      <askee>Taoiseach</askee>
      <Quest>the requests, if any, that have been made to the Central Statistics Office to start assembling statistics on income levels in the different sub-regions of the State in preparation for the Structural Funding negotiations post 1999.</Quest>
      <QRef>[9284/95]</QRef>

    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. J. Higgins) Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. J. Higgins)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. J. Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Central Statistics Office is conscious of the desirability of regional accounts and has initiated investigations into their compilation by commissioning the ESRI to undertake a study into the methodology required to produce these accounts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>How does the Government propose to move forward?  Up until now Ireland has been considered as one region in Structural Funding negotiations.  I do not want to go into detail but how does the Government propose to prepare the analysis which would allow us, if necessary, to make our case for Structural Funding in 1998 and 1999 based on regional statistics?  A great deal of work needs to be done first.  It was acknowledged at the completion of the last round of Structural Funding negotiations that in building our case we would have to compile information over a number of years.  We should start with the current year.  Is the Government planning to do this and, if not, will the Minister of State give a commitment that it will do so?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been universally acknowledged that there are gross disparities between the regions.  The ESRI <Col N="1360" /> has been commissioned to undertake a study into the methodology required to produce these accounts.  It is expected that its report will be available early next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>While I welcome the fact the ESRI is carrying out a study, in 1998, or 1999 at the latest, we will have to present five year figures.  That only gives us four years in which to compile data.  If we wait until next year it will be too late.  We should be able to present regional data covering a five year period. Based on the European GDP average this country will not be considered as one region.  Therefore we need to start compiling information from 1995 onwards while we still have time to do so.</P>

      <P>This question relates to the Central Statistics Office. Normally matters of policy should not arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The point made by the Deputy is under active consideration.  It is fully appreciated at Government level, in terms of devising a timetable and calculating averages.  The CSO is only responsible for the proper collection of statistics in accordance with internationally accepted standards.  I am not responsible for their interpretation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State said that the ESRI is conducting a study into the methodology required.  Does he agree that the regional authorities established in recent years should be consulted in this regard, particularly in the assimilation of pertinent information in making the case for the regions?  Will he undertake to consult with them on this matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>It is desirable for the ESRI to have full access to all agencies, including the local authorities, in establishing as accurately as possible, income levels in the regions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor) Mervyn Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2, 4, 16, 17, 27 and 59 together.</P>
      <P>The position remains that when the Government has made its formal decision on the proposed constitutional amendment on divorce the details, as they must, will be announced by way of a Bill.  That is the basis on which the Government's decision must be announced because, as Members of the House will be aware, it is the proposal in that Bill that will form the basis of the debate in both Houses and, on the Bill being passed by both Houses, the proposal it contains will be the basis on which the people will be asked to vote &ldquo;yes&rdquo; in the referendum on the matter.</P>
      <P>The timing of the Government's announcement regarding the details of the Bill will depend on the timing of the referendum.  At this stage the target date of 30 November next would require that the Bill be published at the latest in October next and, as indicated by me on several occasions in reply to questions, one of the matters affecting a decision on the timing of the referendum will be the outcome of the case that is currently before the Supreme Court regarding a challenge to the constitutionality of provisions in the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act, 1989.  In finalising proposals for divorce the House will appreciate that the Government would wish to be in a position to have the benefit of the Supreme Court's deliberations on the law in relation to judicial separations so that account can be taken of those deliberations in putting a shape on divorce law proposals.  I can assure the House that in devising its proposals the Government will also have in mind the need to have comprehensive measures dealing with the financial and other consequences of divorce for dependent spouses and children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1363" /> In the meantime, I am continuing the process of consultations with interest groups and persons and I am examining all submissions made to me.  Among the consultations publicly announced in recent weeks were meetings with the Fianna Fáil Party and the Progressive Democrats.  Among other meetings I had in the same period were meetings with the ICA, the Council for the Status of Women, Women's Aid, AIM, the Divorce Action Group and FLAC.  That process of consultations will continue with the aim of reaching the maximum consensus possible on the approach which should be taken on divorce in the referendum.</P>
    <P>Consultations between the political parties have been, and will continue to be, part of that process and it is fair to say that recent debate has helped all sides to crystallise their views further on the matter.  The Government is committed to the holding of further meetings with the Opposition so that its views can be taken into consideration as far as possible by the Government in making its decision on what should be provided for in the constitutional amendment Bill proposal.</P>
    <P>The Government's information programme on divorce, for which £500,000 has been allocated to my Department, will be on similar lines to recent referendum programmes.  The information will be of a factual nature.  No public relations or advertising firms have been engaged to date in connection with the programme.  However, the Market Research Bureau of Ireland was commissioned recently to carry out a poll on the views of people regarding the options for dealing with divorce in the Constitution.  The cost of the survey is approximately £15,000.  An information leaflet has recently been issued by my Department outlining the legislative and administrative measures in place to deal with protection and support of families. The leaflet puts in context some of the issues relating to divorce.  The cost incurred by current printing of the leaflet was £868.  The cost of the survey and <Col N="1364" /> the leaflet will be met from the sum of £500,000.</P>
    <P>The vast majority of cases dealt with by Legal Aid Board solicitors are family law cases and many of those cases concern judicial separations.  The issues involved in separations such as maintenance, what should happen to property, including the family home, rights of succession and the care of children would also arise in the context of divorce, and solicitor staff of the board will be in a position to deal with those issues as they arise in cases of divorce.  I am informed by the board that, as in the case of the introduction of any new major legislation, the board would, in the event of divorce laws being enacted, be reviewing the position so as to ensure that its staff are fully informed to deal with new issues raised by the matter.</P>
    <P>I have on several occasions given details to the House about the programme of family law reform to which the Government is committed in the run-up to the referendum.  The main legislative and administrative measures which I am concerned to have dealt with by the time of the divorce referendum are the Family Law Bill, 1994, the Civil Legal Aid Bill, 1995, the Domestic Violence Bill, which will be published shortly, and implementation of further phases of development for the Legal Aid Board, the Family Mediation Service and counselling services on the basis of the substantial funding provided by the Exchequer to those areas.  I can report continued progress on those matters in recent months.  In large measure they address the many submissions which I have received on various aspects of marital breakdown.</P>
    <P>I have promised that a draft of the Divorce Bill which would be introduced in the event of a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote in the referendum will be published at the same time as the amendment of the Constitution Bill.  That Divorce Bill will set out for the information of voters the exact details of the powers the court will have to protect and support spouses and children following the granting of a divorce <Col N="1365" /> decree and it will contain provisions corresponding to those in the Family Law Bill, 1994.</P>
    <P>Other matters which are primarily the responsibility of the Minister for Finance in relation to the tax aspects of divorce, of the Minister for Justice in relation to the courts and of the Minister for Social Welfare in relation to the social welfare aspects are also the subject of proposals for reform in anticipation of divorce.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister give the findings of the Government's private research conducted in March for which the MRBI was paid £15,000?  Did the majority of people support the inclusion of conditions in the Constitution?  The Minister stated that clear conditions and grounds should be set out in the Constitution. Will he say what the present position is on the findings of the research and what is his intention at this stage?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The findings of the research were published in some newspapers and are common knowledge. That opinion poll has been superseded by a later one.  That poll showed that 50 per cent of those surveyed believe that the conditions should be included in the Constitution.  The final decisions on this matter have not yet been made by the Government; they are still under consideration by the Cabinet sub-committee on divorce.  Details of the amendment will be published in due course at the appropriate time in the form of a Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that by basing his divorce strategy on opinion polls he will be in a very difficult position because he will have no specific advice from that source of information? Will he make the findings of the poll available to Opposition Members so that we can ascertain his strategy and the kind of questioning he favoured?  Is there a breakdown in terms of the view of the various parties' <Col N="1366" /> supporters about including the terms of divorce in the Constitution?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government will make its decision on all these matters at the appropriate time and will take into consideration all relevant factors.  Any one opinion poll taken at a particular time is no more than a snapshot of the views of those polled at that time.  A number of opinion polls have been taken subsequently and they are only one factor politicians and the Government study with interest.  The Government will reach its conclusions taking all factors into account, including consultations with political parties in the House and various interest groups. When that decision is reached it will be published in the form of a Bill and Members will have ample opportunity to discuss it during its passage through the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister expresses doubts as to whether he will meet the target date of 30 November for the holding of a divorce referendum.  He was cited in one of the Independent newspapers on 19 May as saying that the Government might not meet the divorce poll target date.  Will the Minister indicate the position regarding that?  Does he expect to meet that target date?  He has said that he expects to publish a Bill by October at the latest. Will he give a breakdown of timing from the publication of that Bill until 30 November bearing in mind 30 days must elapse between the passing of the Bill and the matter being put before the people in a referendum?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I can only repeat what I have said all along regarding the date of the proposed referendum.  The date I gave of 30 November is a target date.  I am hopeful of meeting it but, as I have indicated on many occasions, there are a number of imponderables, one of which is the awaited Supreme Court decision on the constitutionality of the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act, 1989.  The hearing of that <Col N="1367" /> appeal by the Supreme Court is completed and judgment on it has been reserved.  Neither I nor anybody cannot say when that judgment will be delivered. It could be delivered before or after the summer recess.  That is one of the imponderables.  The 30 November date remains a target and the Government will keep the position under review depending on how the situation evolves regarding our necessary legislative programme and the outcome of the Supreme Court decision on the &ldquo;F&rdquo; case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister omitted to answer my question on the findings of the poll his Department commissioned. Will he make those findings directly available to Opposition Members?  He has returned to the question of all party consensus, something our party favours and has maintained continually to the Minister.  It would be appropriate for him to make as much information as possible available to us.  On the question of his strategy, he declared he wishes to have the provisions relating to divorce written into the Constitution.  Is he still of that opinion or have the findings of other opinion polls dented his view in that regard?</P>

      <P>My beliefs on that question remain unchanged, but it is a matter for Government decision.  The Cabinet sub-committee is discussing it and the Government will discuss it and reach its decision in due course.  That position is shared by some political parties in the House and was held by the Progressive Democrat Party in 1986. The then Leader of that party, Deputy O'Malley, indicated that was his position and that of his party on that occasion, but perhaps members of that party have changed their minds on the issue since then.  Regarding the MRBI opinion poll commissioned by the Department, all relevant details of it have been published in the newspapers and the information is pretty accurate. <Col N="1368" /> The views of any party on it are not terribly relevant.  No doubt the Progressive Democrat Party is aware of its members' views and does not need the benefit of an opinion poll commissioned by my Department to ascertain the level of support among its members on that issue.</P>

      <P>I agree with Deputy Keogh that we must move forward on the divorce issue and that time is running out for people who have been waiting for divorce, many of them since 1986.  It is precisely for those reasons that the Government is bringing forward a referendum on the issue of divorce to enable those questions to be addressed, something that apart from the previous Government no earlier Government since 1986 bothered about, mentioned or brought forward.  The Government is bringing forward proposals for a referendum and hopes it will be held in 1995, in recognition of the very factors pointed out by Deputy Keogh.  It is regrettable that other Governments and parties did not do <Col N="1370" /> that when they had an opportunity to do so.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Equality and Law Reform</askee>
      <Quest>in relation to his Department's report in 1993 on a survey of equal opportunities in the public sector, the extent to which women were under-represented in senior management and professional posts; the measures, if any, he has taken to enable women to break through the glass ceiling; and if he has identified the barriers which prevent them from doing so at present.</Quest>
      <QRef>[9732/95]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>As indicated in December 1993, when I published the report on a survey of equal opportunities in the public sector, women are virtually absent from senior management in the public service and very few public sector bodies have specific equality objectives and timescales for progress towards equality.  The published report refers to data collected on the position in 1990 and the picture painted was one of a totally unacceptable level of inequality in our public service.</P>
      <P>The report was broken into three main parts, dealing with State-sponsored bodies, local authorities and health boards.  In the State-sponsored bodies only 2 per cent of senior management were female while only 6 per cent of management-professionals were female.  In local authorities 1 per cent of women were at senior management level and 6 per cent of women were in the professional-management category. Among administrative staff in health boards there were no women in senior management posts although their representation in professional posts was 21 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following on the release of this report my Department wrote to all public sector employers exhorting them to introduce equal opportunities policies and programmes without delay.  This was <Col N="1371" /> further followed up when the Government undertook in the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> that all public sector employers which had not introduced equal opportunities programmes would be requested to do so before the end of 1994.  I understand that progress is being made in this regard across the public sector.  The evidence for this is reflected in the requests for assistance being made by public sector employers on the Employment Equality Agency and other public service support agencies.</P>
    <P>Under the aegis of my Department, the Employment Equality Agency adopts a proactive role in the encouragement of both employers and trade unions to adopt equality policies by the provision of guidance, advice and published material.  It continues to support and assist equal opportunities networks in the State-sponsored bodies sector.  In recent months the Employment Equality Agency, in conjunction with the Irish Vocational Education Association and the Association of Chief Executive Officers of Vocational Education Committees, has developed a special, &ldquo;Model Equal Opportunities Policy for Vocational Education Committees,&rdquo; and is further involved in follow-up advisory sessions.</P>
    <P>The removal of barriers to more women progressing to management positions in local authorities is one of the aims of a recent initiative of the agency.  This involves a major equal opportunities project with a local authority and a large retail chain, entitled, &ldquo;Quality through Equality&rdquo;, and is currently under way with funding assistance from the EU.  The criteria for selecting participants for the project included the requirement to develop practical measures of gender equality which could be applied to Irish employments, with a view to developing models of best practice for equal opportunities in both the public and private sectors.  It is worth pointing out here that absence of women in senior management and <Col N="1372" /> professional positions is equally a feature of private sector employments.</P>
    <P>The Employment Equality Agency also assists with the entry of more women into management positions and decision-making areas through support for legislative redress.  Individuals who feel they failed to secure a management position because of discrimination on grounds of sex or marital status can seek the agency's advice and assistance in making a complaint to the employer.  If it proves necessary to take a formal case under the Employment Equality Act, 1977, the agency can provide representation before both the equality officer and Labour Court.  In successful cases, the equality officer and Labour Court can instruct that the woman be appointed to the disputed position.</P>
    <P>It is important to note that the Employment Equality Act, 1977 prohibits discrimination in employment on grounds of sex or marital status and provides for equal treatment of men and women at work.  Where there is underrepresentation of one sex, however, the Act allows for special training to be provided to enable the under-represented group compete on an equal footing for promotional positions.  Some equality training initiatives are being used in the Civil Service, for example, where there has been a modest increase in women at senior management levels.  I will be seeking to strengthen the provisions of employment equality legislation on positive action in the forthcoming legislation which is in preparation and which I propose to publish later in the year.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the existence of legislation and the ongoing efforts of the agency I am increasingly inclined to the view that the most effective approach to tackling the problem of under-representation of women at higher levels in work organisations is one which arises within the organisation itself where management recognises the potential value of having more women in senior positions and where women actively pursue such opportunities.  In this regard I welcome <Col N="1373" /> the initiative of the Midland and Mid-Western Health Boards in commissioning research to ascertain the views and advice of women on their perceptions of the barriers to promotion in their employments and how these can be removed.  The conclusions of this survey reflect similarly unacceptable patterns of inequality as were found in the 1993 report.</P>
    <P>At the same time both these health boards are to be commended for their willingness to tackle this issue in such an open manner.  Undoubtedly their initiative will also prove relevant for other health boards and indeed other public sector employers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that in 1995 it is appalling that women are represented to the extent of only 1 per cent and 2 per cent and, in some cases, not represented at all, at senior management level?  In reply to a question I tabled recently the Minister stated that in the Civil Service the number of women at principal officer level was 12.1 per cent, 5.5 per cent at Assistant Secretary level and none at Secretary level.  Does this not indicate there is something radically wrong with present procedures?  Will the Minister examine Civil Service and local government promotional interview board systems to ensure that women get through what appears to be a glass ceiling?  While everything appears to be equitable and in order, in general women are still not appointed to higher level posts even though it is 20 years since the marriage ban was lifted.  If women are not appointed to principal officer level in the Civil Service, where they are represented to the extent of only 12 per cent at present, they will not have an opportunity of being appointed to higher posts.  As the greatest number of management posts arise at principal officer level, will the Minister examine the position?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree the level of advance in this regard leaves much to be desired.  This complex problem has <Col N="1374" /> been endemic in our society for many years, but we are beginning to make progress.  It is important that public and private sector employers recognise the benefits to be gained in their organisations by implementing gender equality programmes.  I commend semi-State bodies such as Aer Rianta, Aer Lingus, the ESB, An Post and SFADCo which have devised equal opportunities programmes. We are endeavouring to exhort other companies to follow their lead, but that must be coupled with the improvements proposed in the anti-discrimination legislation to outlaw discrimination on gender grounds in the promotion of women at all levels in the public and private sectors.  The matter must be tackled at a number of levels.</P>
      <P>Women must be appointed to positions of influence right across the spectrum of State, interview and appointment boards.  The Government is adopting the policy of a minimum of 40 per cent women and men on all new State boards so that the influential position of women can work its way through interview and appointment boards.  Progress will be made when State boards, equal opportunities policies and new legislation coalesce and I look forward to that happening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister stated that training is offered as a support for women who fail to attain higher level grades.  Fair competition is needed from the point of view of women because it would appear that they have to be outstanding to be successful at interviews. Despite that, they do not seem to have the opportunities to which they are entitled.  This is a serious problem because the people on these boards are already at a higher level in their careers. Since women are grossly under-represented at the higher level, there is perhaps an unintentional bias against them. I ask the Minister to seriously consider the operation of the Civil Service boards, about which we hear so much in regard to equity, as they apply in local government.  Also, will the Minister commission a study of the factors <Col N="1375" /> involved here which are very real for the women affected who experience great frustration as a result?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure Deputy Woods that all aspects of the matter are constantly kept under review by my Department and the Department of Finance, which also has a role in this matter. A key factor is an appropriate representation of women on interview boards making these promotions.  That is a very important aspect.  We are aware of a number of the contributory factors.  The availability of child care, for example, is very important in allowing women an equal opportunity to participate for prolonged periods at work, notwithstanding family responsibilities. That is the reason my Department is giving such a high priority to the question of child care provision.  I believe there is a question on the Order Paper about that.  In cases of unfair competition, as suggested by Deputy Woods, under existing legislation, if discrimination takes place a remedy exists and the Employment Equality Agency, which operates under the ambit of my Department, is ready, willing and able to assist any woman who feels that she has not been treated fairly in any competition for a new position.  The new Bill, which is in course of preparation, will strengthen those provisions further.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 5, 10, 12, 18, 22 and 24 together.</P>
      <P>Under the policy agreement, <i>A Government of Renewal</i>, the Government is committed to taking specific action to end discrimination and to ensure equal opportunity for participation by all people in Irish life.  The intention is to put in place mechanisms for full and equal participation by every citizen with a disability in every aspect of economic and social life in line with the forthcoming recommendations of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities, which I appointed in 1993.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, and without prejudice to the commission's work, I have been pressing ahead with several initiatives to prohibit discrimination against people with disabilities and to enhance their employment status.  I will be introducing in the Oireachtas two new equality Bills, the Employment Equality Bill and the Equal Status Bill.</P>
      <P>The Employment Equality Bill will repeal the Acts of 1974 and 1977 and re-enact them with substantial improvements, with a view to securing radical improvements in the legislative framework for equality.  The Bill, among other things, will cover discrimination on grounds of disability.</P>
      <P>The Government is also committed to tackling the question of discrimination in non-employment areas.  The proposed Equal Status Bill will afford protection with regard to discrimination in education, access to goods, services and facilities, including recreational facilities, entertainment, accommodation, transport and professional services, and to the disposal of accomodation or other premises.  Protection under this legislation will apply to various categories, including people with disabilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards exploring ways of increasing job opportunities, I had a meeting recently with the Irish Business and Employers' Confederation with a view to developing mechanisms to enhance the prospects and opportunities for <Col N="1378" /> advancement of people with disabilities in the employment area.  I regard this meeting as one of the ongoing series of consultations with employers' representatives geared towards increasing the number of people with disabilities employed in the private sector.</P>
    <P>The Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities is due to present its report to the Government at the end of this year.  In its deliberations, the commission has been engaged in the most extensive consultation exercise since the foundation of the State with people with disabilities, their parents and carers and other interested parties. The conclusions of the working group which the commission set up to look at the issue of work and training, in so far as these issues relate to people with disabilities, will form a very important part of the commission's final report.</P>
    <P>The 3 per cent quota for the employment of people with disabilities has been met in the Civil Service and I am continuing my efforts in seeking to improve the position in the wider public sector.  I fully support the efforts of the National Rehabilitation Board in its efforts to improve the employment prospects of people with disabilities and believe that the Monitoring Committee for the Employment of People with Disabilities, which operates under the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i>, has an important part to play in progressing this issue.</P>
    <P>I understand the commission is also examining the question of the pay levels applying to people with disabilities in sheltered employment.  It would be prudent to have the expert advice of the commission before embarking on new initiatives in this area.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the difficulties being experienced by people with a disability in relation to financial services and insurance cover.  These important issues are also being considered at present by the commission and I look forward to receiving its recommendations for improving the situation.  However, the commission's deliberations do not prevent any person who feels that he or <Col N="1379" /> she has been unfairly treated from lodging a complaint with the appropriate complaints authorities within those industries and seeking to have it fully investigated.  The proposed Equal Status Bill will prohibit discrimination on grounds of disability in the financial services sector.</P>
    <P>The <i>ad hoc</i> steering group, which I set up on 6 April 1995, on the recommendation of the commission, to facilitate the establishment of a Council for the Status of People with Disabilities, has already met on a number of occasions. The establishment of the council will provide a permanent forum for having issues affecting the welfare and interests of people with disabilities examined and highlighted and will constitute an important step in ensuring that these issues are addressed.</P>
    <P>My role in relation to people with disabilities, in addition to those outlined above, is essentially a co-ordinating one. In this connection, my Department is represented on a number of interdepartmental committees dealing with problems which impact on the lives of people with disabilities.  I should point out, however, that the Minister of State at the Departments of Health, Education and Justice has special responsibility for aspects of child care and policies affecting children.</P>
    <P>The Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities has established a working group to examine the situation of people with disabilities in relation to arts and culture.  I understand that, last November, the commission co-sponsored, with the National Rehabilitation Board and the City Arts Centre, a conference on arts and disability in the Royal Hospital in Kilmainham and that it has taken other initiatives to ascertain the views of people with disabilities and interested groups in relation to arts and culture.  I believe that the initiatives undertaken by the commission adequately address the point raised by Deputy McDowell in his question.</P>

      <P>Nobody doubts the Minister's good intentions in this area and the fact that, over the coming years, we will be continuing with further legislation and developments.  However, we are faced with a crisis in regard to people with disabilities.  A recent survey of wheelchair users indicated that 87 per cent of them were unemployed.  A programme of immediate action is needed.</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned the 3 per cent quota for the employment of people with disabilities has been met in the Civil Service as a whole and that is commendable.  When grant aid in excess of £5 million is being paid to companies to set up in Ireland I suggest the Government as a minimum attaches a 3 per cent disability quota.  Surely it should be feasible for companies in receipt of that level of funding from the State to comply with that minimal requirement?  Would he consider also having disability proofing from the outset in any new public sector schemes?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Enterprise and Employment assesses grant applications and deals with them in consultation with the Minister for Finance.  I will refer Deputy Woods's comments on that to the appropriate Ministers.  I accept the level of unemployment among people with disabilities is unacceptably high.  The Government recognises that fact and is attempting to address it in a number of ways, not least by having people with disabilities as a specified category in the new Employment Equality Bill, something which never happened before as only the gender category has been addressed in legislation in this area until now.  That will be a major step forward.  Many people with disabilities feel they are capable of doing a particular job as adequately as an able bodied person and that they are discriminated against in employment or promotion merely on account of their disability.  The new legislation will be a major innovation in that regard and will impact substantially on the employment prospects of people with disabilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1381" /> The Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities is addressing the broad ranging issue of the employment of people with disabilities and is due to report towards the end of this year.  The commission has had extensive consultation with people with disabilities throughout the country and of course more than half the members of the commission are people with disabilities who are well aware of the problems. I look forward to its further suggestions and recommendations on employment which will be considered by the Government.</P>

Probably the only time I would advocate State subsidies for private enterprise is for employment of the disabled.  I suggest the Minister should suggest to the commission that the State would subsidise the income of people with disabilities whilst in employment.  Does the Minister agree that depending on a person's disability it is more costly for them than the able bodied individual to remain in employment, for example, because of equipment or transport needs?  Would the Minister consider the radical proposal of grant aiding employers to allow people with disabilities continue in employment?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities is examining all aspects of the employment of people with a disability and the alternatives open to it to advance the interests of people with disabilities in the employment context. Numerous suggestions have been made, including the suggestion put forward by Deputy Lynch.  I know the National Rehabilitation Board &mdash; which does remarkable and excellent work in the employment context &mdash; is also actively involved in the employment of people with disabilities.  All the strands are being drawn together in the work of the <Col N="1382" /> commission.  It is the first time something of that nature has been set up and the combined wisdom of the Departments of Enterprise and Employment, Health and Equality and Law Reform and not least, of the people with disabilities will be drawn together in that report.</P>
      <P>I expect it will be a formidable document, comparable to the report of the Second Commission on the Status of Women.  It will be a major guideline not only for this Government but for future Governments to implement over a period of time.  I expect that many of its suggestions will be radical.  The report is due relatively soon and I am sure we will discuss it at the appropriate time.</P>

      <P>The Minister will be happy to know that I was in Cheeverstown House with his colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Health.  They run sheltered employment schemes for handicapped people in Cheeverstown.  However, the parents of handicapped adults feel that their offspring are being exploited because of low levels of pay.  I appreciate this is a delicate area.  Does the Minister agree that with the ever increasing growth of sheltered employment an organisation should be put in place to institute a trade union type structure to represent the interests of people in sheltered employment, given that they fall outside the mainstream of trade union membership? How does he envisage the rights of these workers being adequately represented?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The issue raised by Deputy Byrne is important but it is also complex.  I would prefer to wait until the expert examination of that subject being conducted by the commission is completed. Factors such as the needs of those who work in sheltered workshops, their level of employment and what they produce, the concerns and wishes of their parents and the needs of the organisations that employ them must be carefully balanced.  They perform a valuable function and we are anxious to <Col N="1383" /> encourage their activities.  I know that is very much to the forefront in the commission's considerations and I assume it will make practical suggestions on that subject.  I do not know if it will encompass trade union representation and I do not wish to prejudge that. When it reports, I will examine its recommendations carefully and the Government will consider how best to implement appropriate suggestions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenneally</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities was appointed in 1993 and that he expects to have its report by the end of the year.  Will the Minister ensure that is so?  Has he made adequate resources available to the commission?  What priority has been accorded to it?  If we receive the report at the end of the year, two and a half years will have elapsed since the commission was set up.  Does the Minister expect to be Minister in that Department when the report is available?</P>

      <P>It was estimated that the commission would require two years to enable it to prepare a report.  That is the time which was allowed to the Commission on the Status of Women to prepare its report.  It is adequately resourced to enable it perform its function and I have not received any complaints to the contrary.  It carried out extensive research, one of the most interesting of which was the listening exercise, inviting people with a disability, their parents, carers and interested groups to express their views. The response was remarkable.  Hundreds of people were present at these listening exercises.  Many commented that this was the first time anyone from Government expressed an interest in listening to their needs and experiences <Col N="1384" /> and it was much appreciated.  The commission is doing an excellent job.  The two year period will expire at the end of the year and I understand the preparation of the report is on target.</P>
      <P>The Council for the Status of People with Disabilities will have an important role to play when it is set up.  When the commission reports it will cease to exist but the council will be ongoing and will provide a forum for consultation with Government, interested groups and so on so that the needs of people with a disability can be dealt with on a permanent basis and they will have countrywide representation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that the commission is doing an excellent job and I am sure it will produce a comprehensive report.  Does the Minister agree that there should be specific anti-discrimination legislation on disability rather than encompass it in two Bills?  If the commission makes that recommendation will the Minister look at it favourably? What will be the status of the report?  Will the Government state which recommendations it intends to implement?  The recommendations made in the second report of the Commission on the Status of Women are to be taken as guidelines.  Will the Minister examine the recommendations and state the timeframe within which they will be implemented?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I envisage that the report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities will be similar to the second report of the Commission on the Status of Women.  There probably will be an appreciable number of recommendations.  It is impossible to predict which ones the Government will decide to implement in whole or in part as appropriate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I was appointed Minister for Equality and Law Reform in the previous Government, I was faced with the dilemma of whether to bring forward legislation which would cover the disadvantaged groups or await the outcome of the report of the Commission on the <Col N="1385" /> Status of People with Disabilities.  Having considered all aspects, I decided not to wait for two years until the commission reported but to prepare the legislation. I endeavoured to deal in one Bill with the different categories of people we wish to protect.  The preparation of legislation is complex and time consuming. I am anxious to cover not only the position of women but people with disability, discrimination on grounds of colour, creed and age, members of the travelling community and so on.  The legislation is at an advanced stage of preparation and I hope to publish the first Bill, the Employment Equality Bill, this year.  It will be a major step forward.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>We should congratulate and record our appreciation of the various agencies involved in the provision of employment through sheltered schemes.  I am amazed at some of the projects.  Given the fears of the parents of children who are in sheltered employment and that there are so many organisations involved, for example, Cheeverstown House, Eve Holdings, Menni Enterprises and the Rehabilitation Institute will the Minister assure us that these jobs will be secure in the future as EU funding will expire in 1996?</P>

Will he consider organising a seminar to get across to top management in the public service the importance of disability and gender proofing and of providing access and opportunities for career advancement for people with disabilities &mdash; and women? Such a seminar would prove worthwhile <Col N="1386" /> and unless the initiative comes from the top one will not get the necessary support along the line.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6, 9 and 15 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The monitoring committee on the implementation of the recommendations of the Second Commission on the Status of Women met on one occasion prior to the publication of the first progress report in June 1994.  Work on the publication of the second progress <Col N="1387" /> report is ongoing.  Deputies will appreciate that given the number &mdash; 210, many of which have several component parts &mdash; and detail of the commission's recommendations a considerable amount of work and co-ordination with other Government Departments and outside bodies is required to produce a comprehensive overview of progress. Suggestions made recently by members of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Women's Rights are being considered in compiling the report.</P>
    <P>A meeting of the full monitoring committee is due to take place shortly.  The interdepartmental committee, which was established in conjunction with the monitoring committee and consists of representatives of those Departments in whose remit the bulk of the recommendations fall, has had four meetings in the interim.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the recommendations by the commission was that barriers to participation by women in employment programmes should be removed.  This is particularly important as women are very anxious to participate in the community employment scheme.  However, because of the way in which it is operated and the selection process, women who do not have an unemployment payment in their own right are unable to get on the scheme. This is a very clear discrimination.  I appreciate the Minister's difficulties in that regard&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I was about to say that similar arrangements might be useful in this case.  To get over the problem of lone parents it was decided that at least 10 per cent of the placements should be allocated to them.  Will the Government allocate 10 per cent of places on community employment schemes to women?  I appreciate that the Minister might have difficulties in opening up the scheme but the Government could make a start by allocating 10 per cent of places to women.</P>

      <P>The recommendations in the report of the Second Commission on the Status of Women cover the gamut of virtually all Departments and any question referrable to the work of a particular Department should be addressed to the relevant Minister.  My Department's role is merely to monitor what recommendations have been implemented, to report on an annual basis, etc.  Approximately 60 of the 210 recommendations were implemented when the last report was produced in June 1994 and I hope the second report will be published this summer.</P>

      <P>The Minister very kindly <Col N="1389" /> met the Members of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Women's Rights and discussed with them the report and the recommendations made by the commission. Does he intend to follow through on the suggestion made at the meeting that the monitoring committee should report progress so that there is continuous monitoring of the implementation of the recommendations and an indication which recommendations are favoured by the Government and which are regarded as not being feasible? This would give us an idea of the guidelines the Government will follow. Does he agree that the monitoring comittee should meet more than once a year?  An ongoing system of reporting progress might alleviate the necessity for the full committee to meet on a regular basis.  We should have some way of monitoring what exactly is happening in this area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The interdepartmental committee meets on a more frequent basis.  The terms of reference of the monitoring committee are laid down by the Government.  It is not true to say that all the recommendations in the report were adopted by the previous Government to whom the report was presented.  Recommendations come up for consideration on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis from time to time, possibly following recommendations from the interdepartmental committee to the monitoring committee or whoever.  It is not a question of earmarking all or any of the recommendations for attention by any Government within any particular timescale. They are guidelines.  I imagine the second commission's report will be a reference work on the subject of gender equality for some time to come.  It is interesting that substantial progress has been made.  Almost 60 of the 210 recommendations were implemented by June 1994 and I expect further progress has been made since then.  We can have a look at it following the publication of the next report with a view to ascertaining what progress is being made on the various issues.</P>

      <P>The monitoring committee was set up in 1993, according to the Minister's reply it met only once in the intervening period and will meet again shortly, &ldquo;shortly&rdquo; could mean any time.  Will the Minister agree it is an appalling record that the monitoring committee has met only once?  Is there a problem in relation to resources and why has the committee not met on a regular basis?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>No, the monitoring committee met, as necessary, to finalise the June 1994 report, during the currency of the previous Government.  The interdepartmental committee &mdash; made up of departmental representatives &mdash; which examines various recommendations in the report and considers those that may be appropriate for implementation within a particular timescale, met on four occasions.  The full monitoring committee will meet again shortly in connection with the finalisation of the 1995 report.  That is quite acceptable and appropriate; that is how it was envisaged to work and is an ongoing process.  Implementation of many of these recommendations will take time; some can be implemented more speedily than others; some depend on the availability of resources and that can vary from Government to Government and from budget to budget but appreciable progress is being made in connection with it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no problem with resources as far as the monitoring committee and the interdepartmental committee are concerned but there may be a budgetary problem with resources in so far as implementing a particular recommendation might be concerned. As the Deputy is aware, that varies from budget to budget depending on the circumstances at a particular time and the resources in the various Departments which have responsibility for dealing <Col N="1391" /> with the subject matter of the recommendations. All Departments of State have a role to play in connection with matters coming within the ambit of their Department referred to in the commission's report which covers virtually the whole spectrum of human activity and, consequently, all Government Departments are affected by it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>In this question we should separate policy from the nuts and bolts of what the monitoring committee is doing.  Nobody is suggesting that the monitoring committee has anything to do with specific areas of policy in relation to the recommendations of the commission.  Will the Minister give us the date for publication of the next report so that we can ascertain exactly what progress has been made?  Nobody will say that the 210 recommendations can be implemented instantly or that a timescale could be suggested.  It would be helpful if the Minister indicates whether he intends to act on the advice of the Joint Committee on Women's Rights in relation to reporting progress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Joint Committee on Women's Rights made certain suggestions regarding the format of the 1995 report.  As I said in my reply, I am considering its suggestions which will also be considered by the monitoring committee when it meets shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>From what the Minister said it appears it is intended that the monitoring committee will meet only once a year.  Will the Minister agree that this is totally inadequate and indicates a lack of urgency in this area?  Even if, as Deputy Keogh said, it is not possible to implement all the recommendations or any recommendations <i>in toto</i>, the monitoring committee may be able to make proposals which would be helpful to the Minister in the interim and to the Government.  I suggest the monitoring committee should meet at least four <Col N="1392" /> times per year and, as the Minister suggested, the interdepartmental committee can do the work in the meantime. Those people who have seen the policies and ideas outlined in the report of the Second Commission on the Status of Women must be disappointed that the monitoring committee meets so infrequently.  I ask the Minister to consider a more active programme for the monitoring committee.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I take Deputy Woods's point.  The interdepartmental committee meets more frequently.  I will consider more frequent meetings than heretofore for the monitoring committee.  The ongoing work of examination is the responsibility of the interdepartmental committee as the Government representatives who assemble the recommendations for Government.  Its role is crucial and I will take into account the comments made by the Deputy.</P>

      <Quest>the action, if any, he intends to take to limit the power of District Court judges to order maintenance payments by spouses to be made from social welfare or supplementary welfare payments; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Where a spouse fails to maintain the other spouse or any dependent children the law provides that the court may, on application to it, make an order for payment of maintenance. The maximum weekly amount that may be ordered by the District Court is £200 per week for the support of a spouse and £60 per week for the support of a child.  There are no limits on the amounts that may be awarded by the Circuit Court.  In determining the amount of any payment the court must have regard to all the circumstances of the case including the income, earning capacity, if any, property or other financial resources of either spouse and any <Col N="1393" /> children.  Income includes social welfare payments, with the exception of certain allowances such as supplementary welfare allowance.  The law in this area is prescribed in the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act, 1976.  I have initiated some important changes to that Act in the Family Law Bill, 1994, at present before the Seanad having been passed by this House.  However, I have no evidence to suggest that the law needs to be amended in the way that appears to be suggested by the question.  The criteria set out in the Act for the making of maintenance orders by the court are based on what is fair to all parties and the court is already precluded from taking into account certain social welfare payments such as supplementary welfare allowance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanKenneally" hpid="Mr. Kenneally Mr. Kenneally">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenneally</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased this question appeared on the Order Paper because there was an attempt to transfer it to the Minister for Social Welfare, who does not have responsibility for it. In regard to the other question I tabled to the Minister, I received notification at lunch time that it was being transferred to another Minister.  The Minister referred to the 1976 Act under which the judge, in such a case, must take cognisance of income, earning capacity, financial resources and property when making a decision.  As in the case of many matters that arise in this Chamber the question was inspired by an event. The Minister has said there is no evidence to lead him, under the Family Law Bill, to delimit the powers of a justice. I suggest there is a grey area in relation to earning capacity.  How can one justify a situation where a person on long term unemployment assistance of £61 per week must pay maintenance of £20 per week to an estranged wife? When the person went back to the court the amount was reduced to £15, part of which is being paid by the health board. That suggests the health board is paying a large amount of maintenance rather than the person involved.  Surely there is something wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1394" />
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the existing law only the supplementary welfare allowances are excluded from the court's consideration in assessing the amount of maintenance.  Social welfare payments are taken into account.  However, every case is different and the court is supposed to take into account the overall financial position of each of the spouses before making a maintenance order.  Where a person is in receipt of some form of social welfare benefit but has substantial other means, social welfare payments would be taken into account.  It is at the discretion of the court to make a maintenance order having taken into account all the circumstances. I cannot comment on the cases referred to by the Deputy without knowing the full circumstances, but the law as it stands is appropriate and leaves discretion with the court to take the income into account.  There are many cases where a person's sole income is from social welfare and in such cases the court would probably be disinclined to make an order for maintenance but may do so if it is appropriate.</P>

      <P>We are supposed to provide a level of social welfare payment that is adequate to meet the needs of the recipient.  In the case I referred to, the woman is on the full amount of lone parent's allowance.  Does the Minister not agree that, given that supplementary welfare allowance is excluded, means-tested social welfare payments should also be excluded?  That would eliminate anomalies that might arise because a person has other means.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I will consider the suggestion, although I do not immediately see that it is necessary because the court examines each individual case on its merits.  That is the reason the discretion is left with the court.  The judges who hear such cases are experienced and know the needs of each spouse, having examined the income of each.  I imagine it would be exceptional for a court to make a maintenance order where the <Col N="1395" /> sole income consisted of a means-tested social welfare payment, but it would depend on individual circumstances. That level of discretion must be left with the court.  Providing for hard and fast exclusion might be unjust in some cases.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot give any timescale on this matter other than to say that legislation will not be introduced this year.  I agree with the Deputy that it is regrettable that the Matrimonial Home Bill was found to be unconstitutional. The intention of that Bill was specific, it had the unanimous support of this House and would have automatically vested matrimonial homes in the joint names of both spouses.  The present position is that that cannot be done. However, if a matrimonial home is in the name of one spouse and that spouse is minded to transfer it into the joint names of both spouses that can be done by deed.  My intention in examining new legislation was to try to devise a conveyancing method which would facilitate <Col N="1396" /> that.  It is for that reason that I opened discussions with the Incorporated Law Society.  The interests of building societies, local authorities, banks, etc. which have mortgages on such property would have to be taken into account in any arrangements.  The situation is being examined but I cannot say that legislation will be forthcoming in the short term.</P>

      <Quest>the average percentage of women serving on boards of State companies in each of the years 1990 to 1994; the proposals, if any, he has to increase the number of women serving; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The information, in the form sought by the Deputy, is not readily available and it would take a disproportionate amount of time to compile.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In August 1988 women comprised 12.6 per cent of the membership of State boards and, in February 1992, 15.2 per cent.  In March 1993 the Government set the objective of achieving 40 per cent gender balance for direct Government-ministerial appointments to State boards over a four year time horizon. Nominating bodies were asked to aim <Col N="1397" /> for this objective also.  In mid-1993 18.5 per cent of total board members were women and this figure increased to 20.9 per cent in mid-1994.  In February 1995 women represented 23.6 per cent of the total serving membership &mdash; 28.9 per cent of ministerial nominees were women.</P>
    <P>I will continue to monitor the progress being made in this area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch" hpid="Kathleen Lynch Kathleen Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Kathleen Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not a great fan of the quota system.  I tabled this question in order to find out what progress has been made in the light of the Government's good intentions and the commitment to having 40 per cent representation by women on State boards. I understand the reasons for a gradual increase in the number of appointments of women rather than appointing 40 per cent at any one time, but I find it difficult to understand the lack of progress in an area over which the Government has complete control in regard to appointments.  How many State boards have been appointed since 1993?  What is the level of female participation on those boards?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The only board of which I have knowledge is the one I appointed within recent weeks, that is the Civil Legal Aid board.  The Deputy will recall that the previous board was 100 per cent male, and the term of office of that board came to an end a few weeks ago. The new board, appointed by me, is made up of 50 per cent men and 50 per cent women, and the chairperson is a woman.  I would remind the Deputy that ministerial nominees to State boards account for something less than 50 per cent of the total board membership.  If we are to make substantial progress in this &mdash; and we are making very substantial progress so far as the actual ministerial and Government appointees are concerned &mdash; at least equal progress has to be made in the appointments made by the nominating bodies which, as I said, comprise something over 50 per cent of the appointments to these <Col N="1398" /> boards.  In many cases that level of compliance in following the lead set by the Government has not been achieved and ongoing effort by my Department and other Ministers is required in that direction. The utmost pressure is being bought to bear and appointing bodies are being told when making their nominations, particularly where more than one appointment is concerned, that they should comply with the standards set by the Government themselves in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch" hpid="Kathleen Lynch Kathleen Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Kathleen Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's reply gives me some kind of hope in this area. Where the Government has the power to appoint an entire board I am glad to see that it is 50:50.  I would not like to see dominance of any kind.  I ask the Minister to ensure that nominating bodies who do not comply with the guidelines set down by the Government in this case, should incur some kind of penalty or be made to experience the Government's displeasure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I note the Deputy's suggestion that perhaps there should be a penalty for nominating bodies that do not comply.  That is something that would have to be looked at very carefully. At the moment I am concentrating on applying pressure and making requests to the nominating bodies.  They are responsible organisations, bodies like IBEC and ICTU and various other organisations of that calibre who have nominating rights to many of those State boards.  If the appropriate pressures are brought to bear I am hopeful we can make progress on a voluntary basis in that regard.</P>

      <P>The Minister is to be commended in this area.  Would he agree that it was necessary, in the early stages at least, to have a quota system and that that has helped to accelerate the representation of women on these boards?  I would like to commend the Minister on the work he has been doing in this area although, of course, there has been a general support for that <Col N="1399" /> approach from 1988.  I believe the House should commend the Minister on what he has achieved to date and I ask him to keep up the good work in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">

      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>We should commend the Minister on bringing up the ministerial average to 28.9 per cent of appointees. Is the Minister aware of a degree of resistance on the part of certain bodies to appointing women to boards and would he agree that some form of censure should be available?  Will he consider that and has he any ideas on what form that might take?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not like to comment on that.  I do not think we have reached that point yet.  As regards resistance in some quarters to the appointment of women, I would have to say that in some quarters perhaps there is not the degree of compliance that I personally would wish but the Government is continuing its efforts to set its own example in this regard and to apply every possible pressure on all the nominating bodies where it is necessary to convince them that there are women well qualified and available to fulfil any role on any State board if they are minded to seek them out.  That is an ongoing process.  We are achieving modestly improving results so far as the nominating bodies are concerned.  Bit by bit the message is getting through and I am hopeful that we can achieve the necessary results on a voluntary basis.  I do not think we need consider the question of sanctions or penalties at this point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take these three Private Notice Questions together.  I fully share and appreciate the concern of Deputies at the present serious situation facing Irish Press Newspapers and its 600 employees.  The current industrial relations dispute arose from the dismissal of a journalist last week.  My understanding is that the decision to dismiss him was taken by management as a result of an article by him which was published in <i>The Irish Times</i>.  Following the dismissal the National Union of Journalists held a mandatory meeting which was followed by occupation of the Irish Press premises on Burgh Quay by a number of journalists until today.  Publication of the group's three newspapers has ceased and all staff have been laid off.  The union is seeking the reinstatement of the dismissed journalist.  However, management has stated that there is no question of him being reinstated.</P>
      <P>The Labour Relations Commission was in contact with both parties offering to assist in finding a resolution to the dispute but, regrettably, its services were not utilised.  In view of the gravity of the situation and the positions being adopted by the parties, the Labour Court has intervened in the dispute in accordance with the terms of section 26 (5)  of the Industrial Relations Act, 1990. Both parties have agreed to attend the court for exploratory talks tomorrow.  I understand that the workers ended their occupation of the company's premises earlier today.</P>
      <P>I welcome this intervention by the Labour Court but I would not like to make any further comment now which would jeopardise this process apart from urging both parties to co-operate with the Labour Court in its endeavours to find a resolution to the dispute.  In this regard I am sure that all parties appreciate the serious consequences for all those involved.</P>

      <P>I share the Minister's wish that the impasse can be broken and the matter resolved satisfactorily.  The <Col N="1404" /> workers have given proof of their good intentions by withdrawing from the premises.  I hope management will respond in like manner.  In particular I ask them to suspend the correspondence which led to this impasse.  Is it not ironic that the <i>Irish Press</i> which was set up in 1931 to give the voiceless a voice now finds itself threatened by the same forces which led to the need for its establishment?  Will the Minister continue to keep a close watch on proceedings as this matter is not being played on a level playing pitch?  I am glad the Labour Court has intervened.  I hope there will be openness and that both sides will adopt a fresh approach in seeking to resolve the difficulty. There are 600 jobs at stake and many of the men and women concerned do not have the prospect of another job.</P>

      <P>While I acknowledge the work the Minister has done and recognise that this is a sensitive issue does he agree, as the Irish Press group has not published any titles in recent days, that this represents a serious democratic deficit in the print media? For example, in the capital city people have a choice of only one evening newspaper while people in Cork have a choice of at least two.  Does the Minister further agree that the approach adopted by management in seeking a resolution to the crisis at the Irish Press group is worthy of comparison with the approach adopted in boardrooms in distant places, such as Chicago in the United States of America, and that this style of management has contributed to the hardening of positions rather than to a happy and fruitful conclusion?</P>

      <P>Will the Taoiseach consider giving Government time, preferably next week, to debate in the House the successful investment conference that took place last week?  That is the best we should do for our colleagues in the embassy in the United States who put tremendous commitment and effort into the conference.  All of us who were honoured to attend would like to put our comments on the record and to build on the success of the conference.  I congratulate the Tánaiste and all the representatives who attended.  It was a tremendous occasion. The President of the United States, the Vice-President, Al Gore, Warren Christopher, Mr. Browne and all the other people involved made a great effort to help this country, particularly the Border region.</P>

The Tánaiste, who led the Irish Government delegation, informed me that it was an outstanding success, politically and economically.  It would be very useful to pay tribute to the hosts of the conference, the United States Government, particularly President Clinton, who put so much effort, time and money into making it a success.  It is very important that there be active follow up on the contacts and ideas that emanated from the conference.  The risk is that the follow-up might not take place unless one applies oneself to it, and the suggested debate, to which the Tánaiste and I are more than happy to agree, will help in that regard.

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I had three basic purposes in dealing with the implications, for the Attorney General's office, of the delays in the Fr. Brendan Smyth case. My first purpose was to ensure that individual responsibility for the errors was clearly established so that the whole office would not suffer any loss of morale. My second purpose was to hold the person responsible accountable in a fair and measured way, without involving the taxpayer in endless law cases, with the costs in money and lost time that go along with that.  My third purpose was to put this whole matter behind us as quickly and amicably as possible so that we could get on without distractions with the major reorganisation of the office, which is now under way.  I am happy to tell this House that these three basic purposes have now been achieved.</P>
      <P>I stated in this House on Tuesday last that arising, in particular, out of the seven months' delay in dealing with the extradition warrants in the Fr. Smyth case, I had, shortly after the conclusion of evidence in the Dáil select committee, initiated inquiries, including <i>inter alia,</i> seeking formal and independent legal advice, as to what action if any, might appropriately be taken arising from the delay with which the original extradition request was dealt with in the office of the Attorney General during the seven months in question.</P>
      <P>I was in the process, on foot of a study of the legal and Civil Service advice I had received, of finalising my deliberations on the matter, when I learned that subsequent correspondence from the solicitors for the victims had not been replied to.  This new information, which I regarded as serious, required that I make additional inquiries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Arising from the process which I had initiated, and again acting on the independent legal advice I had received, I decided to take three steps: revoke the powers delegated in 1957 to the Attorney General under the Civil Service Regulation Act, 1965, so that I <Col N="1482" /> could take the next appropriate step in my inquiries; tell Mr. Matthew Russell, the senior legal assistant in the Attorney General's office, that I was proposing in the near future to give consideration to the exercise by me of the powers under section 8 of the 1956 Act which provide for the compulsory retirement of civil servants aged over 60; and, in this context, ask Mr. Russell to respond in relation to three issues; the delay in the handling of the Smyth extradition case; the failure to issue a reply to correspondence from the victims solicitor in that case; and the management at Civil Service level of the Attorney General's office.</P>
    <P>I also resolved in the light of Mr. Russell's response that I would then decide if I should give consideration to the exercise of the powers I have in regard to compulsory retirement.</P>
    <P>The position that has now emerged in response to my taking the three steps last week is that Mr. Russell has sent me a letter saying that he is voluntarily retiring from the Civil Service on Thursday, 1 June.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance has agreed that the terms of section 6 (1) (b) of the Superannuation and Pensions Act, 1963, can be applied in his case.</P>

      <P>In such cases a number of years, three in Mr. Russell's case, can be added to his actual service of 21 years in the Attorney General's office, his transferable service of five years from the University of Dublin, Trinity <Col N="1483" /> College, as well as the seven professional added years applicable in his case because of the years in practice required to qualify for the post Mr. Russell held.  A sum of half annual salary can be paid in addition to the normal lump sum.  This has resulted in an increase of £3,000 a year in pension and £46,500 in the once-off lump sum over his accrued retirement entitlement.  In all the circumstances, I believe that this settlement was prudent for reasons I will explain later.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In the letter conveying his retirement &mdash; which I have circulated with this statement &mdash; Mr. Russell makes, in my judgment, three important points in relation to the non reply to the two letters: that he never acted in bad faith; that he now recognises he acted in error and regrets that, and that throughout his career he has endeavoured to discharge his duties and responsibilities with honesty and to the best of his ability.  My considered view is that Mr. Russell does indeed understand that he acted in error and does regret that.  I believe that Mr. Russell did provide good service to the State in a large number of cases during his career.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It might be noted that, in his evidence before the sub-committee last December he said he was dealing with a very large volume of work.  Apart from 17 UK extradition cases then current, he said that his office was dealing with 3,800 actions of all kinds against the State, with a total exposure of the State <Col N="1484" /> to damages of £1 billion.  I refer Members to column 487 of the select committee report of 21 December for further details.</P>
    <P>For these two reasons I believed it correct, and asked the Minister for Finance to agree &mdash; which he has done &mdash; that the benefits of sections 6 and 7 of the 1963 Act should apply in Mr. Russell's case.</P>
    <P>Some may claim that these relatively generous severance terms should not have been afforded to Mr. Russell.  Let me put on record why I believe it was right to agree to these terms.  Without them there would have been no agreement. Compulsion under section 8 of the 1956 Act would have to have been used.  That section has never been used before.  In that case I was advised that court challenges were very likely &mdash; about matters like the minutiae of the procedures adopted, the value of Mr. Russell's good work on other cases, and whether he could have got a fair hearing in the highly charged political atmosphere of the time.  Such legal actions and charges could have absorbed a great deal of valuable time and money for the State, and their result would be unknowable.  I might add that the cost to the State of a recent botched resignation which ended up in court, was £60,000 in damages, and £76,000 in costs.  I will refer later to that case in another context.</P>
    <P>By pursuing the method of an agreed voluntary retirement, we have avoided all these possible court challenges.  We have got a prompt retirement.  We have got a clear admission of error on Mr. Russell's part.  We have closed the book on the whole question and we can now get on with reorganising the Attorney General's office&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Sir, I ask that Members opposite allow me read my statement.  They have been looking for it and they should hear it.</P>
      <P>We can now get on with reorganising the Attorney General's office with a new official head of office who can be selected as someone suited to the requirements of running a modern law office in the information technology era.</P>
      <P>Let me now outline what actually happened to the correspondence from Belfast solicitors seeking financial compensation, and threatening legal action, for the seven months delay in the Smyth extradition.</P>
      <P>The first letter of 14 November, 1994 was brought to the attention of the then Attorney General, Mr. Fitzsimons, who noted it.  I understand that Mr. Fitzsimons believed that it was going to be replied to, but it was not.  The faxed copy was placed on the file, no more; the posted copy was kept on Mr. Russell's desk until 8 May last.</P>
      <P>A copy was seen by the current Attorney General in December but only as part of an exercise of selecting documents for the sub-committee.  This particular letter had to be excluded from the parts of the file passed to the sub-committee because it disclosed the names of members of the family who had been victims.  Mr. Gleeson presumed that the letter which had been publicised by the solicitors themselves on 15 November, and which had been received in the Office of the Attorney General a full month before he came to office, had been replied to in the normal way.  Normally such a letter would be replied to by the Office of the Chief State Solicitor.  There was nothing in anything Mr. Gleeson saw to suggest that this normal courtesy of replying to the letter had not been complied with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as the letter of 10 January 1995 is concerned, it appears that Mr. Russell <Col N="1486" /> received the letter, did not acknowledge it, did not show it to anyone and, as I understand it, left it on his desk.  There is no one else in the Attorney General's office to whom blame attaches in this matter.</P>
    <P>The existence of the letter of 10 January 1995, and the fact that it and the November letter were never replied to, was not brought to the attention of the Attorney General until 8 May when a parliamentary question was asked by Deputy Michael McDowell.  I would like at this point to recognise the work of Deputies McDowell and O'Donnell in bringing this matter to light.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have stated on a number of occasions that the delay in replying to this correspondence was not justifiable.</P>
      <P>Mr. Russell in his letter to me of 29 May 1995 states:</P>
      <P>I am of course aware of the recent controversy which arises from the fact that no response was sent to two letters sent by a Northern Ireland solicitor seeking payments for victims of sexual abuse by Fr. Brendan Smyth. You have asked me to address the question of the letter dated the 10 January, 1995.  That letter as you know repeated the demand in the first letter and also stated that the solicitor was acting on behalf of two individuals omitted from the first letter.  I took the view that this letter should be treated in the same way as the earlier letter and should not be answered until after the Dáil had completed its consideration of the delay and controversy surrounding the extradition of Fr. Brendan Smyth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There were a number of reasons for this approach.  The first was that, <Col N="1487" /> irrespective of the sympathy one must feel for victims of these crimes, there was no legal basis for a claim for compensation from this State, and indeed in all the recent publicity surrounding this matter I have not seen it suggested that such is the case.  Nevertheless until the Dáil had dealt with the question of the extradition which was the basis of the solicitor's claims it would have been difficult and, I believed, unwise for the State to take a definitive position on the claim. Furthermore as you may know many more actions are threatened by solicitors' letters than are commenced, and in view of the tenuous nature of the claim I thought that this might well occur in this case.</P>
    <P>The course of events has shown that judgment to have been erroneous and it is one that I very much regret.</P>
    <P>I agree that Mr. Russell's judgment was indeed erroneous.  Having considered the matter I do not consider Mr. Russell's explanation satisfactory.  In a public office, such as that of the Attorney General, all correspondence should be replied to.  No one individual should take it on himself or herself not to reply to correspondence.</P>
    <P>The present position is that the matter of the claim for compensation by the victims is being dealt with by the Attorney General with the help of two legal assistants in his office, highlighting the fact that the Attorney General has no conflict in the Smyth case generally. Since Fr. Smyth had gone to Northern Ireland and had been before the courts there before I came to office, I as Taoiseach did not request a progress report on his extradition.  I was unaware that any correspondence remained unanswered and, therefore, did not have a reason to seek copies of such correspondence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will now deal with the possible criticism that I did not deal sufficiently quickly with the consequences for Mr. Russell of his delay in the original extradition matter.  The facts are as follows.  The sub-committee of the select committee concluded its deliberations on 26 January last and shortly afterwards I sought formal and independent legal advice.  Dr. Mary Redmond, solicitor, Mr. Peter Kelly, Senior Counsel and Dr. Patrick Ussher, Barrister at Law were engaged.  The first consultation with Dr. Redmond took place on 15 February.  Consultation with counsel took place on 22 February and senior counsel's opinion was sent to me on 3 March.  This opinion required detailed examination of many complex issues and required further consultations with senior officials of my Department and the Department of Finance.  This process was undertaken in the period of March-April.</P>
      <P>As I emphasised on numerous occasions in the past week, the consideration of the legal and official advices had to be accompanied by scrupulous adherence to the principle of fair procedures. In this context, it was also necessary to consider carefully all the relevant evidence that came before the sub-committee.  I have already quoted some of that evidence by Mr. Russell in regard to his heavy workload, evidence of which might even have been corroborated by other officials in any contested action.  The legal arguments Mr. Russell advanced for this delay being justified by the alleged novelty of the Smyth extradition case had also to be considered.  I make no apology for dealing with this very important matter in a carefully considered and measured way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I held a formal consultation on the whole matter with all the relevant officials on 4 May at which I decided I would ask Mr. Russell to come to see <Col N="1489" /> me to explain his role in the delay in processing the Fr. Smyth extradition warrants.  Before this was arranged I became aware of the failure to reply to the letters of 14 November 1994 and 10 January 1995.  This new information clearly necessitated a new set of inquiries. I also raised some queries in regard to the legal aspects of the advice I had received earlier.</P>
    <P>I note the criticism expressed by Deputy Michael McDowell in a fair-minded article in a Sunday newspaper. He stated that I seemed to confuse the requirements of natural justice in dealing with higher senior civil servants with the role of a High Court Judge.  The article continued:</P>
    <P>John Bruton is the Taoiseach of the country.  [I am glad Deputy McDowell considers me eligible to be a High Court Judge].  He is responsible to the Dáil for the running of the Attorney General's Office.  It is quite possible for him to say that, while he has not completed his investigations, the information available to him thus far suggests that X or Y is the case.</P>
    <P>Provided he retains an open mind and stresses that he had come to no final conclusions and that he will listen to all sides of the story, there is no conflict between having to exercise executive functions in accordance with the principles of natural justice and being publicly accountable for the way in which you are handling those matters.</P>
    <P>My legal advice was clear and contrary to the advice offered by Deputy McDowell in a Sunday newspaper.  My advice was that I should not disclose as facts matters which might be contested by Mr. Russell in his response&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;since to do so could be construed as a prejudgment on my part.  This would leave open to legal <Col N="1490" /> challenge the process which I was carefully following.  I was determined to exclude such risk as far as possible.  I therefore followed a measured course, particularly in regard to answering questions here.  In following my legal advice I was aware of the result in the case of O'Reilly <i>v.</i> the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Attorney General where over-hasty procedures were adopted in regard to the resignation of an official of less senior rank than Mr. Russell in the Department of Industry and Commerce.  Deputy O'Malley was Minister for Industry and Commerce at the time.  The High Court judgment in that case made it clear that I, in exercising my powers under section 8, had to act fairly and follow a procedure analogous to that outlined in the Commissioner Garvey case.  A failure to do so could result in the taxpayer having to pay damages and costs, as indeed happened in the O'Reilly case.  This is the case where the State had to pay £60,000 in damages and £76,000 in costs to Mr. O'Reilly in addition to bearing its own significant costs, and all in addition to Mr. O'Reilly's normal retirement entitlements.  I was determined that that unhappy precedent would not be followed by me.</P>

      <P>These fall under a <Col N="1492" /> number of headings and I will deal with each of them.  Concern was expressed that I did not inform the House in a timely manner of the reasons it was appropriate to seek independent legal advice, that the Attorney General did not reveal his client relationship with Mr. Russell to the subcommittee, that I did not reveal more fully the nature and extent of potential conflicts that might arise following Mr. Gleeson's appointment as Attorney General and that I withheld information relating to what happened to the correspondence from the Belfast solicitors until I had completed my inquiries.  I will deal with the last point first as it is easily dealt with.</P>
      <P>To ensure I remained in a position to conduct my inquiries in a fair and impartial way, it was vital that I did not prejudge the issue.  Therefore, I could not comment.  It was equally important that any person or persons whose actions were being reviewed should have his or her rights protected.  It was, therefore, not possible for me to say anymore.  In so doing I followed legal advice.  In any event, the result vindicates the course I took.  I will refer later to the complaint that I did not inform the House before last Wednesday of the fact that Mr. Gleeson, while in private practice, had been consulted by Mr. Russell.  There is also the related complaint that Mr. Gleeson did not inform the sub-committee.</P>
      <P>When I invited Mr. Gleeson to become Attorney General he informed me that, while in private practice, he had furnished legal advice to Mr. Russell. I so informed the Tánaiste and the Minister for Social Welfare, in their capacities as Leaders of the other two parties forming the new Government. The extent of the informal consultation that took place between Mr. Gleeson and Mr. Russell was not more than about six telephone calls and one short meeting&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>On the general issue of what was the right time to disclose to the general public that Mr. Gleeson, in private practice, had been confidentially consulted by Mr. Russell as a client, in normal circumstances, that confidentiality could only be breached with the client's permission.  Any client in such a situation could properly claim he had a legitimate interest in not wishing to have the fact that he had consulted a senior counsel publicly known, because it might have been interpreted as indicating something of the client's view of his own situation.</P>
      <P>Thus, for the State to have unilaterally revealed the fact of this consultation, at the time of the sub-committee hearings, could have been deemed to have been unfair and prejudiced to Mr. Russell in both the short and the longer term.</P>

      <P>That public and formal step was the making of the revocation order reassigning to me the personnel functions of the Attorney's Office.  That step could only be explained by reference to Mr. Gleeson's conflict <i>vis-à-vis</i> Mr. Russell.  To reveal it any earlier could have been deemed to have been unfair and prejudicial to Mr. Russell and could thereby undermine the process that has now been concluded satisfactorily.  This constraint arguably even applied at the time of my answers to questions last Tuesday, because I had not then made the revocation order or decided on its timing. That decision was made later that evening because of an impending disclosure of the confidential information concerning Mr. Gleeson's client relationship without the corresponding and necessary information about the revocation order having been duly signed and put into effect.</P>
      <P>No conflict arose between Mr. Gleeson's role as Attorney General and his previous advice to Mr. Russell at the time of the sub-committee's hearings. This is because Mr. Gleeson's consultation with Mr. Russell was not relevant to the sub-committee's Orders of Reference.</P>

Where litigation is involved, the Office of the Attorney General briefs independent barristers without reference to the Attorney General.  I can say from personal experience in any case coming before the Government where any conflict involving Mr. Gleeson arises he absents himself from any discussions and makes sure the Government has available to it the best possible advice.</P>

      <P>As far as the Goodman related cases are concerned, it is well known that the State will, in any event, employ independent counsel and would be doing so no matter who is Attorney General, as the Deputies opposite who know anything about the law will testify.

      <P>The normal course of events is to have claims dealt with in court on behalf of the State by independent counsel, hired by the State.  Indeed, as it happens, such counsel have been employed by the State in the export credit claim of Goodman International. The fact of Mr. Gleeson having acted for the Goodman companies was in any event a matter of wide public knowledge and has been known by the Opposition for many months.  The appropriate arrangements have at the outset been put in place by Mr. Gleeson and <Col N="1501" /> are being applied in all cases of potential or actual conflict.</P>

      <P>The engagement of independent barristers by the State is standard practice.

      <P>In response to a parliamentary question on 25 January last, I outlined how the Attorney General had made special arrangements to deal with cases where, prior to his appointment as Attorney General, he had acted as counsel for the other side in issues involving the State.  Those arrangements, in summary, are that such cases be dealt with by his professional staff with the assistance, if necessary, of outside counsel, without reference to Mr. Gleeson.</P>

      <P>If someones takes legal advice from a barrister that very fact is itself a matter of professional confidence. It is not something which a barrister is entitled to make public.  This means that for this, as for every past and future Attorney General, questions of client confidence and potential conflicts of interest will inevitably arise as any Attorney General worth his salt will have acted against the State in a previous case.  His obligation is to reveal the conflict, but only where it arises or where he foresees that it will arise and then only to those directly affected by it. He cannot broadcast it at will.  It would appear that if the Opposition had its way the only person qualified to become Attorney General would be a barrister who is not good enough to get briefs.</P>

      <P>Some might claim that the importance of Mr. Russell's case was such that a potential conflict involving it ought to have ruled Mr. Gleeson out for consideration as Attorney General in the first place.

      <P>In the recent debate on this matter, Fianna Fáil speakers tended to present the fall of the last Government as due entirely to the problems in the Attorney General's office and to the disclosure or otherwise of information about these. That is an inaccurate version of history. The last Government fell because of a breakdown of trust between two parties, which had developed over several months, on a wide range of issues, and in particular on making a judicial appointment after Labour Ministers had left the Cabinet room.  The problems in the office of the Attorney General were just the last straw.</P>

      <P>I have been criticised, in a personal way, for not including information that I was not asked for in answers to a parliamentary question last Tuesday about the fact that Mr. Russell sought legal advice from Mr. Gleeson. Parallels have been drawn with the non-disclosure of the significance of the Duggan case by my predecessor.  I was following a course of action which involved making the position of Mr. Gleeson known at the appropriate time, if it became relevant.  To disclose it before it became relevant would have involved a breach of client confidentiality. The relevant time was when I <Col N="1506" /> was making the revocation order, not before.</P>

      <P>There was nothing improper about Mr. Gleeson's position and nothing that needed to be hidden other than for reasons of client confidentiality. In light of the time limit for Dáil questions, I advise the House that it would not be wise to start placing Ministers under a general obligation to anticipate every conceivable supplementary in their original answers to ordinary Dáil questions.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>However, I would welcome an independent examination by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges of the matters that ought to be included in original Dáil replies, taking account of the time available and of the need to deal expeditiously and equitably with up to 150 Dáil questions per day.  This would be no more than fair because Ministers must have clear guidelines if present requirements of simply answering the question asked are to be changed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Parallels with the non-disclosure in the Duggan case are not valid.  On that occasion the Taoiseach was not just answering one, precise Dáil question at Question Time as I was last Tuesday. He was setting out, with the help of his Ministers meeting all night, to make a comprehensive statement on all aspects of the delay in considering the Smyth case which also happened to be followed by a question and answer session. <Col N="1507" /> When a comprehensive statement is being made, an obligation to include everything that could reasonably be considered relevant, even unsought information, could be argued to apply. That does not apply in the case of a Dáil Question.  I am making a comprehensive statement today and stand ready to be judged by the standard I have stated.  I will endeavour to answer all questions fully.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Because of their necessarily narrow focus I have long realised that ordinary parliamentary questions alone are not a satisfactory method of dealing with major issues where a more extensive examination, with more time to come back to particular queries, is appropriate.  I made that point at the time of the beef tribunal. When that report was presented to the Dáil last August, after much cost and work, Deputies were not allowed by Fianna Fáil to ask Ministers any questions about the Ministers' statements on the report.  That was wrong and I hope it will never happen again.</P>

The feasibility of splitting the two roles of the Attorney General, in accordance with the commitment in <i>A Government of Renewal</i>, is being considered in the context of the current review of the Ministers and Secretaries Act.

      <P>The annual salary paid to the Attorney General is £66,384. Apart from the lawyers employed to advise the Taoiseach on matters arising from the handling of the Father Smyth case, no extra costs have arisen as yet for employing external legal advice. Whatever cost is involved will be offset by savings to the State in legal fees which arose in the first five months that Mr. Gleeson was Attorney General because he represented the State, at no charge, before the courts on three substantial matters.  The amount saved by his appearance in those cases, £35,000, exceeds his salary for that period.  No recent Attorney General has done as much work, free of charge, in court himself for the State than Mr. Gleeson.</P>

      <P>Delivery has just been taken of the first of the PCs.  There have been some queries about the fact that there is a two-year time frame for full implementation of the IT plan. However, the only significant reservation expressed by the independent legal technology consultants appointed to the Attorney General's office for quality assuring the IT plan, was that the two year pace of implementation might be too ambitious, not insufficiently ambitious.</P>

      <P>The report called for an expansion of the library service.  The post of legal librarian was advertised through the Civil Service Commission and an appointment is expected soon. The expansion of the library service will be the responsibility of the appointee, <Col N="1511" /> under the direction of a newly-established library committee.  Steps have already been taken in this direction through the provision of additional funds to upgrade the library's collection of books and legal periodicals and through the acquisition of external legal databases under the IT plan.</P>
      <P>Arrangements are in train for the involvement of the Top Level Appointments Committee in the filling of relevant senior legal vacancies.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The assistant secretary who is on loan from the Department of Justice and acts as administrator to the office of the Attorney General continues to provide a very effective service in that position, pending the appointment of a head of administration within the next six months.  In addition, the office has moved to fill additional posts at the legal assistant and senior draftsman grades and to open eligibility to the latter to solicitors as well as barristers.  Advertisements for senior draftsman were placed last week in the national press by the Civil Service Commission.</P>
      <P>The lack of up-to-date indexes to the statutes is something which all of us as legislators find unsatisfactory.  It has also drawn adverse comment from the legal and business professions generally, in that the absence of adequate indexes makes it difficult to know what is the current up-to-date position of statute law.  The Attorney General has put in hand steps to rectify this situation as quickly as possible.  The potential use of information technology in assisting in the compilation of up-to-date indexes of the Acts and Statutory Instruments is the subject of active investigation and a steering group has been established to progress it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The office needed reorganisation for several reasons, but no matter what procedures are put in place, if a person in an office chooses for whatever reason to <Col N="1512" /> defer an acknowledgement or reply to a letter, information technology is of limited help.  However, the measures will reduce that possibility and should identify any such cases arising.</P>
    <P>In all of this affair we must of course keep to the forefront of our minds the trauma caused to the victims of the sexual abuses concerned.  The publicity surrounding the matter has imposed intolerable pressure on the victims.  The delay in replying to their solicitors' letters is not justifiable in any way and I apologise unreservedly for this error.</P>
    <P>The delay has not prejudiced the potential legal proceedings by the victims in the Smyth case.  The possible claim for compensation by the victims is now being dealt with by the Attorney General in the normal way with the assistance of two legal assistants, both of them experienced and qualified barristers within the office of the Attorney General.  My understanding is that actual legal proceedings have not been issued by the solicitors involved at any stage since 10 November when they issued a seven day notice in regard to such proceedings.</P>
    <P>The Fr. Brendan Smyth case caused understandable public outrage about the sexual abuse of children, and widespread sympathy for the victims of such heinous criminal behaviour.  The prolonged debate about the delay in dealing with the extradition warrants raised public awareness of the extent of such abuse and its concealment in our society.  We learned from first hand accounts, on television and in our newspapers, of the prolonged trauma sexual abuse can cause for the victims.</P>
    <P>Let there be no doubt about the resolve of the Government to take whatever measures are necessary to protect children, in so far as is humanly possible, from abuse and neglect.  This year an additional £10 million has been set aside for the development of further services to assist children and families in need.  Coming on top of investments of the same scale in the previous two years, the availability of this funding will facilitate the commencement before the end <Col N="1513" /> of 1995 of further sections of the Child Care Act.  In particular, those key provisions will greatly strengthen the powers of the health boards, the Garda and the courts to intervene on behalf of children who are in need of care and protection.</P>
    <P>The Government will be pressing ahead with arrangements for the implementation of the Child Care Act in its entirety during 1996.  We are determined that this objective will be achieved and that before the end of next year a comprehensive framework will be in place for the care and protection of vulnerable children.  We will actively monitor progress in building up our child welfare services and, if further initiatives are called for, we will not hesitate to take the necessary action.</P>

He had set out how we would deal with sex abuse cases in the future.  The Taoiseach's reply which appears at column 39 of the Official Report of 15 November 1994 was:</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach announced a major reorganisation of the office of the Attorney General.  As we all know, in business parlance an announcement of a reorganisation of a company usually means that some people will lose their jobs or will be moved to other positions.

      <P>I am glad to see the Taoiseach and the Government have at last taken action with regard to matters in the Attorney General's Office and put in place the procedures recommended by the review committee and approved by us last November.  It is not before its time.</P>
      <P>Let me make it abundantly clear that personnel arrangements are secondary to the issues of this affair.  What has been uncovered recently betrays an inept and bungling Administration headed by a trio of furtive leaders who have been hiding important facts from the public gaze for the last week.  Worse still, we have an Administration which did not address the needs and concerns of the victims' families as a priority.  The great changes proposed by the review group and the various procedures mentioned by the Taoiseach are cold comfort to the family of the victims.</P>
      <P>Last November and December we had the crocodile tears of persons who are now in Government.  The entire manual of criticism was then flung at the last Administration and the finger of accusation was pointed angrily at the former Taoiseach because he was in charge of the Attorney General's Office, because he did not disclose the proper information to the Dáil, correspondence was not passed up the line and he did not answer a question he was not asked.  No matter how Deputy John Bruton squirms, or how he protests that all this is entirely different, the public know that he is condemned by his own words and that his Government colleagues are pinned by the daggers of their own previous allegations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was fine to preach about principles <Col N="1520" /> when they were on the Opposition Benches but now we all see, and the public see, that Fine Gael's principles are moveable feasts, Labour's principles are essentially self-preservation and the Democratic Left principles are as serious as their concern for old age pensioners.

It also recommended the implementation of an electronic mail system to improve communications within the office with the State Solicitor's office and with other Government Departments.  What happened to those recommendations?</P>

      <P>Where were they implemented and, if not, why wait so long?  Who is finally responsible?  Those are questions the Taoiseach must answer not just for the future but about what happened for the past six months. It was clear last December that the Attorney General's office was under great pressure.  The office workload had doubled from 1984, yet the staff had remained virtually static from 1986.  It is hardly right and proper for anyone to lay the blame on civil servants.  There was a real build up of pressure on everybody working there and great credit is due to those who still work there.  I agree with the Taoiseach on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the new Government took office it was abundantly clear that <Col N="1521" /> immediate action should be taken to ensure that the Smyth file was dealt with carefully and expeditiously.  This is what the public wanted and what the victims and families wanted.  This is what the former Opposition demanded daily.  People were justifiably annoyed that there had been a seven month delay with the extradition case.  Disbelief was expressed that a process as sensitive and potentially complicated as extradition could ever be delayed so long.  Responsibility was laid firmly at Deputy Reynolds's door.  It was said that he was responsible and it was alleged that he was guilty.  Now that we have had a six month delay from this Government who is responsible?  Where are the responsible ones?</P>
    <P>The state of disorganisation in the Attorney General's office brought down the last Government.  This Government took office on the solemn understanding that it would carry through a reorganisation already planned by their predecessors in the wake of the Fr. Brendan Smyth case.  The programme for <i>A Government of Renewal</i> states:</P>
    <P>It will be a priority of the Government to re-establish confidence in the office of the Attorney General to ensure that there is no breakdown in future.</P>
    <P>Within six months there is another serious breakdown, also related to the Brendan Smyth case.  The Government took full responsibility in its programme for re-establishing confidence and ensuring that there would be no breakdown, but six months later it has denied all responsibility for the further breakdown and the failure to re-establish confidence. No Minister is responsible.  No Taoiseach is responsible.  It is all the fault of one poor civil servant.</P>
    <P>After what happened last autumn one would have expected that all unfinished business, every letter relating to the affair, would have received priority and follow-through to ensure that further <Col N="1522" /> mistakes were not made.  What happened defies belief.  The letter of January shows that the system was not working as it should have.  The letter from the family of victims was apparently brought &mdash; in some form &mdash; to the attention of the Attorney General.  He simply assumed thereafter, without checking further, that it was being dealt with.  The Tánaiste told us solemnly in this House on 16 November last that the key issue throughout this episode has been accountability, the right of the public to secure adequate explanation, and the responsibility of the holders of high office to take responsibility for their actions.  Where stands accountability and collective responsibility today?  Are we to understand that one Attorney General was or should have been fully accountable for the delay in handling a child abuse case which was never drawn to his attention and in regard to which any explanations offered by the Taoiseach of the day were not good enough, and that another Attorney General who was aware at an early stage of a letter seeking compensation from the State for that delay is not and should not be accountable for the failure to deal with the letter until prompted by a parliamentary question by Deputy O'Donnell? I agree with the Taoiseach that we owe our thanks to Deputy O'Donnell for her tenacity in pursuing the case. Are we to accept that the Government and the Taoiseach have no responsibility for the resurrection of the whole sorry saga?</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach stated on 15 November that the seven months' delay in a case like this represented a personal failure on the part of the former Attorney General, even though he had not seen the file.  During the same speech he commented further that it was another case of evasion of responsibility by shoving the matter into the hands of officials.  Today the Taoiseach is going against what he said on that occasion &mdash; he is shafting a civil servant to save himself.  What was not acceptable then is acceptable now, and the <Col N="1523" /> Taoiseach is engaged in the kind of evasion of responsibility he condemned during the crisis that brought him to office.  The Taoiseach's explanations in this instance are unsatisfactory, and the public know it.  The media forced the Taoiseach to reveal late what he should have revealed early.  This is what he described last autumn as truth by instalments. It would be fitting if the Taoiseach spent more time answering our questions fully in this House than ringing RTE to try to influence what emerges on the other side.</P>
    <P>Any barrister who becomes Attorney General will have dealt with many legal cases previously.  However, this Government came to office on the basis of one legal case, and it would be reasonable to expect, on that matter at least, it would be possible for the State's primary law officer to be free to act.  This was not the case.  The Attorney General's capacity to act was heavily compromised and he could not deal with the most important and sensitive file in his office or, indeed, with other issues of major public importance, nor could he deal with the position of the most senior official in his Department.  There is no provision in the Constitution which allows the Attorney General to abdicate a substantial portion of his duties.  That conflict of interest has been a certainty since this Government came to office and could have been disclosed before it was forced out of the Taoiseach by the media.  This cover up has led to the present crisis.</P>
    <P>It must be remembered that this controversy centres on the failure of the Attorney General to deal effectively with the most sensitive file in his office and to ensure that at the very least an acknowledgement would be issued to a letter sent six months ago.  It must be realised that the failure to deal with this file was a failure to acknowledge the hurt of the people whose lives were destroyed by a child-molesting cleric.</P>
    <P>I now turn to a relevant and related point.  It is difficult to understand why the Attorney General did not inform <Col N="1524" /> the Select Committee on Security and Legislation of this ambivalent position. I listened to the Taoiseach today and I am still less than convinced.  A person of his experience coming into the eye of a political storm would surely have thought it proper, right and fitting that a committee which considered official A as a key witness should know that Mr. Dermot Gleeeson was his legal adviser or that someone &mdash; the Taoiseach who is in charge of the Attorney General's office, the Tánaiste, or the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa &mdash; should have informed it of that fact. Today's bout of activity is an attempted smokescreen, to cover the failure of the Attorney General to act for six months, and the Taoiseach's mishandling of the situation for all that period.  The Taoiseach had many opportunities to disclose the Attorney General's conflict of interest.  It could have been disclosed in reply to Deputy Harney's question of 25 January in the House on the Attorney General's appointment, at the time of the recent controversy over the European Union fine, in February when independent legal advice was sought on the matter, or three weeks ago when Deputy O'Donnell raised the first question on the issue.  Those who knew remained silent &mdash; and complicit.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach's judgment must be called into question because he appointed an Attorney General whose hands were tied with regard to the most sensitive file in his office.  Nobody doubts the Attorney General's abilities, but since he has to absent himself from adjudicating on the Smyth file, which effectively brought this Government to office, his election was unwise.  If the Taoiseach believed that the Attorney General could deal effectively with the Smyth file without involving official A, that was very foolish.  The Tánaiste has the effrontery to tell the people that the Government was correct not to make public the Attorney General's potential conflict of interest when it was first made known to him.  He said that there was no requirement whatsoever to inform the public.  What has happened <Col N="1525" /> to the famous virtues of openness, transparency and accountability?  They have been replaced by deceit, secrecy and passing the buck.  The air is indeed thin on the high moral ground.  The public certainly had a right to know that the new Attorney General would be prevented from dealing with the Brendan Smyth file or from exercising full authority over his office because he had been advising the senior official, Mr. Matt Russell, in a private capacity, and it does not matter whether that involved one consultation or 50.  The fact that he had a lawyer-client relationship with the senior legal adviser who heads his office has led to the present bizarre situation where the Taoiseach has had to take over certain aspects of running the Attorney General's office.</P>
    <P>A number of other questions arise from the lawyer-client relationship.  Mr. Gleeson was appointed by the Taoiseach in October as a member of the Fine Gael deputation to the Forum, thus establishing a formal link with the party.  By early December he was an adviser to Deputy Bruton and Mr. Russell. His closeness to the Taoiseach is also shown by the fact that political discussions were held in his house by Deputies Spring and Bruton.  Did a private conversation with Deputy Bruton influence his outburst on radio on Sunday 3 December 1994 in which he lacerated the then Attorney General.</P>
    <P>In his contribution here on 6 December Deputy Bruton took up the defence of official A &mdash; things are a little different today &mdash; and pointed out that he was not the only person who was aware of the warrants, that the Department of Justice and the Chief State Solicitor's office must also have been aware of the existence of that warrant.  How did Deputy Bruton know that the Chief State Solicitor's office was involved, something he did not know when he spoke in the House on 16 November? In his RTE interview on 4 December Deputy Bruton said that on the previous Friday he had written to Deputy Spring &ldquo;putting before him all the information <Col N="1526" /> that I have&rdquo;.  Did that include information Deputy Bruton had from inside the Attorney General's office?  If true, is it not ironic coming from a Taoiseach who now spends his time trying to hunt down the source of Government leaks? We are entitled to ask on what date did the current Attorney General, as a lawyer in private practice, start acting for Mr. Russell.  When did he have his first discussion with Mr. Russell about that matter?  Will the Taoiseach outline to the House all the discussions he had with Mr. Gleeson about the Brendan Smyth case up to 15 December 1994, a period not covered by any constitutional requirement or convention of secrecy? It is to us, and the public, of the utmost importance that these matters be clarified by the Taoiseach.  We also need to know what part Mr. Gleeson played in this affair so that we can determine how far he was incapacitated.</P>
    <P>It will be recalled that he, as Attorney General, refused to supply certain information to the Dáil committee. If the Attorney General was precluded from acting in the Brendan Smyth case by reason of conflict of interest and was unable to deal with correspondence, how was he able to take a decision on whether that documentation should or should not be supplied to the Dáil committee? What caused this whole controversy to erupt again was the sickening realisation that we have a Government practising double standards.</P>
    <P>The burning, passionate concern with the rights of victims of a paedophile priest, which was so evident last November, would appeal today to have been so much play-acting, the cynicism of so many.  How often did Deputy Bruton berate us from the Opposition benches for allegedly blaming civil servants? Yet that is precisely what he is attempting to do, to shift the blame.  In effect, among all the shouting, the Taoiseach is asking credit for doing that.  Has he not been guilty of the same concealment of information, the same economy with the truth, of which he accused his predecessor, though his predecessor was <Col N="1527" /> cleared by the committee of that because he had not got the information? Failing to volunteer information to this House, which the Taoiseach had in his possession, because he was not asked the question was surely a little odd.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton said on 6 December last: &ldquo;We stand to be judged by the people for the way we conduct ourselves under pressure&rdquo;.  The rainbow coalition has miserably failed its own test of political correctness.  Its members believe in their hearts that moral principles are only for use as weapons against Fianna Fáil, not as a guide in their own conduct. They are not open with the people and they do not wish to be accountable to the people.  The clear pane of glass has been shattered.</P>
    <P>There is little point in the Government trying to make a big deal of the Attorney General's office being questioned and made amenable under various Bills.  I noticed in some of the press cuttings that the compellability of witnesses Bill is being thrown out.  The Bill was already on the stocks, the work on it had been completed.  What we need in this House is a compellability of Ministers and Taoisigh Bill to force them to speak the truth in this House, something the Taoiseach has failed to do.</P>
    <P>Why was no action taken for six months?  The Taoiseach was responsible and he accepted responsibility.  It is his fault.  He won the crown by asking for Albert Reynolds's head and now he must look to his own.  By looking for a senior civil servant's head instead, he and his Government are in effect admitting&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like the Taoiseach to listen to this point because I would like his answer to it later.  By looking for a civil servant's head the Taoiseach and his Government are effectively admitting that the Attorney General of the day is not responsible for administrative inefficiency or other <Col N="1528" /> oversights in his office and that, therefore, the whole basis on which the last Government was brought down is null and void.  The Government has contradicted its own case for the past six months.</P>
      <P>What is needed is a total overhaul of the entire fabric of the law and the institutions connected with Government. What we have heard of so far is just tinkering at the edges of the institutions we have inherited, the Attorney General's office, the office of the Chief State Solicitor and the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions.  Why are they separate?  They should be considered as one in the context of greatly changed times and needs.  Perhaps the time has come for an elected representative to hold the position of Attorney General, as happened in the past.  Being a Member of the House the Attorney General would be, at all times, answerable directly to us and, being a politician, he or she would have to declare any conflicts of interest.  This is the sort of fundamental appraisal and reform that should have been undertaken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Government has lost any legitimacy it might initially have been thought to possess.  There are grave doubts about the quality of the Taoiseach's leadership.  In one sense what happened is more serious because the Government has no excuse this time for failing to realise the sensitivity of the matter.  Yet it did not do anything about it.  If the same standards were applied today as were applied last November and December this Government and this Taoiseach would not survive one day longer.  What was principle in Opposition has become expediency in office.  What we have in this Government are three leaders practising expediency.  This is a Government of double standards founded on hypocrisy. The sneers of January have been replaced by the fears of May and the electorate is already waiting for the Taoiseach.  In due course the people will have their say on his handling of this shabby affair and in our view he bungled.  He bungled the matter again <Col N="1529" /> today and the only credit the Taoiseach can claim is that he has got his third head and he will be looking for more.</P>
    <P>I am afraid the Taoiseach failed miserably.  He failed in every aspect of this case.  It is a sad day for this House when the Taoiseach is applauded by his backbenchers for saying that he is the first Taoiseach who has got rid of a senior civil servant and he expects the people to respect that.  The Taoiseach, the Government and those who support them should be ashamed of themselves.</P>

      <P>I am glad to have an opportunity to contribute to this debate, in particular to express my support for the careful and considered way in which the Taoiseach has approached this whole matter.  In all the controversy that has surrounded the issue we are discussing today, it is too easy to forget that there is a family at the centre of the matter.  That family has suffered a great deal and they deserve our respect for the courage they have shown.  It is, or ought to be, a matter of shame that they have been treated with insensitivity and discourtesy at the hands of the Irish State.  It is not for me or anyone else here to prejudge any legal issues that would be involved in a claim by any individual against the State but I join the Taoiseach in expressing regret at the insensitivity shown to that brave family.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This House is entitled to the answers that the Taoiseach supplied today and is entitled to the reassurance that the Taoiseach and the Government are prepared to take firm action on matters of this kind.  I know it is a source of frustration of Members, as indeed it is to members of the Government, that the matter has required careful handling in a discreet and confidential way to bring it to a conclusion.  I hope and believe, however, that Members who are prepared to examine the whole controversy objectively will come to accept that there were very good reasons for proceeding with care even if that meant that information we were anxious to put before the House was inevitably <Col N="1530" /> delayed.  Some commentators and several Opposition Members have sought to compare the events of the past few days with the events that resulted in Labour's resignation from the Government towards the end of last year.  I believe those comparisons are superficial, they are facile and are essentially untrue.</P>

      <P>In that case, information was withheld because it was politically expedient to do so and there is no evidence that those who withheld ever had any intention of releasing it.  In this case information was withheld because it was essential for the operation of the principle of natural justice and the promise to keep the Dáil as fully informed as possible has been honoured in full at the earliest possible moment.  In the previous case withholding of information for reasons of political expediency was part of a pattern of events which placed trust at a very low discount.  In this case the Taoiseach has endeavoured, within the constraints imposed on him, to recognise that trust must attract a high premium.  Anyone who lived through the period of the fall of the last Government, as I did, knows only too well that the comparisons that some are attempting to draw are indeed spurious. The present controversy derives from the fact that members of the Government have tried to approach the issues involved in an honourable, practical and reasoned way.  If honour and reason had characterised some of the events of late last year that Government might never, in fact, have fallen as it did.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I take this opportunity also to place on record my appreciation of the honourable way in which the Attorney General has behaved.  Ireland is well served to have a person of such character and ability in its service.  The ethical considerations which motivate <Col N="1531" /> him make him more valuable to Ireland and not less.  We can draw strength and confidence from the fact that one of the most sensitive posts in the land is occupied by a person of unimpeachable integrity and whose management skills are admirably suited to any difficult task.  No senior lawyer in this land could approach public office without weighing up the ethical constraints which arise from his or her previous experience.  To describe a previously successful professional life as a source of dangerous compromise is to miss the point.  I am satisfied the Attorney General has served this State well and I hope he goes on doing so for many years.</P>
      <P>It is time to look to the future.  The outcome announced today by the Taoiseach is evidence that we can learn from the mistakes of the past and also that when firm and honourable action is necessary this Government will not be found wanting.  If this controversy has highlighted anything it is that in matters which require sensitivity we may have to find new ways of ensuring the House gets all the information to which it is entitled.</P>
      <P>It is a matter of regret that, for instance, Members who had legitimate questions to ask did not in the first instance seek private briefings or reassurance.  They might reflect on whether they would have better served the interests of the family involved in this issue had they sought to make progress on their behalf by a direct approach to the Taoiseach.  Such a direct approach in the first instance would not have precluded the opportunities for a transparent approach to the problems involved and would not have changed the approach taken by the Taoiseach which has culminated in his statement here today.</P>

      <P>In general terms, I am satisfied that any fair-minded person who follows this debate will readily conclude that the Government and, in particular, the Taoiseach has handled a difficult situation firmly and fairly.  That is what the House has a right to expect and that is what has happened.  The events of recent months ought to have taught us many lessons.  Those who have a genuine commitment to transparency and who regard it as essential to the functioning of our democracy ought to be assured that transparency is at the top of the Government's agenda.</P>
      <P>For our part in Government, we repeat the commitment which underpins the Programme for a Government of Renewal to try to ensure always that no matter how difficult the issue we will seek to approach it in as open a way as possible.  As the Taoiseach said, no one can claim that every aspect of this case has been handled as everyone would wish but it has been approached in good faith and with the intention of securing a result that serves the interests of justice and transparency.  I hope this House will accept that there was no breach of faith and no intention to do so in that commitment.  We should move on and apply the lessons we have learned.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach's attitude to this affair, particularly today, reminds me of the political equivalent of Albert Pierpoint &mdash; with one touch of the lever the Taoiseach wants to remove his political responsibility into oblivion with the corpse of Matthew Russell.  I was not going to mention the family concerned but following the Tánaiste's intervention I have to say I met them <Col N="1533" /> last night and they said they believed that &ldquo;John Bruton, Dick Spring and Proinsias De Rossa have used them to get to where they are now&rdquo;.

We do not want justice behind closed doors.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach took credit for getting rid of a public servant whom he bought off with a golden handshake of approximately £120,000.  He calls this accountability.</P>

      <P>I have tried to be fair in this matter.  When the family concerned had contacted me on 2 May I asked my colleague, Deputy O'Donnell, to table a question to the Minister for Justice.  In the answer we were told nothing about the events which have now come to light because of the efforts of a hardworking journalist and because of expediency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1534" /> Last Tuesday afternoon the Taoiseach, Deputy Bruton, was able to resort to due process but by Tuesday evening this had gone out the door.  On Wednesday morning he was able to tell us that the reason the question was not answered was it was not asked.  There is no point in the Taoiseach saying that the position is not the same as it was when he had this to say about Deputy Reynolds on 16 November at columns 338 and 344 of the Official Report:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;He knew, when he rose in this House, that what he was giving here yesterday was not a full explanation. Yet he went ahead ....  We need reform to ensure that when the answers to questions asked in the House are not adequate the Cheann Comhairle can demand that a further answer be given.  Only by that change will it be possible for us to ensure that the Government of the day is truly accountable&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>On 17 November, at column 477 of the Official Report, he said:</P>
    <P>The lesson is that truth should not come out in instalments: the truth, the whole truth should be given on the first day and let the cards fall as they will after that.  That is a good lesson for all of us who aspire to high office. It does not matter at the end of day so long as at the earliest opportunity one has told the truth.  Let others manage the news once the truth is already on the table.</P>
    <P>I am afraid it was management of the news that dictated the way the Taoiseach behaved during the past week.</P>
    <P>I have huge personal regard for the Taoiseach.  People can laugh but that is a fact.  I was away last week and when I heard about what had happened I was genuinely surprised.</P>

I had expected him to tell us that he did not behave correctly last Tuesday, that he should have answered the questions; instead, he put forward a justification and a defence, attacked everyone else and dragged in matters which were irrelevant. I will not go down that road; I will approach this matter from the point of view of the victims and public accountability.  I set no higher standards for the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the Minister for Social Welfare than the standards they set for themselves.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Social Welfare, Proinsias De Rossa, said at column 53 of the Official Report of 15 November 1994:</P>
      <P>What message does this convey to the unfortunate victims of Fr. Smyth, many of whom are still attempting to cope with the trauma of their ordeal? What message does this cavalier attitude convey about the degree of seriousness with which the constitutional office of Attorney General regards the crime of sexual abuse of children?</P>
      <P>What are the victims to think when the official at the centre of the controversy was still handling correspondence relating to this matter on 8 May?  We were told that the Attorney General would deal with every file involving child sexual abuse.  Yet, a letter received on 10 January was still on Official A's desk on 8 May.  What message does this convey?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At column 59 the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa said: &ldquo;Any new Government must learn the lessons of the past two years and avoid repeating the mistakes&rdquo;.  Surely the first lesson would be that the official at the centre of the controversy, who did not seem to understand the nature of paedophilia, should not have been still dealing with <Col N="1536" /> this case on 8 May.  I find that incredible, as, I think, will most people.  The public is bewildered that what is called the Smyth affair is back on the agenda of the Dáil, at the forefront of political debate.  Many people wish it had gone away.  As the Tánaiste said, the key issue throughout this episode is one of accountability, the right of the public to secure adequate explanations and responsibility of the holders of high office for their actions &mdash; I could not say it better.</P>
    <P>What should have happened?  The committee should have been told about the conflict of interest.  I emphasise, as I did on 25 January, that Dermot Gleeson is a man for whom we have great regard. He is a man of enormous ability, a dedicated and hardworking individual but he has been badly compromised.  The Taoiseach informed the Tánaiste and the Minister for Social Welfare of the conflict in the Smyth case, but why was Dermot Gleeson dealing with the file and with the committee?  If, as the Taoiseach said, independent lawyers will deal with any matter in which the Attorney General could remotely have a conflict of interest, surely the committee that inquired into what went wrong should not have dealt with Dermot Gleeson, Attorney General.  He should have had nothing to do with that matter.</P>
    <P>In his speech the Taoiseach said: &ldquo;All barristers, especially the Attorney General, who is the head of the profession, are required to follow the most strict rules requiring them not to disclose clients' business&rdquo;.  He went on to say: &ldquo;The obligation of a barrister to reveal such potential conflict of interest, only comes into play when the conflict actually arises or if he reasonably foresees that it will arise.&rdquo;  I believe that the conflict arose during the time the committee was making its inquiry.  The Taoiseach said that the public was told only when it was absolutely necessary.  It was only when the public was going to be told through a journalist that the Taoiseach told it.</P>
    <P>Why did the Taoiseach not assume <Col N="1537" /> the necessary powers before last Tuesday night?  Why did he not take those powers last December or January?  If he had done so, he would have had to tell the House.  If the journalist had not found out about the conflict of interest, in view of the fact that the committee was not told and the Taoiseach did not take the powers until last Tuesday night, I believe that we would never have known.  Why did the Taoiseach not take those powers when Deputy O'Donnell put down the question on 5 May, which was answered on 11 May?  The Deputy was interviewed on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; on 12 May.  Why did the Taoiseach not take the powers then?  Why did he take them only on 23 May when the journalist intended to expose the conflict of interest?  Those questions must be answered.</P>
    <P>The Attorney General did not appear before the committee.  The Taoiseach said that he expressed the view that to appear before the sub-committee would be pointless.  Perhaps the committee had valid questions to ask him, but obviously the Attorney General could not have appeared before it given his professional relationship with Mr. Russell. The committee was entitled to know about that and to decide whether his appearance would be pointless.</P>
    <P>We have been told about a conflicts book in the Attorney General's office &mdash; there should be a conflicts book in many offices &mdash; but that is no assurance to the public.  The conflicts book did not work in this case because the only people handling the Smyth file were Mr. Russell and the Attorney General.  A conflicts book is useless in that kind of scenario.</P>
    <P>In his speech the Taoiseach complimented Mr. Fitzsimons.  He seems to adopt a different attitude now from that adopted a few months ago.  I remember listening to the Sunday news on RTE on 3 December in which Mr. Fitzsimons was castigated.  I was astonished and in a subsequent conversation with the Taoiseach told him I did not agree with what he said because Eoghan Fitzsimons is an honourable man.  Today, <Col N="1538" /> however, the Taoiseach said that Mr. Fitzsimons acted with propriety during the whole controversy.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach said in his speech: &ldquo;In the light of the limits on time for Dáil questions, I would have to advise this House that it would not be wise to start placing Ministers under a general obligation to anticipate every conceivable supplementary&rdquo;.  That is not the attitude adopted by the Taoiseach last November and December.  Let us be consistent. We cannot have one set of rules for Fianna Fáil Taoisigh and Attorneys General and a different set of rules for others.  There must be accountability and it is through this House, in a parliamentary democracy, that we ensure accountability.  The Taoiseach promised a review of Dáil questions and a review of the procedure.</P>
    <P>The <i>Programme for Government</i> refers to a Government that must belong to the people.  The Taoiseach said that the relationship between Government and the people it serves has been damaged by a lack of openness, that that relationship must be renewed and so on.  He spoke about the need to reform institutions at national and local level to provide service, accountability, transparency and freedom of information.  He said that one way he would do that was by making the Executive fully accountable to the Legislature.  He said he would ensure that various organs of the State and the holders of high office are more answerable and accountable to the Legislature. What happened in that regard?  We are promised the same thing today.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach said that anybody who is senior at the Bar and becomes Attorney General would have conflicts of interest.  They would have dealt with hit and run cases, but no Attorney General was in a position where cases were evident the day they were appointed.  I ask the Taoiseach to quote precedent.  If precedents exist we would have been told.  Is there a precedent for the kind of conflict that arises in ten major cases, serious fundamental cases against the State?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1539" /> The Taoiseach said he had to involve himself in due process.  I do not believe there is a conflict between due process and being fair to an individual and giving the facts to this House.  The committee should have been told about the conflict between the Attorney General and official A, Mr. Russell.  The Taoiseach should have assumed the powers he assumed on 23 May last December when he took office.  The Attorney General should not have dealt with the matter when it was before a committee of inquiry of this House.</P>
    <P>Last week the Taoiseach said he did not answer the question because Deputy O'Donnell and others had not asked it and that he could not do the Opposition's job for it.  That is a very weak response from a Taoiseach who said that the truth must not come out in instalments.  We must learn lessons from this case and throwing money at a problem does not solve it.  An additional £800,000 was allocated to the Attorney General's office this year.  Despite making available PCs, strategic management plans, consultants and the three wise men, despite the fact that a Government fell, a President of the High Court was forced to resign and the Government took office on the basis of what happened in the Smyth case, we have not learned the lessons which the Minister, Deputy De Rossa, said in this House on 15 November last we should learn.  Let us hope we learn the lessons now.</P>
    <P>If somebody is involved in a controversy and errs, as official A did, they should not be allowed to continue handling the case.  There should have been procedures in place to ensure that did not happen.  It is not acceptable that an official who erred, whose resignation the Taoiseach felt compelled to seek, is given a golden handshake &mdash; that happened in a few other instances recently. What signal does that give to the victims of crime in society?  The victims of serious crime, including Fr. Smyth's victims receive nothing for their pain and suffering, but those whom we want to get rid of to save our own political <Col N="1540" /> bacon receive golden handshakes.  The Taoiseach had to do a deal, he bought off the official and he thinks the chapter is closed &mdash; he said at the beginning of his speech that he set out with three motives and is now happy it is all behind us.  I do not believe it is all behind us. We have not learned the fundamental lessons of last year.</P>
    <P>I will put questions to the Taoiseach later but I want him to tell me in particular why he did not take on the powers in regard to personnel functions in the Attorney General's office until late last Tuesday evening.  What was the reason for not fully answering Deputy O'Donnell's question?  If that question had not been put down, if the family involved had not made contact with us, if it was not for the resilience of the family, a family whose trust in society, in the institutions of State and Church have been totally and utterly betrayed, we would never have known about the Fr. Smyth case.  For more than 30 years that man was a perpetrator of the most awful crimes against children in Ireland and other countries, including America.  If it had not been for Deputy O'Donnell's question we would not have the facts we now have and Mr. Russell would probably be still in situ in the Attorney General's office, handling letters and these types of cases.  Obviously there was no intention to get rid of him.  That is disappointing from a Taoiseach who promised so much.</P>
    <P>When the Taoiseach took office he spoke of transparency comparable with a pane of glass, but the glass is very shattered now.  The glaziers are probably on their way to fit a new pane because that is what is required.  The Taoiseach promised so much in terms of accountability, and I believe he intended to deliver, but something went wrong along the way.  The attitude of the Tánaiste, Deputy Spring, earlier in the House when he tried to rubbish the Opposition and accuse me of playing games with the victims reminded me of the attitude he adopted to the famous Masri file he looked at, and saw nothing wrong with either.  Then there was the <Col N="1541" /> silence of Deputy De Rossa.  Sometimes there are those who are so blind that they never get a chance to see the obvious.  It is not acceptable that a different attitude, a different set of standards is applying.  That has left the public bewildered.</P>
    <P>I hope we learn lessons from all of this and that from today the Fr. Smyth saga can be put behind us.  Because of the serious wrong done to the family in question, the Taoiseach should meet them as a matter of courtesy in the first instance.  That would be appreciated.  I know he apologised to them in his contribution and that will be welcomed and understood but he should meet with them as they are genuinely bewlidered. They wonder if somebody in the Attorney General's office has something against them or if they are being used.  I am not withdrawing what I said earlier, I did not mean to say it but I said it because of the attitude adopted by the Tánaiste.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The manner in which we dealt with this matter in the House last week and the type of defence put up by the Taoiseach today is not transparent or open and does not display public accountability. Getting rid of Matthew Russell at the eleventh hour, calling him back from his holiday or whatever to save the bacon of those responsible, the three party Leaders of this Government, is not acceptable.  The birth of this Government was based on the Fr. Smyth matter.  If it could throw that file aside, forget about all of this as soon as it came to power, the whole question of judgment, sincerity and the bona fides <Col N="1542" /> of its Leaders must be called into question. I am sure there are many others who are of the same opinion.  When my party put down these questions initially and I was contacted I genuinely thought I would hear that the matter was delayed in the Chief State Solicitor's office.  I did not know that this trail would have been the one uncovered, if I had been told so I would not have believed it.

He was still opening the post and taking the letters. Are there any other new child sexual abuse cases?  Who handed Mr. Russell the letters?  He was obviously still handling the matter.  There were no checks or balances, no accountability.  The Taoiseach when in Opposition said in this House on 16 November that ultimately the Taoiseach is responsible for the office of the Attorney General.  I believe the Taoiseach has not exercised his responsibility in this matter.  The very issue that gave birth to this Government is the one on which it has let down many people.  The Taoiseach has not handled this matter well or shown good judgment.  It is a total mess and today's episode, rather then detracting from it, merely compounds the issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Some Opposition Deputies and a number of commentators have tried to suggest that what happened over the past few weeks constituted a repeat of the events of last November.  These comparisons simply do not stand up to scrutiny.  What was involved last year was the failure of the office of the Attorney General to act on legitimate warrants for the extradition of Fr. Brendan Smyth to Northern <Col N="1544" /> Ireland as a result of which this habitual child molester remained at large for almost six months, with all the potential risk to children that involved.  I stand over ever word I said in Opposition regarding that issue.  What is at issue here is the failure to respond to correspondence from solicitors seeking compensation on behalf of the victims of Fr. Smyth.  This latest delay &mdash; as the Taoiseach made clear from the very beginning &mdash; was unacceptable and the serious view which this Government took of it was indicated by the inquiry initiated by the Taoiseach once we became aware of it.  But a delay in replying to letters &mdash; serious and all as that may be &mdash; cannot be regarded on the same plane as failing to act on a warrant for the extradition of somebody wanted for such serious offences.</P>
      <P>The political dynamics of the current situation are also quite different from those of late last year.  It is clear from the evidence given to the sub-committee of the Select Committee on Security and Legislation that trust between the two parties then in Government had been irreparably damaged by a series of events which pre-dated the Smyth controversy, most notably the handling by the former Taoiseach &mdash; sacked by Fianna Fáil &mdash; of the publication of the report of the Beef Tribunal and his insistence in appointing Mr. Harry Whelehan to the Presidency of the High Court despite the absolute opposition of his partners in Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>In many respects the Smyth affair was the final stage of a process of disintegration that had commenced some months before.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In contrast, the parties now in Government trust each other and work in a constructive spirit to implement our programme.  Furthermore, we have the utmost confidence in the integrity and the judgment of the Taoiseach and the Attorney General.  I am satisfied that the Taoiseach handled this affair in the most open way possible consistent with <Col N="1545" /> the obligations to natural justice which he had to meet once he assumed responsibility for certain matters in the office of the Attorney General.  In many respects it was a frustrating experience to sit here last week and watch the Taoiseach having to deal with Opposition attacks, knowing that he was effectively fighting with one hand tied behind his back as he could not answer many of the questions thrown at him for fear of prejudicing the process which he had at that stage initiated.</P>
    <P>I am also more convinced than ever that the decision to appoint Dermot Gleeson as Attorney General was a wise one.  The legal expertise Mr. Gleeson has brought to the Cabinet table has proved to be invaluable to the Government. His assessment of the Abortion Information Act, which Deputy McDowell and others assured us was unconstitutional, was vindicated by a judgment of the Supreme Court.</P>

      <P>One of the things that impressed me most was Mr. Gleeson's willingness to regard the office as a full time position and unlike virtually all his predecessors to forego private practice at the bar.  Mr. Gleeson has, since his appointment, attended in court on behalf of the State probably more often than all his predecessors combined in the past ten years.</P>
      <P>Prior to nominating the Attorney General, the Taoiseach informed me that Mr. Gleeson was one of a number of lawyers who had been consulted on an informal basis by an official in the Attorney General's office regarding his position as an employee in that office&mdash;</P>

      <P>A number of important lessons were learned from the failure to deal with the warrants for the extradition of Fr. Smyth and the Taoiseach has already outlined in some detail the progress made by the Attorney General in implementing the recommendations of the review group which reported in February last.  It is unsatisfactory that despite those changes a letter on a matter of such importance and sensitivity should have lain on an official's desk and not have been drawn to the attention of the Attorney General.</P>

      <P>There are also lessons to be learned regarding the danger of allowing a civil servant, <Col N="1549" /> regardless of his or her ability or experience, to build what amounted to a personal fiefdom in areas of the public service, especially when civil servants are not held accountable to the wider public in the way in which political officeholders are.</P>
      <P>There is also a need to consider whether the powers of Government are adequate to deal with such situations. The previous Government indicated it wanted Mr. Russell removed from the office of Attorney General, but found it could not do so.  The current Government had to go through a tortuous experience to arrive at the position where Mr. Russell will no longer be an official of the Attorney General's office. The rights of public service personnel must be respected and protected, but is it right that the options open to a Government in dealing with such a problem are so circumscribed?  There are no easy answers to these questions, but they must be addressed and members of Fianna Fáil should help us address them rather than shouting across the floor of the House.</P>

      <P>The Smyth affair is the most extraordinary to have confronted the Irish people.  The extent of this man's depredations and particularly the manner in which he abused his position of trust for such a long period sent an unprecedented wave of revulsion through society.  It led to the resignation of a newly appointed President of the High Court, contributed to the collapse of the previous Government and has continued to cause problems for this Administration.  Above all other considerations, there must be sympathy for the enduring damage inflicted on this man's young victims.  The political and judicial casualties of the Smyth affair will recover, but his victims will carry to the grave the psychological scars of his abuse.  If there is any positive spin off to the Smyth affair it is that it focused attention on the wider problem of child <Col N="1550" /> abuse and perhaps encouraged others who had remained silent up to now to come forward.  It is now clear that the extent of child abuse is far greater than we imagined.  We all have a duty to provide all possible assistance to the victims of child abuse to come to terms with their ordeals and to ensure that the legal and social structures are in place which will end this vile and despicable practice for all time, and that is what the Government is committed to doing.</P>

      <P>Has Mr. Russell agreed to co-operate in cases in which he was involved after he leaves his post on 1 June?  If, as stated by Government leaders, he was the individual controlling some of the cases in question, I presume his co-operation will be required.  Will the Taoiseach confirm that following Mr. Russell's departure, the honest outstanding claims made by victims and their relatives will be paid?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The terms of the agreement regarding Mr. Russell's departure do not require him to continue to do work for the Attorney General's office, but I have no doubt that if Mr. Russell is summoned to appear as a witness in a case that comes to hearing he will do so and give evidence in an honest manner.</P>
      <P>As far as claims for compensation by the victims are concerned in November, a letter was received saying that the solicitors would institute proceedings within seven days claiming this compensation. As we know, that letter was never replied to and no proceedings have been issued.  A further letter was received on 10 January again saying that proceedings would be instituted within seven days by the Belfast solicitors if that letter was not replied to.  The Belfast solicitors have not yet issued any claim and that is an important point.  I do not understand the reason for their delay in issuing the claim but that is not a matter for which I have any responsibility. There is a responsibility in regard to the failure by the Attorney General's Office to reply to that letter and that responsibility has been exercised.</P>
      <P>As far as the State's response to that claim is concerned, obviously we would have to see whether the claim has any basis in law.  The preliminary advice we have received suggests there is not any basis in law for the claim but when the claim is made &mdash; which has not yet happened despite all the points made about delay in responding to it &mdash; it will be assessed from the point of view of its legal validity to see if there is a liability attaching to the State in regard to the matter.  I cannot answer the question any more than that.  Payment of a compensation claim means the State paying our taxpayers' money.  The Government is not allowed do that without legal authorisation.  The legal authorisation will only arise if there is a valid basis in law for the claim but the claim has not yet been made so the matter cannot be assessed.</P>

I have no objection to doing anything by way of an apology to the families, that would help them in any way.  I would be quite happy to facilitate any contact with the families that would help and support them in their present circumstances.

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>If Mr. Russell was compulsorily retired or if he resigned without availing of the special provisions of the Act, which provide for enhanced terms where a reorganisation of the office is taking place, he would be entitled to a lump sum of approximately £80,000 on retirement.  In the normal way, any civil servant retiring with his years of service would be entitled to a lump sum of about £80,000.  If he had resigned yesterday without getting any assent to his resignation being considered under the Act, he would get £80,000 anyway.  Because he has been allowed to avail of the section which allows for a resignation where a reorganisation of an office is taking place, the extra lump sum is in the region of £45,000.  The difference between the rate of pension he will receive on an annual basis under the provision as against what he would qualify for anyway if he resigned or was compulsorily retired, is somewhere in the region of £3,000 per year.  In regard to how much that will involve at the end of his life, that is impossible to assess without knowing his life expectancy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The assessment of whether that was a wise course of action obviously depends <Col N="1554" /> on one's assessment of the risk of a successful legal challenge.  On the basis of the legal advice I received, I was concerned that anything that was done, in this politically spotlighted case, to move for compulsory resignation or retirement, rather than agreeing to this package, could have ended up with the same result that occurred when Deputy O'Malley was Minister for Industry and Commerce and an attempt was made to remove an official which resulted in substantial additional damages and costs having to be undertaken by the State because of the incompetence of Deputy O'Malley's Department in handling that resignation.  I was determined not to follow that unfortunate precedent set when Deputy O'Malley was Minister and to pursue a more responsible, reasonable and agreed approach to this, and I think I have got a good result.</P>

      <P>Throughout the Taoiseach's contribution today we heard about the impediments to the lawyer-client relationship.  The committee sat from 22 December to 11 January. Communications were sent from me to the Attorney General, on behalf of the committee, in an effort to obtain information which, unfortunately, Mr. Russell could not give the committee because of the constraints on him.  He had to communicate with the Attorney General.

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Taoiseach had an obligation to the committee which he set up and was doing a job on behalf of the House to give that information because it was crucial to the work of the committee.  We hear about the Attorney General's and Mr. Matthew Russell's right to natural justice <Col N="1556" /> but nothing about the rights of the people for which the committee was set up who suffered as a result of the episode. The Taoiseach evaded that issue and has not a direct answer to why he did not inform the committee which he set up.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me explain to Deputy Wallace that when I received information on a privileged basis &mdash; I had a material reason to be told about Mr. Gleeson's conflict of interest in this case because I was proposing to appoint him as Attorney General &mdash; I was bound by the same obligations of confidentiality in the use I would make of that information that also applied to Mr. Gleeson, in other words I could only disclose it, because it was confidential barrister-client information, under the same conditions that he, Mr. Gleeson, could disclose it.  Therefore, I could only disclose it to people where there was a material requirement for them to be told.  I was in no freer position, therefore &mdash; this is the mistake Deputy Wallace is making &mdash; to disclose that information than Mr. Gleeson.  In fact, solicitor-client relationships would not work, if a third party being told that information for a legitimate reason could be free to broadcast it after that. You could not have that situation and I am sure if Deputy Wallace thinks about it for any length of time he will realise that his proposition is neither logical nor possible.  Furthermore, to come to the question of bringing that matter to the attention of the committee, as I explained in my speech, the only function the Attorney General had to perform in respect of the committee was one of selecting documents that the committee could or could not see.</P>

      <P>The second question asked why I had not made a formal order revoking the delegated powers. My purpose in revoking the delegated powers related only to a particular possible disciplinary action against one official.  It was only when I reached a point where I was pretty certain I would have to take formal action in the matter that it was appropriate for me to make a formal revocation.  It would have been <Col N="1563" /> impossible for me to have revoked it earlier because I would then have been in a position where I would be responsible for holiday arrangements for clerical staff and every conceivable minor personnel issue in the office.  I took the approach of taking the necessary legal advice to determine whether there was a sufficient case to answer.  Only when I had established beyond all doubt, in light of my perusal of the legal advice, the evidence before the sub-committee and all the other relevant factors including the failure of Deputy O'Malley in a similar case regarding a resignation, that it was prudent for me to take this formal course of action was it then appropriate for me to make the revocation order.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann is concerned that State and EU funding of tourism should be applied in the most costeffective manner and so as to maximise tourist growth, having particular regard to the permanent cessation of violence in Northern Ireland, the Government's proposals to reorganise State investment in the industry and the need to increase investment in this growth sector.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Tourism and Trade took over from Deputy McCreevy a few months ago.  The previous Minister was imaginative and energetic where tourism is concerned.  There is little evidence to date that his successor is following that precedent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Deputy intend to share time?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I will give the information to the Chair.  In my few months as Fianna Fáil spokesperson on tourism and trade I have had an opportunity to meet many people who depend on tourism for a living.  They own part of the product &mdash; the accommodation and leisure facilities.  By virtue of a serious effort on the part of Bord Fáilte to market Ireland as a premier tourist destination throughout the world, they have been able to improve, upgrade and expand tourism infrastructure.  They know that the key to healthy tourism is anticipating demand and providing accordingly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Money for investment is always a problem.  The Government of which I had the honour to be a member was sensitive to the potential of the industry. It was conscious of the role which Government must play in securing a bright future for tourism and made <Col N="1565" /> great strides to increase direct State funding of the industry and secure EU funding to supplement it.  It is a shame to see genuine effort cast aside and replaced by a form of bureaucratic inertia and inability or unwillingness on the part of the Minister to appreciate the golden opportunity he has been given to make a real and lasting impact.</P>
    <P>The Minister inherited his portfolio at a promising time.  Not only has he access to billions of pounds in EU funding but he is perfectly situated to channel to where it can do most good, the worldwide funding which will come on stream as a consequence of the permanent cessation of violence in Northern Ireland. Given that tourism is set to replace agriculture as the most important source of indigenous national income, a forceful and determined Minister for Tourism and Trade could open up an avenue to prosperity for those working in the tourism industry and provide an opportunity for the development of strategy for tourism.  Obviously this would be of benefit to those directly involved and it would have the added effect of fostering the essential relationships of trust and mutual respect between Irish people North and South.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil's commitment to the reconciliation of the differences which separate our island stands on its own. The previous Government and I worked long and hard to create the present opportunities, they did not simply fall off the trees.  They were individually pursued and the effort never flagged. Even though the 25 years of murder, fear, mayhem and hatred have now ended, the future is by no means certain. However, the Government is not moving with the urgency necessary to bring along with it those whose belief in the peace process is not total.  I have no wish to raise unnecessarily the level of concern being expressed about where the process is headed.  The Government has a duty to every person on the island to push at every door and to open doors so as to involve our neighbours in Northern Ireland in running the island. That is the only way forward and the <Col N="1566" /> Minister has a vital role to play in this area.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that he met various politicians and officials in Northern Ireland to discuss North-South co-operation in tourism.  Is that all he has done? Last week he attended the conference in Washington organised by President Clinton, on whom much thanks and credit has been poured by people on this side of the Atlantic for what he has done.  The Minister is engaged in a nationwide tour to explain to people in those seaside resorts fortunate enough to be included in it the benefits of the incentive scheme announced in the budget.  The only flaw with this familiarisation process is that he has very little time to do sufficient work.</P>
    <P>A lengthy familiarisation process may be a luxury which the nation cannot afford.  It is time for action and, in so far as tourism is concerned, today is the time for action as tomorrow may be too late.  I look forward to hearing the Minister outline what he is doing to further the peace process.  We should not have to surgically extract that information from him.  Perhaps he has no information, has nothing to report or he is not doing anything that is worthy of being put to the test of popular reaction.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil deplores the throw-away attitude of the Government to tourism. Events taking place elsewhere are having, and will have, a damaging effect on our tourism industry.  In the past few months I have been made aware of the deep concern about the direction of the Government's tourism policy.  It appears to be ignoring the damaging effect the state of the punt will have on Ireland as a destination for foreign tourists.  The strength of the punt means that foreign tourists will find Ireland a more expensive holiday destination and may well decide to go elsewhere.  Other factors such as the punitive rates of taxation on restaurants, hotels and services generally and the appalling condition of our roads &mdash; these problems did not arise yesterday or today and we accept part of the responsibility for the condition of the roads in some counties &mdash; work <Col N="1567" /> together against the promotion and marketing of Ireland abroad by Bord Fáilte.</P>
    <P>People are also seriously concerned about the complete lack of effort by the Minister and the Government to take measures to combat the escalating level of crime against tourists.  During the previous debate the Minister for Justice, Deputy Owen, directed snide remarks at me.  She is a good Minister for Justice but she should be very careful about the remarks she makes about Deputies on this side of the House.  She has a good deal on her plate and she should set about reducing the level of crime.</P>
    <P>We are going through what I hope is only a bad patch in terms of increased crime levels in cities and, in particular, my city of Dublin.  Between 2,000-3,000 gardaí are stationed along the Border to deal with subversive crime and to patrol Border areas.  Is it not time the resources of the State for combating crime were reallocated to where the crime is occurring, now that we have what everyone hopes is a permanent cessation of violence by the para-militaries? If there are good reasons for keeping these gardaí on the Border &mdash; the cost of relocation is not a good reason &mdash; then the Government should recruit more gardaí.  It is cheaper to prevent crime by effective measures and methods of policing than to meet the costs of crime after it is committed.</P>
    <P>We need a strong Garda presence on the streets and not just in patrol cars, which are also very necessary.  The men and women who join the Garda are of the highest calibre and many young people are anxious to join this respected and reputable force.  The Minister should consider a new recruitment campaign with a view to dealing with crimes against tourists.  There are parts of every city and town which are virtually no-go areas for gardaí.  Drugs and drug related crimes seem to be out of control, yet vital resources are not available to tackle this major social and economic evil.</P>
    <P>A feeling of being safe is a major <Col N="1568" /> factor for tourists when choosing their holiday destination.  We must protect our good reputation in this respect and ensure that the message does not go abroad that Ireland is an unsafe place to visit.  Unfortunately, that is the direction in which we are going and the time to stop it is now.  The Government has a fundamental role to play in this area. Crimes against non-nationals in a foreign country are always very well publicised in the media in that person's country. These incidents not only prevent unfortunate victims from considering Ireland as a future holiday venue but they also have an immeasurably negative influence on others who might have put Ireland high on their list of holiday destinations.  We need to ensure that tourists return to their own countries singing the praises of Ireland and encouraging all their friends to visit here &ldquo;before everybody finds out about it&rdquo;.  I say that in a positive sense.</P>
    <P>Most sensible people would venture the opinion that the Government should be gearing for growth and expansion in the industry.  They would, therefore, be very surprised to learn that far from injecting State funding into the industry to speed up the pace the Government is engaged in a cost cutting exercise.  The Minister's Department, the Office of Public Works and the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications share the dubious distinction of having had their annual budgets reduced.  It is bad enough that the entire tourism budget is only £77 million &mdash; tourism produces more than £3 billion and supports 90,000 jobs &mdash; but what is worse is the manner in which this funding is to be allocated by the Government.</P>
    <P>I want to give an example of the value to the State of this investment.  This level of annual spending by the Exchequer in 1995 is the equivalent to a State input of just £258 per job.  Is there any sector in the economy where jobs are produced so inexpensively?  If the Minister is aware of one let him identify it.  When he cannot find one let him rethink how many extra jobs might be created if the Government was doing <Col N="1569" /> what it should be doing and not fiddling with numbers in order to convince themselves that everything will be all right on the day.</P>
    <P>Administration costs in the State tourism sector are to increase by 10 per cent in 1995.  This increase exceeds the level of inflation forecast for this period by more than 300 per cent.  What does this grossly disproportionate figure mean to the tourist industry?  It does not mean a single additional job or service and actual cutbacks in existing services. Yet within this increase is a reduction of £60,000 in travelling costs &mdash; surely a blow to our foreign promotion and marketing strategy &mdash; and a reduction of £103,000 in the allocation of the funding of external advisory services, so essential in the highly competitive and sophisticated international tourist marketplace. How can the Government stand over these irrefutable facts?</P>
    <P>The Minister should be aware of what exactly is happening and should have no difficulty in answering specific questions concerning his area of responsibility.  I raise this issue having endured the tedium of three days of the Minister answering parliamentary questions concerning his ministry.  The almost universal approach of the Minister has been to give as little information as possible or to avoid answering questions altogether. It is not good enough to disclaim responsibility.  If he is not aware of the stated objective of his Government &mdash; openness, transparency and responsibility, three words which grate on me, &mdash; it is almost as bad as the expression &ldquo;political correctness&rdquo; and is nauseating in its application, particularly by the Taoiseach, then the last couple of weeks ought to have rectified this.</P>
    <P>If questions are legitimately tabled to a Minister, which related to that Minister's area of responsibility, it is surely the duty of the Minister to answer the question, having consulted with other Departments or bodies, or to transfer the question to another Minister who will provide the information requested.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1570" /> For the Minister to deal with parliamentary questions in the manner so far demonstrated is a serious breach of the principles on which the Minister's Government has constructed its platform for this wretched period of moral rectitude which the House is going through and is an insult to the legitimate interests of parliamentary democracy.</P>
    <P>The Minister may well be surprised at what I said.  He may well believe that it is not for him to decide how parliamentary questions are to be answered and that it is enough for him to take the advice offered to him in his Department as gospel.  This is manifestly not so. Advisers are there to advise; it is for the Minister to decide.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister well and he will appreciate that the criticism levelled at him concerns &mdash; not him in a personal sense &mdash; only the manner of his presentation and the discharge of his duties. He is new at his job.  Yet he knows that his Government has pledged to the people that it will be open, transparent and accountable.  I am sorry for again falling into the trap of those clichés which have come to mean much to some and nothing to others.  The Minister's Government already seems to have encountered serious and damaging obstacles on its chosen path.</P>
    <P>I note the Minister has not lost sight of the first rule of politics &mdash; get reelected &mdash; and that he is making his presence felt in his home county of Mayo.  If he continues to obfuscate when he is asked to answer straightforward questions in this House, he will not be doing his job.  While the people of Mayo may well have taken him to their hearts, the public is notoriously fickle and, if it proves that the public is not being well serviced by the policy which he promotes, his party and their partners in Government may be in for an unpleasant surprise at the next general election, which may not be as far away as some Government Members hope.</P>
    <P>He may decide for himself which policies will mean something to the people in the tourism industry or with the <Col N="1571" /> potential to become part of that industry. He does not have to accept every proposal presented to him.  It is his job to select what is good and to reject what is not.  What should he do?  He should not dismantle Bord Fáilte without ensuring that what is put in its place will be more effective and less costly.</P>
    <P>In this regard my understanding is that the Minister proposes to reallocate responsibility for dealing with proposals for State, European Union and all other funding for individual tourism projects from Bord Fáilte to the regional tourism organisations.  We do not know how much this will cost nor how it will operate. If he does not tell the House, Members will be reinforced in their concerns. Let him also tell us how much extra he is prepared to allocate to regional tourism organisations, if the new system is to have any effect.  It should at least be as good as the service provided by Bord Fáilte at present, and if it is to be an improvement on that service, who will provide the funding?  Will it be financed from external funding thus depriving the tourism industry of badly needed support?</P>
    <P>I also understand that in the future the system of registration of guest accommodation and monitoring of standards is to be removed from Bord Fáilte and reallocated to an unidentified body. Will the Minister tell the House how this new body is to be financed, staffed and operated and to whom it will be responsible?</P>
    <P>It occurs to me that the staff who will be made redundant from Bord Fáilte as a result of these policy changes are likely to be the best qualified for the jobs in the regional tourism organisations and in the new Registration and Standards Body.  Are we likely to witness Bord Fáilte staff being made redundant tomorrow, at an estimated cost of £2.2 million to the State, and the following day the same staff being re-employed either directly or indirectly by the State at similar or higher salaries?  Is that good business?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I also understand that the real allocation of State funding for overseas promotion of Irish tourism is to decrease by over £700,000.  How can this be so?  Is the Minister determined to stifle any attempts to widen the net for our tourism industry?  To cut spending on Ireland's promising area of economic development and to respond to the industry's thirst for encouragement and free thinking by such a penny pinching policy is not how it should be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister may well have the report of the consultants retained by the previous Government and say, as we have come to expect, that this has nothing to do with him, that it has all been visited on him by the previous Government, by his Department, by the Department of Finance or by anyone else he may care to mention.  I challenge the Minister to point out to the House where the consultants advised him to reduce spending on foreign promotion of the Irish tourism industry.  Did the AD Little report advise the Minister to limit support for the small business sector to £5 million?  Did they advise him to cut SFADCo funding by some 37 per cent?  The last cut is the most bizarre of <Col N="1573" /> all for an area which has suffered and continues to suffer.  The Shannon region needs a special effort if it is to regain its market share in tourism and to move forward.</P>
    <P>The Minister has inherited a brief which offers the prospect of good news only.  With the peace process in place and progressing, he is presiding over what is the most significant area of the Irish economy at a time when the growth of tourism in Ireland is huge. Ireland has the opportunity to become one of the premier tourist destinations of the world, if properly managed, and the potential of the country has, to date, only been scratched on the surface.</P>
    <P>This is not a time for conservative thinking in this area and the Minister must do whatever is necessary to get proper advice, persuade his Government colleagues of the need for radical action and keep pushing until he gets his way.  If he succeeds he can claim the spoils of victory and the people of Ireland will thank him.  If, on the other hand, he continues on his present path of no change at any cost, then he must expect to lose the respect of the people who elected him and his Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith" hpid="Mr. B. Smith Mr. B. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this motion which is timely and extremely important from political and economic points of view.  In 1987, Fianna Fáil in Government identified tourism as a potential growth area and that Government's decision to invest considerable resources in the tourism industry has been fully vindicated with the very successful growth in tourism revenue and in employment in the tourism industry between 1987 and 1994.</P>
      <P>During the past few years considerable cross-Border co-operation has taken place.  We must build on this view of the cessation of violence since last autumn.  All communities, both North and South, recognise the strength of the Thirty-two Counties as a tourism product. It is absolutely essential that we are in a position to sell the island of Ireland as an attractive holiday destination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1574" /> One of the very positive decisions made by Fianna Fáil in Government was to restore the Ballyconnell-Ballinamore canal which winds its way through my constituency.  That decision was a progressive one from which the economies of Fermanagh, Cavan and Leitrim will reap the benefits for many years.  The economic impact of the canal restoration is evident in that area.  The canal links the Shannon and the Erne, the major waterways here, and the system now provides an unrivalled facility for people wishing to avail of cruiser holidays.  In years to come the direct and indirect economic impact of that decision taken by a Fianna Fáil Government will be easily recognised by substantial improvement in the local economy. This Government inherited office at a particularly promising time and it is essential that it provides the funding for major cross-Border projects.  If tourism in the Border area is to significantly expand in the future and advantage taken of the new climate created by the peace process, there is an urgent need to develop a strong and improved product which is attractive to the more general visitor and supported by a broad range of attractions.</P>
    <P>A number of key development requirements must be addressed if the area is to successfully exploit a wider tourism market.  These include the creation of a well defined tourism image and indentity for the area in the general tourism market and the provision of a number of quality attractions and facilities supported by an improved tourism infrastructure.  In particular, a limited number of high profile flagship attractions would play an important role in creating an image and identity for the area in the marketplace, as well as attracting visitors in their own right. Such projects have been specifically identified in the new county tourism plans.  Another important requirement would be the establishment of a co-ordinated and integrated approach to promotion and marketing.</P>
    <P>A firm commitment by the Government in terms of funding to a selected <Col N="1575" /> small number of the high profile flagship attractions would be of tremendous benefit to the future development of tourism.  The Government should commission a tourism action plan for the Border area to be published and adopted not later than the end of this year in recognition of the peace initiative and the prospects for growth and investment it brings with it, and of the well known and special problems of that area.  In its approach to the preparation of the action plan the Government should recognise that a plan of firm action is required, not another study.</P>
    <P>The problems of the area have been well diagnosed in numerous studies and reports over the past 20 years and it is now time to apply tangible cures through a series of public investment programmes and other related initiatives. In preparing the action plan the Government should allocate the task to a small group of suitably qualified individuals to include a number of people from the local area.  The plan should be unambiguous, clear and specific in terms of the initiative and investment programmes which are to be implemented, the timescales involved and their sources of funding.</P>
    <P>I want to refer briefly to two projects of major importance in the context of the development of cross-Border tourism. In the past few years preliminary work has been carried out on the proposed extension of the Erne Navigation from Belturbet to Lough Oughter to Killeshandra and Killykeen Forest Park. Fianna Fáil in Government were anxious to advance this project in the context of INTERREG II, but the replies to parliamentary questions by the Minister for Finance and Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht indicate in no uncertain terms that this project has been relegated in the priority list.  The project would be complementary to the successful Ballyconnell-Ballinamore Canal and would open up a further interest in waterways or boat users.  The Erne, flowing through Cavan, Fermanagh and Donegal, is a project that needs <Col N="1576" /> all the criteria for cross-Border development, and I appeal to the Ministers concerned to give it the priority it deserves.</P>
    <P>The former Minister for Tourism and Trade, Deputy McCreevy, sanctioned grant assistance towards the cost of conducting a planning and implementation study on the development of a mountain park around the upland areas of south west Fermanagh, west Cavan and north Leitrim.  The full implementation of this project would enable the very strong tourist attractions of that area to be identified and marketed more aggressively with a consequent increase in tourist numbers.  The specific funding designated for the development of Border regions would be ideally suited to the Erne Navigation project and the Breffni Mountain Park proposal in that they meet all the criteria, such as the economic value of the project and its cross-Border nature, and are visible testimony to the peace dividend.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>The last great flood of Northern Ireland tourists coming over the Border to Sligo, Leitrim, Roscommon and the western counties was in 1968.  It is with delight that we may now have the opportunity of introducing to the southern counties a generation of people who have never been here.  It was the emphasis on the peace process by the last Government, and the former Taoiseach, Deputy Albert Reynolds, in particular, that brought about an environment in which people can enjoy the unusual and extraordinary tourism product in this part of the island without suspicion, fear or the worry associated with a period that I hope has gone for ever.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fianna Fáil Governments and Ministers have always emphasised the importance of development, of supporting the individual who develops a good project and is prepared to give his talent, energy and finances to that end.  We put particular emphasis on tourism but that seems to have disappeared.  We now have a battery of inspectors and all types of conditions, controls and regulations in circumstances where products <Col N="1577" /> are not even developed.  On returning to the west having travelled to the southern counties one witnesses a continual decline in the quality of the tourism product to the point where, when one reaches home, it is non-existent.  Once again, the western and north eastern Border counties are being ignored.</P>
    <P>It is a safe bet for the Government and Bord Fáilte to promote tourism in places that are already marketed as tourist destinations.  However, there is a different type of tourism, well recognised in every townland, which must be marketed and promoted, and it takes money to do that.  It is amazing to think that under the new Leader programme the flexibility clause is to be deleted with the result that the locally based boards will have no autonomy and local people will not be able to use their own knowledge and experience to justify the financing of product development in the future because of the elimination of the flexibility clause.  Matters will be governed by the Department and ultimately by the Minister, and finances will dictate the level of tourism and where it will be located.  In some areas the growth of tourism has been slow but despite that it has supplemented the incomes of people who might not have survived the recent years or recession without that little injection of cash for a few months each year.</P>
    <P>In north Roscommon, Keadue won the Tidy Towns competition in 1994 and there is not one approved guesthouse there.  The policy which states that you cannot provide green field accommodation is not a good or sensible one. You can, it appears, in certain situations obtain funding for carrying out improvements to existing buildings and dwellings as seems to be the case with the enterprise boards, Leader I and Leader II.  Where people are in a position to put up their own money, and take on the challenge of the very demanding job of providing services for the public, particularly the visiting public, they should be supported.  One of the real difficulties in the area in which I live is that the economic base is not all <Col N="1578" /> that strong.  Consequently what might be fine in some parts of the country, 25 or 30 per cent, to help to get product development going is far from being enough in our area.  More is needed.</P>
    <P>The Minister is a west of Ireland man and I join our spokesman, Deputy Andrews, in wishing him well and congratulating him.  I have personal regard for the Minister and I would like to think he identifies with some of the matters to which I referred.  If we are to achieve some of the things I have mentioned we should look at the idea of cheaper money so that people might take the opportunity to develop.  It is often much better than the grant-aid concept.  Real tourism is best served by men and women in small guesthouses and small hotels.  In recent years there seems to be an idea that big is beautiful but when you go into to some of the big hotels you could be in any part of Europe.  When visitors come here they want to discover Ireland, they want to meet Irish men and Irish women.</P>
    <P>There is an emphasis on the development of amenities.  If there is not accommodation in an area one cannot expect people to stay overnight.  If there is accommodation, there is some prospect of a meaningful contribution to the local economy.  However, that does not seem to be the idea today.  I was recently told at a committee of this House that priority would be given to the development of amenities.  Unfortunately even that is not happening in the area in which I live.</P>
    <P>On the Shannon, for instance, there is no berthing place between Carrick-on-Shannon and Lough Key except what was provided by the land owners of another period.  It is extraordinary that villages and towns like Knockvicar, Cootehall, Tarmonbarry, Lanesborough and Rooskey itself have as many as 25,000, 35,000 or 40,000 people, according to Office of Public Works figures, going through the lock gates and they do not have the facility to berth in these little villages to enjoy and experience life there and meet the people.  It is not <Col N="1579" /> possible to do that if there are no berthing facilities.  I have continually asked both Bord Fáilte and the Office of Public Works to recognise that you cannot have people staying in a particular location if you do not have accommodation or berthing facilities.</P>
    <P>Something else would eliminate serious loss of time and indeed embarrassment. It is never a bad thing to know where you are when you arrive in a country.  Signposting is a fairly basic method of discovering where you are and where you are likely to get to if you take a particular route but in Ireland it seems almost to be frowned upon.  Signposting is very well done in other European countries but in Ireland there seems to be a plan to conceal knowledge of where you are or where you are likely to arrive.  If people decide to come it is better that they can go away in a position to say they were in a certain place and that they knew they were because the sign told them so.  That is not always the case and I would ask the Minister to pay attention to that.  He will gain recognition for it.</P>

      <P>I apologise to the co-sponsors of the motion.  Deputies Andrews and Killeen, for the unavoidable absence of the Minister this evening.  He will be here to respond tomorrow evening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The events of the past number of months have been a source of satisfaction to us all, principally because those who sought to use the bomb and the bullet to achieve political ends have decided to place their trust in democratic politics.  A cloud of fear, division and suspicion among the peoples on our island is gradually being lifted, and we are attempting to create a more normal <Col N="1580" /> climate of trust and confidence in building in peace, our future together.</P>
    <P>We have seen some very dark days over the last 25 years and it is the wish of everyone in this House that they do not return.  Indeed, it is important to record that all parties have contributed to the peace, and it is natural, therefore, that we should all want to ensure that peace improves the economic and social conditions in our community.</P>
    <P>Peace has transformed international perceptions of Ireland, and it is certain that the tourism industry on the whole island stands to gain in the short term. More money than ever before is supporting our tourism effort abroad, and peace has enabled us to work more closely with our Northern Ireland counterparts in marketing the tourism attractions of the island of Ireland.  It is only since becoming Minister of State that I have come to realise how close our relationship has become.  Participation at tourism trade fairs abroad is often undertaken on a joint basis, and this is not often realised in Ireland.  Perhaps the most visible example to reach a home audience was the recent Eurovision Song Contest, when attractions on both sides of the Border received coverage as part of the promotional exercise in selling tourism on the island as a whole.</P>
    <P>The domestic audience may also have recently seen a joint North-South consumer advertising campaign on British television.  Similar campaigns are being run in the US, France and Germany this year as part of a £6.3 million programme known as the overseas tourism marketing initiative.  This is funded by the Exchequer, the EU, the International Fund for Ireland and the private sectors, North and South.  It is being led by both industries with the advice and co-operation of Bord Fáilte and the Northern Ireland Tourist Board.</P>
    <P>These are indicative of the substantial efforts made by the Government to exploit the potential which arises for tourism from the peace process. Exchequer and EU resources from the Government's allocation of Structural <Col N="1581" /> Funds are being made available to improve prospects for tourism growth on the whole island.  These arrangements have also served to enhance North-South co-operation in the tourism area and to build a firm base for undertaking more extensive work together in the future.</P>
    <P>It is appropriate at this point that I should pay tribute to all the donor countries who, in their desire to support the peace process in Ireland, are generously and selflessly devoting time, energy and financial resources to sustaining the peace.  The US Government, at its most senior levels, has lent its considerable support, as evidenced by last week's trade and investment conference in Washington.  Having helped to create the peace, it is now working to cement the foundations for future economic prosperity in Northern Ireland and the Border counties.  I take the point made by Deputy Smith in this regard.</P>
    <P>The European Union has been a major source of investment funding for tourism development in Ireland, both North and South, since 1989, and Deputies throughout the country will be aware of the impact this funding has had for development in their own areas.  The EU has been prepared to provide, on top of normal Structural Fund allocations, a further 300 million ECU to support peace and reconciliation in the region.  The EU has also been a longstanding contributor to the International Fund for Ireland.</P>
    <P>In addition, Canada, New Zealand and, more recently, Australia have all financially supported economic and social advance through the international fund.  All of these financial contributions have helped to generate the new wealth and employment which tourism has created on the island over the last few years.  Since 1988, tourism has created an extra 25,000 full time jobs in the State and the industry now accounts for about 7.5 per cent of total employment. Over a similar timescale, tourism's contribution to GNP has risen from 5.8 per cent to over 7 per cent and <Col N="1582" /> this increase has occurred against an economic background where real GNP was rising rapidly.</P>
    <P>These figures suggest that we have prudently used the substantial funds which have been invested in tourism development in recent years and it is the Government's firm intention that the new resources now available will similarly be used to good effect.  There is a heavy burden of responsibility on us to ensure that the expectations, which underlie the generous commitments of funding support from many foreign Governments, continue to be realised.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to say what the long term impact of the peace process will be for our tourism industry.  While an annual revenue increase of between £100 million and £450 million has been suggested for the whole island in the long term, I have no intention of committing myself to this higher figure.  I do, however, support the view that any level of increase will not happen as a matter of course.  It will require considerable effort on the part of us all.</P>
    <P>This Government has committed itself to that work by, providing additional marketing resources to sell Ireland and its weather-independent attractions overseas; investing in tourism plant to increase our capacity to cater at a high standard for larger numbers of visitors; improving the overall environment into which we invite our visitors; enhancing the customer care standards which we offer to our guests from overseas; and creating the structures to deliver these objectives on a cost-effective basis.</P>
    <P>The main funding vehicle for achieving these objectives is the operational programme for tourism which is forecast to deliver over £650 million in tourism investment by the turn of the century. This programme has been successfully launched and some 1,000 firm proposals for development have been received to date.  This denotes substantial confidence on the part of investors and the community at large in the future prospects of the industry.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1583" /> The new EU-funded INTERREG programme for Ireland and Northern Ireland has recently been launched and tourism in the six southern Border counties will benefit from some £10 million in EU funds over the next five years.  This should allay whatever fears Deputy Smith may have.  It is intended that some of these funds will support cross-Border regional marketing initiatives in order to help create new tourism business for the whole area.</P>
    <P>The forthcoming special support programme for peace and reconciliation will provide about £240 million in EU funds to support the peace process in Northern Ireland and the six southern Border counties.  It is intended that tourism development, both North and South, will be supported given its high propensity to create employment in the affected areas.  It is planned to secure Commission agreement to the programme by the end of July.</P>
    <P>Further funding from the International Fund for Ireland, the INTERREG programme and the special peace programme will all help to support tourism development in Northern Ireland and the six southern Border counties in the future.  Each of these funds has its own strategic priorities which have to be respected, but it is my conviction that tourism will offer the most visible and immediate evidence of hope for future economic and social development in the area.  My Department will be making every effort to ensure that the measures undertaken by these programmes will complement and support the overall tourism effort.</P>
    <P>Appropriate complementary measures, such as the new pilot scheme for traditional seaside resorts, will be introduced from time to time by the Government to assist the industry exploit its potential to the full at national level.  In short, every appropriate opportunity will be taken by the Government to develop tourism and to highlight to the wider international audience the tourism attractions of Ireland as a holiday destination.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1584" /> Peace in Northern Ireland has opened up opportunities for greater North-South tourism co-operation.  A number of initiatives, such as joint all-Ireland and regional marketing, have already been taken in the short period that has passed since the ceasefires.  The Government expects that it will prove possible in the years ahead to develop our relationships further to our mutual benefit.  We are committed to exploiting to the full the new circumstances which have been created and to maximising the benefit to be achieved from the resources available to both authorities in the coming years.</P>
    <P>On some of the points made by Deputy Andrews, it would not be appropriate for me to respond to the points made about the <i>modus operandi</i> of the Minister, Deputy Kenny, in terms of how he performs in his own constituency. That is a matter for the Minister. Given that the Deputy has tremendous experience in this House and is a lawyer by profession his references to crime against tourists left much to be desired. A number of initiatives have been taken including regular liaison between the Garda authorities, Bord Fáilte and other tourism interests in an effort to stamp out crime against tourists; the deployment of extra Garda patrols in areas of high tourist interest; the establishment of a Garda office in O'Connell Street which acts as a centre for advising tourists on safety measures; the distribution of safety leaflets in three languages and city maps produced by gardaí to tourists; increased level of foreign language training for gardaí: special provision in the Criminal Evidence Act, 1992 to enable tourist victims to make an immediate statement before a district justice which eliminates the necessity to attend the subsequent trial; action by gardaí against illegal traffic wardens; the setting up of a business watch scheme in Talbot Street which may be extended to Grafton Street and Mary Street in 1995. Further measures will be taken in 1995 by the Garda, Bord Fáilte and the tourism industry to propagate the stay safe message.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1585" /> Having regard to these measures I am disappointed the Deputy launched an attack on the Government and claimed it was inactive in tackling crime against tourists.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also referred to the efforts of Deputy McCreevy.  As a former chairman of the Select Committee on Enterprise and Economic Strategy, I am well aware that Deputy McCreevy was a competent Minister and give him credit for this.  While he was very much at home with all elements of his brief he agreed to a substantial reduction in the allocation in the Estimates for his Department and this calls for an explanation. As a result there is a cash shortage in the Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State knows his record on public service spending.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>One cannot call for the deployment of extra gardaí while criticising public expenditure.  That is a contradiction.  The Deputy cannot have the best of both worlds.</P>
      <P>The Deputy also said the Government was not doing enough for the tourism industry.  During the term of office of the previous Government of which my party was a member, a Minister of State was not assigned to the Department of Tourism and Trade.  I have specific responsibility for domestic tourism. In this regard perhaps my performance could be the subject of some criticism.</P>
      <P>I referred to cross-Border co-operation. For the first time in the history of this island tourism organisations, north and south of the Border, launched a campaign on mainland Europe.  I was happy to be in Holland when we launched a video to sell the island of Ireland as a tourist destination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to tax on restaurants and the condition of roads, that did not happen overnight.  Deputy Andrews also referred to the quality of answers, but that depends on the nature of the questioning. If relevant questions are not tabled one cannot respond in a positive <Col N="1586" /> way.  Perhaps Deputies have not asked sufficient questions.  I may be inviting trouble by saying that, but unless the questions are tabled we cannot respond to them.</P>
    <P>Deputy Doherty made an excellent contribution.  He is obviously very familiar with the tourism scene in his part of the country but he should not blame people for what he believes is the over-development of some areas such as the south-west region at the expense of other parts of the country.  The people in the south-west region where I reside took the initiative in developing their area.  Perhaps the product they have to offer is more attractive to tourists and there is greater accessibility by virtue of the fact that there are airports and ferry ports in the area, but it is not always easy to gain access to the west.  With the opening of airports in Knock and Farranfore there is now greater access to the west and Donegal.</P>
    <P>There has been a huge increase in the number of Northern and British registered cars coming here, which were not seen in great numbers in recent years.  I have every confidence that together with our colleagues in the North we will market this island as the prime tourist destination in Europe.  That is a difficult task but I have no doubt the determination is there to do so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. S. Ryan Mr. S. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my party colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy O'Sullivan, for sharing his time with me. I listened with great interest to the Minister's speech in which he outlined the actions the Government took to create a peace dividend in terms of tourism. Looking back at events of recent years I applaud the success of the present and previous Governments in contributing to the development of the peace process.  I recall last year hearing an item on the Gay Byrne radio show where Gay's representative, Joe Duffy, travelled to Northern Ireland with people from this part of the island who had never visited the North.  I took great heart from that programme as it illustated vividly that barriers are breaking <Col N="1587" /> down on all parts of this island.  All parties in this House have helped in their own way to silence the guns and break down the barriers.</P>
      <P>The Government has developed an agreed basis in the framework document for moving the peace process forward, based on the guiding principles of self-determination and consent, with Government by exclusively democratic and peaceful means and full respect and protection for the rights and traditions of the Unionist and Nationalist communities. As part of this process we have enlisted the active and vigorous support of the US Government and the European Union who generously contribute to secure a just and lasting peace on this island.  There have been many momentous achievements in a very short time.</P>
      <P>As a result of the peace process people living outside Ireland have reassesed their image of Ireland as a country to visit and in which to invest and do business.  It is no coincidence that in the period October 1994 to March 1995 the number of overseas visitors increased by 12.5 per cent compared with the same period a year earlier.  These figures are confirmed by personal experience.  The number of people passing through Dublin airport, which is in my constituency, is increasing dramatically every year. Almost seven million passengers passed through the airport in 1994 compared with 5.3 million in 1991.  The increase is so great that the capacity of the airport will have to be expanded in the coming years.  In the first three months of this year there was a 22 per cent increase in the number of passengers using the airport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is recognised by everyone involved in the tourism industry that additional accommodation is necessary.  Dublin Tourism in its plans identifies the need for an additional hotel in north Dublin. It is unacceptable that the Government to date has not sanctioned approval for a Great Southern Hotel at Dublin airport. Such a proposal was submitted by the board of Aer Rianta, and has for <Col N="1588" /> some time been under consideration in the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications.  Acceptance of that proposal would not undermine the future of the company.  As a TD for the area, I believe that this foot-dragging by the Government is totally unacceptable.</P>
    <P>Implementation of this proposal would provide 150 permanent jobs and meet the needs of the tourism industry. I share the view that if the idea emanated from the private sector the hotel would have been built when the proposal was first made more than two years ago.  I ask the Government to give the go ahead as a matter of urgency for this economically sound proposal. Hotels make a major contribution to wealth generation, and the north Dublin area needs wealth generation, particularly in view of the job losses.</P>
    <P>Whether by great foresight or otherwise, the decision of Irish Ferries and Stena Sealink to extend their services to Holyhead this year constitutes excellent timing as significant extra business can be expected, particularly from the British market, in the wake of the ceasefire. The forthcoming EU funded Ireland-Wales INTERREG programme will have a tourist dimension which will help promote traffic growth on the Irish Sea.</P>
    <P>The Dublin region benefits by more than £300 million in foreign exchange earnings every year.  The peace process offers great opportunities to increase this figure and create additional employment to provide services for visitors.</P>
    <P>Regarding the question of access, I am aware that Bord Fáilte and the Northern Ireland Tourist Board are encouraging more airlines to serve our airports on a regular basis.  That was a common objective at last week's conference in Washington and I hope success will be reported in that vital area in the short term.  Encouraging new carriers from our principal overseas markets will help to sustain the future growth of our tourism industry, will have beneficial effects for business, trade and tourism and will create many new jobs to serve additional visitors.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1589" /> Tourism has made a major contribution in providing sustainable employment and increased foreign earnings for the Exchequer.  The Operational Programme for Tourism 1994-99 aims to create a further 35,000 full-time jobs over the period of the programme, including 17,250 in direct tourism employment.  Given our achievements in the past seven years, that objective is achievable provided we sell our special product, that we are competitive and provide value for money.  We will not attract tourists for sunshine holidays, but we have a product which is becoming increasingly attractive to more foreign tourists.  I refer particularly to activity-type and special interest holidays, such as golfing, fishing, cycling, walking and visits to parklands and historic houses.  An added attraction here is peace, tranquility and a green environment.  We must build on that. Bord Fáilte has identified further growth potential for such holidays.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the excellent plans proposed and being implemented by Bórd Failte and various regional tourism organisations, there is a significant role for local community development in tourism.  I refer particularly to local tourism committees established in towns and villages throughout the country. They are working effectively to develop local tourism.  That potential should not be underestimated and should be actively encouraged.  A widely held view particularly in my constituency, is that further assistance is required to promote tourism potential at local level.  Surely assistance towards the production of brochures and marketing could be provided given that £650 million is available under the plan.</P>
    <P>I ask Bord Fáilte and Dublin Tourism not to concentrate solely on Dublin city &mdash; although that area should be addressed &mdash; and forget about the three new county council areas in which there is a population of over 500,000 and which have the necessary attributes to promote tourism.  They should give greater consideration to those areas.  I ask the Government when it reviews the <Col N="1590" /> renewal programme for seaside resorts to consider including some areas in my constituency as none is included under the present one.</P>
    <P>Coming from a constituency heavily dependent on Dublin Airport and the traffic which flows through it, I firmly support the Government in its continuing efforts to expand the tourism industry north and south of the Border.  I have no doubt the Minister of State, Deputy O'Sullivan, will deliver in this important area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">

      <P>Because of the short time available I will concentrate on what is now termed cultural tourism in my constituency of Clare.  There is now a general recognition that tourism and environmental interests can be aligned. As the House will know, the State has acquired 3,200 acres in the Burren to form the Burren National Park.  Valuable ecological and cultural assets is the basic prerequisite in assessing developmental opportunities.  The Burren has a wealth of historic and prehistoric monuments. It has field monuments dating from the earliest inhabitants 5,000 or more years ago.  There is a wealth of tombs, castles, houses and other monuments dating from the distant to the recent past.  There are about 120 known dolmens and wedge tombs, 500 stone forts, numerous early Christian churches, wells and medieval castles.</P>
      <P>Visitors to the Burren are often the more informed tourists.  There is a good mix of general, specialist and academic tourists taking an in-depth interest in the region.  That niche market should be developed along with conservation and preservation of our physical heritage. Along with the matchmaking festival in Lisdoonvarna, the music of Doolin, the holiday centres of Lahinch and Liscannor, the scenic beauty of the Cliffs of Moher and the heritage of Corofin, we must also develop tourism potential in the northern Burren along the coast which is internationally known for its rich repository of marine species.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ballykinvarga could rival Newgrange if excavation work was carried out and <Col N="1591" /> the site properly marketed.  Perhaps such an excavation as the one carried out in Mahawn Fort in Newmarket-on-Fergus under the discovery programme could be initiated.  Kilfenora must be given funding to promote its ecclesiastical heritage and tradition.  The presence of the cathedral and its famous high crosses could be promoted in such a way as to bring thousands of visitors to that village, thereby giving everyone an opportunity to appreciate our rich past and create much needed tourism for the Kilfenora area.</P>
    <P>I noted with interest the reply given by the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht to a question I tabled on 25 April last relating to the high crosses in Kilfenora.  The Minister stated that a survey of monuments in the Burren will be carried out shortly, that the crosses will be included in that and that any conservation work which may be required in relation to those crosses will be carried out in the light of the survey.</P>
    <P>The natural and man-made resource of the Burren is a tremendous cultural and economic one.  We need a co-ordinated approach with each area in the Burren being funded to promote and develop its strengths.  The whole area of folkore is sadly neglected in Ireland. Yet County Clare has a wealth of tradition not least in the Burren, waiting to be given proper recognition by funding from State agencies.  I take this opportunity to pay tribute to the Irish folk tradition summer school which meets annually in Lahinch and which has already recognised that need.  It is also necessary to promote folk music and I am aware there is a substantial move in the county to support a folk music centre in Ennis.  I hope the Minister will consider that possibility.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the organisers of the archaeological conference held annually in County Clare, of the Merriman summer school and of the Burren wild life symposium held each year in Fanore. Will the Minister convince his colleague, the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht that he should fight <Col N="1592" /> for world heritage site status for the Burren?  Our wealth of tradition, culture and heritage should not be just preserved, but put to the best possible use to create sustained employment in County Clare.</P>
    <P>On 25 April 1995 I tabled a question to the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht regarding Ennis Abbey and I am pleased that, under the operational programme for tourism, he committed £200,000 for a scheme of works for that abbey.  I am also pleased it is proposed to commence the project with a preliminary survey this year and to have it completed by 1999.  I hope the Minister can persuade the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht to guarantee further progress on Quin Abbey and that the present delays will be dealt with expeditiously to facilitate further tourism in the country.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Members should cast their minds back to 1987 when, after five years of inept Government, a minority Fianna Fáil Government came into office and faced serious difficulties with our national finances.  We set about restoring confidence in our economy by setting parameters within which we could live.  We identified tourism as an area of economic growth and from 1987 to 1994, while in Government, Fianna Fáil placed major emphasis on its development. Some of those involved in channelling resources into tourism marketing, management and promotion did not maximise their efforts for the benefit of the country.  The political leadership of the past six or seven years which culminated in the cessation of violence in Northern Ireland in 1994, with private sector commitment, placed us in a unique position.  No previous Government, Minister or State agency had been <Col N="1593" /> presented with such an opportunity to maximise economic development and growth for the benefit of our people.  I am disappointed at the Government's decisions on investment in tourism infrastructure.  I fail to understand why it does not recognise that we are an island nation, peripheral to many parts of the world, with inclement weather conditions and that we must provide tourism amenities and facilities.</P>
    <P>While in Government Fianna Fáil used the Office of Public Works to develop our heritage, ecological and natural resources.  For many years Germans have enjoyed the facility of the River Shannon.  National parks in Killarney, Glenveagh, Connemara and elsewhere have been developed.  It should not be possible for small groups of people, aided and abetted by international so-called environmentalists, to persuade a Government to deny parts of the country European Union resources for facilities crucial to tourism development.  We all know the decisions in regard to the Wicklow and Burren national parks.  We have been allocated £20 million under the national development plan and £650 million under the operational programme for tourism. Additional initiatives under INTERREG and the international fund for Ireland can ensure that badly needed tourism facilities are put in place.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Government to be positive, to consider the island in its totality and not deny our people facilities that can attract thousands of foreign tourists who could make a vital economic contribution to the well-being of the nation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnEllis" hpid="Mr. Ellis Mr. Ellis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity to highlight some of the problems experienced by our tourism industry. From a tourism point of view this country could be one of the best in the world. We do not have environmental problems and we have many lakes, inland waterways, mountains and woods, but many of our amenities have not been developed.  A number of developments, <Col N="1594" /> however, have come to fruition in recent years.  The Shannon-Erne link has brought a new lease of life to County Leitrim which, as a tourism destination, was badly deprived for many years.</P>
      <P>For the past 25 years tourism suffered badly in Border counties.  I was not surprised to hear the Minister state that the south-west developed at a much faster rate than the northern area.  Many people believed that terrorists operated in the north-west and other areas along the Border.  The Government now has an opportunity to develop those areas of great scenic beauty and its emphasis on all Ireland rather than Border regions at the Washington Conference last week is regrettable.  The north-west region provides many great tourism amenities.  It is one of the best areas in the country for coarse and game fishing and the people of the area, with mainly their own resources, have developed marketable tourism products.  However, if the area is to reach its full tourism potential further Government expenditure is necessary.</P>
      <P>The tourism potential of our waterways is beyond doubt.  Cruiser tourism, which abounds in the north-west, attracts high spending tourists, but I accept that those who hitch around the country are entitled to proper accommodation as well as those who can afford to pay £1,500 per week for a cruising holiday.  Every spectrum of our tourism market should be developed. Those interested in hill walking will be aware that the Yorkshire Moors facilitates 15 million to 17 million people per annum, but people are now objecting to the damage being done to the paths in the area.  We now have a major opportunity to grasp that market.</P>
      <P>Very few of our much talked about archaeological sites have been developed to their full potential and it was a retrograde step by the Government to decide to abandon the Burren and Luggala projects.  In tourism terms, that was an abdication of responsibility to provide facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Lack of investment has hindered the <Col N="1595" /> tourism industry, particularly in the northern half of the country.  Deputy Ryan talked about an additional hotel in north County Dublin but that area can well provide hotel accommodation without the need for major grant assistance as there are enough people in that area for it to develop.</P>
    <P>In some of the more remote areas, there is a need for additional incentives with regard to the provision of tourist accommodation, hotels, self-catering facilities, bed and breakfast premises or hostels.  It is now falling to some of the county enterprise boards to fund such developments because Bord Fáilte and other tourist organisations will not fund them.  I attended a county enterprise board meeting yesterday which agreed to fund a hostel, which should have been funded by Bord Fáilte or another State agency.</P>
    <P>Ireland has a niche in the tourism market, namely, our green image.  It is our responsibility to provide the people wishing to holiday here with every facility but reductions in marketing budgets will not help to spread the word about our green image.  The Government must provide sufficient funds to market the product being provided by our hoteliers, bed and breakfast owners and the owners of self-catering accommodation. They need Government assistance to ensure that their own personal investments result in full benefits for this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy to contribute to this important debate.  Every so often we see headlines in our newspapers about millions of pounds becoming available to the Border counties for tourism and other areas of development from the International Fund for Ireland, EU Structural Funds, etc.  However, as my colleagues pointed out, there is invariably a sting in the tail which involves matching funds either from the Exchequer, local authorities or the private sector.  Over the years, we have also seen lists of allocations from the national lottery for a variety of worthy <Col N="1596" /> projects throughout the country, but I wonder how many of those projects have got off the ground because they too are allocated funding on the understanding that the remaining necessary funds must be raised locally.</P>
      <P>The same principle applies to many projects involving tourism.  If we cannot come up with matching funds for various projects, there is a danger that much of the money from the IFI, Brussels, the United States and elsewhere will not be forthcoming.  At the recent Washington Conference, the EC Commissioner made a valid point when she stated that unless something is done about the matching funds, the majority of the funding allocated will be unused.</P>
      <P>My main concern is about my own county which I believe has been the Cinderella area of this State since its foundation.  An accident of history placed Donegal virtually in no-man'sland, surrounded by the Atlantic on one side and, until recently, six Army garrisons and the Border on the other.  For a long time many people in the South actually believed that Donegal was one of the Six Counties.  There can be no doubt, however, that it is one of the most spectacularly beautiful places in Europe but, from a tourism point of view, it is also one of the least developed areas.  This may be welcome to a handful of people who like to wander about in complete solitude but it does not provide for the type of employment the county so badly needs. There is little point in setting up regional tourism boards unless they are adequately funded.</P>
      <P>As my colleagues said, there are wonderful amenities in Donegal.  I also make the point that there are more anglers in the UK than football supporters.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Glashaboy (Cork) Ozone Pollution Alert.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for enabling me to raise this <Col N="1597" /> important issue in the Dáil this evening. I thank the Minister for Justice, Deputy Owen, for taking the first available opportunity, on the part of any Government Minister, to address the serious issue that has arisen over the past weekend. I refer to the issuing of Ireland's first ozone pollution warning at Glashaboy, a rural area outside Cork city, last Saturday.  At 11 a.m. it was first detected that the safety limits established by the Environmental Protection Agency in relation to ozone levels were breached. Accordingly, an alert was issued by the meteorological station at 11 a.m. and this continued at intervals until 4 p.m.</P>
      <P>Glashaboy is situated seven miles east of Cork city.  If the limits were breached in this non-urban area, it is reasonable and logical to conclude that the levels in the city centre, with its higher density to traffic, must also have been breached and, therefore, would have been more injurious to health.  The warning in question indicated that the young, the old and people suffering from respiratory ailments of any kind should remain indoors and should not go outdoors for the duration of the health warning.</P>
      <P>Because of a low level of environmental awareness, the warnings went largely unheard and, therefore, largely unheeded.  A spokesperson for the Department of the Environment, when questioned by a journalist from <i>The Cork Examiner,</i> explained that there was no need for over-reaction and that unless people suffered from asthma or other respiratory type ailments, there was no danger for their health.</P>
      <P>Over half the children in this country suffer from asthma and it is bordering on negligence to conclude that a potentially serious health hazard is not looming. Properly located ozone pollution monitoring stations should be put in place immediately in Cork city and in the immediate environment.  At present, Cork Corporation tests only for sulphur dioxide and smoke particles in the air. It does not test for ozone pollution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Minister to ensure that this matter is attended to and rectified urgently.  Immediate steps must be <Col N="1598" /> taken by the Department of the Environment to investigate the substances that lead to ozone pollution with a view to introducing measures that would significantly reduce the levels of these substances, thereby protecting the health of our people, young and old.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen) Nora Owen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen)</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Deputy McManus, I am glad of this opportunity to respond to the concerns prompted by last weekend's occurrence of higher than usual concentrations of ozone in the Cork city area.</P>
      <P>I should first explain that ground level ozone is the result of a chemical reaction between nitrogen oxides, mainly from vehicles and power generation, and volatile organic compounds, mainly from vehicles and solvents.  It represents a well identified form of air pollution, and in sufficiently high concentrations can seriously affect respiration by human beings, animals and plants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ground level ozone as an air pollutant is not yet well understood as better known pollutants such as smoke, sulphur dioxide and lead, for which air quality standards have already been fixed at national and EU level.  Deputy Quill rightly adverted to the fact that people are not aware of ozone pollution. An EU directive of 1992 accordingly determined that an ozone monitoring regime should be established in all member states.  This would provide detailed information on the nature and scale of ozone pollution as a preparation for the fixing of air quality standards. Irish participation in this ozone monitoring programme commenced this year.  Six monitoring stations have been established at Dublin, Cork, Galway, Monaghan, Wicklow and Kilkenny.  The precise location of these monitors was determined in accordance with EU requirements on the placement of such equipment.  The amount of ozone present in city areas is generally reduced by complex reactions with nitrogen oxides, so that the highest ozone levels are to be found away from built-up <Col N="1599" /> areas with heavy traffic.  Consequently, locating monitors in inner city areas, as has been suggested, could be expected to give rise to lower reported ozone levels than those from existing monitoring locations.</P>
    <P>The EU monitoring programme has a public information dimension in that it fixes two different thresholds for the release of information to the public about ozone pollution.  The first is, where the level of 90 parts of ozone per billion of air is exceeded on an average hourly basis, notice is given to susceptible sections of the public &mdash; the old, the very young and those with respiratory conditions &mdash; to avoid unaccustomed physical exercise and, where possible, remain indoors for the duration of the ozone episode.  The second is that a further threshold can be activated by a level of ozone exceeding 180 parts per billion, and in this event a similar notice is given to the public at large.</P>
    <P>The first and lower of these thresholds was exceeded in the Cork city area, as the Deputy said, for two brief periods on Saturday 27 May and Sunday 28 May.  This resulted in the Meteorology Office issuing the first of the notifications which I have described.  The highest ozone value monitored on 27 May was 98 parts per billion and on 28 May was 112 parts per billion.  I can assure the House that the lower threshold represents very much a precautionary level in terms of any impact on human health.  The public information notice associated with this threshold should not be regarded as an alarm but as a practical suggestion which susceptible sections of the public may wish to follow in a sensible way.</P>
    <P>An unusual aspect of these episodes was that they occurred during parts of the day and in climatic conditions where ground level ozone formation to the levels registered would not have been expected.  Sunlight and an air temperature of at least 20ºC to 22ºC are normally required to create ozone pollution. Given the unusual nature of the <Col N="1600" /> episode the Department of the Environment has asked the Environmental Protection Agency to investigate the matter and to seek an explanation for the Cork monitoring results given the indications against local ozone formation in these cases.</P>
    <P>The Government is committed to taking all measures necessary to address ozone and any other form of air pollution. We need first to understand the dimensions and causes of the problem. That is the purpose of the systematic monitoring which is taking place in Ireland and throughout the EU.  Further monitoring of the situation will tell us more clearly whether ozone levels of serious proportions can be expected in Ireland, and whether the problem is primarily of national or transboundary origin. Responses to the problem must be based on this information.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Deputy that we will pursue these questions actively and diligently in the wake of the Cork experience.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to raise this important topic.  The position in relation to the verdict of guilty but insane is grossly unsatisfactory. This was graphically illustrated recently in the Gallagher case.  In that case, as I recall, two committees appointed by the Minister for Justice took the view that the prisoner had not recovered sufficiently to re-enter society.  The inspector of mental hospitals took a different view and then subsequently reversed his decision.  This did little to inspire public confidence. Public confidence could hardly have been restored by the fact that the initial report from the inspector of mental hospitals described the prisoner as recovered while another report immediately afterwards from the same source stated the prisoner had not recovered. One can hardly be surprised that the public is bewildered and the victim's <Col N="1601" /> family has suffered and is suffering extreme trauma and distress.</P>
      <P>Legal history shows that mistakes have been made in the past in this area, often with devastating consequences.  In one celebrated case in the United Kingdom in the early 1960s, a person who by his own admission poisoned quite a few people was adjudged guilty but insane and spent considerable time in a hospital for the criminally insane. On his discharge an eminent psychiatrist not only pronounced him &ldquo;recovered&rdquo; but gave him a letter of recommendation for employment.  The psychiatrist's professional opinion was that he had made an &ldquo;extremely full recovery&rdquo; and &ldquo;that he was above average intelligence&rdquo;. A few years later the person who had made that &ldquo;extremely full recovery&rdquo; was found guilty of poisoning two other people and attempting to poison two more.</P>
      <P>The question that arises in this type of case is whether psychiatrists should have such a central role in saving those convicted of some of the most horrendous crimes from due process of law and transferring them to State run institutions for the so-called criminally insane.  It has been argued, and in my view rightly, that the psychiatrists' role in such matters must be limited to helping those who are overtly psychotic. When psychiatrists get involved in grey areas such as personality disorder and immature personality they do so, not only at their own peril, but at the peril of society as a whole.  There is already sufficient violent crime without releasing into society other violent criminals who may have recovered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To say the law is in a state of confusion is a charitable understatement. What is the status of a report made by a committee which the Minister for Justice can appoint from time to time to check whether somebody has recovered? Is the Minister bound by its recommendations or can she ignore them?  What is the position if the inspector of mental hospitals disagrees with the report of the committee appointed <Col N="1602" /> by the Minister for Justice?  Is the position different if the inspector of mental hospitals reports as a result of a specific request by the Minister for Health?  A recent Supreme Court decision would seem to suggest that it is.  All these legitimate questions, neatly avoided in the Gallagher case, still remain and must be answered.</P>
    <P>The ultimate solution to this problem is new legislation allowing for the defence of diminished responsibility. That legislation has been promised for almost two decades and all Governments during the past two decades must take some share of responsibility for that fact.  Such legislation would enable the State to contain dangerous convicted criminals within the prison system rather than in mental hospitals at the State's pleasure.  It would avoid the potentially lethal consequences of these people &ldquo;recovering&rdquo; at the whim of some psychiatrist.  Such legislation must be introduced as an urgent priority as its introduction would enable us to sleep easier.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this question.  The Deputy has acknowledged that there was a need for some considerable time to update the laws on insanity.  That need has existed for a great deal longer than my short time in office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Proposals for the amendment and updating of our criminal insanity laws are at an advanced stage of preparation in my Department. Deputies will appreciate that at this stage it would not be appropriate for me to give specific details of the proposed legislation. However, certain issues are being examined in the context of the legislation. These include the procedures for determining the release of &ldquo;guilty but insane&rdquo; persons.  Other matters which are being considered in that context are fitness to plead at a criminal trial, a possible change in the verdict of &ldquo;guilty but insane&rdquo;, the introduction of a right of appeal against such verdicts, the definition of criminal insanity and the <Col N="1603" /> possibility of introducing &ldquo;guilty with diminished responsibility&rdquo; as a criminal verdict.</P>
    <P>There is a number of reports both here and in the United Kingdom on the question of criminal insanity.  The third interim report on the interdepartmental committee on mentally ill and maladjusted persons, often referred to as the Henchy Committee, is one of the most comprehensive and contains many detailed recommendations.  The issues in question have been the subject of considerable debate in the United States and other countries.  We have, therefore, the benefit of a considerable body of research and recommendations to enable us reach proper and informed conclusions, although there seems to be no universally agreed solution in other jurisdictions to the problems in question. It is my intention that suitable amending legislation will be introduced in this area as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>There are 22 guilty but insane patients in the Central Mental Hospital at any time.  Over the years a small number of such patients would have been transferred, with the approval of the Minister for Justice, from the Central Mental Hospital to their local psychiatric hospital.  These approvals would have followed detailed submissions from the Central Mental Hospital authorities and a review by Department staff who would have consulted the Garda in the matter.</P>
    <P>Other persons detained in the Central Mental Hospital who come under my responsibility include prisoners transferred to the hospital for treatment either voluntarily, under section 17 (6) of the Criminal Justice Administration Act, 1914 as adapted, or by certification of two doctors, under section 13 of the Lunatic Asylums (Ireland) Act, 1875 as adapted and extended by the Criminal Justice Act, 1960.  There are about 30 such persons detained at any one time in the Central Mental Hospital.</P>
    <P>Persons found by a jury to be unfit to plead by reason of insanity are ordered <Col N="1604" /> by the court to be detained in the Central Mental Hospital under the terms of section 17 of the Lunatics (Ireland) Act, 1821 until they have recovered.  There are only about half a dozen such patients at any one time.</P>
    <P>Of course, there are patients in the Central Mental Hospital who are there under the terms of mental health legislation who do not come under my responsibility.  The Deputy referred to reports by the mental health inspector. He is answerable to the Department of Health.</P>
    <P>Regarding the specific category of persons found guilty but insane to which the Deputy referred, the Supreme Court decided on 12 February 1991 in the case of the Director of Public Prosecutions <i>v.</i> John Gallagher that, if and when a person detained pursuant to section 2 (2) of the Trial of Lunatics Act, 1883, i.e. a person found guilty but insane, seeks to secure their release from detention, he or she may apply to the Executive, in the person of the Government or the Minister for Justice, for release on the grounds that they are no longer suffering from any mental disorder warranting their continued detention in the public and private interests and the Executive must inquire into all the relevant circumstances using fair and constitutional procedures.</P>
    <P>To ensure that each case was given the consideration required by the Supreme Court decision, an advisory committee, comprising a senior counsel, of not less than ten years' standing, as chairperson, a consultant psychiatrist and a general practitioner, was set up by the then Minister to consider and advise on such applications.  For legal reasons, the committee is so constituted as to make it independent of the Minister and the Department.</P>
    <P>The terms of reference of the advisory committee are as follows:</P>
    <P>To advise the Minister for Justice as to whether or not the applicant is suffering from any mental disorder warranting his continued detention in the public and private interests <Col N="1605" /> (including the question of whether he would be a potential danger to any member of the public if released) having regard to any relevant information, material or submissions as may be tendered to or come to the notice of the Committee, including any information, material, or submissions tendered by or on behalf of the applicants.</P>
    <P>I should emphasise that its functions are purely advisory and that the power of decision in each case remains with the Executive.  Final decisions are taken in the light of all circumstances including the advice of the committee and the question of possible danger to the public.</P>
    <P>I am advised that powers of temporary and conditional release for persons found &ldquo;guilty but insane&rdquo; are available to me under the terms of the Trial of Lunatics Act, 1883.  These powers are used to grant short periods of accompanied or unaccompanied parole for such persons as part of their treatment and at the request of the authorities at the Central Mental Hospital.  I assure Deputies that the same stringent guidelines outlined above are taken into account by me when assessing such applications.</P>

      <P>I thank the Chair for allowing me raise this matter.  The findings of the Mountjoy visiting committee's report 1994 should not surprise us. All visiting committees have said much the same for some years.  We owe them and other committees a debt of gratitude for highlighting the often appalling conditions in prisons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The committee addressed two major issues, the drugs problem and the physical conditions obtaining in Mountjoy.  It is estimated that up to one-fifth of Mountjoy's daily prison population are hardened drug addicts and have regular and unrestrained access to hard drugs in the prison.  Unfortunately that confirms what many of us have long suspected. <Col N="1606" /> What is most disturbing is the report's conclusion that a complete absence of drugs could make Mountjoy unmanageable. The report states:</P>
    <P>It is about time the notion was dismissed that prisoners resort to drugs for fun trips.  Many need them to keep at bay the sinking, agonising despair in which they find themselves in Mountjoy.</P>
    <P>They also need drugs to feed their habit.</P>
    <P>The visiting committee does not recommend drugs as a palliative but recognises the hard and unpalatable reality of life in prison.  In the face of that, the committee came to the inescapable conclusion that methadone maintenance programmes should be provided for incarcerated drug addicts similar to those operating in the outside community.  During a recent Adjournment debate I raised the need for a comprehensive methadone maintenance programme in prisons.  The Minister pointed out that a number of staff and infrastructural support arrangements would have to be put in place and stated that it was not envisaged that methadone maintenance would be provided for all prisoners who are drug addicts. They would have to be on a programme in the community.</P>
    <P>I question the wisdom of this approach.  I recognise the constraints under which the Minister is working and the seriousness with which she views the problem.  However, I am baffled by the approach.  Prisoners are being told that if they do not deal with their problem in the community they will not receive help in prison.</P>
    <P>Hundreds of addicts are attempting to deal with their problem and there are huge waiting lists for programmes in the community.  Prisons should be places of treatment as well as containment.  While I recognise the concern that, if given access to methadone programmes, prisoners may simply substitute one drug for another, under controlled circumstances the risk of such substitution is relatively minor.  I hope the Minister <Col N="1607" /> will take on board the visiting committee's recommendations.</P>
    <P>The fundamental issue is not how do we deal with the drugs problem but why it arose.  Drugs are not an inevitable accompaniment to prison life.  Although 70 per cent of those incarcerated in Limerick Prison were convicted of drug related offences, the drugs problem in that prison is negligible.  Several prisoners in Mountjoy sought a transfer to Limerick Prison in order to escape the drug culture which prevails in Mountjoy.  The root cause of the drugs problem in Mountjoy can be found in the sinking, agonising despair which many prisoners experience in the ironically nicknamed &ldquo;the Joy&rdquo;.  Much of that despair is caused by the appalling conditions in which the prisoners are contained. There is inadequate medical attention, scanty sanitary facilities, overcrowding and lack of proper employment, in short, conditions that are Dickensian.</P>
    <P>The 1994 Mountjoy Visiting Committee once again highlighted the appalling conditions in Mountjoy Prison.  In the past these reports made headlines for a week before they were left to gather dust on shelves in the Minister's office. On this occasion, I have every confidence the Minister will take action.</P>
    <P>There is an urgent need to place prisons within a modern statutory framework. There should be legally enforceable minimum prison conditions and prison rules and codes of conduct must be on a statutory basis.  Prisons must be removed from the sole authority of the Minister and placed under an independent prison board mandated to monitor the implementation of relevant legislation and to which prisoners could have swift and unbureaucratic recourse in the case of complaints.</P>
    <P>The visiting committee has done its job extremely well and the ball is now firmly in the Minister's court.  I urge her to address prison reform and to introduce the necessary legislation as a matter of urgency.  I know her response will <Col N="1608" /> be well considered, humane and practical.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the points made by Deputy Byrne about the Mountjoy Visiting Committee and the other visiting committee which do much valuable work in prisons.  This is not always the easiest of tasks and it is only right and proper that we thank the Mountjoy Visiting Committee for its report and the other committees.</P>
      <P>I received the 1994 report on 23 May. It is perhaps the longest report furnished by a visiting committee.  I am considering its contents and will consult in the matter with my officials, the governor of the prison and the visiting committee.</P>
      <P>The committee states that there are up to 130 hardened drug users in the prison at any one time and its has its own in-house supply network.  It also calls for an improvement in treatment facilities for addicts, including the introduction of methadone maintenance programmes.  I have already acknowledged that there is a significant drug problem in some of our prisons, particularly Mountjoy, and I would not dispute the committee's estimate that there are approximately 130 addicts or approximately 20 per cent of the daily average population in the prison.</P>
      <P>One of the reasons there is not the same movement of drugs in Limerick is that there is a huge movement of prisoners in and out of Mountjoy Prison every day and week.  These prisoners may be on remand, going to court, on temporary release, going to hospital or getting treatment.  There are, therefore, enormous opportunities open to prisoners to bring drugs in and out of the prison.  However, I am not aware of any evidence of a supply network in the prison, as alleged by the visiting committee, and I hope that any hard information it has to this effect will be made available immediately to the prison authorities.  The report did not make clear how it came on this information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of methadone maintenance for prisoners.  I can confirm that <Col N="1609" /> I intend to introduce facilities to provide continuance on methadone maintenance for offenders who come into prison while already conforming to all the disciplines required of them on a maintenance programme.  This is the point at which we will introduce methadone treatment for the people already on it. The Deputy's suggestions on how to improve the availability of methadone treatment to other prisoners are very valid.  Two new options are now under active consideration for the management of drug dependent offenders in Mountjoy Prison.  These are the creation of a detoxification facility in the medical care unit in the prison which will help prisoners to come off drugs completely and ensure they do not become dependent on methadone, and the establishment of a high security drug free unit where prisoners who are either drug free when they enter prison or who become drug free and want to remain so will be incarcerated.  A wide range of new security measures have recently been approved by me to prevent as far as possible the smuggling of drugs to prisoners. This includes a new search room where prisoners are searched properly after visits for their own safety.  At present, such searches take place in the corridor and I want to ensure that there is a facility where prisoners can be searched and drugs taken from them.</P>
    <P>Chapter 8 of the visiting committee's report deals with overcrowding in Mountjoy and alleges that previous submissions on this topic have been ignored.  This is not true as those familiar with the five year plan for the management of offenders will know.  Over 200 new prison spaces will be created over the next two years with the building of the new female prison and the new male adult prison at Castlerea.  It is also intended to reduce the pressure on Mountjoy and other institutions by a carefully planned programme of positive sentence management allied to an increased reliance on community sanctions and measures.  In addition, the feasibility of a separate remand facility is being examined at present by a joint <Col N="1610" /> Department/Governor Working Group. The steady increase in committals in recent years, which was highlighted by the committee, is acknowledged.  It reflects the level of crime in the community and the action of the courts in imposing custodial sentences on offenders and of the Garda in catching the offenders.</P>
    <P>Places for 150 adult male offenders will be provided at Castlerea.  County Roscommon.  Construction of the prison perimeter wall and associated works is under way and the main construction of the complex is planned to commence later this year.  Accommodation for up to 60 female offenders will be provided in a new purpose designed stand-alone facility to be located on a Department of Justice site at Cowley Place beside Mountjoy Prison.  Planning for this new prison, which is being overseen by an expert steering group comprised of prison management, departmental officials, Office of Public Works architects and representatives of women's interest groups is well advanced, and construction works are due to commence later this year.  All of these measures will help to alleviate the pressure on accommodation in Mountjoy Prison and I hope they will lead to an acknowledgment in next year's report that some action has been taken on overcrowding.</P>
    <P>Other issues raised by the committee include the lack of work and training facilities for prisoners.  The five year plan provides for an expansion in the number and quality of such services over the next few years.  I recently visited the prison to see the facilities and I hope to be in a position to open more of them.  The committee also expressed concern about the physical infrastructure of the prison, with particular reference to sanitation and hygiene.  I am committed to the continuation of the already well advanced programme of refurbishment which will include in-cell sanitation in all cells.  The committee has acknowledged some of the more recent improvements at the prison, including the new kitchen, auditorium and modern bakery.  I will send Deputy <Col N="1611" /> Byrne an invitation to the opening of these facilities so that he can see them at first hand.  Mountjoy Prison is more than 100 years old and its physical limitations cannot be put right overnight. Much positive work has been done there in recent years and much more is in the pipeline.</P>
    <P>Many of the other points raised in the report will require careful consideration and expert professional advice will be needed in regard to medical services, <Col N="1612" /> etc.  The visiting committee has been somewhat vague in its criticisms of the medical facilities and my Department will endeavour to clarify its concerns in this respect.</P>
    <P>As in the case of the annual reports of all visiting committees, the contents of the Mountjoy committee's report will be given careful consideration and action will be taken where I deem it necessary, appropriate and feasible.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.20 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 31 May 1995.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor) Mervyn Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 20 and 61 together.</P>
      <P>The Government is conscious of the need for child care facilities for parents with family responsibilities to enable them participate in the employment market and is committed to the stimulation of the development of such facilities by employers, parents and community interests.</P>
      <P>Responsibility for the various aspects of child care resides with a number of Ministers.  However I am happy to report progress consequent on the publication of the working group's report.</P>
      <P>Arising from the publication of the report my Department undertook interdepartmental consultations with all Government Departments responsible for particular policies and action areas covered by the recommendations in the report.  In particular, in view of the timescale imposed by the Community Support Framework these contacts targeted the need for the development of actions to be taken under the National Development Plan.  In addition, early action was taken to get child care projects up and running.</P>
      <P>Last year I set up a scheme of funding in my Department to assist in the development of a number of pilot child care projects in disadvantaged areas. Under this pilot scheme grant assistance is provided for new and innovative child care projects with strong local participation and in particular for partnerships between employers and community groups.  An allocation of £1 million of Exchequer funds has been approved by my Department to date for a total of 75 projects under this scheme.  This initiative will enable those with family responsibilities to undertake education, training, retraining and employment opportunities which they would otherwise be unable to aspire to in the absence of a child care facility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, my colleague the Minister for Education, has recently introduced the Early Start Pre-school Project for children in eight locations.  The project is aimed at enhancing the overall <Col N="1408" /> development of pre-school children so as to prevent school failure and offset the effects of social disadvantage.</P>
    <P>In line with the National Development Plan, I have been concerned to ensure, in conjunction with my colleague the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, that training and employment programmes run under the Community Support Framework receive significant assistance towards the development of child care facilities. Under the operational programme for human resources development 1994-99, An Foras Áiseanna Saothair, FÁS, has made considerable provision for the training and development of child care practitioners.  A sum of £1.264 million has been allocated to child care training, including training for the development of managers of child care facilities; a further £200,000 is allocated under the management training for women programme to upgrade child care workers in the management of child care facilities.</P>
    <P>In order to encourage flexible working arrangements for public sector employees with family responsibilities, and in accordance with the undertaking in the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i>, my Department wrote to all public sector employers requesting them to introduce progressive policies of equal opportunities to ensure that the existing pattern of inequality within the public sector is effectively redressed. The <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> also highlights the question of job potential of child care services and this matter is currently being examined by the Central Review Committee of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i>.  In addition, the NESF recently reported on the job potential of the services sector in Ireland.  In the context of this report the forum made a number of recommendations on the provision of child care services.  These recommendations broadly mirror those included in the report of the working group on childcare facilities for working parents.</P>
    <P>The question of the stutory regulation <Col N="1409" /> of minimum standards of child care and the supervision and inspection of such facilities is a matter for my colleague the Minister for Health.  Part VII of the Child Care Act, 1991 provides for the regulation and supervision of such services and this Government is committed to the implementation of the Act not later than 1996.</P>
    <P>I am continuing to review developments in this area so that progress can be made on other appropriate aspects of the working group's report and the relevant <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> commitments concerned.  Given the partnership approach envisaged by both the working group and in the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i>, the further progress required will continue to depend on effective social partner participation with community and State sector interests.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor)</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to Questions on 31 January 1995 I set out in detail the strategy of the Government in relation to children.  Under its Programme of Renewal the Government is committed to dealing with a range of matters affecting children.  It is committed to the rapid implementation of the provisions of the Child Care Act having regard to the resources, training and staff that will be required.  A Minister of State to specifically co-ordinate key areas has been appointed with special responsibility for all aspects relating to child care and children's policy, particularly the implementation of the Child Care Act, for special education, and for the proposed Children Bill aimed at updating the law dealing with young offenders.  Other areas of the law affecting the welfare of children, including adoption, guardianship and child sexual abuse are also to be assessed under the Government's programme with a view to being updated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1412" /> The position regarding children under our laws as they stand is of special importance and constitutional and statutory provisions and administrative policies reflect that.  My Department's responsibilities concern the civil law aspects as distinct from the criminal law aspects which are the responsibility of the Department of Justice and the child care and health aspects which are the responsibility of the Department of Health.  As regards the civil law aspects, the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964 provides the very important principle that any court in deciding questions relating to children shall regard the welfare of the child as the first and paramount consideration.  The civil law in relation to children has been updated and developed on a systematic basis in recent years and we have a body of law that is comparable with the best in other countries.  Important provisions in relation to children have been provided for in the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act, 1976, the Family Law (Protection of Spouses and Children) Act, 1981, the Status of Children Act, 1987, the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act, 1989 and the Child Abduction and Enforcement of Court Orders Act, 1991.</P>
    <P>I initiated the Bill which led to the Maintenance Act, 1994.  It enables the State to ratify a European Union and a United Nations convention to assist persons in the recovery of maintenance abroad.  Arrangements are being made by the Department of Foreign Affairs to have those conventions ratified.</P>
    <P>The Family Law Bill, 1994, which I also initiated and is before the Seanad having been passed by this House, has important provisions in relation to maintenance of children, raises the age of marriage from 16 to 18 years and, where family law proceedings in the courts are concerned, puts the reporting role of the health boards and welfare officers on a statutory footing.  A Bill to strengthen the law on domestic violence will be published in the very near future.</P>
    <P>The extensive provisions which already exist in our laws in relation to <Col N="1413" /> children are, being reviewed and they will be updated as necessary under the Government's Programme of Renewal. The Government will, in addition, look forward to contributions from the recently established Joint Committee on the Family which, as Members of the House will be aware, has been asked under its terms of reference to deal in particular with the question of the protection and enhancement of the interests of children.</P>

      <P>The cost to date of publications initiated by the Department of Foreign Affairs since December 1994 amounts to £50,284.  This includes the publication of 140,000 copies of the Framework Document at a cost of £35,145.  Other publications include the Diplomatic List and a number of information fact sheets on various aspects of Ireland for distribution by our embassies abroad.</P>
      <P>In addition to the costs indicated above, publications which were initiated before December 1994 but which will be paid from the 1995 budget include the 45th report of developments in the European Union published in March 1995.  While the final cost remains to be established, it is estimated to be in order of £1,200.  A new edition of Facts about Ireland was launched on 18 May 1995 and a total of 20,000 copies were printed.  The costs of the publication in 1994 and to date in 1995 are £85,588.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only publication initiated since 16 December 1994 by the Office of the Tánaiste was the Interim Report of the Task Force on Long-term Unemployment which was published on 7 March 1995.  Two thousand copies of the report <Col N="1414" /> were printed at a cost of £7,980.  A portion of this cost is recoverable from moneys received from sales to the public through Government Publication Sales Office.  However this figure will not be known until after the end of 1995.  It is also planned to publish the final report of the task force before the end of 1995.  However, it is not possible at this stage to provide an estimate of the likely cost of this report.</P>

      <P>The Government Departments involved in the co-ordination, documentation and preparation of the case which was presented to the White House Conference for Trade and Investment in Ireland, which took place in Washington last week, were the Departments of the Taoiseach, Foreign Affairs, Finance, Enterprise and Employment, Tourism and Trade, Agriculture, Food and Forestry and the Environment.  The State agencies involved included the IDA, An Bord Tráchtála, Forbairt, FÁS, An Bord Bia, Bord Fáilte, Aer Rianta, Aer Lingus and Údarás na Gaeltachta.</P>
      <P>Government Ministers and officials and the State agencies utilised the conference to emphasise the attractions of investment in the six Border counties. In addition, material which highlighted these opportunities was contributed to a strategic overview paper which the US organisers prepared and which formed part of the conference documentation. Separate documentation circulated by the Irish Government delegation included an attractive promotional package produced by the IDA which highlighted the benefits of investment in the Border counties.</P>

      <P>A study carried out by the Central IT Services &mdash; CITS &mdash; of my Department over the last three months addressed, <i>inter alia,</i> the provision of Internet services, on a reliable and secure basis, to Government Departments and offices. The study recommends that Internet services should be made available to all Government Departments and offices, including Leinster House, but that, in order to maintain the security of computer systems within the Civil Service, access should be provided through a single access point.  A number of interconnected computers, collectively known as a &ldquo;firewall&rdquo;, at this access point, through which all traffic to and from the Internet would pass, would <Col N="1416" /> enable the highest available levels of security to be implemented.  The &ldquo;firewall&rdquo; would provide facilities to ensure that external Internet users could not access computerised information systems intended for internal use within individual Departments and offices. Because of the resources which would be required to keep the necessary security measures up-to-date, the study recommends that the firewalling service be provided by a specialist service provider in this area.</P>
      <P>The study findings and recommendations are currently being considered with a view to an early decision being taken on providing access to the Internet. The costs of providing access to Internet services, however, are likely to be significant, with set-up costs of the order of £100,000.  Running costs, which at this stage cannot be quantified, are also likely to be significant and would comprise both access charges payable to an Internet service provider and firewall service charges.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions. Nos. 34, 35, 36, 37, 38 and 39 together.</P>
      <P>In order to claim the tax relief introduced in this year's budget for tenants in private rented accommodation in respect of rent paid, taxpayers should contact their inspector of taxes and request the claim form RENT 2.  The Revenue Commissioners have prepared an information note which is available as part of the claim form.  The taxpayer should complete the form and return it to their inspector who will then review the taxpayers tax-free allowances and make the appropriate changes.  A new certificate of tax-free allowances will, if applicable, then be issued to the taxpayer.</P>
      <P>In order to claim the relief the tenant must furnish the name and address of the landlord as well as the landlord's tax reference number.  Landlords are required under the legislation to include this information in the receipt or acknowledgement for rent to be provided to tenants.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied from the level of inquiries to my own Department together with the current level of demand for the RENT 2 claim forms from the Revenue Commissioners that public knowledge of the proposed rent relief is widespread and I do not propose to take any special measures to publicise it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The cost to the Exchequer in a full tax year of this relief, including the cost of the existing relief for those aged 55 years and over, is estimated at £20.3 million.  It is anticipated that the new relief will bring about an eventual additional tax yield of up to £20 million per annum from the additional disclosure of rental income by landlords. However, this yield will take some time <Col N="1419" /> to materialise and the net cost of the new relief to the Exchequer has been estimated at £5 million in 1995 and £7 million in 1996.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will appreciate that decisions to increase or decrease the level of particular income tax reliefs are considered in the context of the annual budget.  As is the case with all reliefs, I will monitor the impact of the reliefs for persons in private rented accommodation and take any action in relation to them as may be necessary or desirable.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): The provision of ambulance services in County Donegal is a matter for the North-Western Health Board in the first instance.

    <P>However, it is accepted that in cases such as cardiac emergencies, speed of <Col N="1421" /> intervention is critical in terms of survival rates.  In these situations the Review Group on the Ambulance Service recommended the development and evaluation of a first line response capability based on general practitioners practices.  The necessary medical equipment for such a service is being introduced in a number of areas throughout County Donegal, including that referred to by the Deputy and arrangements are also being made for the linking of the general practitioners involved, to the emergency communication network.  This initiative will greatly improve access to early emergency care for those living in County Donegal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): I assume that the <Col N="1423" /> Deputy is referring to Item 107 of the Plan for A <i>Government of Renewal.</i></P>
      <P>At present in Ireland, mammography is used largely as a diagnostic tool for symptomatic or worried women on referral by their general practitioners. There are now 17 diagnostic units throughout the country and expertise has been growing in all aspects of the early detection of breast cancer and its treatment.</P>
      <P>I am conscious of the need to maintain standards of excellence in these diagnostic units.  Accordingly, my Department has been in consultation with the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland and also the Faculty of Radiology in this regard.  The Deputy will wish to know that the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland has agreed to undertake a review of all diagnostic units from a quality assurance perspective on behalf of my Department. Any decisions on the development of new units must await the outcome of this review.</P>
      <P>In relation to mammography screening, the Deputy will be aware that the Government of Renewal programme also contains a commitment to expand the Eccles Street Breast Cancer Programme on a phased basis to cover those women in the high risk group nationwide.  My Department is supporting this major mammography screening programme which is being undertaken at the Mater Foundation.  This programme is one of a network of pilot schemes on breast cancer being carried out in the European Union.</P>
      <P>The Eccles programme has been recognised by the European Union as a European Centre of Excellence.  The key factors which contributed to its success in this regard are that it is a centralised screening programme with strong clinical leadership and trained and dedicated radiological, epidemiological and radiographical support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The programme's second round of screening has recently been completed <Col N="1424" /> and a report on the findings of the programme was submitted to my Department recently.  This report is currently being assessed and evaluated in my Department and I hope to be in a position to announce a decision on the expansion of the programme shortly.</P>
    <P>On taking office as the Minister for Health, I set as a priority the development of services to combat cancer and my Department is working on a comprehensive cancer strategy which is due for completion in the coming months. The initiative on cancer was prompted by the perceived need to ensure the provision of an equitable and high quality cancer service throughout the country. The objective is to take all measures possible to reduce the incidence of cancer and to ensure that those who develop cancer receive the most effective care and treatment.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): The Department of Health introduced a Charter of Rights for Hospital Patients in 1992.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The objective of the Charter is to ensure that the health service becomes <Col N="1425" /> more responsive to the needs of individual patients and that there is a code of practice available which sets out what patients have a right to expect when they make use of hospital services.</P>
    <P>Under the Charter, patients have the right to be given an indiviudal appointment time for out-patient services.  I am aware that a small number of hospitals are still experiencing some difficulty in giving individual appointment times to patients attending out-patient clinics.  In some of these cases, individual appointments are being gradually introduced to out-patient clinics.  The Department is pursuing these matters with the hospitals involved.</P>
    <P>In accordance with the Charter, all hospitals are required to have detailed complaints procedures in place.  Patients may, therefore, register complaints directly with the hospital authorities about any aspect of the hospital service, including delays at out-patient level.</P>
    <P>Under the terms and conditions of the consultants contract, the requirement to personally discharge all of the consultants' contractual commitments does not preclude the consultant from delegating aspects of his or her scheduled work to other appropriately qualified medical staff.  As both consultants and other hospital doctors are paid all-inclusive salaries the question of payment for individual visits does not arise.</P>
    <P>My Department's Strategy document &ldquo;Shaping a Healthier Future&rdquo; gives an undertaking to re-orientate the health services so that they are more responsive to patients' needs.  This Government is committed to the provision of a quality health service which provides a high level of patient satisfaction with regard to both the outcome of treatment and the process through which it is delivered.</P>

      <P>The board is addressing this issue and is developing the service with funding provided by my Department under the dental health action plan.  Unfortunately, the health board has experienced considerable difficulty in retaining the services of orthodontists at consultant level.  The board is at present sharing a consultant orthodontist with the Dublin Dental Hospital and my Department recently approved the creation of an additional two consultant posts for the board.</P>
      <P>My Department has had discussions with the board with a view to agreeing a framework for the development of a consultant-led orthodontic service in accordance with the strategy outlined in the dental health action plan.  The objective is to develop orthodontic services in the Eastern Health Board area to a level consistent with treatment needs. On completion of the present discussions I will make additional funds available to the Eastern Health Board to further develop its orthodontic services.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): There is currently no breast cancer screening programme in County Galway.  However, mammography is used as a diagnostic tool for symptomatic women and there is a dedicated breast clinic at University College Hospital, Galway.  In 1994, the clinic carried out mammograms on 1,198 women.</P>
      <P>The Department is supporting a major breast screening programme being undertaken at the Mater Foundation. The Government of Renewal programme contains a commitment to expand the Eccles Street Breast Cancer Programme on a phased basis to cover those women in the high risk group nationwide.  This programme is one of a network of pilot schemes on breast cancer being carried out in the European Union.</P>
      <P>The programme's second round of screening has recently been completed and a report on the findings of the programme has been submitted to the Department recently.  This report is currently being assessed and evaluated in the Department and I hope to be in a position to announce a decision on the expansion of the programme shortly.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): Persons suffering from acute asthmatic conditions currently have access to required medication including inhalers under a number of different schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The general medical services scheme provides without charge general practitioner services, drugs, medicines and <Col N="1430" /> appliances to persons covered by medical cards.  Approximately 36 per cent of the population are at present covered by medical cards.</P>
    <P>Where an individual or a family is subjected to a significant level of on-going expenditure on medical expenses &mdash; general practitioner fees, prescribed drugs etc. &mdash; due to a long term medical condition, these expenses may be reckoned in determining eligibility for a medical card.  In some cases a medical card may be issued to a family member on a personal basis.  Eligibility for a medical card is solely a matter for the chief executive officer of the relevant health board to decide.</P>
    <P>Persons who suffer from an on-going medical condition can avail of the Drug Cost Subsidisation Scheme which caters for people who do not have a medical card and are certified as having a long term medical condition such as asthma with a regular and on-going requirement for prescribed drugs and medicines in excess of an amount per month, currently £32.</P>
    <P>Persons who qualify for inclusion in this scheme will not have to spend more than £32 in any month on prescribed medication.</P>
    <P>Under the Drugs Refund Scheme which covers expenditure by the whole family, any expenditure on prescribed medication above £90 in a calendar quarter is refunded by the health board.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that appropriate and comprehensive treatment and support is being provided to asthma patients through these schemes.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): In recent years, more emphasis has been placed on overall levels of service provided in general hospitals rather than on the provision of a specific number of beds.  This is a reflection of the major changes in medical practice which have resulted in a reduction in the length of stay for in-patient care and the marked shift towards day case surgery and treatment of patients at out-patient level.</P>
      <P>In looking at acute hospital service delivery I feel it is inappropriate to focus solely on in-patient beds as a measure of hospital resources.  The emphasis is on overall activity levels and throughput, whether this is achieved by in-patient care, day care or out-patient attendances.</P>
      <P>In the cases of Ennis General Hospital, the average length of stay between the years 1992 and 1994 fell from 6.78 days to 6.45 days.  In the same period the number of in-patient treated increased from 4,120 to 4,815, while the number of day cases treated rose from 1,341 to 1,975.  Out-patient attendances in 1994 were 15,490.</P>

Seo a leanas slíocht as mo chuid cainte:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Ireland's position on whaling has always been to adopt a pro-conservation role in accordance with scientific evidence and in line with the principles of sustainable development ... While it is no longer part of our culture to eat whale meat and while <Col N="1437" /> we have chosen not to utilize consumptively the whale resources in our waters, we recognize the rights of other nations to follow their own cultures. As Minister responsible for cultural affairs as well as conservation, I believe it would be wrong and in the nature of cultural imperialism for Ireland to attempt to impose our cultural values on those nations whose populations have depended on the whale for generations.  Yet we will seek to convince them of our position. On this island, we have different cultural traditions and are learning to live together in peace and harmony and to respect each other.  Accordingly, Ireland will respect other nations' cultural values, although we will continue to demand the highest possible standards of conservation and will insist on transparent control and supervision systems and that any animals killed will be killed as humanely as possible.  We should also like the same standards of care and conservation applied to all cetaceans and not just to the great whales.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Tá socruithe agam go gcuirfear cóip den ráiteas iomlán a thug mé don IWC chuig na Teachtaí.</P>
    <P>With regard to the killing of pilot whales in the Faroe Islands, I will be conveying our views to the Faroese Government in the light of my statements during the debate on a Private Members' Motion on Whaling in Seanad Éireann on 24 May 1995 and of my address yesterday to the IWC.  It should be noted that Denmark and the Faroe Islands do not accept that the IWC has competence in the matter of small cetaceans.</P>

      <P>As I indicated in my reply to Questions Nos. 12, 15, 31, 41 and 42 on 26 Aibreán 1995, planning permission for the Wicklow National Park Visitor Centre was refused by An Bord Pleanála and the planning application for the Burren National Park Visitor Centre was withdrawn on the 31st March, 1995.  Final decisions as to what use if any is to be made of the works already carried out will not be determined until draft management plans for the Wicklow and Burren National Parks have been prepared and the public have been given the opportunity of contributing to them.  As I have indicated previously it may be desirable to carry out some works at these sites, pending the outcome of the consultation process, with the permission of the courts and the consent of the relevant local authorities where necessary.  In the circumstances outlined above, the question of a timetable does not arise at this time.</P>
      <P>The siting of visitor centres for the two national parks will be included in the terms of reference of the consultants whom I propose to commission to prepare management plans for the national parks in the context of conservation strategies for the wider areas of Counties Clare and Wicklow.</P>

      <P>The increase in the number of asylum applications in 1994 is primarily due to the large number of asylum seekers from Cuba.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Aside from the Cuban situation which is well documented.  I do not believe that it would be proper to disclose information on the nationalities of the applicants having regard to the general and understandable desire on the part of individual applicants to ensure that an application for recognition as a refugee is processed in confidence.  As the number of applicants of some nationalities is small, it would be relatively easy in some instances to identify particular individuals if nationality statistics were provided.  Such identification could have <Col N="1454" /> serious implications, particularly if members of an applicant's family are still in the country of origin.</P>
    <P>The majority of applicants entered the State through Shannon and Dublin airports; others arrived through Dublin Port, Dún Laoghaire and Rosslare.  The total number of asylum seekers in 1994 was 355.</P>

      <P>The issue raised in the Deputy's question are to a large extent already dealt with by sections 6 to 9 of the Criminal Justice Act 1993.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1458" /> Under that Act criminal courts have a general power to require offenders to pay compensation to the victim for any personal injury or loss resulting from the commission of any offence and this may obviate the need for a victim to institute civil proceedings with a view to obtaining compensation.</P>
    <P>The court may make the compensation order either instead of or in addition to dealing with the offender in any other way.  Where it considers that it would be appropriate both to impose a fine and to make a compensation order, but the means of the offender are insufficient to pay both, the court must give preference to making a compensation order.</P>
    <P>The amount of the order can be an amount equivalent to what in the court's opinion the injured party would recover in a civil action against the offender.  In determining whether to make the order, and for what amount it should be, the court must have regard to the offender's means.  It may, if it considers it appropriate, provide for payment by instalments. This is to ensure that the order can be realistically enforced.  The court must also have regard to any evidence and representations that are made by or on behalf of the offender and the injured party.</P>
    <P>Payments under a compensation order, be they by instalment or otherwise, must be made by the offender to a District Court clerk for transmission to the injured party concerned.  Where there is a default in payment, the District Court clerk may enforce recovery of sums in arrears whether by proceeding in his own name for an attachment of earnings order or otherwise.</P>
    <P>I am not satisfied that the measures referred to by the Deputy would represent an improvement on the existing legal position which I have outlined. While I have no immediate proposals to change the provisions of the 1993 Act, I will of course keep their operation under review and consider any specific proposals for reform which may arise.</P>

Correspondence was received by my predecessor, however, in connection with this matter. Because arrears of applications for naturalisation had built up in my Department in the recent past it was decided to give priority to clearing these applications over items of general correspondence. Work is now well advanced on clearing the arrears and a reply will issue to the Deputy's query shortly.</P>

      <P>A housing review group was set up in September 1994 consisting of representatives from the Departments of the Environment, Health and Finance and from local authorities and health boards under the chairmanship of the Department of Social Welfare to review the increasing role of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme in housing provision.  This review group was set up at the instigation of my Department because of a concern that <Col N="1461" /> the expenditure on housing under the SWA scheme was taking place outside of housing policy.  This review will attempt to identify the reasons for the increase in rent and mortgage supplements and to identify the likely trends for the future.  It will also consider what is the most cost-effective way of assisting those on social welfare incomes to meet their housing needs. The group is due to make its report in the autumn.</P>
      <P>The terms and conditions, including subsidies where applicable, of the social housing schemes administered by the local authorities have recently been revised and updated as detailed in the booklet <i>Social Housing &mdash; The Way ahead</i> which was published by the Department of the Environment on 2 May 1995.  The Department of the Environment has advised that there are no proposals to review these schemes further or to alter present arrangements in relation to the funding of local authority housing.</P>

      <P>A statistical system has been in use for some years in the health boards which enables financial records to be maintained.  There is, however, no separate code for asylum seekers in that system.  It is understood that the Department of Justice received a total of 355 applications for asylum in 1994. Approximately half of these reside in the Mid-Western Health Board area. The board estimates that approximately £½ million was paid out in supplementary <Col N="1462" /> welfare allowances to asylum seekers during 1994.</P>
      <P>At present, my Department is developing a new computerised system, integrated short term schemes system, ISTS, which will integrate all short term social welfare payments such as disability benefit, unemployment benefit, unemployment assistance and supplementary welfare allowance.  It will be implemented on a phased basis for SWA payments from March 1996 and it is anticipated that it will be fully operational in all health board areas by the end of 1996.  This new computerised system will give better quality statistical and expenditure analysis in respect of the various elements of the SWA scheme.  I have asked the computer staff who are developing the ISTS system to ensure that a specific code is incorporated into the system to identify the number of asylum seekers in receipt of SWA payments and the cost of this provision.</P>

      <P>Various independent and regulatory authorities have an interest in the general area raised by the Deputy.  They also have the capability to employ inspectors and take action as necessary under various statutory provisions.</P>
      <P>I propose to deal with the relevant provisions of the company law code. The decision to petition the High Court to instigate a company law investigation into the affairs of CountyGlen plc following preliminary investigation by my Department of shareholder complaints, was prompted by company law concerns. The results of that inquiry proved it to be fully justified.</P>
      <P>In relation to the company law code each case where there are concerns of a possible breach would be carefully considered in the light of its particular features. It would appear that the Deputy's question arises from my reply to his earlier question on 25 April 1995, Question No. 226 at volume 451, No. 8, columns 1884-5.  No investigations were formally sought under section 7 or 8 of the Companies Act, 1990, during the years 1990 to 1994 into the affairs of any beef processing companies.</P>
      <P>The Government, following resolutions of the Dáil and Seanad, established the Tribunal of Inquiry into the Beef Processing Industry in May 1991 and the report of that extensive factfinding exercise in July 1994 was published by the then Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Pn 1007. The tribunal dealt exhaustively and comprehensively with the various allegations made by Dáil Deputies and others.  It determined on a variety of matters and made a series of recommendations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am advised that the 904-page tribunal report was referred by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry to the Director of Public Prosecutions for such actions as might be considered appropriate.  The director is independent in the performance of his duties and I would expect that, in that process, <Col N="1466" /> he is giving due attention to the results of the inquiries.</P>
    <P>It is also the case that one major group of beef processing companies had been subject to further detailed inquiry &mdash; under the aegis of the courts &mdash; by the examiner appointed in August 1990 under the provisions of the Companies (Amendment) Act, 1990.</P>
    <P>As regards the Deputy's reference to alleged tip-offs and the shredding of documents, this would appear to be a matter primarily for the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry in this case.  It would seem that this matter arose in the course of prosecutions taken for fraud by senior management at a particular meat plant to which the Minister for Justice adverted in reply to the Deputy's question on 25 April 1995. Question No. 193 at volume 451, No. 8, columns 1858-9.</P>

      <P>In the years 1990-1993 the total amount of money overpaid to farmers under the disadvantaged areas' headage schemes was £1,893 million of which at present £1,426 million has already been recovered.  In the premium schemes the total amount overpaid in the same period was £2.071 million of which at present £.929 million has already been recovered.  The outstanding balances will be recovered from future entitlements.</P>
      <P>Details of the position in relation to 1994 are not available as all payments are not completed.</P>
      <P>The vast bulk of these overpayments arose because of the system of making advance payments before completion of all processing of individual claims.  From 1995 onwards, any advance payment will only be made on foot of fully processed claims.  This should ensure that the level of overpayments in future years will be minimal.</P>

My Department was also in contact with the NDAB in relation to the 1993 case. While my Department did not refer the 1989 case to the NDAB, it subsequently copied to the board a letter which issued in reply to a query about the health aspects of the dip in question.  The decision to delete dips from the list of approved dips was taken following consultation with the NDAB.  The dip involved in the 1989 case was not among those deleted.  The 1993 case did not relate to any specific dip but deleted dips were implicit in the relevant correspondence.</P>

      <P>There is a large international dimension to maritime safety legislation.  The International Maritime Organisation (IMO) Conventions are the cornerstone of maritime safety regulation throughout the world.  The Department gives the highest priority to introducing into Irish <Col N="1477" /> law the IMO's constantly evolving standards for ferry safety.</P>
      <P>Following the <i>Estonia</i> tragedy in September 1994, the Maritime Safety Committee of the IMO ordered a thorough review of ro-ro passenger ferry safety to be carried out on a priority basis by a panel of international experts.  The review was to draw on all available advice and information from IMO member states.  The terms of reference of the panel of experts required it to look at all potentially dangerous areas of ro-ro passenger ships.  The main philosophy which governed the work of the panel of experts was that a safe ship is one which is well built, well maintained and run by a well trained crew.  The Chief Surveyor of the Department of the Marine played an active role in the review.</P>
      <P>The report of the panel of experts was presented to the Maritime Safety Committee of the IMO at its last meeting earlier this month.  The panel recommends that a number of IMO conventions be amended, viz the Conventions on Safety of Life at Sea, Search and Rescue and on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping.  IMO member states are now considering this report in detail and it is to be discussed further by the Maritime Safety Committee in advance of the IMO general assembly in November.</P>
      <P>Ireland will comply fully with any new legislation which is introduced by the IMO.</P>
      <P>The role of the European Union in maritime safety was given increased impetus as a result of the <i>Braer</i> tanker disaster and more recently following the loss of the passenger ferry <i>Estonia</i>.  The EU's &ldquo;Common Policy of Safe Seas&rdquo; provides the framework for a range of important regulatory measures covering maritime safety including Port State Control, the International Safety Management Code and reporting arrangements for ships carrying dangerous or polluting goods.  Ireland participates actively at EU level to ensure that the highest standards of ferry safety prevail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Marine Survey Office of the <Col N="1478" /> Department of the Marine operates a strict year-round programme of inspections for all ferries using Irish ports.  The inspection programme is designed to ensure strict compliance with national and international safety standards.  The programme also encourages a culture of safety, reliability and best practice.</P>
