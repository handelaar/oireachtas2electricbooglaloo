      <P>The White House announced last week that the President's visit here will now be confined to Friday, 1 December 1995.  The events planned for Dublin, which I indicated to the House on 14 November, will stand. These are: a meeting with the President at Áras an Uachtaráin; an address to both Houses of the Oireachtas; the conferring, by Dublin City Council, of the Freedom of the City; bilateral discussions with the Government and a Government dinner in honour of the President and Mrs. Clinton.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Given the curtailment of the President's programme, consideration of visits to other locations, was not possible. The President and his administration have of course demonstrated a clear commitment to the development <Col N="1578" /> of the Border areas through the US contribution to the International Fund for Ireland and the Washington Investment Conference held last May.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware from the White House statement that the President will also visit Belfast and Derry.</P>
    <P>The President will depart Dublin for Germany on the morning of Saturday, 2 December.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for his reply.  Before the curtailment of the visit, was it envisaged that the President would come to the Border areas? A number of Border Deputies, particularly on this side of the House, have already raised this issue with the Taoiseach. Was there a suggestion from the Government that the President would come to the Border areas, particularly on the southern side of the Border, in view of the commitment by the Americans &mdash; as the Taoiseach has quite rightly pointed out &mdash; to the International Fund for Ireland, and also the Washington Investment Conference which related to the six Northern counties and the six southern Border counties?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the President will visit Derry which is virtually on the Border.  As far as the southern side of the Border, is concerned, representations were received.  I recollect in particular, a request from Deputy Andrew Boylan on that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>He was not the only one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The difficulty is quite simply that there are so many areas that the President would like to visit and would profit from visiting, but even at the maximum, the proposed visit was for no more than two days.  As the President will visit Derry, which is on the Border, the suggested proposals for the other day included a visit to the midwest and the south-west.  As the Deputy knows, that part of the programme has, <Col N="1579" /> unfortunately, had to be eliminated because of the totally understandable requirement of the President to visit Germany to assist in the important preparation for the successful implementation of the peace accords in Bosnia-Hercegovina.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Why did this Government lay so much emphasis on the President going to the south-west and not to the six southern Border counties?  I can assure the Taoiseach &mdash; and he probably knows this as well as I do &mdash; that there are as good golf courses in the six Border counties as there are in the south-west.</P>

      <P>I join with the Taoiseach in expressing the hope that the people will turn out in strength to welcome and pay tribute to President Clinton for the great work he has done for this country.  He has given it a great amount of attention, not just in the last week or so but throughout the past three years.  On those public occasions he has gone to the trouble to make himself available for, in the short time he will be here.  I hope he will receive a great welcome.</P>
      <P>On a lighter note, my colleagues from the Border region inform me that the Clintons lived in the vicinity of County Louth.  They tell me that two of George Washington's most famous generals were sons of a James Clinton who emigrated from Ardee in 1738.  Perhaps that is why President Clinton always has so much to say about the Border region. He is probably the only person from outside the country who refers to the &ldquo;southern counties of the Border region&rdquo; and I appreciate that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I share that view.  My reseachers tend towards the view that he is probably one of the Clintons of Moynalty but that may not be true.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 to 11, inclusive and No. 66 together.</P>
      <P>The Government is currently engaged in an intensive process of contacts with the British Government and other parties to surmount some of the roadblocks in the way of the commencement of all-party talks on the basis of the &ldquo;twin track&rdquo; strategy.  In that regard, I have had a number of lengthy telephone conversations with the British Prime Minister, most recently just over an hour ago.  We expect to have further telephone discussions later today and meanwhile officials remain in contact.</P>
      <P>We are at a particularly sensitive point in our efforts to secure the vital breakthrough and I, therefore, cannot go into detail yet on the specifics of the present situation.  However, the Government's proactive approach on the issue has been informed at all times by an impartial and pragmatic assessment of past and present realities, taking into account the sensitivities that exist on all sides.  Because of the crucial importance to the peoples of Ireland, North and South, that political agreement must be reached to underpin peace, we will continue to do everything possible to move matters forward.</P>
      <P>Regarding Deputy Dempsey's question, I am satisfied that the procedures for bringing to my attention important items of correspondence are satisfactory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach outline the procedures in place to ensure urgent messages and important letters are brought to his attention before he comes into the House rather than say they are satisfactory?  We know that a message was not brought to his attention a few weeks ago and he inadvertently misled the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1583" />
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not inadvertently mislead the Dáil.  I conveyed to the Dáil in a prompt manner the content of a message that had been given to me.  I did not mislead the House, inadvertently or otherwise.  When I was asked subsequently whether a letter had been received I confirmed that it had been received but that was the first occasion on which I was specifically asked about a letter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted the Taoiseach confirmed he had a telephone conversation today with the British Prime Minister and may have some later in the day.  I do not wish to pursue the matter because of the delicacy of the situation. However, I wish the Taoiseach and the Government well.  It is important that these talks are brought to a successful conclusion.  There seem to be efforts in other parts to divide the Irish team and I do not wish to facilitate that in any way.  Is the Taoiseach optimistic that there may be a breakthrough later today?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Irish Government is devoting maximum effort to achieving the necessary breakthrough at the earliest possible moment.  I am not able, nor would it be wise for me, to go further than that and use adjectives to describe my state of mind on the matter or engage in any reference to times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>For the third week in a row the Taoiseach is unable to say anything at Question Time other than refer to &ldquo;the delicacy of the situation&rdquo;. He will appreciate that is not satisfactory. Having said that, we support the Government's effort, as I stated yesterday, and the personal efforts of the Taoiseach.  Would it represent a serious political failure if after 15 months cessation of violence both Governments could not agree on the terms and time to bring all parties together for political talks?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Both Governments are working seriously towards that <Col N="1584" /> objective.  I am putting everything I can into bringing about the success that is necessary.  I believe that sense of commitment is reciprocated by the British Prime Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The obvious question on everyone's lips over the last 72 hours is if the Taoiseach can assure us that any breakthrough will be firmly copperfastened and not fall apart when President Clinton leaves our shores.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Any agreement will be one between the British and Irish Governments to which each Government will feel the other is bound in honour. In other words, the possible outcome of the efforts now being made will be an agreement between the Governments of the two islands.  Others have facilitated us in moving closer to such an agreement but any agreement will be an agreement between in the British and Irish Governments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Without going into detail, will the Taoiseach say if his position on Washington Three, as reported in the Official Report, still holds, that an international commission must have within its remit the substance of Washington Three, which is that whatever kinds of arrangements are made for the decommissioning of arms to take them out of Irish politics forever will be included in the remit of Senator Mitchell and his two colleagues?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We are seeking an agreement between the British and Irish Governments that will provide a basis, supported by all, to move on a twin track towards all party inclusive talks. We are working together to achieve that objective taking into account the sensitivities and concerns of all parties in Northern Ireland, all of whom are needed to become parties to this process if we are to reach the ultimate objective, which is agreement.  That is all I can say about the matter at this juncture.  If agreement is reached, and that is not certain at this point, I will be happy to <Col N="1585" /> come before the House at that stage and deal with every question that may be posed on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach's telephone conversation today will be the sixth between himself and Mr. Major in the last few days, covering four hours if I keep track of time correctly.  Will the Taoiseach say anything about the areas of the Downing Street Declaration that the British Government has not fulfilled? Will he assure the House that the Framework Document is central to the ongoing work?  Will he assure us that, not withstanding what may be signed between himself and Mr. Major in the coming days, what has already been signed will not be forgotten?  Will he confirm that any talks will take place on a three stranded basis and that the North-South strand will not be omitted, as was suggested yesterday by a senior politician?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Irish Government remains firmly committed to the three stranded approach as the appropriate one towards finding a solution. What we are hoping is that we may be able to launch a twin track process towards all-party talks, the ultimate objective of which would be an agreement.</P>
      <P>The task in which we are now engaged is a task about process.  The Framework Document, the commitment to which I have repeatedly given in this House, is of a different nature; it is not a process, it is a framework for agreement and a statement of a possible ultimate destination.  What we are now engaged in is a process towards talks which may lead to that destination or some other destination which reflects the underlying values contained and given concrete and detailed expression in the Framework Document.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the sake of discussion here, it should be understood that what is now being sought is different in nature from the Framework Document.  What we are now dealing with is a process leading <Col N="1586" /> towards talks.  The Framework Document is an agreed model prepared by the Government of a possible ultimate destination for those talks.  They are two quite different but equally important things.</P>
    <P>The Deputy should not draw the sort of inference he seems to be inclined to draw from the fact that in discussing the process we are not constantly referring to one particular destination.  That is not in any way to take from our commitment to reaching that destination but in order to concentrate on the task more immediately in hand, which is getting a process which would get everyone involved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I remind the Taoiseach that the Framework Document which he himself signed is a process arising from ongoing work under the Downing Street Declaration.  He is correct in saying that is a model.  It was negotiated, as stated in the preamble and throughout the document, on the basis of how the peace process should be moved forward. Therefore, it is very relevant in terms of where we go from here.  I do not accept that it is a separate agenda.</P>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for assuring the House that the North-South strand cannot and will not cut out.  The suggestion yesterday by Mr. Trimble that any attempts to move forward the process or any of the individual issues mentioned in the Framework Document would have to be made on a tripartite basis is not workable.  I thank the Taoiseach for clarifying that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have repeatedly indicated my view on the value and importance of the three stranded approach.  There is nothing new in what I have said about that matter today.  The Framework Document does flow from the Downing Street Declaration, but one will only reach an agreement of the kind postulated in the Framework Document or any agreement of similar effect if one actually gets people around the table.  Getting people around the table at this juncture is my first priority. <Col N="1587" /> It is the correct and proper priority. That is the reason I am spending so much time on it.</P>

      <P>I accept that the Taoiseach has been doing his utmost in the past week to try to move matters forward &mdash; I think he would agree that these benches were relatively quiet last week &mdash; but even as we speak the British Government is playing down the idea of an imminent breakthrough.  I hope that is wrong.  Has it entered into the Taoiseach's calculations that the British Government has been doing everything in its power to play down the visit of President Clinton to this country, given the relationship which exists between the United Kingdom and United States, and has not been fully cooperating so as to turn his visit into a damp squib?</P>

      <P>There are no plans of the kind the Deputy mentioned, but so long as the criteria I have outlined in response to previous questions are fulfilled &mdash; there should be no difficulty in fulfilling them if the need arises &mdash; I would have no problem with holding a joint meeting.  Although I have no plans at the moment I would be very happy to hold meetings with any or all of the party leaders in Northern Ireland at any time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1588" /> One should work towards a situation where meetings of that nature are considered routine, that one has such meetings whether there is a particular item of importance to discuss, so that no great political significance is attached to whether a meeting takes place.  One should have normal dialogue on an ongoing basis between the Government and all the parties in Northern Ireland. That is best for them and for us, rather than have a situation where such meetings are considered to be either a tremendous breakthrough or, because a meeting is taking place, it is expected to yield a particular result.  The aim should be to have a relationship with all the parties in Northern Ireland where meetings take place on a reasonably regular basis in an atmosphere of &ldquo;business as usual&rdquo;.</P>

As he himself said, an impasse has been reached in relation to the matters under discussion.  Does he believe, as happened in the run up to the Downing Street Declaration, that there would be nothing wrong in principle with holding a summit or a meeting between himself and the British Prime Minister for the purpose of discussing across the table areas of difference where problems cannot be successfully alleviated over the telephone? Does he believe that a summit cannot take place until a prearranged outcome is negotiated by him and his officials with the British Prime Minister and his officials?  Does the Taoiseach believe, given the seriousness of the matters related to peace process at the moment, that a summit meeting between himself and the Prime Minister would be good in terms of face to face confrontation on the issues as distinct from the continuing diplomatic talks, should the current phase of these talks prove to be unsuccessful?</P>

I agree with this and I accept the Taoiseach is maximising normal diplomatic channels to the greatest possible extent but does he believe a similar relationship should exist between the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister as he would like to see between the Taoiseach and the Northern party leaders with <Col N="1590" /> regard to matters of great importance?

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12 and 13 together.</P>
      <P>The Government intends to initiate Constitution amendment Bills on votes for emigrants and Cabinet confidentiality and these are being drafted at present.  I am not yet in a position to indicate when the necessary referenda will be held but I expect it will be some time next year.</P>
      <P>The Minister for the Environment proposes to promote debate on emigrant representation by publication shortly of the text of the proposed Constitution amendment Bill on votes for emigrants as well as outline proposals for the implementing legislation which will be required if the amendment is approved in a referendum.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Justice is examining the Law Reform Commission report on the law of bail published on 27 September. When that examination is completed she will bring proposals, including options for any constitutional amendment, before the Government and an announcement of the Government's decision on the matter will be made in due course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that the position of the Minister for Justice and the Government on a referendum on bail, as outlined in statements earlier in the year and during the debate on the Fianna Fáil Private Members' Bill some weeks ago, still holds and that a bail Bill will be put before the House.</P>
      <P>I understand that the Constitution Review Group is proceeding satisfactorily with its work.  Will its recommendations be taken into account in any referenda we may hold during 1966?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is unlikely that it will be possible to take into account any recommendations from the Constitution Review Group in a referendum in 1996 because the group is not expected to produce its final report until Easter.  The <Col N="1592" /> next step will be for the report to be examined by an all-party committee of the House.  Unless such a committee reaches agreement quickly, it is unlikely for logistical and timing reasons, that any of the matters in the report will be ready for a referendum during 1996. This could be a different matter in 1997. The situation on bail is set out in my reply to the questions asked by Deputies Ahern and Callely today.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach and the Government seem to have changed their minds on the question of a bail referendum. In March the Minister for Justice said we would have a bail referendum. I know the Taoiseach has had other worries in recent days but he will have noticed that more people are being shot in the streets of this and other cities, that drugs are becoming more plentiful and cheaper and that crime is rising. Does the Taoiseach not feel, given the most horrific year of crime in the history of the State, that he should give a clear commitment to hold a referendum on bail?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We received a report from the Law Reform Commission which suggests alternative ways of dealing with this problem short of constitutional change.  It is prudent for the Government to examine this report quickly.  Arguments in it would be advanced in respect of any proposals which might be put forward.  It is better to first examine the report so that any proposal which the Government might make on bail, whether or not it involves a constitutional amendment, takes fully into account the learned and detailed review of the law contained in the report.  I strongly affirm the Government's absolute determination to deal with the problem of crimes committed by people on bail.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">

      <P>This is a serious problem because of the tendency of people on bail to believe they are &ldquo;going down&rdquo;<Col N="1593" /> anyway.  They do not have to have the same fear of the consequences of their actions as people who are not in this position.  I strongly affirm the Government's determination to deal with this matter in the most effective legal way possible.  It is important to find a way which works.  In so doing, we will take full account of the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission and other views canvassed in the House or elsewhere.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No. The Deputy can take it from my reply that we are considering the Law Reform Commission's report to see if it provides an alternative and we will come to a decision on this at an early stage.  It may well be that constitutional change will have be be considered but at this juncture the Government's task is to consider whether the alternatives suggested in the report are adequate and, if they are not, to proceed with a constitutional amendment.  It is important to find the most effective method to deal with this problem.</P>

      <P>The RTE Authority was appointed on 1 June 1995 after the publication of the Green Paper.

      <P>I do not believe he should be excluded.  I sought Professor Corcoran's opinion on the draft of the Green Paper on the basis of his competence, his published work and his wide reputation internationally, for example, in regard to television and children's rights, and his opinion was most valuable.  Subsequently when the Authority was appointed Professor Corcoran <Col N="1595" /> informed it of the precise matter upon which he had offered an opinion on the Green Paper.  The submission received from the Authority, with more than 150 others, is comprehensive ranging across many matters other than those on which he expressed an opinion.</P>

That is its right and it is not interfered with by me.  There is no difficulty in that regard.  If a person who is recognised as one of the most distinguished communications experts were disqualified on the basis of being public service-minded enough to offer an opinion, that would be grossly unfair. I have every confidence in the RTÉ Authority and I am particularly confident that Professor Corcoran will make a distinguished contribution.</P>

      <P>Section 35 of the Finance Act, 1987, as amended, expires on 31 March 1996 for corporate investors and on 5 April 1996 for individual investors. In the light of the Government's continuing commitment to support the Irish film industry, and to have an independent assessment of the operation of the scheme I have appointed consultants to review the operation of the section 35 scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1596" /> I am pleased to inform the Deputy that the report of the consultants is close to finalisation.  The report will be considered by me and by the Government is the context of overall budgetary policy for 1996.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister outline the types of checks carried out by his Department and the Revenue Commissioners to ensure the conditions of section 35 certificates are adhered to? How many certificates, if any, have been withdrawn and for what reasons?  In view of the collapse of the film &ldquo;Divine Rapture&rdquo; will the Minister request proof that full funding is in place for a film before granting a section 35 certificate? Will he consider a condition that the producers of a film be required to present a bond which would guarantee all moneys due to Irish workers and suppliers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for her constructive and detailed set of questions.  I will communicate with her if my information is in any way inaccurate. Approximately 59 certificates have issued for films in the last 20 months, since I became the certifying authority. Gross budgets amount to about £185.6 million, with £100 million spent in the Irish economy.  There are about 226 trainees on those schemes.  In regard to withdrawal of a certificate, as I stated in reply to an inquiry from the public press, in the case of one project this summer I and my Department were concerned that the conditions of the certificate were not met &mdash; these conditions issued in the certificates of June and September.  It would not be wise to comment on that matter at this stage, but all appropriate action was taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the film <i>Divine Rapture,</i> the section 35 investment was not released and failure in that case related to seed funding from Cinefin, the American-French investors.  The Deputy raised a good point on security for local creditors in the case of a film such as that, but that must be counter-balanced with justification in financial terms of a <Col N="1597" /> section 35 investment in that there is an element of risk.  In reviewing the scheme I will consider all such procedures.  My concern is to maximise the benefit to the indigenous film community.  I am particularly pleased that of the last dozen projects I have certified, seven will involve first time Irish producers who started off with seed funding from the Irish Film Board.  These are the kinds of changes which will make the scheme more effective and more attractive to the indigenous sector.  The consultants' report is near finalisation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept what the Minister said about <i>Divine Rapture</i> and the fact that section 35 was not used in that case.  Does the Minister not agree that before any such future projects get under way, he should request proof that full funding is already in place?  The Minister referred to elements of risk.  In this case the Irish workers and suppliers were put at risk and some are still out of pocket.  That is why I suggested at the time that the Minister should require film producers to present a bond which would protect Irish suppliers and workers in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to be as positive about this as possible.  There are some difficulties in relation to bonding which some of the international financial suppliers of bonds for film productions have experienced.  For example, I know of one source in Britain which would provide bonds, provided British technicians were hired.  I am willing to consider where a bond might be used in the future revision of the scheme.  I am sure the Deputy agrees that it would be inappropriate for me, as the certifying authority, to remove the obligations and duties from others who gather money for investment, publish prospectuses, seek investment and invest money in production companies.  They have obligations which cannot be passed on to me.  As regards the future of the scheme, I am willing to consider how it can be improved.  If <Col N="1598" /> there is merit in applying a bond, particularly in relation to suppliers as the Deputy mentioned, I will consider it when amending the scheme further after the consultants' final report is presented to me.</P>

      <P>Tógfaidh mé Ceisteanna Uimh.  21, 23, 24 agus 36 le chéile.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Dírím aird na dTeachtaí ar an bhfreagra a thug mé ar Cheisteanna Dála Uimh.  17, 18, 40, 43, 47, 56, 67, 74, 94 agus 97 ar 1 Feabhra 1995, colúin 962 go 967 sa Tuairisc Oifigiúil don lá sin, nuair a thug mé sonraí faoi chinneadh an <Col N="1599" /> Rialtais den 20 Eanáir 1995 i ndáil le hairgeadú Theilifís na Gaeilge.  Níl aon athrú ar an gcinneadh sin.</P>
    <P>Mar thoradh ar chinneadh an Rialtais, cuireadh £3.6 milliún do chaiteachas caipitil agus £2.5 milliún do chaiteachas reatha ar fáil sna Meastacháin do 1995. Chomh maith leis an airgead ón Státchiste do na hoibreacha caipitil do Theilifís na Gaeilge, chinn an Rialtas go bhféadfadh RTE úsáid a bhaint as an tsuim £6.4 milliún (ús san áireamh) a gnóthaíodh mar fharasbarr ar na teorainneacha ioncaim a leagadh síos faoin Acht Craolacháin, 1990.  Tuairiscíonn RTÉ go bhfuil suim £3.59 milliún caite go dáta i 1995 ar oibreacha caipitil agus meastar go gcaithfear £3.65 milliún eile roimh dheireadh na bliana.  Ó thaobh chaiteachas reatha tuairiscíonn RTÉ go bhfuil £1.1 milliún caite go dáta i 1995 agus meastar go gcaithfear fuílleach an tsoláthair roimh dheireadh na bliana.</P>
    <P>Go dtí go gcruthófar bonn dlithiúil ar leith do Theilifís na Gaeilge, tá cúram leagtha ar RTÉ i ndáil le tógáil an bhonneagair tarchuradóireachta agus feidhmiú na seirbhíse, ach dearcadh Chomhairle Theilifís na Gaeilge a thógáil san áireamh.  Maidir leis an mbunstruchtúr teicniúil, tuigim ó RTÉ go bhfuil tarchuradóirí tógtha ag dhá phríomhláthair, agus tástáil déanta orthu, agus táthar ag súil leis go mbeidh an próiséas sin críochnaithe leis na príomhtharchuradóirí uile faoi dheireadh an earraigh 1996.  Tuairiscíonn RTÉ freisin go bhfuil dul chun cinn maith á dhéanamh le tógáil na bhfoirgneamh, na dtúr agus eile a bhaineann leis an gcóras nasc-tarchuradóireachta.</P>
    <P>Fuarthas cead pleanála le déanaí don cheannáras i mBaile na hAbhann, Contae na Gaillimhe, agus tá tús curtha leis an obair ar an láthair.</P>
    <P>Maidir leis na cláir féin, tuigim go raibh an chéad bhabhta coimisiúnaithe ann i mí Lúnasa agus gur fógraíodh an dara babhta i mí Mheán Fómhair.  Tá obair ag dul ar aghaidh freisin maidir le hábhar a athghuthú i nGaeilge.</P>
    <P>Tá súil ag RTÉ go dtosóidh an tseirbhís nua ar 31 Deireadh Fómhair 1996.</P>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome foreign investment in artistic and cultural developments in this country.  In general I believe that the promoters of individual developments are best placed to secure such investment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1611" /> The national cultural institutions welcome support which is in keeping with their aims and objectives, through donations and sponsorship including from foreign sources.</P>
    <P>It is important that our institutions should receive wide recognition abroad and any support which is received gives witness to the standing in which they are held besides the obvious tangible assistance which is granted.</P>
    <P>It is fair to say that since taking over responsibility for the national cultural institutions, the increased funding which I have secured in this area will have the long-term effect of enhancing the status and services of our institutions even further so that they will be able to attract prestigious contributions from abroad.  In this regard, I understand that both the Irish Museum of Modern Art and the National Gallery in particular have been successful in attracting such interest in recent years and they will continue to seek and achieve such benefits.</P>
    <P>The Deputy should also be aware that the range of incentives which I have put in place to promote the Irish film industry &mdash; which deals with an important art discipline in its own right &mdash; has succeeded in attracting significant foreign investments to this country.  If the total production funding for film and television in the 1994-95 tax year, it is estimated that some £67 million was sourced from abroad out of a total of £113 million.  This represents 60 per cent of foreign investment in film and television for the period quoted.</P>
    <P>Earlier this year, I set up FORTE, the music task force to examine the scale and structures of the music industry in Ireland to identify any factors that may be inhibiting the industry's further development and identify measures that could accelerate the industry's expansion.</P>
    <P>The final report of this task force is due before the end of the year in which I expect that the matter of foreign investment in the music industry will be addressed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>I look forward to the final report of FORTE.  Will the Minister acknowledge that the arts plan states that the Arts Council will co-operate with Forbairt, An Bord Tráchtála and Bord Fáilte in an increased effort to market Irish art abroad and to use their marketing expertise to attract investment in art?  What progress is being made in that respect?  Is the Minister in a position to indicate whether any targets have been set and, if so, whether they are being met?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Deputy's interest in this matter, in the integration between projects like music and art in their own right as cultural spheres and the immense employment potential and economic significance of the cultural industries that are derived from these sources.  The answer to the Deputy's question is &ldquo;yes&rdquo;; there have been talks between my officials and the different agencies she specified.  I look forward to receiving the report of the task force &mdash; I am told I will have it before the end of next month &mdash; which will have examined every aspect, including those mentioned by the Deputy, in addition to the marketing, production, technical and creative aspects.  We have not waited for the detailed proposals because the different necessary connections between the various agencies referred to by the Deputy already have been progressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to ask two further brief supplementaries.  Members have a certain difficulty in that if we want to ask questions about any progress the Arts Council is making we are told by the Minister that is not a matter for the House because of the distance he wishes to maintain &mdash; quite rightly &mdash; between himself and the council.  That presents a difficulty for Members who, during debates on Estimates, vote money for the Arts Council but we are then precluded from asking detailed questions on progress in any given year.  Will the Minister examine the possibility of <Col N="1613" /> allowing Members access to the kind of information that would enable them to assess whether progress is being made on these important issues?  Also, when the FORTE report becomes available, does the Minister envisage moving towards new legislation in relation to the Copyright Act, for example?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>On the first question, I acknowledge the Deputy's appreciation of my statutory distance from the Arts Council.  That is necessary because if it did not exist there would be a direct relationship for individual projects which would seriously erode the autonomy of the Arts Council as specified in its founding legislation.  I take the Deputy's point, however, in relation to being interested in progress and I will try to ensure that such information, as appropriate, will be made available as easily as possible.  I do not have any difficulty in that regard.</P>
      <P>On the Deputy's second question, which is interesting, I said that FORTE was established to examine any obstacles that may exist to the development of the music industry in addition to examining instruments that might be developed.  I await the report but I envisage that non-statutory measures may be taken in relation to, for example, developing the area of music publishing.  The Deputy is correct in saying that legislation might be required and, if so, I will move immediately to put that into preparation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I note with interest that the Minister said there is a need for distance between the Arts Council and the Minister.  That kind of autonomy is necessary, but it is the Minister who decides on the moneys for the Arts Council without which it cannot continue to do its work.  There is a shortfall of at least £3 million for 1995 alone, and we cannot say this will be forthcoming later in the year because it is now nearly December.  Will the Minister comment on this very serious situation?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am entirely guided by the Chair, but I did think there was another question dealing with that. However, I have no difficulty in replying to the Deputy.  The position is indeed as the Deputy said.  I did say in a previous debate that I am responsible for the overall funding of the Arts Council, among other institutions. Funding has risen from just over £10 million to £16.25 million in the present year, and the arts plan envisages a sum that is even higher &mdash; a figure of over £19 million.  I am still in discussions with my colleague, the Minister for Finance, regarding the provision of adequate funding.  There are three things about the arts plan that are important.  It was prepared in consultation and in partnership; it is constructed around seven modules over a three-year period; and it has specified levels of funding.  In order to be totally forthcoming to the House, let me say also that if the funding is not available to meet the targets, the plan will have to be constructed over a different time period.</P>

      <P>This was the subject of a priority question just a month ago when I asked about the shortfall of £3 million for the arts plan for 1995.  At that time the Minister assured me that he was entering into discusions with his colleague, the Minister for Finance.  I had not planned to revisit that question, but since the Minister is so forthcoming, let me ask him if he is optimistic as to the outcome of his discussions in the last month.  Can he indicate to the House that the shortfall in 1995 will be made good in 1996 and that the amount already promised in the arts plan for 1996 will be allocated in full?  Will the Minister also accept that although in the context of 1995 there was a 22 per cent increase in funding&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It had been adopted. There were three stages &mdash; the publication of the plan which was a Government decision, the adoption of the plan <Col N="1616" /> which was also a Government decision, and the funding of the plan.  I am in discussions. The important aspect is that the plan is the framework for action.  It has its seven modules which are important to a coherent development of arts activity.  If I am successful to the point at which I can secure money according to the scale envisaged in the arts plan, that would be the desirable outcome.  If this is not possible for any reason, however, it would mean that the modules as described in the plan would stay intact but could not be delivered in the same timeframe.  This is the point I made to my colleagues in the Department of Finance.  As to whether one allows oneself feelings of optimism and pessimism, I do not allow myself feelings of that kind any more.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht</askee>
      <Quest>the amount he expects the Irish Audio-Visual Industry to secure from the Media II 1995/2000 Programme which is worth £320 million across Europe; the plans, if any, he has to run a series of information campaigns on the criteria for EU funding under this Programme to draw the attention of those involved in the Irish Audio-Visual Industry to the different sub-schemes under the EU initiative; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[17549/95]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The total amount of funds available under the MEDIA II 1996-2000 Programme is 310 million ecus, or approximately £250 million, and is by far the largest amount targeted at the promotion of artistic and cultural expression in the European Union to date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that the significant level of <Col N="1617" /> film and television production which is now under way in the State is a strong indication that the industry is well placed to benefit from MEDIA II. Moreover, I am pleased to inform the Deputy that I succeeded in securing important balances in the MEDIA II Programme to ensure that the circumstances pertaining in Ireland will be taken account of in its application.  For example, the MEDIA II decision ensures that countries and regions with low levels of audio-visual production capacity and less widely-used languages will be taken account of in the programme. There is also a particular emphasis on the needs of small and medium-sized enterprises, which is a particular feature of the Irish industry.</P>
    <P>I have to inform the Deputy, however, that while the EU Council of Culture Ministers has adopted the appropriate decisions for MEDIA II, the precise structures and criteria for, and practical application of, the programme have yet to be decided.  In any event, since payments under MEDIA I were made directly from Brussels to film and television practitioners and it is likely that this arrangement will continue in some form for MEDIA II, it is not possible for me to indicate the amount of funds the Irish industry can secure from the MEDIA II Programme. It will depend on the draw down following the applications of the practitioners whom I expect to benefit proportionately more in terms of their preparedness.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamLawlor" hpid="Mr. Lawlor Mr. Lawlor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lawlor</NameTxt>
      <P>As this is aimed particularly at the smaller operator and the less commercial but competent producers of such audio-visual productions, does the Minister feel it would be helpful to hold information seminars, perhaps at a later stage when more is known about the programme from Europe, so that we can maximise the financial advantages?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be of as much assistance as I can in relation to this.  In preparing for the Media II Programme <Col N="1618" /> which represents a considerable increase on Media I &mdash; the receipts on Media I will continue to be available and that should affect the gross sum available &mdash; the Irish position has been that from the outset we were in favour of a five-year programme.  This was not the position taken by every other country. In addition, we were very much in favour of a tiered approach.  I agree with the Deputy that if one were to make the benefits of Media II available for very large productions that would not necessarily be to the benefit of the diversity of practitioners on lower budgets.  That is the significance of the tiered effect that has been built into the programme.  It is a very important programme for us. Media II will be different from Media I in so far as Media I was structured on about 19 sub-programmes whereas Media II will be around three main poles &mdash; development, distribution and training.</P>
      <P>I am confident that the developments in our indigenous industry will ensure a better capacity for drawdown.  There have already been comprehensive consultations with practitioners and the industry in the preparation of Media II and these will prove valuable in the finalisation of details.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister consider incorporating the general philosophy behind Media I and II in the Green Paper on broadcasting?  Does he agree that from the beginning France tried to ensure that the European rather than the American influence on culture would be to the fore in the audio visual sector?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I took a position on these matters at the European Council. Matters came to a head during the concluding stages of the GATT negotiations when it became clear that there was a huge imbalance between the European Union and the United States in terms of the audio visual sector.  For example, exports in this sector from the European Union to North America amount to approximately £228 million <Col N="1619" /> while imports in the other direction are 12 times higher.  This gave rise to questions about cultural domination and whether there should be a concept of cultural exception in this area, in other words it should not be regarded as a commodity which is traded.  I favour this view.  The second issue is the creation of capacity for film production, distribution, etc.  If the production is right the jobs will be in Europe.  The third dimension relates to tailoring the Irish industry and its mixed model through Bord Scannán na hÉireann.  It is more important than section 35 to tailor Media II in such a way that it suits Irish practitioners.  These have been achieved.  It has started from the principle that acknowledges cultural exception and the need to maximise the employment and economic benefits of the cultural industries.</P>

Will the Taoiseach comment on yesterday's remarks by the Minister for Finance who opposed a German proposal to impose fines for breaches of the Maastricht criteria on the grounds that the poorer member states may need to run higher deficits to sustain growth and maintain capital expenditure?

The Deputy is correct that there are two other Bills promised in respect of that Department.</P>
      <P>My only reference to legislation in the broadcasting area related to a general Broadcasting Bill.  I am not in a position to state categorically whether separate legislative changes are specificially necessary for the establishment of Teilifís na Gaeilge.  I will investigate if such changes are necessary and, obviously, will give the Deputy my best estimate as to when it will be produced.  The only listed item of legislation for which a promise was given in the normal way is the general Broadcasting Bill.  I presume that if legislation is needed to deal with Teilifís na Gaeilge it can perhaps be dealt with in the context of the wider legislation, as well as separately.</P>

      <P>I thank all Deputies for their help in passing this Bill expediously. It is important from a budgetary <Col N="1746" /> perspective that the Bill should be enacted and the scheme be operational to allow for the money to be raised for the payment of the equal treatment arrears.</P>
      <P>As I outlined when I introduced this Bill to the House I had several aims in mind in bringing forward this legislation. First there was a need to raise the finance to pay the equal treatment arrears without adversely affecting the budgetary targets we had set ourselves this year.  As Deputies know the cost of the payments this year will be of the order of £200 million.  Of this, £60 million was provided in the budget. However, after the budget the ruling of the High Court was delivered and it was necessary to raise money to meet the payments.  It was necessary to raise the money other than through extra borrowing which would have upset our budget targets and this presented me with an opportunity to help develop the financial markets by means of this new instrument.</P>
      <P>The second aim therefore was to raise the money in such a way as to influence positively the Irish financial markets and their development.  Securitisation is a feature of the markets in the US and the UK and in some other European countries.  I asked the National Treasury Management Agency to develop a proposal to allow securitisation of certain flows of funds based on the local authority mortgages.</P>
      <P>The scheme proposed by the agency was designed to receive a lump sum up-front as a consideration for the benefit of the flow of income from local authority mortgagors to some of the local authorities.  I stipulated however that the scheme should have no effect on the mortgagors nor any adverse effect on the local authorities.</P>
      <P>The Bill now before the House provides the necessary legal framework to enable the scheme to proceed.  The agency has identified the stream of income needed with the help of the local authorities.  In addition, it has developed the bond structure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill has been considered by this <Col N="1747" /> House and I have sought to answer any questions raised because of the complex nature of the area.  I have been open and transparent about all the issues in the Bill.  I assure the House that there will be no change in the rights or obligations of local authority mortgagors or any extra burden on the local authorities.</P>
    <P>The Bill will allow us to meet the equal treatment arrears payments and also help, I hope, to develop the Irish capital markets generally.  I acknowledge the help and assistance I received from all sides of the House in this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>On Second Stage I spoke at some length and outlined a brief history of equal treatment as it affected me in a previous Department. I welcome the fact that the Government has brought the saga of equal treatment arrears for married women to an end. However, this matter has been through so many court cases here and in Europe that one would be loath to predict that there will not be another case or two in future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Second Stage and Committee Stage I pointed out that I would have nothing against the principle of the Government setting off the mortgage book.  Under this Bill the Government has taken unto itself powers to do a number of things.  It is not intended, as the Minister has pointed out, to securitise the whole mortgage book, but about £200 million of the total sum which now stands at about £140 million.  We discussed this at some length on Second Stage when I made it quite clear that I had no objections in principle to the idea of securitisation.  Nor do I disagree that it is the Government's right to pay off the whole equal treatment arrears in one year if it so wishes.  I would, however, quibble with its decision to pay the arrears in one year because it was unnecessary, but it is certainly within the right of the Government to bring the whole saga to a conclusion in one go.  Since the announcement of this matter, I have disagreed with the way it <Col N="1748" /> was put before the people.  I do not want to stand up for one Minister against another but the Minister, Deputy Quinn, has been reasonably open about this matter.  However, when the decision was announced, by another Minister, as to how it was to be done, there was not the same type of openness one would expect from certain Members of the Government.  It endeavoured to create the impression that this would not affect the Exchequer borrowing requirement for 1995 or any other year.  As I stated on Second Stage the Exchequer borrowing requirement, current budget deficit or whatever one likes to call it, amounts to selling off future income to pay a current debt.  One cannot say that the payment of social welfare arrears to married women on foot of the equal treatment directive is anything other than current expenditure.  It is not capital expenditure.  I gave vent to my thoughts on the issue and I upset some Democratic Left Deputies.</P>
    <P>I disagree with the Government selling off a future income stream to pay off current expenditure.  Securitisation of the local loans book was considered by a previous Government.  I am speaking of the period prior to the general election in 1992 when my party stated in its manifesto&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>If under section 3 the Government securitises more of the local loans fund a positive resolution must be put before the House.  I welcome that.  I have heard that in 1996 there will be another effort made to securitise more of the fund to pay for current expenditure.  I counsel against that as it would be a negative step.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister spoke about the development of capital markets and I welcome that.  I do not agree with securitisation if it raises money on foot of capital assets or a future income stream <Col N="1749" /> which is not used for capital and long-term expenditure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with both Deputy McCreevy and the Minister.  I was not present for the Second Stage debate but Deputy O'Malley, in a colourful contribution, ranged far and wide.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>There is nothing wrong with the Bill, rather it is the purpose to which the proceeds are being applied that raises some questions.  The Equality Payments Bill must be defrayed but it is not a happy situation to sell off capital assets to defray accumulated current non-payments over the past number of years.  It is similar to a building society securitising some of its loan book if it did not pay equality payments to its female employees and had a huge bill slapped on it by the Labour Court.  It would be the disposal of a capital asset to pay for something which few accountants would categorise as a capital liability.</P>
      <P>I do not know when arrears crystallise into a capital liability.  If your bank account is overdrawn it is slightly academic whether it is a capital sum or arrears of current expenditure.  You pay interest anyway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy McCreevy that it should have been possible to defray these repayments over a longer period and deal with them by way of current expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The original proposal was to borrow through the NTMA or the HFA and purchase the loan book from the Government.  To pretend that while this might be public sector borrowing it was not Exchequer borrowing was a transparent device that would not fool anyone. I am happier with the proposed <Col N="1750" /> course of action as it has greater fiscal integrity.  There is something objectionable in principle in using discounted future cash flows, which effectively is the disposal of a capital asset, to defray accumulated non-payment of current expenditure liabilities.  From that point of view I echo what Deputy McCreevy said.  This is not good financial management.</P>
    <P>I do not oppose securitisation in principle because I do not see why the Government of the day should retain future cash flows of this kind if it can liquidate them.  The only issue, as Deputy McCreevy stated, is the use to which the proceeds of a sell-off of this kind are put.  If it has been used to reduce national borrowing the money would have been put to proper use. While my party supports the Bill it is not sure that the motive behind it is quite as pure as the wording of the Bill might suggest.</P>

      <P>It is unfair to heap the blame on any individual or Government. The matter dragged on for some time over several Administrations.  It will be a lesson for future Members of this House on how not to deal with a European Community directive.  The sooner difficult items are dealt with the better.  This issue has cost taxpayers a lot of money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope the same priority will be given to social welfare and taxation measures as they are closely linked.  I have tabled a question for written reply today relating to the severity of the taxation system, particularly as it affects the low paid.  It is, unfortunately, true that it does not <Col N="1751" /> pay many people to get out of bed in the morning because it is not worth their while.  There is a substantial disincentive to do so.  We then wonder why the number on the live register is increasing.  We say that there is another register, the labour force register, which we are much happier to look at as the number is about 76,000 lower&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I stand corrected.  The problem is that each of them has to be paid every week and the unfortunate taxpayer has to foot the bill.  I ask the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Social Welfare to attach the same priority to the task of eliminating the many poverty traps within the system because of the taxation policies followed. There has been a lack of determination to do so.  Fiddling around with different registers is not the answer.</P>
      <P>The nub of the problem is that the Minister for Social Welfare decided to play hardball in his first year in office and demanded that a couple of hundred million pounds be spent in the first budget of the rainbow Government. More's the pity as the economy was in good shape due to belt tightening which caused grief for certain sectors.  It will be a pity if there is continued slippage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When in Opposition the Minister for Social Welfare regularly lectured the Government on the importance of publishing the Estimates early in the year. It has been reported in the news columns that while he would agree to a figure of 2 per cent plus inflation he would prefer a figure of 5 per cent.  That is no way to run a Government and it is very selfish of any individual Minister to attempt to do that.  I have great sympathy for the Minister for Finance but for the sake of the economy and future generations this is not the way to resolve the problem, although it is welcome that it is out of the way.  The Estimates should be agreed and published so that they can be the subject of a rational debate.  That is the way to <Col N="1752" /> handle the matter, as the Minister for Finance well knows.  I say good riddance to this matter, but this method should never again be used.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies McDowell and McCreevy for their support in relation to the method of securitisation used. The NTMA route is a more stand alone and self-contained one which meets the obligation and requirement to separate it from additional Government guaranteed borrowing on the one hand and provide a new instrument in the capital markets on the other.  There is a shortage of adequate secure investments and instruments in the capital markets to attract the substantial investment funds within the economy which, by reason of not having an adequate range of secure investments, properly and understandably find investment opportunties elsewhere as they are perfectly entitled to do.</P>
      <P>On the question of paying all the money at once, the budget provision was for £60 million in anticipation of a liability in 1995.  The High Court judgment was handed down within days of the announcement of the budget.  The legal advice was that while an appeal was technically feasible the prospects of winning were negligible.  The probability was that had we appealed the decision &mdash; we were not of the mind to so do &mdash; we would have been obliged immediately to pay out all the money, estimated at the time to be of the order of £260 million, in a lump sum with some interest.  This could have led to additional costs of the order of £80 million, giving a total cost of the order of £340 million.  The Government, therefore, decided to pay out all the money in one go.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There were constraints in calculating how this could be done.  A sum of £200 million has been paid out this year with the balance to be paid in 1996.  It is expected that some small residual payments will remain to be paid in 1997.  All <Col N="1753" /> the money will be drawn from the proceeds to be raised on foot of this securitisation. We did this knowingly because &mdash; Deputy McDowell made this point &mdash; a series of current account payment liabilities had accumulated over time to the point where, whether they were a current or capital liability, the volume of money involved required recourse to a capital sum.  We did so in the manner described.</P>
    <P>I have answered the points raised by Deputies McDowell and McCreevy and also the points raised by Deputy Walsh who expressed concern with regard to social welfare.  As he correctly said, we have resolved this matter once and for all in such a way that all future potential office holders will ignore European Union directives at their peril.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Courts and Court Officers Bill, 1994 was introduced with the objective of improving the courts system.  That Bill which has just been withdrawn from the Dáil contained a number of measures which I have retained in the present Bill with some significant changes and improvements.  The Courts and Court Officers Bill before the House today prescribes alternative and, I think, more effective remedies for the main problem facing the courts system &mdash; the arrears of cases and appeals awaiting hearing before the courts.  It also contains many more provisions which will implement much-needed administrative and procedural reforms to improve the efficiency of the courts system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The system is overdue a full reappraisal and a new approach.  The courts need to be fully equipped to handle modern-day demands and pressures. The courts system has been trying to <Col N="1754" /> provide a reasonable level of service in recent times in the face of many challenges. There has been a marked increase, for example, in the amount of business coming before the courts over the past number of years, in particular more civil actions and personal injuries litigation, more family law business and more criminal cases.  The background to this increased volume is complex, but there are legal, financial, cultural and social factors involved.  Not only is there more business, but the trend is that cases and appeals are more complex now and, therefore, more time-consuming than in the past.  Changes to the limits of the jurisdiction of the courts and developments in the family law area have had a tremendous impact on the amount and complexity of business coming before the courts.  The courts system has not been able to keep up with this growth in the amount of cases and appeals.  That state of affairs needs to be turned around urgently and that is what I am aiming to achieve with this Bill and with further proposals for reforms which I will also outline.</P>
    <P>I was faced with two options on taking office when considering my priorities for legislative reform in the courts and judicial area.  I could keep the substance of the reforms contained in the 1994 Bill on track or I could pause to reflect on the direction those reforms should take.  I took the latter course and decided to take stock.  The programme, <i>A Government of Renewal,</i> contained two key proposals that would have a major impact on the planned reforms. The first was to review the 1994 Bill to ensure in particular that it contained the measures that would best address the problem of delays in all the courts and the second related to a court commission.</P>
    <P>Initiatives in these areas had been proposed in the 1994 Bill.  A new court of appeal was to have tackled the accumulation of appeals awaiting hearing by the Supreme Court.  An advisory commission on the courts was to have been set up.  It is a fair indication of the extent of reassessment of the 1994 Bill <Col N="1755" /> that the present Bill, together with my proposals for the longer-term development of the courts system, differs markedly from what was proposed in these key areas in the 1994 Bill.</P>
    <P>I have adopted a three-pointed approach to reforming the courts service; first, to tackle immediately the problem of delays in the courts by providing in this Bill for 17 more judges; secondly, to implement in this Bill several other changes in courts administration and procedure that will also reduce delays and enhance the efficiency of the courts service; and third, to develop a longer-term approach to improving our courts system.</P>
    <P>On this last point, I will be taking the opportunity to refer in a few moments to the Working Group on the Courts Commission which I recently set up.  It is clear that the pressing matter of delays in the system must be addressed with immediate effect.  This Bill will do that, but it is vital that we address the issue now of what kind of court service we will have in five, ten or 15 years from now.  We cannot lose sight of that.</P>
    <P>The Courts and Court Officers Bill, 1995 will tackle the serious problem of delays in the hearing of actions and appeals at all levels of the court system. Long delays in having cases resolved mean that the system of justice is letting down many litigants, victims of crime and to some extent the community as a whole.  Delays in the courts can also adversely affect the smooth running of the business and commercial sector. This I believe could undermine public confidence in the system of justice.  It is the recognition that justice delayed is justice denied that informs my overall approach to tackling the problems in the courts system.  I see access to the law and recourse to the courts as an important individual right.  The current arrears before the courts means that this right is impeded.  I am satisfied that this Bill will facilitate the exercise of that right.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1756" /> Let me emphasise that it is not simply a once-off clearing of arrears of cases and appeals that is at issue here.  It is also a question of equipping the courts with the organisational systems and resources to dispose of their workload on an ongoing basis once the arrears of cases and appeals before the courts are under control.  I am confident that this Bill will achieve that.</P>
    <P>The 1994 Bill proposed the setting up of a court of appeal comprising of three additional High Court judges to deal mainly with appeals against decisions of the High Court in personal injuries cases and to relieve the problem of delays in hearing appeals in the Supreme Court.  Having reviewed that proposal.  I have concluded that the proposed court of appeal would fall considerably short of the target of clearing the arrears of appeals before the Supreme Court.  I was not satisfied that what would have been an appeal court hearing appeals predominantly from decisions in personal injuries cases could be justified, even though it was also to have incorporated the jurisdiction of the Court of Criminal Appeal. I reached this conclusion following consultation with the senior Judiciary and others.  I was not convinced that the proportion of personal injury appeals that come to a hearing and the nature of those appeals would have generated sufficient business to keep the proposed court of appeal fully occupied.  There was also the risk, I believed, that the proposed court of appeal would generate a further tier of appeals from that court to the Supreme Court.  Such a development would defeat the purpose of the proposed court and would be highly inefficient as it would lead to further delays in the system and greater costs.  I am not going down that road.</P>
    <P>The real pressure on the Supreme Court comes from the very considerable increase in the length and complexity of appeals other than personal injuries appeals.  That same factor equally applies in relation to civil cases in the High Court.  In the Supreme Court, a further factor is that the statutory <Col N="1757" /> maximum number of judges of the Supreme Court has remained static at five, including the Chief Justice, for several decades while the number of judges of the High Court increased at various times over that period from six to the current maximum of 17.  There has therefore been a great increase in the volume of decisions that can be appealed to the Supreme Court without a corresponding adjustment in the Supreme Court to cope with that increase.  Appeals relating to the Constitution or complex appeals against decisions in major commercial law cases often require immediate attention.  We have seen many of these in recent years. The necessary prioritising of business results in other appeals, especially personal injury appeals, being put back.  It is unfair to the individual litigant to have to wait so long for an outcome to his or her appeal.  We must enable the Supreme Court to make inroads on those arrears.</P>
    <P>I have decided in section 6 to provide for an increase of three in the number of Supreme Court judges, bringing the number to seven judges, in addition to the Chief Justice.  Section 7 provides for a major development in the structure of the Supreme Court by enabling it to sit in two divisions at the same time, thus allowing two appeals to be heard simultaneously. This will enable the Supreme Court to sit in divisions of three judges for most appeals or in two divisions of three and five judges where a court of at least five judges is required.  Section 7 stipulates that a court of not less than five judges should deal with matters arising under Article 12 and 26 of the Constitution which refer respectively to the President and to the reference of Bills to the Supreme Court, or a question of the validity of any law having regard to the provisions of the Constitution. Under section 7 of the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Act, 1961 such matters must be heard by five Supreme Court judges.  By virtue of section 7 of the Bill, therefore, the Chief Justice may determine that the full court may sit in such cases.  It is envisaged that <Col N="1758" /> the full court will sit only on rare occasions.  I am convinced that enabling the Supreme Court to hear more than one case at the same time is the most effective way of tackling the arrears of appeals at Supreme Court level and enabling the court to deal with the increasing number and complexity of appeals which must be heard.</P>
    <P>I am advised that the development of a divisional Supreme Court sitting at the same time is consistent with constitutional requirements.  It represents a very significant change in the structure and composition of the Supreme Court, but our Constitution, in Article 36, envisages such developments as it permits the regulation in accordance with law of the constitution and organisation of the courts.  Section 8, which allows the Chief Justice to allocate the business of the court, will help to promote consistent decisions in the vitally important areas of the law bearing on the Constitution. I am assured in any event that a decision of a court &mdash; be it a court of three judges or more &mdash; would be the decision of the Supreme Court, final and conclusive in all cases as is required under Article 34.6 of the Constitution, and, therefore, not open to challenge.</P>
    <P>A further development affecting the Supreme Court is contained in section 2 (1) of the Bill.  This section enables the Government by order, following consultation with the Chief Justice and the President of the High Court, to abolish the Court of Criminal Appeal and to transfer its jurisdiction to the Supreme Court.  It is my intention that such an order will be made when the arrears of civil appeals in the Supreme Court are brought under control.  At that point, I would expect the Supreme Court to have sufficient capacity to allow it to take over the work of the Court of Criminal Appeal.</P>
    <P>Sections 9, 10 and 11 increase the statutory maximum number of judges from 16 to 18 in the High Court, from 17 to 24 in the Circuit Court and from 45 to 50 in the District Court, not including the Presidents of those courts. This is an overall increase of 14 judges <Col N="1759" /> in these courts.  That represents a considerable commitment on the part of this Government to tackling the backlog of cases and appeals before these courts.</P>
    <P>The accumulation of civil business including family law business in the Circuit Court is causing problems for many people.  I am acutely aware of this.  The provision for an additional seven judges in the Circuit Court is a considerable investment but I am confident this will produce a very worthwhile return to the public.  There are two important factors that have brought about the current accumulation of cases in the Circuit Court.</P>
    <P>First, the Courts Act, 1991, increased the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court from £15,000 to £30,000 which resulted in a major increase in the volume of civil business for hearing in the court.  It appears that this increase in court business is permanent and will probably grow.  Civil cases before the Circuit Court are now more numerous, more complex and more time consuming than before.  The second factor at Circuit Court level is the huge increase in family law business.  The Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act, 1989, transferred the majority of family law business in the courts to the Circuit Court.  This, and the fact that more and more people are having recourse to the court in these proceedings has led to a dramatic increase in the volume of family law business in the Circuit Court.</P>
    <P>Delays in the hearing of family law business in a number of Circuit Court venues lead to a significant human cost not only to the parties involved but also to their families.  These developments were not matched in terms of the judicial resources available to the Circuit Court in recent years.  Additional judges in the Circuit Court are badly needed to eliminate the present delays there and to deal with the volume of civil and family business in that court.</P>
    <P>The Courts Act, 1991, also increased the civil jurisdiction of the District Court to £5,000 which has resulted in an overall increase in civil business in the <Col N="1760" /> District Court.  The type of family law cases for hearing in the District Court, for example, barring orders and protection orders are such as merit immediate attention or relief.  The District Court by its nature is intended to provide local courts where legal matters can be heard quickly and without formal pleadings. The provision for five additional judges in the District Court is necessary accordingly to assist in the hearing of civil, family law and criminal cases.</P>
    <P>The appointment of additional judges to the courts is in my view an essential step to turn around the business of the courts and to improve matters in the courts system with immediate effect.  I have also got Government approval for the provision of comprehensive administrative back-up for the new judges.  I should make it clear however that in no way do I see increasing the statutory number of judges as the only solution to deal with the current problems.  This approach will work in conjunction with other reforms contained in this Bill to improve efficiency in the courts.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for an increase of 17 in the number of judges.  I expect that the Government will decide to have all of these additional appointments made as soon as possible after the Bill is passed.  It may be that when the arrears in the various courts are brought under control over time and if the volume of business before the courts settles down it will not be necessary to fill every future vacancy that may arise after that. However, that is something which will only become clear with the passage of time.</P>
    <P>Looking towards the longer-term development of the courts service, I have decided to institute a full re-appraisal of the entire existing courts system.  With that in mind, I got Government approval last summer for the setting up of a Working Group on a Courts Commission.  I set up that group, to be chaired by Mrs. Justice Susan Denham of the Supreme Court, a number of weeks ago.  I made the point at that time that this initiative provides an opportunity for a thorough examination of the <Col N="1761" /> courts system to ensure that it is meeting the needs of today's society.  This development, I have no doubt, will make a vital contribution to the modernising of our courts system.  The group is very broadly representative and I consider that to be essential &mdash; we must have the views and be in a position to draw on the experience of the Judiciary, the legal professions and the relevant Government Departments as well as other types of experience such as that of Women's Aid.</P>
    <P>I have asked the working group to review the operation and financing of the courts system with particular regard to the quality of service provided to the public.  In my view that should be the bottom line for the development of the service.  In the light of that, I have asked the group to consider the matter of the establishment of a commission on the management of the courts as an independent and permanent body with financial and management autonomy in line with the commitment to that effect in the Government of Renewal Programme.</P>
    <P>I have decided that this is a better approach than adopting the advisory model for a courts commission which was a feature of the 1994 Bill.  This Government has taken the view that working towards an independent body responsible to the Government for the management of the courts service would be a more effective and efficient approach.  That strategy, however, needs to be carefully developed in the forum of the working group.  The working group will be well placed to address all of the many and varied issues that I have no doubt will arise.</P>
    <P>This major re-appraisal of the organisation and structure of the courts is long overdue.  It is a development which I am confident, will ensure for the future that our courts system will be able to keep pace with ever-increasing and changing demands on it.  We need a courts service that maximises the use of resources while providing us with a modern and efficient system for the administration of justice.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1762" /> Part IV of the Bill deals with judicial appointments and provides for the setting up of a Judicial Appointments Advisory Board.  This will introduce an important new dimension to the procedure for judicial appointment. Deputies will be aware that the 1994 Bill also provided for the setting up of a Judicial Appointments Advisory Board, and I will be dealing in a moment with a number of important differences between the board as proposed and the one that will be set up under the terms of the present Bill.</P>
    <P>First let me put these new arrangements in some perspective.  The procedure for appointing judges is governed by the Constitution.  Article 35 provides that the judges of the Supreme Court, the High Court and all other courts shall be appointed by the President. That power is exercisable and performable on the advice of the Government.  That fundamental arrangement is of course unaffected by this Bill.  I need hardly say that our Judiciary is widely respected for its integrity, fairness and independence. The focus of these measures is, however, on the Government's role in the process.  Because of the Government's central role in the appointment of judges, there should be guarantees to ensure that procedures to appoint judges are not only appropriate but are seen to be appropriate.</P>
    <P>The Bill introduces a new initial stage in the procedures whereby the advisory board will short-list and recommend barristers and solicitors to the Government for appointment to judicial office by the President.  The scope of this provision as defined in section 12 is similar to that proposed in the 1994 Bill in that new arrangements will not cover appointments to Chief Justice or as President of the other courts.  I think this is a very prudent exclusion because I know that the Government, in considering appointments to these leading judicial posts will want to promote continuity in the courts system.  That is why <Col N="1763" /> section 23 provides that the Government when considering those appointments, shall have to first have regard to the suitability of serving judges of those courts.  Section 17 further defines the scope of the new procedures.  That section provides, in effect, that where the Government proposes to advise the President to appoint a serving judge to a higher court, the procedures of the board shall not apply.  In other words, the new appointments procedures will apply to the first appointment of a barrister or a solicitor as a judge.</P>
    <P>I felt that the composition of the board provided for in the 1994 Bill was not sufficiently representative &mdash; in fact there was no provision for any representative other than the Judiciry or of the legal professions.  The main change I am introducing in section 13 is that I will have the right to nominate three persons to the board.  This will allow me to introduce a wide range of experience into the process.  I am thinking of nominees with commercial, administrative and consumer backgrounds &mdash; in other words those who can represent people who rely on the courts on a daily basis. Representatives of victims of crime, women's groups and perhaps other bodies could bring an invaluable new perspective to the consideration of the suitability of candidates for judicial appointment.  Of course all of those interests could not be accommodated in my first round of nominees but the provision for three year renewable terms of appointment allows the option of introducing a broad range of influence over a longer period of time.</P>
    <P>A further change in the composition of the board is that the Attorney General of the day will be a member.  In my view, the Attorney General of the day is uniquely suitable, with his or her knowledge of the legal profession, to be a member of the board.  Under section 18, the board will be able to recommend the Attorney General for a judicial appointment.  However, when the board <Col N="1764" /> is considering the Attorney for appointment, he or she will be required to withdraw from the deliberations of the board.</P>
    <P>Section 16 provides for the submission by the board of the names of all persons who have been considered by the board for appointment, with the board recommending at least ten persons. Requiring the board to recommend only three to five names as was proposed in the 1994 Bill would restrict unduly the Government's discretion in the matter of judicial appointments which it has by virtue of the constitutional arrangements relating to this matter.  For this reason the board should be required to recommend a reasonable number of names.  I have considered this carefully and I am satisfied that at least ten names is the right formula.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that where fewer than ten persons wish to be considered for appointment or where the board is unable to recommend ten persons, the board may recommend a lesser number of names for appointment.  Where more than one vacancy arises the board will be required to submit at least ten names for each vacancy unless the Minister specifies otherwise.  The intention here is to avoid imposing an obligation on the board to produce a very large number of recommendations which could prove to be difficult, in the event of a number of vacancies arising in the same court.</P>
    <P>The recommendations of the Advisory Board will not be binding on the Government.  That is appropriate, mindful of the constitutional position relating to judicial appointments.  It is nevertheless expressly provided in section 16, that the Government shall first have regard to the names recommended by the board in advising the President on the appointment of a judge.  That is a significant direction to Government and one that highlights the pivotal role I expect the new board to have.  To ensure that the input of the board is on the public record, section 16 also requires that the notice of appointment <Col N="1765" /> published in the <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> shall indicate when a judge has been appointed on the recommendation of the board.</P>
    <P>The 1994 Bill set out a committee system for the nomination of suitable persons for judicial appointment.  I prefer to leave it to the board members as is provided in section 14 to decide for themselves if they want to delegate tasks to sub-committees.  That may well be a practical and workable arrangement to decide recommendations at the different levels of the court structure.</P>
    <P>Section 48 will enable me to provide funds for judicial training courses arranged by the Judiciary.  The provision of suitable courses is necessary to enable judges to keep up-to-date with developments in a range of legal and other areas.  I know that the senior Judiciary have already taken initiatives in this area and funding has already been provided for seminars.  I am particularly pleased by an initiative taken by the Chief Justice who is setting up a Judicial Studies Institute which will have responsibility both for induction courses for newly-appointed judges and continuing courses of education and training for members of the Judiciary.</P>
    <P>Also on the subject of judicial training, under section 19, persons wishing to be considered for judicial appointment by the Advisory Board must agree to take training courses if appointed and if so required by the Chief Justice or President of the Court to which they are appointed.  This is a better approach than that proposed in the 1994 Bill whereby the Minister would make regulations requiring training for candidates aspiring to judicial appointment.  I am sure that would be unworkable, not least because it would discourage well-qualified persons from seeking judicial appointment as they would be required to undertake courses without any guarantee of being appointed.</P>
    <P>Aside from increasing the number of judges, this Bill contained several measures to improve efficiency in the interests of users of the courts.  I will explain the most significant of these. Section 25 will increase the jurisdiction <Col N="1766" /> of the Master of the High Court to enable the Master to deal with a range of applications that at present must be dealt with by judges in the High Court. This will ensure that the fullest possible use is made of the Office of the Master of the High Court in the judicial area. This new business will be allocated to the Master of the High Court for hearing by the President of the High Court. There are of necessity a number of matters that the Master will not be empowered to hear, including criminal proceedings, and these are set out in section 25.  This section also provides that under Rules of Court, additional powers to deal with pre-trial procedures may be conferred on the Master.  That would mean that the Master of the High Court would, under such rules, have jurisdiction to simplify and narrow in so far as possible all the issues which may arise in an action.  When the Master has disposed of pre-trial issues, the action would then be submitted to court.  This will help to keep hearings as short as possible.  The purpose of the provision is to release High Court judges from the time spent on various applications and other matters preliminary to hearing the central arguments in a case and to reduce legal costs.  Section 23 provides for the swearing in of the Master of the High Court in like manner as a judge. This is appropriate as the Master will be empowered to exercise similar powers to a judge of the High Court in certain circumstances.</P>
    <P>Section 33 confers additional powers on county registrars.  A county registrar is assigned to each Circuit Court and his or her function is the control and management of the business of that Circuit Court office.  The Bill confers new powers on county registrars which are set out in the Second Schedule to the Bill. As with the provisions relating to the Master of the High Court, this measure will maximise the potential of the offices of county registrars.  These additional powers correspond to those which are currently exercised by the Master of the High Court in respect of the High Court.  The effect of this proposal is that <Col N="1767" /> county registrars will be empowered to deal with many motions that judges of the Circuit Court are at present required to hear.  County registrars will, for example, be able to deal with motions to remit actions to the High Court, notices for discovery and motions to join a third party.  I am satisfied that this will effect considerable savings of court time, will help to reduce delays at Circuit Court level and should reduce legal costs.  Section 33 also provides that appeals from decisions of the county registrars shall be to the Circuit Court.</P>
    <P>Section 45 gives the Superior Courts and Circuit Court Rules Committees the power to make rules requiring parties in High and Circuit Court personal injuries actions to disclose, without having to apply to court, the reports of experts, such as doctors, whom it is intended to call to give evidence.  This is aimed at speeding up the hearing of actions and should help to reduce legal costs for litigants.</P>
    <P>Currently, appeals in civil cases from decisions of the Circuit Court outside Dublin cannot be heard by the High Court sitting in Dublin.  Section 42 will allow such appeals to be heard in Dublin where the parties consent to that or by the direction of the High Court where the interests of justice require it. This will allow appeals to the High Court to be dealt with more efficiently.</P>
    <P>Section 41 will improve efficiency in the hearing of appeals by the High Court against decisions of the Circuit Court sitting outside Dublin.  The present requirements are very inflexible. For example, the half-yearly sittings of the High Court on circuit must be held simultaneously and the High Court cannot sit in more than one appeal town in any one of the High Court circuits save in exceptional circumstances. These arrangements impede efficiency and the Bill removes those requirements.</P>
    <P>I have been concerned for some time about the ease with which criminal trials, often of very serious offences, can <Col N="1768" /> be switched for hearing from the Circuit Court sitting outside Dublin to the Dublin Circuit Court.  This exacerbates the problem of delay in the Dublin Circuit Court and can be a costly exercise from the point of view of bringing gardaí and witnesses to the Dublin Circuit Court. Under the Courts Act, 1981, once the required notice is given, an application to transfer a trial to the Dublin Circuit Criminal Court is automatically granted. I do not accept that transfers in all these cases can be justified.  There may well be legitimate grounds in certain circumstances to grant an accused a trial before a jury from a region other than, say, where the accused lives.  Section 31 provides that an application to transfer the trial to Dublin will only be granted to the Court if the judge is satisfied that it would be manifestly unjust not to do so.</P>
    <P>The Bill also rationalises the territorial jurisdiction of judges of the District Court.  At present, an accused before the District Court may only be tried in the District Court district where he or she lives or was arrested or where the offence was committed.  This can give rise to inefficiencies and unnecessary costs.  Section 40 will allow for much greater flexibility in the hearing of criminal cases by District Court judges. It will allow for the trial of an offence and the processing of other matters by any District Court judge in any District Court district in certain circumstances.</P>
    <P>A number of the measures in the Bill will have the effect of reducing legal costs by increasing efficiency and speeding up business in the courts.  However, I am acutely conscious of the need for an effective control mechanism in relation to legal costs when costs are in dispute.  The settling of disputed legal cost bills is the function of the Taxing Masters of the High Court.  Significant deficiencies in the powers of the Taxing Masters have been identified following a number of court decisions.  Section 27 will give much-needed additional powers to the Taxing Masters of the High Court, and to county registrars in the Circuit Court, to evaluate solicitors' and counsels' fees and fees charged by <Col N="1769" /> expert witnesses in actions and to allow or disallow such fees.  These powers will also be available to the Taxing Masters in relation to solicitor and client bills of costs.  I am confident that this move will help to restore effective control over legal costs where these costs have not been agreed.</P>
    <P>Section 50 will confer on the Master of the High Court and other court officers the discretion that only judges currently have to order the payment of interest on awards.  The Bill will ensure that a plaintiff who seeks an award of interest will not have to apply separately to a judge at additional cost.</P>
    <P>Under section 46 of the Bill, I will have a new residual power to make party and party costs rules.  These costs are paid by an unsuccessful litigant to a successful litigant.  This power could be used where a court's rules-making body fails to make costs rules or where costs rules are submitted to me which I consider to be excessive.</P>
    <P>Section 36 gives the President of the District Court the power, currently vested in the Minister for Justice, to temporarily assign judges of the District Court.  This is consistent with the position in the Circuit Court whereby the President of that court exercises the power to temporarily assign Circuit Court judges.  At present all of the practical arrangements relating to the temporary assignment of District Court judges are made by the President and I am satisfied that it would be more efficient to devolve my assigning authority in respect of these assignments to the President.</P>
    <P>Under the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Act, 1961, the Minister for Justice, after consultation with the President of the District Court, determines the number of judges to be permanently assigned by the Government to the Dublin Metropolitan District.  At present, the Government cannot permanently assign more than one judge to any other district.  The effect of section 39 is to enable me to determine that two or more judges may be assigned to any District Court district.  The intention <Col N="1770" /> here is to provide for the permanent assignment of a second or subsequent judge to any District Court district where the workload of the court warrants this.</P>
    <P>I would like to mention briefly some important changes relating to the legal profession and the Judiciary.  Under the Bill solicitors will, for the first time, be made eligible for appointment as Circuit Court judges.  At present only barristers are eligible for appointment to the Circuit Court.  This measure widens appreciably the pool of talent from which the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board can draw when making recommendations for appointment to the Circuit Court.  The former Fair Trade Commission in its 1990 Report on the Legal Profession found that experience of court practice and procedure as well as of the law is probably more important than advocacy skills.  I feel that experience of advocacy is one important factor in determining whether a person is suitable for appointment as a judge but I am not convinced that it should be the primary factor.  I am well satisfied that the solicitor's profession as a body possesses the kinds of attributes appropriate to these appointments.  Sections 28 to 30 of the Bill makes provision for this matter.</P>
    <P>Section 47 provides for a retirement age of 70 years for newly-appointed judges to the Supreme and High Courts. The current retirement age for judges appointed to these courts is 72 years. Circuit Court judges retire at 70.  In the District Court, a judge can seek a retirement age extension from 65 to 70.  This new provision for Supreme and High Court judges will, over time, effectively bring about uniformity of retirement ages for judges of all courts.  The 70 years retirement age will not apply to judges who hold office at the time the provisions come into effect, including judges who are subsequently appointed from a lower court to the Supreme or High Court.</P>
    <P>Section 49 provides that the wearing of wigs in court by barristers and solicitors will be prohibited under provisions <Col N="1771" /> of the Bill.  The wearing of wigs by barristers and solicitors in family law proceedings and in the examination of a witness by way of television link in certain proceedings including a sexual offence is already prohibited by statute. The purpose of that reform was to ensure that these proceedings were more informal and I am more than satisfied with the effect of those changes.</P>
    <P>Section 43 of the Bill provides for an amendment to the law in relation to qualification for appointment as a judge of the Supreme Court and the High Court.  The Bill addresses an anomaly under the existing law.  At present, 12 years practice as a barrister is required to qualify for appointment as a judge of the Supreme Court and High Court. Service as a judge of the Circuit Court counts as practice as a barrister. However, service as a judge of the European Court of Justice, the Court of First Instance attached to that court or as an Advocate-General of the Court of Justice does not make up practice as a barrister.  Section 43 deems such service to be practice at the Bar for the purpose of qualifying a person for appointment as a judge of the Supreme Court and High Courts.  A similar provision was included in the 1994 Bill.</P>
    <P>I have already dealt with the measures contained in the Bill to speed up the handling of criminal trials in the courts.  I want to take the opportunity to expand briefly on my further legislative proposals for tackling crime.</P>
    <P>The Government recently approved the general scheme of a Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Bill and this measure is now with the parliamentary draftsman for drafting as a matter of priority.  The Bill will provide for increased powers of detention in drug trafficking cases; the issue of search warrants by Garda superintendents in certain circumstances in drugs cases; and the involvement of customs officers in questioning of suspects detained by the Garda.  I have also requested my Department to review the law in relation to renewal of <Col N="1772" /> licences of premises where the sale and-or misuse of drugs is suspected including an examination of systems of control for unlicensed premises where drug sale and-or abuse is suspected.  This review is well under way.</P>
    <P>A Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill will further improve efficiency in the courts particularly by taking steps to reduce the amount of time which gardaí have to spend in court through, for example, allowing certain evidence to be given by way of certificate.</P>
    <P>A new Criminal Law Bill will place the power of arrest on a modern statutory basis.  A Non-Fatal Offences Against the Persons Bill will involve the repeal of much of the Offences Against the Persons Act, 1861 and will consolidate and update our law in this area. The Juvenile Justice (Children) Bill will be a major reforming measure in dealing with the area of juvenile crime.  A Fraud Offences Bill will amend and update the law on fraud offences with reference to recommendations made by the Law Reform Commission and the Government Advisory Committee on Fraud.</P>
    <P>These are all measures on which a considerable amount of work has been completed in my Department and I mention them briefly in the context of assuring the House that the measure before it today should not be seen in isolation and that I have a major programme of criminal law reform well under way.  We have been working hard with our European collegues in developing anti-crime measures and initiatives and this work will be intensified, with particular emphasis on the drugs front during our EU Presidency next year.</P>
    <P>The operation of the entire legal system can have a very profound and lasting effect on the lives of individuals in the community.  Central to the success of that system is the delivery of justice. That is why an efficient courts system is so crucial.  What I am most concerned with is how that system performs as a service &mdash; that is the issue of real <Col N="1773" /> importance to the individual member of the public.  I am confident that this Bill will set the courts service on course to provide a greatly enhanced service for the future.  I am also satisfied that this progress can be further underpinned by my proposals for the further development of the courts system I have outlined today.</P>
    <P>I look forward to hearing the views of the Deputies today.  I pay tribute to my predecessor, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, who did a great deal of work in preparing a similar Bill in 1994.  It did not reach the debating stage, but if it had I am confident she would have considered a number of the changes I made in this Bill.  I am sure some of her party colleagues who are members of the legal profession would have indicated that some of these changes were necessary.  I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle and the House for allowing me extra time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister also looking forward to hearing what the rest of us will say on the Bill tomorrow and on other days?  I am distressed that she was referring only to Deputies O'Donnell and O'Donoghue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I said I look forward to hearing the views of Deputies today, I also look forward to hearing them on other days.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with the Minister in warmly congratulating Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn who was responsible for all the positive measures incorporated in this Bill.  I will refer later to other measures in the Bill subsequently introduced by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the circumstances I am sure the great giant of English literature, William Wordsworth, will forgive me for saying that one year has passed, one summer with the length of one long winter, since Deputy Owen became Minister for Justice.  The Minister's reign has been correctly described as the &ldquo;year of the criminal&rdquo;.  To date 100,000 indictable offences have been committed under her reign, thousands of criminals <Col N="1774" /> are on temporary release, thousands of crimes are being committed by people on bail and no legislation has been introduced in the House by the Government to tackle a problem that is now seriously out of control.  The &ldquo;year of the criminal&rdquo; has been marked by procrastination on the Minister's part.</P>
    <P>Many people would have believed that the Minister had left the country and abandoned us to our fate were it not for the fact that she was able to initiate or imitate three Fianna Fáil Bills during the year.  None of those worthy Bills dealt directly with the crime problem. Accordingly, Fianna Fáil felt obliged to publish several Bills in which the Minister for Justice did not show any interest.  That did not surprise us but it appalled the public.</P>
    <P>The Courts and Court Officers Bill, 1995 should and would have been introduced in 1994 if the Tánaiste and the Labour Party had kept their word following last year's famous Baldonnel meeting.  Historians, political connoisseurs and cynics alike will recall that the Tánaiste held the previous Administration to ransom in order to expedite as a matter of extreme urgency a similar Bill in 1994.</P>
    <P>It was an urgent imperative for the Labour Party one year ago.  Ultimately, when the tarmac began to run out at Baldonnel, the Tánaiste pressed the ejector seat button and catapulted himself, his party and his flexible priorities into another partnership to avert the unthinkable &mdash; a general election.  Since returning to power, without ever having left it, the Tánaiste marched his merry band of followers into an administration, cobbled together out of chaos and held together with the momentum created by the greatest back-pedalling display ever seen in Irish politics.</P>
    <P>Meanwhile the Courts and Court Officers Bill retained its urgency and importance to the extent that the Government worked flat out to ensure that it would take a full year before a minimally revised Bill saw the light of day.  That is extraordinary when one considers that the Labour Party deemed <Col N="1775" /> this to be an urgent imperative a year ago.  This is not the first time, nor will it be the last, that the Labour leader and his party have made Machiavelli look like a boy scout.  In fact they might consider as their motto for the next general election: &ldquo;Come fly with me but bring your parachute and watch your back on the way out&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Just over a year ago I welcomed many provisions of the Courts and Court Officers Bill, 1994, which was before the House, but I raised some questions regarding the constitutionality of certain provisions which I perceived as having a Labour Party hallmark.  In our Constitution the doctrine of the separation of powers underpins the Government of the State.  There are very good reasons for that.  The Judiciary may not interfere with the Executive and, conversely, the Executive may not interfere with the Judiciary.  In November 1994, on this crucial point, I asked if we were coming perilously close to the Government's role in the appointment of the Judiciary becoming merely interventionist in its scope.  This raised the question of the extent to which the sovereign duty of the Government or the Executive is circumscribed. I warned in November 1994 that the Executive has a constitutional mandate to advise the President on the selection of judicial appointments and the 1995 Bill, on balance, maintains the prerogative.  It is true that the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board's role is advisory only.  Its purpose is defined in section 13 as identifying persons and informing the Government of the suitability of those persons for appointment to judicial office.</P>
    <P>The composition of the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board has been radically altered, under the 1995 Bill, compared with the 1994 Bill.  It is no longer deemed appropriate that the Chairman of the Law Reform Commission should serve as a member of the board; instead, the Minister has proposed the appointment of the Attorney General, the first law officer in the land and the law officer to the Government.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1776" /> That does not say much for the Government's impartiality and the Minister owes the House an explanation in this respect.</P>
    <P>While an Attorney General's competence to advise the Government on judicial appointments is highly desirable, it would be far more desirable if the Attorney General was not a member of the board so that the holder of that office could provide a more independent role in assisting with such appointments.</P>
    <P>In perusing the proposed membership of the board my scepticism is, to say the least, enhanced by the Minister's proposal to appoint up to three persons whose qualifications are not specified. There is no reason given for their appointment and it must be assumed that the Minister intends to appoint three politically partial or favourable individuals to ensure the Government has a representation of 40 per cent on the board.  The original Bill scrupulously avoided any political interference in its proposals.  This lack of partiality is consistent with my party's policy in regard to judicial appointments over the last quarter of a century.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil has a proven and established record of having staffed the Bench with numerous lawyers whose political affiliations were known to apply to other political parties.  These appointments apply to all courts.  As there have been attempts for years to tarnish Fianna Fáil, it may come as a surprise to some people &mdash; but not to the membership of the party and to reasonable people &mdash; that this was and has been the position since the foundation of the party.  This commendable attitude has never applied to the Minister's party during its many years in office.  It is manifestly obvious from the text of the Bill that we can expect no change in Fine Gael's attitude or in that of the Labour Party.  It is a case of more jobs for the boys despite the pretence of what the Minister might claim.  The House is entitled to a satisfactory explanation. I assume that the political &ldquo;yes&rdquo; men have already been selected, <Col N="1777" /> thereby destroying the commendable proposals which my party and the former Minister for Justice, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, made while in Government.</P>
    <P>What exactly was wrong with the original proposal?  The answer is quite clear, that the Bill submitted by Fianna Fáil would have been impartial while the present Bill is designed to kill the spirit of the original Bill and to load the dice in favour of the Government's carefully selected nominees for judicial office.  There is an air of unreality in the requirement imposed on the board.  I refer to section 16, under which the board will have a duty to recommend to the Minister at least ten names in respect of each vacancy for a judicial office.  It is proposed to create an additional three High Court judges and seven Circuit Court judges.  On the basis of this statutory requirement, the board will have to recommend the names of at least 70 members of the Bar, which is slightly less than 10 per cent of the profession. If one excludes the number of barristers who have less than ten years' experience &mdash; and who are not, therefore, eligible for consideration &mdash; we may find that the figure of 70 barristers represents about one quarter of those who are eligible for the Bench.  By widening the net the Minister is deliberately undermining the more considered recommendation in the original Bill where the board was given an option of recommending three, but not more than five, persons for a vacancy.  There can only be one conclusion, the Minister will decide who the judges are.</P>
    <P>While my party stressed the independence of the courts, which was subsequently validated by its hands-off approach to the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board, the Government has made its intentions clear.  It wishes to control the board charged with the recommendation of appointments. Therefore, its recommendations to the President will become predictable.  I stress that I recognise the sovereign duty of the Government to make the appointments in accordance with <Col N="1778" /> Articles 13 and 35 of the Constitution. The position whereby ten names are submitted to the Minister represents nothing less and nothing more than window dressing as we approach Christmas.</P>
    <P>The Government's claim that it is doing all possible to ease the burden imposed by the increased usage of courts facilities has a hollow ring. Deputy Spring and his party sat in Government with Fianna Fáil from January 1993.  I quote from the <i>Fianna Fáil and Labour Programme for a Partnership Government 1993-97</i> to remind the Tánaiste, his Ministers and his party, as follows:</P>
    <P>We believe the independence of the Courts must be enhanced.  We will establish a Judicial Commission comprising the Presidents of the Courts, and the Attorney General.  The Judicial Commission will be independent and will examine and make recommendations to Government on:</P>
    <P> (a)  Overall management of the courts and the streamlining of court services,</P>
    <P>(b)  The fixing of the courts' financial needs for submission to the Oireachtas and the fixing of court charges,</P>
    <P>(c)  The review and reform of Court practices. </P>
    <P>Some recognition was given to this policy document in the Government's agreed policy published in January 1995.  This document envisaged the establishment of a commission as the manager of the courts as an independent and permanent body with financial and management autonomy but, as usual, nothing has been done.</P>
    <P>My party published a Courts and Court Officers Bill in November 1994 and I am not saying it was a perfect example of what such a Bill should contain. Because it was rushed we have to recall it was an urgent imperative for the Labour Party but it was headed in the right direction.  It included a provision for a <Col N="1779" /> courts commission to advise the Government on the organisation and management of the courts and courts service.  It was the intention of Fianna Fáil that a courts commission should be established as a matter or urgency.  The Government's response, in keeping with its overall profile, was to do nothing.</P>
    <P>This Bill is a disappointing successor to an admittedly less than perfect progenitor. It is well known that last year the Tánaiste and his party insisted on the introduction of a less than perfect article instead of waiting for a more carefully analysed product.  This Government has no such excuse.  It has been in office for almost a year and the groundwork for the Bill had been proposed by the Minister's predecessor in office.</P>
    <P>We have witnessed procrastination by the Minister whose sole contribution to the crises involving the administration of our judical systems has been to assure us that she was considering the matter. We have experienced a full year of what I can only describe as masterly inactivity. Absolutely nothing has been done in the past 12 months.  There is no provisions in the Bill for a courts commission. The Minister has decided to make that a separate issue.  In recent weeks the Minister announced she had established a working group to review the operation of the courts.  Why did that take so long?  Fianna Fáil's Bill provided for such a committee.</P>

      <P>I assume it will take six to eight months before the committee completes its deliberations and, presumably, many more months will elapse before the Government gets around to amending its proposals. Meanwhile, our citizens' demands on our courts for their constitutional entitlements to have their cases litigated are denied them.  The delay in processing cases, both civil and criminal, is scandalous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1780" /> In 1988-89 a total of 9,839 civil bills were processed through the Dublin Circuit Court office.  That figure escalated to almost 13,000 in 1993-94.  The Minister informed us on 25 May last that, as of 22 July, there were 8,710 cases listed for hearing in the Dublin Circuit Court. One must assume that by the end of this year that figure will have ecalated to 20,000 and beyond.  The Minister also informed us that the average length of time between the date of notice of lodgment of a notice of trial and the date of hearing of a civil case in the Dublin Circuit Court was 21 months.  I can inform the Minister that the 21 months has become two years.  For High Court personal injuries actions in Dublin there is a wating list of almost three years and in Cork, Limerick and Galway the delay is critical.  It is extremely difficult to accept that the Government is intent on reducing the backlog of cases.  The increase in the number of judicial appointments must go hand in hand with the coherent development of a courts management system.</P>
    <P>The Bill amends the 1977 Courts Act by increasing the number of permanently assigned Circuit Court judges in Dublin to ten.  That is a sound idea but there is a problem.  Unfortunately, there is no facility in the Four Courts to accommodate any extra judges, either High Court or Circuit Court.  The Minister had advance warning of this and, despite that, she and her colleagues in Government &mdash; that includes the Tánaiste and the Minister for Social Welfare &mdash; spent a year in a nightmare dungeon of indolence, opulence and indifference.</P>
    <P>New courts accommodation is urgently required in Dublin but before it is either built or premises are acquired the country must wait for the recommendations of the working group whose brief is to advise the Government on the establishment of a commission on the management of the courts.  Presumably the commission, which may not sit for another year, will then take a further year to provide the additional facilities. By the time the new accommodation <Col N="1781" /> has been provided, the backlog will have increased to perhaps three or four years, yet on 8 June last the Minister told the House that the Courts and Courts Officers Bill would contain measures to deal with the need to tackle the backlog of cases to be heard in all the courts.</P>
    <P>The Bill contains only half measures to tackle the problem.  By removing section 29 providing for the courts commission, the Minister has emaciated the 1994 Bill and the House is left to debate what can only be described as an inadequate measure.  That leaves Fianna Fáil with serious misgivings about the Government's true intentions.  Without the provisions of a courts commission the Government's intentions have been unmasked and the purpose of this Bill is to ensure that the Government gets its nominees onto the Bench.</P>
    <P>The abandonment of a statutory courts commission is another marker for the Labour Party, another dashed promise, another illustration of a battle with its conscience which its conscience lost, another blemish on the steel mirror of openness and transparency it heralded as a new dawn which never broke and never will while the Labour Party is in power.</P>
    <P>One way to get around the inadequate court facilities in Dublin is to provide a High Court judge to be based permanently in Cork.  The High Court sits in Cork for personal injuries actions for a period of nine weeks each year.  In Limerick and Ennis the court sits for six weeks while in Waterford the period is four weeks.  That comprises a total of 19 weeks of sittings by two judges for each sitting.  Additionally, the High Court spends two weeks annually in Cork hearing appeals from the Circuit Court. For the south western circuit, comprising Kerry, Limerick and Clare, the period is almost two weeks.  Waterford has a similar period which has the High Court sitting for six weeks on appeals or 25 weeks per annum for those counties. As the legal year, by which I mean the <Col N="1782" /> number of weeks the courts are in session, of 37 weeks is shorter than the calendar year it will be realised that the High Court is involved in these counties for most of the legal year.  In those circumstances, I strongly advocate to the Minister that there is a need for a High Court situated in Munster.</P>
    <P>We are all well aware of the hardship caused to citizens who are forced to wait for seemingly interminable periods to get their compensation.  Many of them are having to settle their actions for considerably less than full value because the delay imposes an unbearable degree of hardship on them.  The beneficiaries are the insurance companies who, despite their protestations, continue to make record profits annually, and let nobody be under any illusion about that.</P>
    <P>The appointment of extra judges for Dublin is of little use to those whose matrimonial problems, for example, are being litigated in court.  There are approximately 600 judicial separation cases listed for hearing in Dublin alone and, with the passing of the recent referendum, it is clear there will be even more cases.  I understand that the court list is full until this time next year.  If there are no court facilities for additional judges, this Bill, with its inadequate measures, would only amount to a mockery of justice.</P>
    <P>For some reason I can never understand &mdash; I declare my interest in that I am a solicitor &mdash; the present position in Irish law is that solicitors may not be appointed to judicial office in Ireland except to the District Court.  At present, under the Courts Supplemental Provisions Act, 1961, only a person who is for the time being a practising barrister of not less than 12 years standing is qualified for appointment as a judge of the Supreme Court or the High Court, and only a person who is for the time being a practising barrister of not less than ten years standing is qualified for appointment as a judge of the Circuit Court.  This also applies to certain other judicial or quasi-judicial offices.</P>
    <P>While I welcome the provision which will allow solicitors to be appointed to <Col N="1783" /> the Circuit Court, and congratulate the Minister for endorsing Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn's proposal.  I strongly believe that higher courts should not be the preserve of only one branch of the legal profession.  The ban on solicitors becoming members of the higher courts is essentially based on the view that one should have experience as an advocate in the higher courts before being appointed as a judge of the higher courts.  This is a patently unsound argument. If applicants can demonstrate that they have the required intellectual ability, experience, knowledge and character, they should be regarded as qualified for appointment.  This is the view of the law society of England and Wales and of the Incorporated Law Society of Ireland.</P>
    <P>While experience as an advocate is desirable &mdash; I am not denying that &mdash; it should not be regarded as a <i>sine qua non</i> for eligibility.  The best advocates do not necessarily make the best judges and it has to be stressed that some of our best judges did not have distinguished careers as advocates.  The Fair Trade Commission endorsed the view that experience as an advocate should not be the sole criterion for eligibility for judicial office.  The Law Society of England and Wales supported this view and pointed out that there could be disadvantages in not selecting people who have vast experience of dealing with clients directly.</P>
    <P>Heretofore and under the provisions of this Bill, 80 per cent of the legal profession here is excluded from the possibility of ever being appointed to the higher courts, irrespective of their ability, individual merit, academic qualifications or standing or experience within their own profession.  This is unacceptable and downright ridiculous. It is ironic that Ireland was the first jurisdiction in these islands to give unlimited rights of audience to solicitors in courts.  That change was brought about as far back as far back as 1971 under the Courts Act of that year.  I do not have to reiterate that things have <Col N="1784" /> changed dramatically since 1971.  Nowadays solicitors specialise in particular areas of law and some have become acknowledged experts in their field and do their own opinion work.  In addition, many solicitors would happily act as advocates in the higher courts but genuinely feel inhibited from exercising their right of audience because the Judiciary in the higher courts are invariably former barristers.  The Fair Trade Commission acknowledged this difficulty in its report and put its view as follows: &ldquo;We believe that the presence of former solicitors as judges would encourage more solicitors to engage in advocacy since they may well be partly inhibited from exercising their right of audience at the moment because all judges are former barristers, and the possibility of judicial appointment for solicitors/advocates also might encourage more court appearances by solicitors.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In virtually all other common law countries where there continues to be a divided profession of solicitors and barristers, solicitors are eligible for appointment of judicial office on a much wider basis than applies here.  This is so in the Federal States of Australia, in New Zealand and, in general terms, in England and Wales as well.  In Northern Ireland solicitors are eligible for appointment at the level of Circuit Court but there are legislative proposals to amend the law there to bring it into line with the current law in England and Wales.  This will mean that solicitors in Northern Ireland will be eligible for appointment to the higher courts.  In Scotland, solicitors with rights of audience in the High Court are eligible for appointment to judicial office in that court.</P>
    <P>The law should be changed to make solicitors eligible for appointment to all judicial posts here.  This would have the desirable effect of eroding the present rigid lines of demarcation between solicitors and barristers and help to bring to an end any restrictive practices currently extant in the professions.  The exclusion of solicitors from appointment as High Court or Supreme Court judges <Col N="1785" /> is a restraint of trades, excludes new entrants, and is contrary to the common good.</P>
    <P>The rigid lines of demarcation which I have previously referred to between solicitors and barristers should be ended and the professional education of lawyers should be unified in one law school. There should be freedom of movement between one profession and the other. This would open up new opportunities for young lawyers who are at present corralled into one profession or the other irrespective of their talents and ambitions.  Movement between the professions is a desirable objective which can be achieved in this Bill if the political will exists.  If the Minister refuses to entertain my proposal then she is merely underpinning the Bar's monopoly of advocacy in the higher courts and of the appointment of judges to them.  Nothing highlights the anomaly of the present position more than the fact that one must be a barrister to be appointed as a legal assistant in the Attorney General's office but a solicitor can be the Attorney General.  That is extraordinary.</P>
    <P>It is clear that rules restricting movement between both branches of the profession and excluding the appointment of solicitors to the higher courts are outmoded and archaic and have no place in a modern democracy.  For fear the Minister might be feeling optimistic or more light-hearted following my contribution on the elevation of solicitors to the higher courts, let me assure her that I am not interested.</P>

      <P>It is desirable that a person seeking judicial office should attend a course of training after being appointed and not before the appointment is made, as originally required. The new requirement, contained in section 19, is to be monitored by the Chief Justice and the Presidents of the <Col N="1786" /> other courts who will know from experience how these courses should be conducted. I suggest that newly appointed judges might listen to such worthy organisations as the Victim Support Group who are helping in large measure to assist victims of crime.</P>
      <P>I welcome the changes proposed for the Master of the High Court.  The function of this office is not generally known or appreciated.  I am glad that the Master will be entitled to exercise additional powers and functions and I expect that this change will not only enhance the office but will greatly assist the High Court in the exercise of the jurisdiction conferred on the Master.</P>
      <P>I agree with the proposals contained in sections 41 and 42 relating to the High Court on circuit.  As the amount of time for the attendance of the High Court in any one town is very limited, the transfer provisions of section 42 in particular are sensible.  I agree also that in special cases an appeal to the High Court on circuit should be heard by the High Court sitting either in Dublin or in another town sitting in the circuit.  This will reduce the time element in waiting for the appeal.  Allowing for a transfer to either Dublin or another town on the circuit should help to facilitate litigants and their witnesses.  This procedure should be encouraged and I hope it will help to reduce costs.</P>
      <P>Section 43 is an important provision. There are two courts of the European Union.  The Irish judges sitting in Luxembourg have acquired a unique experience in helping to achieve a jurisprudential fusion that is unique in the world.  We must now recognise that the Irish members of these courts can bring a special contribution to our courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 45 (1) proposes that the Rules Committees of both the superior courts or the Circuit Court may make rules to compel parties to disclose certain information without the necessity of making an application in court.  We follow the common law tradition and where a person prosecutes a case, be it criminal or civil, the onus remains on the prosecutor to prove the case.  Some of the <Col N="1787" /> proposed disclosures may be challenged in court.  There is a difference between, on the one hand, seeking particulars of a statement from the Department of Social Welfare indicating what payments have been made to a plaintiff subsequent to an accident and, on the other hand, requiring a party to a case to give the name of a witness or to produce the statement of an expert whose evidence may relate to a medical opinion or requiring an engineer to divulge information of an evidential nature which may have a vital bearing on his client's case.</P>
    <P>The principle of privilege from discovery of documents prepared either during or in anticipation of legal proceedings is long established.  There are numerous High Court precedents recognising the existence of the privileged status of such documents.  Equally, the rule against hearsay evidence is a centuries old tradition which the Minister proposes to abolish.  I oppose section 45 which seeks to abolish the evenlykeeled law of evidence which has served its purpose and which I regard as a cornerstone of our laws.</P>
    <P>I cited my objection to earlier proposals to reduce the retirement age of judges to 65.  It takes some years for a judge to acquire the additional insight that is required of the holder of such an office.  Most judges are well into middle age when they are appointed.  Many judges have delivered remarkable judgments when they were 70 years and over.  There is to be uniform age of retirement of 70, and this is a sensible compromise.</P>
    <P>Barristers are no longer to wear a wig. I will shed no tears at its departure.  The wig served its purpose and its presence has become an anachronism.  I would also recommend to the Minister that the apparel of the Bar should be replaced by a simplified gown more in keeping with the 21st century.  The Bill makes no reference to judicial apparel.  The section should be amended to make such a provision.  Apparently, barristers will no longer wear wigs in court but <Col N="1788" /> judges will continue to do so, and there is no sanction in the Bill which could be imposed on a barrister who arrives in court wearing a wig.  Therefore, I assume that the judge, although himself wearing a wig, will hold the barrister in contempt if he comes into court wearing a wig.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy could say there would be wigs on the green.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>There will be wigs on the green.  It appears that way in many courts.  If wigs are no longer relevant for practice at the Bar, it makes little sense to retain the wig on judges' heads.  The amendment should provide for a new form of judicial gown such as that worn in the European courts or at the International Court of Justice sitting at the Hague.  If this proposal were to be incorporated in the Bill, it would provide a sense of direction for the Bar who could then feel entitled to introduce a similar change in their own attire.  The Circuit Court rules state that judges shall be addressed as &ldquo;a Thiarna&rdquo; or &ldquo;My Lord&rdquo;.  We do not have lords but we have judges and they should be addressed as such.  Given that we are a modern young Republic in the European Union I strongly believe that judges should be called judges, not &ldquo;My Lord&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I am more disappointed with what has been omitted from the Bill than with what has been included.  There is no justifiable reason for omitting a provision in regard to a courts commision. If the Minister was satisfied that she should not include such a provision in the Bill then she should have appointed the working party at a much earlier stage.  If setting up a courts commission is recommended &mdash; and the House knows that such recommendation will be made &mdash; then it will require statutory recognition and we will have to debate yet another Bill, thus prolonging a pressing provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill has been altered in many material respects &mdash; some of these have been for the worse &mdash; since it was first <Col N="1789" /> deemed by the Tánaiste to be an urgent imperative.  I wish to remind him and his party that the poet of the Yukon, Robert Service, once wrote, &ldquo;A promise made is a debt unpaid&rdquo;.  Given that the Tánaiste has not kept his promises to the electorate, as a destroyer is with a lighthouse, he is on a collision course and they are looking for a head.</P>

      <P>When the Bill was published on 16 November I welcomed it as it was long overdue and the State urgently needed to tackle the absurd delays and backlogs which have dogged the justice system over the past ten years by the appointment of new judges and reform of the courts generally.  The delays in the administration of justice have caused injustice and contributed to the high cost of litigation.</P>
      <P>When I examined the Bill in detail my optimism turned to gloom.  Some of its major provisions are very disappointing while those which attempt to depoliticise judicial appointments have been substantially diminished since 1994 when the previous Bill was introduced. That Bill was born out of chaos and the need to put some respectability on the deal agreed by the Tánaiste and others at Baldonnel.  At the time I believed that the proposal to introduce reform in the appointments system for judges was one of the good measures to have come out of that chaos.  During the Second Stage debate of the 1994 Bill there was cross-party support for its substance and the motivation behind it.  The débâcle surrounding the appointments of the Presidents of the High Court during that time brought politics, the Judiciary and the legal profession into disrepute; it was an unseemly affair during which the names of possible nominees for judicial office were bandied about in a very political way.  It would be a welcome step in politics and law if the appointments of judges could be divorced from party politics.  This Bill is disappointing in the sense that it will not divorce party politics from judicial appointments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is ironic that the 1994 Fianna Fáil-Labour Bill was regarded by Fine Gael <Col N="1790" /> and Democratic Left as failing to provide a sufficient degree of accountability. The then Fine Gael spokesperson on Justice, Deputy Gay Mitchell, said, &ldquo;There is a burning desire in the hearts of the people for greater accountability. It is time that became a fire in the hearts of the Members of this House&rdquo;.  I wholeheartedly agree with those sentiments.  I miss Deputy Mitchell's presence on this side of the House where he made such heartfelt pleas for accountability.  It is a pity that Fine Gael's then burning desire has been transformed into this damp squib of a Bill which is worse than the previous Bill.</P>
    <P>The single most important reform the Minister is attempting to introduce is depoliticising the judicial appointments process.  The controversy surrounding the appointments of the Presidents of the High Court in 1994 demonstrated with mortifying clarity the need to provide for a system of judicial appointments which was demonstrably free from political bias.  That squabble diminished everyone involved and it was mortifying to see people's names bandied about politically.</P>
    <P>The principle of judicial independence is central to our democracy.  In the main our judges have served us extremely well and have observed the principle of judicial independence. However, there is something very wrong with a system of appointments when the first point of inquiry by people speculating as to who will fill a judicial vacancy is the political affiliation of prospective candidates.  While political activity should not be a bar to appointment to an important public office such as that of a judge &mdash; it is a civil right protected in our Constitution, while some might say it is a civic duty &mdash; it should not be the reason for the appointment.  For many years the dignity and authority of the Judiciary has been undermined by the linking in the public mind of judicial appointments with political services rendered.  Such a situation should not be permitted to continue.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1791" /> The 1994 Bill provided for the establishment of a judicial appointments advisory board which would sit in committees and would, when a judicial office fell vacant, submit to the Minister a list of three-five nominees who would be suitable for judicial office.  It also proposed that the final decision would be made by the Minister as required under the Constitution.  This mechanism was not perfect and the committee system seemed cumbersome but it was a novel idea.  By and large all parties could live with the Fianna Fáil-Labour proposal for the reform of judicial appointments.  Deputy Gay Mitchell had no problem with the proposal although he lamented the lack of accountability of the proposed board.  With the possible exception of Deputy Gilmore, who seemed to think the number was too high, none of the Deputies who spoke during the debate had any real problem with the proposal that the Minister should make her decision on the basis of at least three to five names supplied by the board.  I would have expected this Government, which came into office on the back of a crisis surrounding a high court appointment, would have been keenly aware of the need to completely divorce the judicial appointments process from party politics.</P>
    <P>Given what appears to have been a broad acceptance by the House in 1994 for a board consisting of senior judges and representatives of the legal profession which would present the Minister with three to five names, it seems extraordinary that we are presented with this proposal.  The composition of the judicial appointments board has been radically altered.  Perhaps the previous Bill could have been criticised on the basis that the board consisted entirely of lawyers, however, this could easily have been remedied by an amendment requiring the appointment of a senior civil servant, such as the Secretary of the Department of Justice or somebody from the Institute of Public Administration and this would have added much needed expertise to the <Col N="1792" /> board without politicising it or undermining its status as an impartial body.</P>
    <P>Under this Bill, however, the composition of the board has been so radically altered as to completely undermine its status as an independent and apolitical body.  The board has been transformed into something so political and so crammed with people with party political affiliations as to call into question its very purpose.  It is proposed to add the Attorney General to the board.  I appreciate that the Attorney General is an independent officer under the Constitution&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Experience shows that Attorneys General by virtue of the manner of their appointment are inextricably enmeshed with the politics of Government.  The Attorney General is legal adviser to the Government. Attorneys General are political appointees and are highly likely to take a political view on the appointment that should be made.  To appoint a person with known political affiliations to a supposedly non-political body is a nonsense and fatally undermines the capacity of the board to make independent and apolitical decisions.  This is compounded by what is contained in section 13 (2) (c) under which three members of the board are to be appointed directly by the Minister.  This is an extraordinary change.  The section is silent as to what these people might be.  The Minister has given some indications in her speech of the categories <Col N="1793" /> from which they may be drawn but the Bill does not require them to have any special skill, special knowledge of the courts or the legal system and does not require them to have any special insight into what it takes to be a good and fair judge.  It is totally in the Minister's gift. The Minister has discretion to appoint anyone she likes, they may be people of excellent experience or of none; they may be political &ldquo;babes in the wood&rdquo; or diehard political hacks but all we know about them is that they will have 30 per cent of the board's voting power.</P>
      <P>That is not all that is wrong with the Minister's proposal.  Not only do we have an appointments board, 40 per cent of whom are political appointees of one sort or another but this highly political body is required to come up with not three to five names as originally proposed but with a minimum of ten.</P>
      <P>Deputy Eamon Gilmore, now a Minister of State and I presume a supporter of this Bill could not have put it better during the debate of 2 November 1994 on the Courts and Court Officers Bill, 1994, Official Report column 1429 volume 446 when he said:</P>
      <P>The concept of a judicial appointments advisory board contained in the Bill is acceptable in principle provided three criteria are met &mdash; first, that it covers all judicial appointments without exception; second, that the Government is prepared to abide by it and, third, that it is structured in a democratic way and is empowered to make specific recommendations to the Government, not a panel of three or five prospective judges given to the Minister who, in the time honoured tradition, may pick from it the person who is closest to the political party in power at the time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A party that considered an appointment system whereby three to five names are put to the Minister to be open to abuse and termed the 1994 Courts and Court Officers Bill as &ldquo;all white feather and no red rose&rdquo; should now be happy to weigh in behind a system which requires a <Col N="1794" /> board &mdash; a board packed with the Minister's pals &mdash; to forward a minimum of ten names.  In the course of her Second Stage speech today the Minister unconvincingly said that three to five &ldquo;would unduly restrict the Government's discretion&rdquo;.  The Minister, having fatally undermined the status, authority and independence of the judicial appointments board, having transformed it from a genuinely non-political body into a body packed with Government supporters&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;is now proposing to take its job away from it.  Under the 1994 Bill the proposed appointments body was demonstrably free from political involvement.  Furthermore it had a real function to perform: not only was it required to receive and scrutinise applications it was also required to weigh, consider and filter them.  It was required to look at the totality of applications and come up with three to five suitable names.  This limited number of names required active consideration of the merits and demerits of the applicants. Under this Bill the board will be required to come up with a minimum of ten names for each appointment.  This is a huge number of names as has been pointed out and it could empty the bar library.  In ordinary circumstances most legal practitioners would be hard pressed to come up with the names of more than five or six senior practitioners who would be willing and able to take on the onerous duties of a judicial appointment.</P>

      <P>Under this provision the board's main function will be to receive applications.  It may occasionally have to filter out a non-starter but in the main it will be so hard pressed to come up with the requisite number of ten that it will simply pass on every application that satisfies the basic criteria.  It will not <Col N="1795" /> consider, filter and weigh up the merits of one candidate against another.  It will receive applications and pass them on to the Minister, in other words the board will be no more than a glorified post box.</P>
      <P>The Minister will have plenty of choice with ten names for each appointment. Having received the list of names, the Minister will &mdash; as Deputy Gilmore said in November 1994 &mdash;&ldquo;in the time honoured tradition pick from it the person who is closest to the political party in power at the time&rdquo; and if she cannot find the right person from the list of names put forward she need not worry because under section 16 (6) the Government is under no obligation to select any of those candidates, so long as it considers them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>It places on a statutory footing the link between politics and the Judiciary which former generations of politicians were embarrassed to admit existed.  How can the Minister say the judicial appointments procedure proposed in the Bill is an improvement on what was proposed before?  I cannot see how she can say it is more fair, more <Col N="1796" /> balanced, less political and more transparent when she is proposing that a minimum of ten names be put forward by the board.  How can she say that a proposal which permits her to hand 30 per cent of the voting power of the board to her appointees is more fair and less political than the previous proposal? What is the purpose of forwarding ten names?  Nobody now in Government suggested there was anything wrong with the proposal from the then Fianna Fáil-Labour Administration or that there was a problem with the system whereby a list of three to five names could be put to the Minister; nobody suggested there was a need for the judicial appointments board to include ministerial appointees among its members.</P>
      <P>Another aspect of the Bill that mystifies me is the failure to deal with the Presidency of the High Court or with promotions in the Judiciary.  During the Second Stage debate on the 1994 Bill there was unanimity that the Office of President of the High Court was an office which ought to be subject to the new appointments procedure.  The then Opposition Member, Deputy Gilmore was particularly energised when he said, as reported at column 1421 volume 446 of the Official Report:</P>
      <P>The most remarkable feature of the Bill before us is that although it emerges from the row over the Presidency of the High Court, and ostensibly it is to provide for new procedures for judicial appointments, it expressly excludes from its terms of reference the High Court Presidency. ... That is an omission which this House might hope to correct and certainly I will be tabling an amendment on Committee Stage to include the High Court Presidency,...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope I can rely on the support of the Minister of State, Deputy Gilmore, when I table similar amendments on Committee Stage.  The Bill should deal with the appointment process for the President of the High Court and other <Col N="1797" /> courts.  It should also deal with promotions within the courts system and there should be a provision to assist the Judicial Appointments Board to achieve a gender balance in the people it recommends. Surely a few women should be included in the ten appointments.</P>
    <P>In many other respects the Bill represents a lost opportunity.  It concentrates to little purpose on the manner in which judges are appointed but fails to deal with the conditions under which they serve.  The courts system is the Cinderella of the public services.  While judges in our superior courts are supposed to have the authority and status of Ministers, they do not have the support and back-up services of programme managers and so on.  This matter should be examined.  Our courts service would be much more efficient if judges were provided with proper back-up assistance. As this is the norm in other jurisdictions, it is ironic that we supply our judges with a ceremonial tipstaff &mdash; a crier &mdash; but not with proper research facilities.</P>
    <P>In line with other public servants, judges should retire at the age of 65 and it is a missed opportunity not to have dealt with this issue in the legislation. There is no reason judges should be exempt from the normal rule that requires public servants to retire at the age of 65.  At present the Judiciary has an increasingly youthful age profile but in 15 years' time our superior courts will be dominated by people of advanced age.  Is this what we want?  When the Minister stated she consulted widely with the Judiciary on this legislation, she may have consulted with them too extensively in regard to this provision.  It is in the public interest that judges should retire at the age of 65.  Their reservations about pension entitlements should not be a reason for the Government failing to grasp the opportunity to introduce a lower retirement age for judges.  Pension matters could be dealt with without compromising the paramount public interest factor of putting in place a useful Judiciary not comprising judges over 70 years who are passed <Col N="1798" /> the intellectual and energy levels required to carry out their duties properly. The argument that many judges over 65 have a wealth of experience to bring to bear on cases could be made in respect of any person who has worked in a job for approximately 40 years.  It is true of senior civil servants, teachers and nurses and, therefore, judges should not get special treatment.  I do not agree with changing legislation to suit the earning patterns of the senior Bar and the pension concerns of judges.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision that allows solicitors to become Circuit Court judges.  If solicitors are permitted to appear as advocates before all courts and are considered competent to be appointed as judges of the District and Circuit Courts, why should they be barred from appointment to superior courts?  This is an anachronism in this day and age.  Solicitors have a wealth of experience, particularly in the area of family law, which should be tapped. There is a crying need for judges with specialist knowledge in family law, particularly as divorce will soon be available in our jurisdiction.  Many solicitors in Dublin alone appear in family law courts on a daily basis.  Why deny them the opportunity to apply for appointment to the benches of the superior courts when their skill, knowledge and expertise is desperately needed?  There is not parity of esteem between the two professions.  By excluding eminently qualified solicitors from the possibility of being considered for judicial office, the Government is pandering to Bar élitism.  This is a shame and much of the legislation reforming the courts and the justice system tends to pander to the élitism of the Bar.  Now that the Government has bitten the bullet in allowing solicitors to become Circuit Court judges, there is no justifiable reason for excluding them from consideration for higher judicial office.</P>
    <P>There is another glaring omission from the Bill in respect of the working group on the courts commission.  The <Col N="1799" /> previous Bill proposed the establishment on a statutory footing of a commission to examine all aspects of running our courts.  The appointment of such a body has been desperately needed for years.  While the working party has been established by the Minister, because of its exclusion from the Bill it lacks a statutory basis.  The commission should be put on a statutory footing under the provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Overcrowding in court lists has reached a crisis and the system is unable to cope with the numbers.  The position has deteriorated significantly since the joint solicitor and Bar proposal was submitted to the Government two and a half year ago and is particularly acute in the area of family law.  In a country that claims to value the family and has given many guarantees in that respect in recent times, it is unacceptable that battered women, abused children and men and women seeking justice in the area of family law may have to wait years to have their cases heard.  I understand that more and more women are applying for barring orders and maintenance under the jurisdiction of District Courts rather than becoming involved in costly judicial separation actions which are outside their income capacity.</P>
    <P>While it has not been mentioned in the Bill, the question of courthouses must arise when one speaks of the appointment of additional judges.  Do we expect newly appointed judges to operate in the existing accommodation chaos?  In other jurisdictions courthouses are important civic buildings which reflect their constitutional status, but many of them here are inadequate. In some rural areas courts sit in night clubs and dance halls and, in many cases, consultation facilities do not exist. While the proposal to appoint additional judges is welcome, where will they be accommodated?  What services will be provided for them?  The Minister must indicate the Government's commitment to providing accommodation and back-up services for those new appointees.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1800" /> In the superior courts there is a pressing need for some sort of centralised authority, such as exists in Northern Ireland, to deal with the administration of the courts service.  This would take an onerous administrative burden off the shoulders of our already overworked and hard pressed Judiciary. The Minister has already set up a working group under Mrs. Justice Susan Denham with a brief to ensure that the system meets the needs of today's society.  This is welcome but it should be put on a statutory footing.</P>
    <P>This Bill fails in its main purpose which is to divorce party politics from judicial appointments.  This Bill is being rushed through all Stages so that a judicial appointment can be made without delay.  There is a degree of ad hockery and a lack of forward planning.  I sincerely regret that this is very much a dilution of the previous Bill which was one of the good things to have come out of the chaos of last November.</P>

We have a problem with long delays and more High Court and Circuit Court judges are required. The situation has come about because we have an epidemic of compensation cases and family court cases which did not occur up to ten or 15 years ago.  No matter what happens to anyone anywhere, compensation is immediately sought and until such time as we address that issue long court delays will continue.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill will give the Garda much more power in dealing with drug <Col N="1803" /> enforcement.  That is long overdue. Every village, town and city is now virtually awash with drugs.  At least, the Garda can now have a greater involvement and can become more effective in bringing drug pushers to court more easily.</P>
    <P>Under the terms of the Bill, gardaí will not have to spend so much time in court because, by swearing an affidavit, they can be out doing what the public expects them to do.  Gardaí spend far too much time in courts giving evidence day after day.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides for certain cases to come before local courts instead of being heard in Dublin, thus cutting the costs involved.  One case &mdash; which I am not going to go into in detail but which arose near my home area &mdash; involved 60 witnesses who had to travel to Dublin for near two weeks.  What did it cost the State?  There was no conviction but the point is that the case should have been heard where the people came from.</P>
    <P>The removal of wigs should have taken place long ago to make courts more pleasant places for witnesses.  It has already come into effect for cases dealing with children.  The wigs should be removed in all cases because they create an impression that those wearing them are very special and are above ordinary people, which I do not accept.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanMcGahon" hpid="Mr. McGahon Mr. McGahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGahon</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill.  We seem to lag behind other countries in identifying the need for victim support.  I commend Deputy O'Dea on bringing in the Bill. Coming from a city with an unenviable crime reputation he knows a thing or two about the issue.  I come from a town which is in the same category.  Last week in Dundalk three people were stabbed on three consecutive nights, a young lady was raped and there was an armed robbery.  That level of crme is totally unacceptable.</P>
      <P>In the early hours of Saturday morning and Sunday morning Dundalk is a hell hole as buses disgorge passengers returning home from discos.  All Members share a common approach to drug trafficking. The day will come when people must address the entire drug problem and many discos, which undoubtedly are the fairground and trading post for much drug trafficking, will be closed down.  Far from being an amenity for young people discos are hell holes.  I hope the gardaí will scrutinise them over the next few years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>After many years of listening to people make apologies for the perpetrators of crime it is nice to know that the Department of Justice has identified the need to help victims of crime.  For many years they were ignored.  Thousands of crime victims must have suffered great distress and trauma.  I spoke tonight to a friend of mine who is a garda and said the extent of the trauma experienced by crime victims is incalculable. It is not only people who have suffered personal assault who need counselling; those whose houses are burgled are also traumatised.  Elderly people who have great pride in their homes and may have spent their lifetime making them comfortable experience great <Col N="1805" /> stress when their homes are defiled.  I commend the Minister and Deputy O'Dea on identifying this area as one where further progress must be made.</P>
    <P>I regret the confrontation aspect of politics and would like to see consensus politics on this matter.  The Government should accept Bills of this nature as far as possible rather than prevaricate and say that while it accepts the spirit of the Bill, it is not quite right.</P>
    <P>Funding in this area is totally inadequate. The State accepts that victims of crime need to be helped but the amount of money provided is petty cash by any standards.</P>
    <P>Special training is now provided for ban gardaí to enable them deal with sex offences and offences concerning young children of which we see all too much in today's society.  That is a worthwhile development.  When a person's home is robbed the gardaí call and provide him or her with the name of various counselling services.  It could be argued that there should be provision for specialist counselling within the Garda but health boards provide that service.  There should be more trained counsellors to help the victims of crime.  In the past people were left without any help or acceptance of the fact that they suffered great stress and trauma.</P>
    <P>The Minister accepts the spirit of Deputy O'Dea's Bill and believes she can upgrade it.  I wish her well in her efforts and hope she will co-operate with and involve him in consultations. He could counsel her on what is needed in this area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Byrne.  I support any measure which provides assistance and compensation for victims of crime.  The Bill contains a number of provisions which will make a positive contribution to those directly affected by crime.  I welcome these measures and congratulate Deputy O'Dea on his excellent work.  I hope the Bill is accepted and becomes a vital part of our legislative framework as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1806" /> Before discussing specific aspects of the Bill I will briefly consider the social context within which we are evaluating these proposals.  In certain ways our society is becoming more advanced and progressive with each passing day.  In the area of technology, for example, we continue to make significant strides in process control within our various manufacturing industries and information management through the use of modern computer equipment.  Steady progress is also being made in the area of health care with previously unknown medical procedures becoming routine. As a result our people are, thankfully, living longer and more vigorous lives.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, there are developments in modern society which are totally opposite to the overall positive nature of change.  We have witnessed in particular a major deterioration in law and order in recent decades.  Crimes, such as murder and rape, were relatively rare up to recent times while the vast majority of other crimes were of a relatively minor nature and rarely involved acts of violence against the individual. Times have changed dramatically, however.  One cannot now open the daily newspaper without being assaulted either by accounts of recently committed crimes or by graphic details of court hearings of serious crimes.</P>
    <P>The list of appalling crimes is endless, whether it involves murder, manslaughter, rape, serious bodily harm, sexual abuse of a variety of types and severity, drug abuse, drink driving, joyriding or domestic violence.  No section of society is immune from violence from the youngest innocent child to the frail and largely defenceless elderly person.  Rather than stabilising the pattern towards increasing crime is firmly established.  The current year has been particularly depressing in that regard.  One has only to review the events of the past week when three people were gunned down without mercy in the Dublin area alone to realise that contract killing is increasingly being seen as a routine method of settling scores.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1807" /> The criminal consequences of increasing drug usage are becoming the single most alarming threat facing modern society.  Daily we read statistics relating to the enormous amount of money required to feed a serious drug habit.  In the vast majority of cases the drug user must resort to crime to obtain the necessary funds for the daily purchase of drug supplies.  It has been estimated that there may be as many as 5,000 hard drug addicts in the Dublin area alone.</P>
    <P>This House, and the Government in particular, have a grave responsibility to offer comprehensive protection to each and every law abiding citizen.  It does not require much analysis to clearly establish that the people are not being well served.  Despite the ever increasing amount of legislation and the sterling efforts of our excellent law enforcement agency, the ordinary citizen is subject to a real risk of becoming a victim of serious crime at any time, on the streets and in the home.</P>
    <P>The crime problem is intolerable and the Minister for Justice in particular has an enormous task ahead of her to ensure that the upward pattern is, initially, halted and subsequently reversed.  The successful tackling of this huge and vital challenge will require a level of assessment, planning, implementation and monitoring which has been noticeable mainly by its absence to date.  Every responsible person must, however, wish the Minister an early and significant breakthrough in her work.</P>
    <P>The number of victims of crime is increasing rapidly and there is absolutely no evidence that their urgent needs are being addressed by the Government.  The Victim Support Bill is, therefore, particularly welcome and a heartening indication that the just requirements of those who have been hurt and abused are at last being given their rightful priority in our legislative programme.</P>
    <P>The first reaction of most non-legal people on reading the Bill is shock that its many excellent provisions are not already fully enshrined in our criminal <Col N="1808" /> law.  Section 2 recommends a number of legal entitlements for the victims of crime.  It begins by proposing that every victim, as a matter of law, should have the right to be consulted by the prosecution in relation to any pre-trial procedures. This is both correct and just.</P>
    <P>The remaining provisions of the section outline the clear rights of natural justice of the victim in relation to free legal advice, the arrangement of appropriate counselling and the careful preparation of a victim impact report to enable the judge to assess the full mental and physical consequences of crime for the victim.  Each of these provisions is necessary and just, particularly in the context of violent crime.</P>
    <P>Section 3 is made up of a number of vital support mechanisms for the victim in terms of obtaining information on the processing and outcome of their case. Sometimes the initial damage to the victim is further aggravated when they are not kept fully informed of the overall management of their case.  The original injury and the unfortunate frequent delays in the over-burdened courts system are sufficient crosses for the victim to bear without having to deal with the inadequate information on a case which, in many instance, is both dominating their lives and casting a dark shadow over them.  I particularly welcome each of the nine proposals in this section.</P>
    <P>Yet another highly desirable provision is recommended in section 4 for the victim of sexual abuse.  It is vitally important that every support is given to the victim to obtain full civil as well as criminal justice subsequent to their horrible experience.</P>
    <P>I am particularly supportive of sections 5 to 7, inclusive, which deal with the imposition and allocation of fines and levies on those found guilty of crime and which address the need to ensure the maximum provision of funds to the Criminal Injuries Compensation Tribunal.  While custodial sentences will undoubtedly continue to play a vital role in terms of both punishment and deterrents, it is essential that the victim of crime receives full compensation <Col N="1809" /> directly from his or her attacker where possible.  The simple message that crime does not pay must be made absolutely clear to anyone with the slightest tendency towards criminal behaviour.  This Bill is an excellent statement and offers practical support and consolation to the all too many victims of crime.  I am happy to support it.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy O'Dea on introducing this Bill.  In recent weeks I spoke in the debate on the Bill introduced by Deputies Eoin Ryan and O'Donoghue which the Government decided to accept.  I said on that occasion that I thought it was a good indication that the House was becoming more responsible in its approach to legislation produced by the Opposition which, up to now, tended to be shot down automatically.  It seems that Deputies O'Dea and O'Donoghue got lucky.</P>
      <P>Whenever we listen to reports of crimes on radio and television the reporter, having giving details of the crime committed, finishes off by saying that &ldquo;nobody was hurt&rdquo;.  That really annoys me.  How can anyone make such a statement?  Just because no bone has been broken and no blood has been spilled it does not follow that no one has been hurt.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, there has been a major increase in crime throughout the country.  In this Bill Deputy O'Dea asks us, as legislators, to face up to the problem and accept that victims deserve and need the support of the State.  We must treat these people in a caring and sensitive way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the past ten years there has been no provision in Irish law for the payment of compensation in respect of pain and suffering to the victims of crime. The only financial support available is out-of-pocket or medical expenses. Most European countries have some provision for the payment of damages to victims.  At a time when the Government is telling us that we have to keep up with Europe in so many other ways it is ironic that when Deputy O'Dea <Col N="1810" /> introduces this legislation the instant reaction of the Minister for Justice is to pick holes in it.</P>
    <P>A woman who has been cooking, baking and making sandwiches to supplement her income is asked to close down because she no longer meets the hygiene standards laid down by Europe. When Deputy O'Dea introduces a Bill, which is in line with legislation passed by other EU states, the Government says it cannot accept it for some other reason.  While our membership of the EU has been of overall benefit, some of these needless restrictions serve only to annoy and frustrate.</P>
    <P>There can be little doubt that the public has lost confidence in our system of justice.  The perception among the majority of people is that the law favours the criminal.  Since the 1970s when free legal aid was introduced, great emphasis has been placed on ensuring fair play for the accused.  Unfortunately, little attention has been given to victims. If justice is to be done, surely it is as important to provide aid for the victim as well as the accused.</P>
    <P>I remember my first visit to a court. I found the atmosphere unnerving and intimidating.  It is not a place to which a person can come for the first time and feel relaxed.  When my case was over, I realised I should have prepared for the occasion.  The same applies to most other people who face a court for the first time.  If we are intent on ensuring justice is done, it is important that this preparation be provided.</P>
    <P>Deputy Wallace spoke about child sexual abuse.  One of the cornerstones of any caring democracy must surely be reflected in how its laws seek to support its children and protect them from abuse of any kind.  In this regard, the recent flood of revelations of child abuse, many of them going back years and even decades, has thrown up an enormous challenge to the limitations of existing civil law and the ability of the judicial system to administer justice in such circumstances.  Clearly it poses a number of fundamental questions.</P>
    <P>The existing common law with regard <Col N="1811" /> to trespass to the person may or may not be adequate to deal justly with the rights of victims in sexual offence cases. No such case has ever been brought to the courts, although there have been a number of out of court settlements. Section 4 (1) establishes clearly in law the rights of such victims and puts this issue beyond doubt.</P>
    <P>Surely to do anything less than enshrine in our laws a full, unequivocal affirmation of the rights of sexually abused victims to bring a civil action for damages against a perpetrator of such an offence is to send out a sinister and dangerous signal from this House.  At the very least, it is the denial of a basic civil right, it immediately has the effect of trivialising such an offence in our civil law and it serves to heap further trauma on an already highly traumatised victim. In effect, it is tantamount to telling victims that if the criminal law can deal with the offenders, we are not interested in their well-being.  Such an attitude is unacceptable.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Government to consider this Bill which Deputy O'Dea spent so much time preparing.  There is a great need for it and this need will increase with time.  I call on the Government to bring forward its own legislation on this issue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. H. Byrne Mr. H. Byrne">

      <P>I commend Deputy O'Dea for the concern he has shown introducing this Bill and on his knowledge of the legal system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The criminal justice system further victimises the victims of crime.  Crime, unfortunately, is a growing and increasingly profitable business.  Statistics clearly show that an average of 400 crimes are committed every day; only 300 are reported.  This is an indictment of our policing system.   Of the 300 reported crimes, only 100 are detected and convictions are brought in only 50 of the detected crimes.  Seven out of eight times a crime is committed, the criminal makes a 100 per cent profit; only one in eight cases results in a conviction. This is not encouraging. <Col N="1812" /> Because of the lack of prison spaces, prison sentences are increasingly devalued penalties.  The Minister for Justice has a stash of solutions, none of which contains the only measure which will make any real difference, that is, the provision of more prison spaces. Creating new powers to deal with criminals in the one in four crimes which are detected is an academic exercise if there are no prisons to incarcerate convicted criminals.  The Minister has adopted the Lanigan's Ball concept.  Some prisoners are no sooner in than they are out again. There is a greater turnover in the prison system than there is in Dunnes Stores. Government policy is putting the cart before the horse.</P>
    <P>Replies to parliamentary questions and letters which I have received from the Minister demonstrates the gap between Government rhetoric and the reality faced by real people.  I was assured that policing arrangements in a particular village in Country Wexford were adequate.  The Minister's arrogance was outstripped only by her blandness.  This village, concerns about which were recently articulated in the Dáil and were in turn arrogantly dismissed by the Minister, has since been hit by a wave of crime.</P>
    <P>I am talking about Clonroche.  One business there has been burgled six times in three years, twice in eight days. If the Minister imagines that policing is adequate in Clonroche and places like it, what is her concept of adequacy? The people in the communities I represent do not think the policing arrangements are adequate.  In Clonroche and elsewhere people are angry with the Government's arrogance and indifference.</P>
    <P>I recently received a letter about Clonroche from the office of the Minister for Justice.  This letter states:</P>
    <P>The Minister has been in touch with the Garda authorities on the matter as they are responsible for the detailed allocation of Garda manpower to individual areas.  They inform her that under the Community <Col N="1813" /> Policing Initiative for Rural Areas, Clonroche forms part of the Enniscorthy Garda District.  The main idea behind the Community Policing Scheme is that the manpower and other resources of a number of small stations are combined in order to improve the police service to the district as a whole.  This enables the Garda authorities to deploy their members to better effect throughout the district and provide the maximum level of service to the public.</P>
    <P>There is currently one garda allocated to Clonroche.  [He lives 15 miles away in Wexford.] In addition, there is a Garda Sergeant stationed at Enniscorthy station with responsibility for the Clonroche and Kiltealy sub-districts. The Garda authorities report that the Clonroche area is regularly patrolled by members from Enniscorthy station and by the Traffic Corps based at Gorey.</P>
    <P>The Garda authorities are satisfied that the current policing arrangements for Clonroche are adequate to meet the policing needs of the area and it is not intended at present to allocate additional manpower to the station. They are keeping the situation under continuing review and any changes considered necessary will be made.</P>
    <P>One premises in my area was burgled on two occasions in the past two weeks. I am on fairly good terms with all the gardaí in County Wexford and, like all public representatives, I meet them very often.  However, I have yet to meet a garda who accepts that the arrangements are adequate.  I am informed by my colleagues from all over the country that they too receive similar responses to their requests for extra policing.  I would ask the Minister what is the origin of the statement we read so often&mdash;&ldquo;policing is adequate to the needs of the area&rdquo;.  If it is not the gardaí who write that phrase, and I am sure it is not, from where does it come?  I do not think I have ever accused anyone, in this House or outside it, of telling lies, but tonight I am tempted to do so.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1814" /> For every crime committed there is at least one victim &mdash; in the majority of cases there are many victims.  I met a garda at a football match last Sunday and we discussed the proper and best method of policing.  The garda living in the area will gather an enormous amount of intelligence.  He is probably involved in the local GAA club or is a member of the many other clubs in the towns and villages.  He is know to everyone in the area and, as has often been said, he knows everything about everyone because he is trusted.  On the other hand, the garda resident outside the area does not enjoy that trust and cannot gather the same level of intelligence. As a consequence crime is rampant.</P>
    <P>The occasional visit of a patrol car is farcical.  That would-be criminal waits for the car to leave the village, knowing that it is unlikely to return that night, and sets out to prey on his victim.  The Minister is fighting a losing battle as every victim will confirm.  Is it any wonder the awful word &ldquo;vigilante&rdquo; is mentioned nowadays with greater frequency? I have cautioned against the use of that word, not to talk of putting it into action, but that is little help to the Clonroche businessman whose supermarket has been broken into twice in the last two weeks.  Try telling him that Garda levels are adequate.</P>
    <P>The ridiculous system where a garda must witness the signing of dole forms continues to operate.  Since the garda has little authority in that regard, why cannot a departmental official preside over that procedure?  Why must gardaí spend so much time dealing with paper work?  What was wrong with the old system where the garda was resident in his own area of responsibility?  Is it any wonder victim support groups are being formed?  As Deputy Power said, there is a perception that the criminal receives much more attention than the victim.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer briefly to the victims of child sex abuse and the other awful crime, drugs.  The number of victims is unknown.  I do not wish to go over ground already covered by Deputies Wallace, Power and O'Dea.  Suffice to <Col N="1815" /> say that drug pushers in each town, as in the city of Dublin, are well known. Why therefore are they not apprehended? The reason is that gardaí who are assigned to the drugs problem are transferred to another case when the need arises.  That is when drug pushers are at their best.  I suggest that gardaí be specifically assigned to deal with the drugs problem.  In that way not alone will drug pushers be known but their activities will be curtailed in a very short time.</P>
    <P>Child sex abuse is the most savage and saddest of all crimes and we hear of a new case every day.  Many people have been hurt as a result of that crime, and it is incumbent on the Minister to ensure the problem is solved.  The criminal in this instance should get his just desserts and it would discourage people from committing the crime again.</P>

      <P>I compliment Deputy O'Dea on the work he has put into the Victim Support Bill.  For reasons already outlined to the House, the Government is not in a position to accept the Bill.  We are currently developing a charter for victims of crime and, with that in mind, we are listening carefully to the views expressed in this debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before I comment directly on the Bill, let me make one or two general observations. It is only fair to recognise that a great deal has been done in recent years to make the criminal law more victim oriented.  In violent or sexual offences, there is now a statutory obligation on the courts, when sentencing an offender, to take into account the effect of the crime on the victim.  As part of this process, the court must listen to any evidence the victim may wish to put forward.  The court may also order an <Col N="1816" /> offender to pay compensation to the victim. A further recognition of the rights of victims is the power which the Director of Public Prosecutions now has, in indictable cases, to apply to the Court of Criminal Appeal to review any sentence which appears unduly lenient.  This is a major advance.  Few things aggravate the violation felt by victims of crime more than the belief that the punishment has not fitted the crime.</P>
    <P>When we think of victims of crime, foremost in all our minds is the plight of children who have been sexually abused.  Nothing can erase the suffering caused by this most dreadful of crimes, but we can and must ensure that our criminal justice system is sensitive to the special needs of such a vulnerable group.  I especially welcome the fact that our courts are now enabled, in cases involving violence as well as sexual abuse, to hear evidence from children by live television link and to admit into evidence video recordings of statements made by children to gardaí or other competent persons.</P>
    <P>There have been other changes to the laws of evidence in favour of victims. Children can now give evidence without taking an oath, provided the court is satisfied that they can give an intelligible account.  Moreover, their unsworn evidence no longer requires corroboration as a matter of law.  The law on corroboration has also been improved as regards the trial of sexual offences. Judges are no longer required to warn juries of the danger of convicting the defendant on the uncorroborated evidence of the complainant.  In rape cases, the law now contains a specific measure to prevent a defendant from unfairly undermining the testimony of a rape victim by irrelevant questioning of her previous sexual experience.  Rape victims, and since earlier this year incest victims, also have their anonymity protected by law.</P>
    <P>In addition to the reform of the law, services available to victims of crime have also been developed through the good work of the Irish Association for Victim Support.  I congratulate that <Col N="1817" /> association.  Appreciation of its work has been reflected in the increase in State funding from £18,000 in 1993 to £130,000 this year.  Most Deputies are familiar with the range of services provided &mdash; including listening to victims, counselling victims and giving them advice on a range of practical matters from legal aid to health service entitlements.</P>
    <P>I will now comment on some of the principles underlying the Bill, without dwelling on drafting technicalities.  One of my main concerns is that the entitlements set out in the Bill for victims of crime do not seem to have been thought through, either in terms of their practical benefit for victims or their consequences for the State.  How realistic is it to require the State to immediately provide a universal and open-ended legal advice and counselling service without regard to need?  Should the prosecution, as the Bill would require, have to consult a victim about every individual pre-trial procedure, even routine technical applications to court? What remedy would a victim have if this requirement was not complied with in a particular case?</P>
    <P>This is not the only part of the Bill where questions are unanswered.  Take, for example, the requirement on the Garda to provide certain information to victims of crime.  It would only apply where a victim makes a written request, but how realistic is that?  Will victims of crime write to the Garda specifying the categories of information under section 3 of the Bill about which they want to be told?  We all agree that communication between the Garda and victims of crime is important, but I must question the practicality of the proposal in the Bill. Deputy O'Dea will argue that he is making a start in providing minimum entitlements, but entitlements, whether minimum or maximum, are of no benefit if they are not used.  Another factor is that a statutory requirement of this nature tends to focus attention on compliance and, in effect, can become a standard practice rather than a minimum practice.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1818" /> Another aspect of the Bill which leaves me less than convinced is the provision whereby judges could allocate part of a fine to the Criminal Injuries Compensation Tribunal.  Everyone is aware of the financial difficulties which the tribunal has experienced in the past, but good progress has been made in recent times in making available the necessary resources, to the extent that delays in the payment of accepted awards have now been virtually eliminated. I doubt if this progress can be maintained and built upon by the proposal in the Bill.  Such a scheme needs adequate and consistent State funding. The proposed income from fines would be completely unpredictable, depending on the number of convictions, the number of fines, the size of the fines and, not least, the extent to which judges would exercise what under the Bill is a discretionary power.  That does not seem to provide a stable platform on which the tribunal could develop its services.</P>
    <P>However, we must review the operation of the scheme of compensation for criminal injuries to see where improvements can be made.  Such a review is currently being carried out in the Department of Justice in line with a commitment in <i>A Government of Renewal</i>.  I do not pretend there are easy answers to these questions.  All the issues need to be carefully considered and their implications teased out.  That is what the Minister for Justice is doing in the preparation of a charter for the victims of crime, which is a commitment in <i>A Government of Renewal</i>.  Work on this is already under way.</P>
    <P>Shortly after I was appointed I met representatives of the National Women's Council, the Rape Crisis Centre and Women's Aid to talk about the experience of women who are victims of domestic violence.  The Department is funding a study by that group, to which submissions can be sent by the public, to talk about the experience of women who are victims of particular types of crime, whether inside or outside the home.  That is important.</P>
    <P>Last week a major conference was <Col N="1819" /> organised by the Department of Justice and Women's Aid on the subject of domestic violence in Ireland.  We looked at what has become known as the Leeds model, which is an integrated interagency approach to deal with domestic violence.  Its focus is twofold &mdash; to assist the victim of domestic violence and to deal with the violent abuser.  We are not just talking about victims, but about addressing the crime.  That work is ongoing and will be reflected in the Department's policies.</P>
    <P>The ongoing work with organisations such as the Rape Crisis Centre, the National Women's Council and Women's Aid is pioneering work.  When I was Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare I was able to fund a primary survey on the extent of violence against women.  We must find out who are the victims of crime.  Some Deputies referred to unreported crimes. We deal with hospitals where people who are victims of domestic assaults attend and they tell the staff they walked into a door and the doctors or nurses may not be aware of the distinction between domestic violence and domestic accidents.</P>
    <P>One area which must be addressed is the need to explain to victims of crime why it is not possible to proceed with prosecutions.  I have tried to explain to many families why a prosecution was not proceeded with by the Director of Public Prosecutions and to explain the independent role of that office.  Victims of sexual crime, particularly child sexual abuse which is often not disclosed for many years, find it difficult to handle non-prosecution, which is a result of time delays.  While we may discuss support for victims of crime, the most satisfactory support is to successfully prosecute and punish the perpetrator of the crime.  That should be the primary focus of our attention.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill which attempts to draw attention to the problem of crime and its effect on victims. The debate should help the Minister for <Col N="1820" /> Justice and other agencies who are involved in formulating a charter for the victims of crime.  I pay tribute to Deputy O'Dea for introducing this Bill because it required a lot of work, particularly as he does not have the resources which are available to the Government.</P>
      <P>Crime is a major political issue.  While some progress has been made in dealing with this problem a lot has yet to be achieved.  It is a challenge to deal with crime because it affects many values, including liberty, which are dearly held in society.  The effect of crime on victims has received little attention.  Few studies have been done on the short-term and long-term effects of crime on victims.  It is a pity that more research is not done on this issue.  It is remarkable that so little money and attention have been given to such an important matter.</P>
      <P>Major emphasis has been placed on the rights of the criminal over the past 25 years but little thought has been given to the right of victims to live without fear.  Little attention has been given to the people's right to feel confident that they will not become victims.  Too many people live in fear of crime and are afraid to report it.  Too many people will not take part in the legal process as witnesses because of intimidation or will not state their case because they are afraid.  A significant degree of intimidation is evident in certain parts of the country and, in particular, in this city. It presents an enormous challenge as it erodes confidence in people's belief that if they come forward and give evidence in court against a criminal they will not be intimidated or become victims of crime.  That major problem must be addressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Little attention has been given to determining the root causes of crime. To some extent analyses of crime have been replaced by announcements by shrill advocates proclaiming simplistic solutions.  Some people have encouraged the abstraction of the criminal's responsibility for crime.  Simplistic arguments have been produced suggesting that in some cases criminals are not really responsible for the crimes they <Col N="1821" /> commit.  That is incredible and damaging. In the past some people here advocated that point of view and promulgated it with great vigour and enthusiasm as an explanation of how society works.</P>
    <P>More emphasis should be placed on ensuring that criminals bear responsibility for their crimes.  Simplistic arguments in that regard have been destructive in encouraging certain people to become involved in crime.  Such arguments have been disastrous to the extent that in some circumstances, they have eroded the central factor militating against crime &mdash; the imposition of a social sanction.  They have removed the social sanction factor which in the past was crucial in discouraging people from becoming involved in crime.  It is bizarre that some people claim that criminals are not responsible for their crimes.  As stated on a recent television programme, some people go so far as to suggest that the gardaí are responsible for some incidents involving crime.  It is time people faced down that claim.</P>
    <P>I was pleased to hear my colleague, Councillor Michael Conaghan, state that on a television programme without equivocation.  It is time the central role played by criminals in committing crimes was recognised rather than the excuses and explanations of their criminal activity put forward by some people. In the long-term such explanations encourage criminal activity which has disastrous consequences for many people who may be direct victims of crime or live in fear that they will become victims.</P>
    <P>I suspect that some of the causes of crime may be deeper than many people are prepared to recognise.  I believe some of them are rooted in the values underpinning consumer society or, as recently stated, the values of hedonistic individualism.  In many ways that type of philosophy has abstracted responsibility from people who should put greater emphasis on advising people of their duties.  Every right carries a duty.  It is time Irish society faced up to the fact that there are duties which none of its <Col N="1822" /> citizens can avoid.  While it is desirable that some emphasis is placed on citizens' rights, if society is to be cohesive, greater emphasis must be placed on the duties rather than the rights of individual members of society, but for every right there is a responsibility.</P>
    <P>Some members of our society who formulate opinion should lay greater emphasis on rights, community, society, and the obligations on the ordinary man and woman on the street to make their society work.  Far too much emphasis has been placed on rights and there is great enthusiasm among certain people to vindicate people's rights while disregarding the issue of responsibilities and duties.</P>
    <P>I appreciate some of the reasons the Minister is not accepting the Bill. Nonetheless, its introduction has been worthwhile.  I gather that some of its limitations have been covered extensively during the debate.  One of two aspects of the financial attachments to the Bill are worth mentioning.  It is regrettable that Deputy O'Dea was not more specific about the funding of some of the provisions in the Bill.  The introduction of the Bill has filled a useful role in stimulating a worthwhile debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my colleagues for sharing their time with me.</P>
      <P>Listening to the debate in my office I heard a number of worthwhile contributions. I was somewhat amused to hear Deputy Power criticise the Government for not accepting the Bill.  It is only a short time since he was sitting on the benches of a Government which was quick to dismiss Bills, motions and other measures brought before the House.  I am amused that he has had a change of heart since crossing the floor of the House; many people have a change of heart when they cross from one side of the House to the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Martin, another Member who has crossed the floor of the House, made worthwhile contributions when on this side.  He must have read what is mandatory reading for all Members of the Opposition, certainly members of <Col N="1823" /> the Fianna Fáil Opposition, &ldquo;How to Behave in Opposition&rdquo;.  One must check the scripts of previous Opposition spokespersons and bury any ideas or principles one might have held, all for the sake of Opposition.  We should be more realistic and face up to the fact that, generally, a Government which intends to introduced its Bill will not accept one introduced by the Opposition a short time earlier.</P>
    <P>I compliment Deputy O'Dea for introducing this Bill.  Having been an Opposition spokesperson I realise the tremendous amount of work involved in preparing a Bill like this.  Opposition spokespersons must prepare legislation without the necessary back-up.  They must rely on the goodwill of the public. We should acknowledge that some people give freely of their time and expertise to assist in the preparation of such Bills.  I am not suggesting that Deputy O'Dea did not put work into this Bill.  When I was an Opposition spokesperson I relied on the assistance of volunteers in the preparation of such Bills.  In the long-term we should address the problem that the Opposition must rely on the assistance of volunteers in the preparation of such work. It is unfair that they should be burdened with so much responsibility and have so few back-up facilities.  This Government, or a future Government, should address that matter.</P>
    <P>The high level of crime is a topic of conversation everywhere.  Many people are fearful.  The lives of many victims of crime have been shattered.  Last night I attended a meeting at which the question of crime was to the forefront.  It was proposed that as many resources as possible should be given to the Minister for Justice to combat crime.  It was proposed, and agreed, although there were some dissenters, that in the coming year lottery money should be provided to help the Minister for Justice combat crime.  The people who attended that meeting supported such a measure because crime is such a major problem. Are there any people who do not know <Col N="1824" /> somebody who has not been a victim of some type of crime?  We hear of the perpetrators, sometimes they are caught, brought to court, fined or sent to prison but, unfortunately, they leave behind innocent victims who were attacked in their homes, robbed, beaten up or even raped.  There have been serious travesties of justice and many people fear that they may become victims of crime.</P>
    <P>This time of the year elderly people living in rural areas are house-bound from 4 p.m. with their doors barred.  They will not answer a knock unless they know it is a neighbour because they are afraid of what might happen.  Crime is creating tremendous fear and will have to be addressed.</P>
    <P>In referring to crime in rural areas I commend the Garda Síochána on providing a confidential telephone number where people can pass on information in relation to crime.  We have a long tradition here where people do not let anybody down but it is time we made it more difficult for the perpetrators of crime and to tip the balance, slightly at least, towards the victims so that there will not be another victim as a result of not passing on information.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Irish Association for Victim Support which was set up recently.  One of the people who was instrumental in setting up the association has had a long tradition in law enforcement and a tremendous involvement in voluntary organisations.  I got to know him a number of years ago when I served in a voluntary organisation with him.  This country is blessed in that many people are prepared to work on a voluntary basis and help out in many different ways.  I welcome the fact that this association, which is doing much good work, receives Government support.</P>
    <P>Members of the association listen to the fears of victims of crime, spend time with them and give expert advice on how to proceed and how to present their case in court or whatever.  We should be proud that we have such an association and we should support it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1825" /> Recently some hideous cases of the appalling crime of child abuse have been reported.  I cannot fathom the reason anybody would abuse an innocent child.  We should do all we can to bring those people to justice and ensure that justice is carried out as far as possible. I have no doubt the child victims of crime go through hell and we must ensure adequate counselling is provided for them to help them readjust to normal life.</P>
    <P>There is, perhaps, another victim who is not often mentioned.  While I abhor crime in every way, during the past couple of weeks I came across a lady for whom I felt extremely sorry.  She was employed in a caring agency and about six months ago a letter was sent to it by a person claiming that an inmate of the agency was being abused.  The person who was supposedly being abused was mentally and physically handicapped and was unable to explain clearly what had happened.  To make a long story short it was suggested that this lady was abusing a person in the institution.  The first the lady knew of it was when a squad car appeared outside her house and a garda asked if he could speak to her.  He told her she had been reported for abusing this person although the agency for which she worked had not informed her.  The garda was particularly helpful and took a statement but those for whom she works have not mentioned it to her.  The garda has not taken a case against her to date.  Five months after the initial interview this lady is still wondering whether something will happen, if she will be charged, if the case has been put to rest, if she has been cleared, if she has been tarnished for the rest of her life and where she will go from here.</P>
    <P>I have a certain sympathy for that lady.  I firmly believe from what she told me &mdash; her reaction and so on &mdash; that she is not guilty of any crime.  She feels she is a victim because the matter has been left so long and that people talked about it without telling her.  Also her family knows about it and it has caused tremendous tension.  To speak about it <Col N="1826" /> five months later reduces her to floods of tears.  If she has done something wrong certainly she should be brought to justice but if she has not the matter should be laid to rest.</P>
    <P>In recent times we seem to have gone overboard in relation to so-called perpetrators. I have noticed that people's names and photographs are printed in the newspapers before they have been brought to court and tried in the normal way.  Surely people are innocent until proven guilty.  I do not want to tip the balance in favour of the criminal but at the same time we have to be sensitive to the fact that there are people on the other side with families and in jobs in which they wish to remain.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Foley</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate my colleague, Deputy O'Dea, for introducing this Bill.  He has shown commendable enterprise and sincerity in his role as Fianna Fáil spokesman on law reform and this is one further example of his commitment in this area.  I have listened to speakers from both sides of the House and the common denominator is that there is general agreement across the political divide that crime is at a crisis point all over the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his opening speech, Deputy O'Dea acknowledged that his Bill is lacking in some respects, either because of drafting difficulties or because a Member cannot impose a charge on the Exchequer in a Private Member's Bill that he or she introduces.  The whole question of drafting difficulties encountered by the Opposition is a matter to which I would like to refer later. However, it is sufficient to remind the House that Deputy O'Dea made it clear that he hoped to persuade the Government to accept the Bill in principle and, <Col N="1827" /> at least, to give a commitment to introduce a comprehensive Bill later.</P>
    <P>I have some sympathy for the Minister of State, Deputy Currie, on this occasion.  He has already provided sufficient evidence to show his concern for the victims of violence and abuse, particularly where children are concerned. He must have been severely embarrassed last Tuesday when he had to read a speech which effectively gave a pat on the head to Deputy O'Dea but went on to say that really he was talking a load of rubbish.  The Minister of State would be well aware that a court appearance can be a traumatic experience, especially for a very young or a very old victim of violence or abuse who may never have been in a courtroom. Those of us who have are aware of the scenario encountered by some victims who are called to give evidence against the person who inflicted the physical injuries.  The offender could be a drug addict of a particularly violent nature. He would be sitting very near the victim, perhaps with eye to eye contact, and with an intimidating presence calculated to terrorise any witness, especially anybody of a timid or vulnerable nature.</P>
    <P>When one considers that witnesses may be called to give evidence which might result in a prison sentence being imposed, I do not have to spell out the possible consequences for that witness. There is always the possibility that there may be present in the court one or more friends of the offender from the wider drug community, yet there is no obligation on the State to provide any legal aid or support for the victim who is required to appear in court.  He or she would have been through a trial by ordeal, severely traumatised and sent home without a second glance unless there is a garda or legal representative present who has compassion for the victim and the time to offer a little comfort and advice.</P>
    <P>I find it difficult to understand why the Minister for Justice &mdash; I regard her as a compassionate person &mdash; could <Col N="1828" /> come up with nothing better than a litany of technical objections to the way the Bill was framed.  With the army of skilled legal personnel at her command she could at least have said she would do her best to draft a Bill which would provide proper legal and other advice to these witnesses as well as an appropriate system of compensation where necessary.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Dea suggested various ways in which the criminal injuries compensation fund could be added to by way of fines, etc.  All we heard in response were niggling objections about possible book-keeping difficulties.  In dealing with the proposal to provide free counselling for victims, we were referred to the work done by the voluntary organisations such as the Irish Association for Victim Support.  Does the service provided by this worthwhile group extend to every parish?  I do not think so.</P>
    <P>Section 2 covers legal entitlements of victims of crime as follows: (a) the right to be consulted by the prosecution in relation to any pre-trial procedures, (b) the right to free legal advice in relation to any trial at which the victim shall be a witness for an indictable offence involving violence or the threat of violence as a result of which the victim suffers either physical or mental injury and (c) the victim shall be entitled to counselling for the psychological effects of a crime involving violence or the threat of violence as a result of which the victim suffers either physical or mental injury, which shall be provided by the State without charge to the victim and regulations regarding the provision of counselling shall be drawn up by the Minister for Justice and laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas within six months of the date of the passing of this Act.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State outlined legislative measures which were introduced by Fianna Fáil in recent years and which were designed to tilt the balance more towards the victim.  They included the affording of much more protection to the victim from unfair cross-examination and harassment in cases involving <Col N="1829" /> rape or other violence.  These measures included the Criminal Law (Rape) (Amendment) Act, 1990 and the Criminal Evidence Act, 1992, which made it easier for children or other witnesses such as mentally handicapped persons to give evidence without being treated as if they were the criminals rather than the victims.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Criminal Justice Act, 1993 was steered through the Oireachtas by Deputy O'Dea &mdash; acknowledged by the Minister as significant legislation.  This Act includes provision for compensation to be awarded to victims in various circumstances.  The snag is that the compensation must be extracted from the offender.  This is all very well if the offender is a person of means, otherwise it is a case of trying to get blood from a stone.</P>
    <P>I mention these Fianna Fáil Bills not to blow a party political trumpet but to stress the underlying message behind the introduction of this Bill.  In recent years we have seen the gradual build up of legislation which gives more and more protection to the victims of crime. However, for various reasons, including lack of funding at particular times, that legislation contains many loopholes which requires serious attention.  We hoped the Minister would have availed of this opportunity to make her contribution to the process by at least giving a commitment to initiate action in the near future.  To promise a charter for victims of crime is simply not good enough unless its contents are given the full force of the law.</P>
    <P>I mentioned at the outset that I would return to the matter of the drafting of Bills.  Over the years many Private Members' Bills have been voted down by the Government of the day.  More often than not, what seemed to be worthwhile proposals were rejected on the grounds of improper drafting. Deputy O'Dea reminded the House last evening that the Attorney General told a parliamentary committee that it takes at least eight years to produce a fully fledged draftsman.  The Opposition does not have the services of one person with <Col N="1830" /> these qualifications.  We must realise that every Member is a legislator and as such is entitled to initiate legislation at least once in his or her term of office.</P>
    <P>I do not absolve my party for failing to address this question while in Government but a short spell in Opposition concentrates the mind wonderfully in certain directions.  I wish to compliment Deputy McGahon for stating in his contribution that all Bills should be accepted on both sides of the House. The State should provide Members of the Oireachtas at least with the means and expertise to draft Bills.  I strongly recommend this idea to the Government because Members on the Government side could find themselves back in Opposition after the next general election and, therefore, they would benefit from what I am suggesting.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern" hpid="Mr. M. Ahern Mr. M. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have an opportunity to contribute to the debate on this important Bill and I compliment Deputy O'Dea on his excellent work in publishing it.  The time and effort that goes into preparing a ten minute speech is enormous and to write one that is worthwhile takes a great amount of time.  When I was in college I engaged in public speaking and we were told that if we wanted to give a speech of 15 minutes duration we had to spend 20 to 30 minutes preparing it.  If we wanted to give a five minute speech, we had to spend approximately eight hours preparing it to ensure that the necessary points were got across in that short time.</P>
      <P>The same applies in this House because in order to initiate any legislation one must undertake an enormous amount of work.  Members emphasised in their contributions that research services are inadequate.  I hope the powers that be take that into account when considering the provision of resources to the Houses of the Oireachtas because if Members of the Opposition or Government backbenchers are required to make meaningful contributions, they must have adequate resources available to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is aimed at providing support <Col N="1831" /> for victims of crime.  We are all aware of the problems crime is causing.  There is an increasing incidence of crime in all areas, much of which is caused by the rise in drug abuse.  The cost of a drug habit is enormous and addicts are forced to resort to crime in order to feed their habit.  Last year more than 100,000 indictable crimes were reported.  That is up to 300 indictable crimes a day.  In addition, there are non-indictable crimes.  This illustrates the enormous problems facing society today.  For every one of those crimes there is at least one victim who is affected immediately by the crime.  In many cases the effects can last for years.</P>
    <P>How the system treats victims and their relationship with the system when the criminal is brought before the court are important questions.  It is not acceptable that victims appearing in court for the first time on behalf of the State get no opportunity to meet the barrister and solicitor representing the State prior to the hearing of the court case.  This should be addressed and should not be allowed to continue.  Very few people in this State enter a courtroom unless they are a victim or are being prosecuted. Most are law-abiding citizens who want to help the Garda, but often the meeting between the victim and the Garda Síochána is perfunctory, and the proceedings in court are disconcerting and even frightening to some people.  There should be greater interaction between the solicitor for the State, the Garda Síochána and victims in order to put victims at ease, advice them and help them not be be frightened of giving evidence.</P>
    <P>Victim witnesses should be entitled to free legal aid and be advised on court procedure and about their rights and duties as witnesses.  The Garda Síochána should, on written request by the victim or the victim's solicitor, provide basic information such as the name of the Garda station, the telephone number of the garda investigating the case, whether or not somebody has been charged and whether the accused person is in custody or on bail.  The victim <Col N="1832" /> should be entitled to know as early as possible whether or not he or she will be required to give evidence, and should also be advised if the perpetrator who has been sentenced is released from jail. We all know of people who have met their attacker on the streets within a couple of weeks of being jailed.  Such a meeting out of the blue can be psychologically damaging to victims.  However, there is such severe overcrowding in our prisons that some people describe them as having a bigger turnover than Dunne's Stores, and victims, particularly those who have suffered physical damage at the hands of criminals, should be advised of their release.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Currie, objected to the Bill because it had no sanctions built in, but Ms Helen Fenwick of the University of Durham, in the 1995 Criminal Law Review, page 843, stated that a sanction would not be necessary if rights were statutorily provided. If a garda does not comply with the law, is he not open to discipline either internally or through the Garda Complaints Board?  If a victim is not given his or her rights it could prejudice the prosecution case.  Therefore, the Garda who are looking for convictions have a built-in incentive to freely provide the rights mentioned.</P>
    <P>Some Government speakers suggested a charter for victims of crime, but my experience of charters is that they are not worth the paper they are written on.  The farmers' charter has not improved by one whit the lot of the 10,000 farmers who marched on the streets today.  I have been dealing with hospitals for many years, but have seen no improvement in the treatment of patients which resulted from the printing of the patients' charter.  Charters are all very well nicely printed and displayed on walls, but their effect is negligible. It is necessary to enshrine rights in our laws.  One charter that comes to my mind is the Magna Carta of 1215 which set out the rights of the king and his barons.  What happened after the signing of the Magna Carta shows how much weight a charter carries.  Kings did <Col N="1833" /> not abide by charters, and the same is happening in regard to charters printed today.</P>
    <P>Under section 2 of the Bill the legal aid centres would have to provide free legal advice to victims of crime.  This is very important for victims who cannot afford to pay for legal advice.</P>
    <P>Counselling is also very important for traumatised victims, most of whom cannot afford the cost of counselling which should be provided free of charge to all victims.  If such services were available not only in Dublin City but throughout the country many of the problems victims of crime have in later life could be averted.  It would not be necessary to go through the Oireachtas to provide counselling for victims of crime; it could be done by way of regulation.</P>
    <P>At present, owing to lack of support, many victims are pushed to the margins. They become disillusioned and this disillusionment spreads to their families and friends and leads to loss of confidence in the system of justice.  The Government and Opposition parties must guard against this happening.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this extremely urgent matter on the Adjournment.  I am seeking to establish if the Minister for Health has received a comprehensive assessment and funding proposal for the Galway Hospice Foundation from the Western Health Board and when a decision will be made on this proposal to facilitate the opening of the hospice which has been completed and ready to receive patients since last September.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Galway Hospice Foundation was founded in 1988 on the initiative of Dr. Pádhraic Ó Conghaile, who was supported by a large group of citizens who appreciated the urgent need for a hospice care service for advanced cancer <Col N="1834" /> patients in the west.  Since 1990 a 24-hour a day, seven day a week medical and nursing home care service for advanced cancer patients has served the people of Galway city and county at a cumulative cost of £1.6 million.  It provides palliative care management, crisis intervention and bereavement care.  It also provides drugs and equipment when they are not otherwise available. The service is completely free for those who need it and no one who qualifies has been refused it to date.  At present 60 per cent of patients in the region with advanced cancer are cared for in the hospice and all GPs and hospitals in the city and county avail of the service. There are approximately 40 patients on the books at any one time.</P>
    <P>Construction work on the new Galway hospice for advanced cancer patients was completed in October 1994 at a cost of £1.9 million.  All of the money spent to date on the home care service and the hospice building has been contributed voluntarily by the people of Galway.  Each year 400 people in Galway die form advanced cancer.  At present 60 per cent of these are cared for by the hospice foundation home care service.  However, 25 per cent of advanced cancer patients need inpatient hospice care.  This in-care facility is available in a modern hospice building in Renmore, Galway, which is fully furnished and fitted out with all the latest hospice care equipment but which cannot receive patients as the funding has not yet been provided by the Department of Health.</P>
    <P>Since 1989 the Galway Hospice Foundation has sought funding for its services from the Department of Health without success.  At present a comprehensive assessment of funding proposals sits on the Minister's desk.  This was supplied by the Western Health Board at his request but given the lack of response to date there is considerable concern in Galway that this submission may not be successful.  The Minister and the Government statutory agencies have continuously referred to equity in their aspirations but when one looks at <Col N="1835" /> what has happened in other areas it is clear that Galway has not been treated equitably.  All other hospices are funded by the State.  For example, Sr. Francis Hospice in Raheny, Dublin, which has just been completed has already been guaranteed running costs by the Department of Health while Harold's Cross Homecare Service was funded by the Department of Health after three years in service and at a time when it served fewer patients than the Galway hospice. The Department has committed an additional £500,000 to existing services for palliative care.  Yet Galway has not yet been included in this allocation.</P>
    <P>Each year £6.5 million is spent in south Dublin on hospice care, £4 million is spent in Cork and £1 million is spent in Limerick, while £1.2 million has been committed in Raheny.  These are Department of Health funds, not health board funds.  However, no statutory funding has been allocated to Galway to date.  The Sligo Hospice Homecare Service has received £150,000 in lottery funding, Raheny Homecare Service has received more than £100,000, Harold's Cross Homecare Service has received £150,000 and a £75,000 capital grant has been allocated to the Raheny day care centre.  Why are all hospice services except the Galway Hospice Foundation funded by the State?</P>
    <P>I wish to remind the Minister that to date the Galway Hospice Foundation has paid more than £500,000 to the State in VAT, PAYE and PRSI.  Yet all it received in 1990 was a £30,000 lottery grant.  Having looked at what the State has done elsewhere, it is clear that the Galway Hospice Foundation has not been treated equitably.  To date this foundation has raised £3.9 million in voluntary subscriptions from the citizens of Galway.  There are no outstanding debts on the hospice building which is fully equipped and capable of meeting all the highest standards of modern palliative care.  Every week 5,000 Galway people contribute to the cost of running the Galway hospice service.  The <Col N="1836" /> Department of Health has expounded the need for palliative and hospice care.</P>
    <P>Last night at a meeting in the Connemara Coast Hotel in Galway which was attended by more than 500 people the Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, Labour and Progressive Democrats Dáil representatives committed their full support to the Galway Hospice Foundation's application to the Department for funding to enable its in-care service to commence at the earliest possible date.  I hope the Minister's response will bring hope to the people of Galway that the hospice's in-care service can be made available to those who so badly need it.</P>

      <P>I commend the Galway Hospice Foundation for the very substantial fund raising it has undertaken in support of the provision of hospice and palliative care in the Galway area.  In response to its request for revenue funding to run the new unit, my Department asked the Western Health Board to carry out a full and detailed assessment of the services offered by the foundation, together with the associated running costs.  This assessment has been completed and has been considered in detail by my Department.  The Minister for Health will consider as sympathetically as possible an allocation of funding in 1996 towards the Galway Hospice Foundation in the context of other competing demands on the health services. This will depend on the funds available for health service developments in 1996. The situation in this regard will not be clarified until the 1996 Estimates have been agreed and published.</P>

    <P>The health strategy document &ldquo;Shaping a Healthier Future&rdquo; acknowledges the important role palliative care services play in improving the quality of life of terminally ill patients and it is our <Col N="1837" /> intention to promote the continued development of such services, making use where possible of existing health facilities.  A policy statement on cancer care services is currently being prepared in my Department and it will include a review of the role played by hospice services in respect of cancer patients and set out recommendations for their future development.  When the proposals of the review group are to hand, we will be in a position to decide on priority areas for development within the palliative care sector as a whole.</P>

      <P>The service seeks to provide continuing and total care for patients and their families by a multi-professional team at a time when the medical expectation is not cure and the primary aim of treatment is no longer to prolong life.  The service seeks to address a combination of physical, psychological, social and spiritual needs of patients and their families, including bereavement support.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding the fact that the outcome of the cancer review group is awaited, significant developments have already taken place in the current year with more than £500,000 being spent in additional development funding in the area of palliative care.  In the area of acute hospital services, approximately £1 million in additional revenue funding has been approved this year to improve cancer treatment services.</P>

      <P>I support the siting of a swimming pool in Bishopstown as this will benefit not only the students attending the regional technical college but the residents of the greater Bishopstown area.  However, residents have been concerned about the chaotic congestion of traffic using the present entrance to the college.  People have made representations to me about the ongoing daily congestion.  Anyone who is familiar with the situation, as is the Minister of State, will be aware that every effort must be made to alleviate the problems as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>I speak on behalf of the Rossbrook resident's association.  Rossbrook is a new estate where many families have young children and the vehicles going to and from the swimming pool use a private road in this estate to reach the entrance to the site.  The residents are genuinely concerned for the very young children living in the estate because of the dangers from traffic.  They are not trying to stop the development.  In an article in last Friday's <i>Evening Echo</i> the Minister of State, Deputy Allen, accused me and Deputy Batt O'Keeffe of inciting opposition to the development at the college.  I want the Minister of State to withdraw that disgraceful remark as I have always acted responsibly and constructively in Opposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The college authorities also have been concerned for some considerable time and have had discussions with the Department of Education.  It is agreed in principle that a second entrance is urgently needed.  Cork Corporation has indicated &mdash; of this I have written confirmation &mdash; that no further planning permission will be granted in this area until an alternative entrance is provided <Col N="1839" /> by the Department of Education or the college authorities.</P>
    <P>We are pursuing this matter on behalf of constituents who are the constituents also of the Minister of State.  I can tell him that they are very disappointed at the way he has twisted things to suggest that they are obstructing development. They know that they and their children will benefit from the swimming pool but they have genuine concerns which the Minister could address if he was committed.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to ensure that the necessary funds will be provided.  If this cannot be achieved in the short-term will he give a commitment to the people that an entrance will be provided within a certain time frame, be it one, two or three years?  If they have such a commitment I have no doubt they will co-operate fully.  I ask the Minister to withdraw the scurrilous statement in the <i>Evening Echo</i> suggesting that Deputy Batt O'Keeffe and I deliberately incited opposition to this development.  Nothing could be further from the truth.</P>

      <P>I am delighted to have the opportunity to clarify the factual situation of the Cork Regional Sports Centre.  The swimming pool is not only for the students but is designed for the people of Bishopstown, Ballincollig and all the areas around it. The people were promised this pool, especially at election time, but nobody delivered on the promises.</P>
      <P>I was delighted to announce on 29 September 1995 that a grant of £2.5 million had been provided for the development of Cork Regional Sports Centre at Bishopstown under my Department's major sports capital programme. The centre will consist of a 25-metre swimming pool, a 12-metre learner pool, spectator accommodation, an aerobics area, a fitness suite, a cafeteria and ancillary facilities.  The centre will serve Cork city and the adjoining county areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The eight-acre site for the proposed <Col N="1840" /> centre adjoins Cork regional technical college and is owned by Cork Corporation. Access to the site is through the Rossbrook housing estate.  The residents on the estate have objected to this on the grounds that it would pose a danger to their children.  Cork Corporation identified the site for the centre as long ago as 1986.  The Rossbrook estate has been built since then and the proposals for the site would have appeared on plans for the area when the houses on the estate were purchased.  I understand that the residents of the estate are planning to seek an injunction against using the road through their estate as access to the site.</P>
    <P>The cost of alternative site access at present is prohibitive.  In the medium term the intention is to provide a new access road which will also serve an expanded regional technical college. This is planned to take place in the next three to five years.  The estimated cost of a new access road is £1 million, which will include the purchase of privately held land for the road.  I am informed that Cork Corporation has advised the Rossbrook residents that it will use its planning powers, whenever Cork regional technical college submits an application for planning permission for the redevelopment of its campus, to ensure that a new roundabout and entrance will be provided on the eastern side of the college.  This new entrance will be the permanent access to the sports centre.</P>
    <P>Construction work on this project began just two weeks ago.  Cork city, and particularly Bishopstown, have waited for this facility for the past ten years.  I would appeal to the residents of the Rossbrook estate to facilitate this development so that the centre will be available for the use of the people of Cork in the shortest possible time.</P>
    <P>Since I became Minister of State with responsibility for sport and youth affairs I have used every possible means to convince the Rossbrook residents of my serious commitment to the provision of an alternative access route to the pool as quickly as possible.  My Department <Col N="1841" /> commissioned a plan for the redevelopment and expansion of the college which gave top priority to the proposed new road infrastructure and a new access road was clearly identified.  The Cork city manager has given an undertaking that no further expansion will take place at the college until such time as a new road is in place and that is a fairly genuine guarantee.  I have given guarantees at numerous meetings with some of the residents of the Rossbrook estate.  The Bishopstown Community Association fully supports this project.</P>
    <P>Last Friday night I responded to press reports of requests to cough up another £600,000.  I find that hard to take, especially coming from Deputy Dan Wallace and Deputy Batt O'Keeffe who are looking for a further £1 million in addition to the £2.5 million that has been given.  The swimming pool was promised for years and both Deputy Dan Wallace and Deputy Batt O'Keeffe were in Government until last November but could not deliver this pool to the people.  I have secured £2.5 million, but they are now asking for another £1 million immediately in order to allow the pool to go ahead.  I ask the people of Rossbrook to trust me and to trust the words of the Cork city manager when we say that an alternative road will be built to the pool as quickly as possible.  I was asked to set a deadline but I was honest and I said it would be a minimum of three years.  I am trying to be honest and open and I have spent nine months trying to convice people to allow this project to go ahead.  I am appealing to people tonight to show faith and they will not be let down in the long-term.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Earlier this afternoon I described 1995 as the year of the criminal.  Until recently the State averaged approximately 20 murders per year and, while that was desperately tragic, criminologists considered it typical relative to the size of the population.  The <Col N="1842" /> bulk of those crimes were rural crimes of passion or linked to fueds over land and families.  In 1994 the number of murders was approximately 25 but so far this year the number of violent deaths had increased to 40.</P>
      <P>It is fair to say that 1995 &mdash; the year of the criminal &mdash; has been marked by the emergence of gangland murders.  It would appear that a more professional job is becoming the norm and that many murders are committed as a result of rows between criminals over drugs or territories.  Tragically, it is now a fact of life &mdash; a fact of Dublin underworld life &mdash; that criminals are settling petty fueds by murdering people.</P>
      <P>The Garda are reported as being confident that they can tackle this dreadful problem and they must do so if they are to retain public confidence.  In the year of the criminal they need legislative back up, but this is not forthcoming from the rainbow coalition Government. It is patently obvious that a radical legislative and tactical approach is required to deal with gangs, mobsters and gangsters.  The time has come, like it or not, for the Minister for Justice to deliver on the promise she made last March of a referendum on bail so that an individual who is likely to commit a further crime while on bail can be refused bail for that reason alone.  It is obvious that thousands of crimes are being committed by people on bail. Thousands of people on temporary release, many of whom are habitual criminals, stalk the streets of this city and country committing further serious criminal offences.  It is evident to everyone that the reign of the rainbow coalition Government in 1995 will be marked, not merely by the emergence of gangland murderers, but also by the disgraceful decision taken by the Cabinet, in the absence of the Minister for Justice, to cancel a planned prison for Castlerea, County Roscommon, and a 60 place prison for women at Mountjoy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is obvious that current criminal law is no longer sufficient to take on the emerging sophisticated structures of the gangs about whom I am speaking. <Col N="1843" /> Garda representatives and experts in the field of criminal law strongly believe that in certain serious cases, such as drug trafficking, the suspects's right to silence should be modified.</P>
    <P>On behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party, I call for tougher penalties for drug criminals who use guns.  It must be noted that our society has changed considerably for the worse in so far as crime is concerned. Eighty per cent of crime is drug related.  The latest Health Research Board figures show that the rate of first time drug users is increasing rapidly and there will be a corresponding increase in desperate despicable crime.</P>
    <P>There is a significant reservoir of arms available for hire or purchase in this city and country and those guns are often held illegally.  In so far as they are legally purchased, the time has come for ballistic testing of all firearms sold in the State and such information should be made available to the Garda Technical Bureau who would be in a position, when a crime is committed, to ascertain where the gun was legaly held, irrespective of whether it was used in an offence.</P>
    <P>Since the Minister for Justice refuses to listen, I strongly urge the Minister of State to introduce the necessary measures to halt what can only be described as murderous atrocities.</P>

      <P>The Deputy gave notice to raise on the Adjournment the urgent matter of the shooting dead of three people on the streets of Dublin over the last week and that is the matter to which I will reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware, it is not the practice for the Minister for Justice to give detailed information to the House about individual Garda investigations except where the circumstances of an investigation are so exceptional that such a course is deemed appropriate. Accordingly, all I propose to say in this matter is that the Minister has been informed by the Garda authorities that <Col N="1844" /> the three killings in question are the subject of intensive Garda investigation.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to speculate on possible motives for the killings.  I am aware, of course, that this has been the subject of a certain amount of media speculation but I do not believe it would serve any purpose whatsoever for me to enter into such speculation.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Deputy, however, that I am appalled &mdash; as I have no doubt other Members of the House are &mdash; at these and all other violent deaths which occur in the State.  This is the most serious of all crimes and the Minister is determined that everything possible is done to bring those who commit such offences to justice.</P>
    <P>I should add that the law provides for very heavy penalties for offences involving firearms.  Notwithstanding this, the Minister will have no hesitation in looking at the matter afresh if the situation warrants such a course of action.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>While I welcome the Minister of State, who has come in to reply, I note the absence of the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications.</P>
      <P>The sacking of Angela Coffey and Kay Mulrooney from the board of CIE is nothing short of vindictive political score settling.  Those fine directors, like all members of the CIE board, have been above reproach.  As required under the Transport Act, 1950, a full explanation on the matter should be given to the House by the Minister of State on behalf of the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's current explanation is insufficient and it is insulting because it was not given to the House.  The Minister stated that it is being laid before the House &mdash; in other words, lodged in the Library &mdash; and that Angela Coffey and Kay Mulrooney are being dismissed because their removal is necessary in the public interest.  How would the <Col N="1845" /> Minister of State feel if her presence was no longer required in the public interest and a statement to that effect was lodged in the Library and not given in the House?  The Minister should come into the House and explain why he chose to remove some, but not all the directors.  If, as he says, he has lost confidence in the board, he must remove the entire board.  He is engaging in political cherry picking.  Should the two sacked directors decide to seek a judicial review of the fairness of the Government's decision, they will probably succeed. While I am not a lawyer, fairness alone would give them a good chance of succeeding.</P>
    <P>The sackings will have major implications for semi-State companies in the future.  The Minister and the Minister of State know it is traditional in this country &mdash; I have had to do it myself on a number of occasions &mdash; that incoming Governments have always worked with existing directors and chairpersons of State companies.  These CIE sackings will make it more difficult to get directors if they feel they will face the sack with each incoming Government.  Is that to be the fate of future boards if they disagree with the Minister?  Any suggestion that the CIE directors were removed because they refused to reinstate the property sub-committee is clearly nonsense.  Any child or amateur business person can see that if the board decides it would prefer to deal with property then it is far better than delegating it to a property sub-committee on which only three or four people might be represented.  When a matter is sensitive it is more appropriate that the whole board should deal with it.  That, therefore, is simply an excuse that the Government has offered to sack these directors.</P>
    <P>I have already raised the point as to why only some directors were dismissed and not all of them.  The removal of the non-executive directors is a bad precedent and was done for a bad reason. The entire board &mdash; the chairman, Mr. Eamon Walsh, the chief executive, all <Col N="1846" /> the directors including worker directors and the dismissed directors &mdash; without exception backed the decision on the Horgan's Quay site on two occasions. After they did the Minister accused the deal of being a shameful one.  Logic dictates that if the board, including the Minister's own appointed chairman, backed the deal then either the Minister or the board has to go.  Unfortunately, the Minister has not taken that honourable course so some members of the board did the honourable thing and two had to be dismissed by the Government.</P>
    <P>Just to test my argument, will the Minister and the Minister of State be prepared to ask the new board next week what they think of the Horgan's Quay site?  Let us hear what this new clean, clinical board &mdash; hand-picked by the Minister and vetted by the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa, and the Tánaiste, Deputy Spring &mdash; will say about Horgan's Quay.  I challenge the Government to put that to the test and ask them about that site.</P>
    <P>It is only appropriate and fair that I should wish Mr. Joyce, the chairman of CIE, and his new directors, every success and the best of luck.  There is a lot of work to be done in CIE: the light rail network, deregulation, protecting bus drivers from attack and the question of competition.  I wish Mr. Joyce and his new directors every success in dealing with the whole range of strategic and operational issues.  Unlike the actions of the present Minister, I trust this board will not be undermined by anybody.  In a statement yesterday, one director, the vice chairman of the Stock Exchange, Mr. Maguire, said the Government had undermined the board and not <i>vice versa.</i></P>

      <P>The Government today, 28 November 1995, laid the following statement before both Houses of the Oireachtas pursuant to section 7 (4) (c) of the Transport Act, 1950:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In exercise of their power under <Col N="1847" /> section 7 (4) (b) of the Transport Act, 1950, the Government have today decided to remove from office, with immediate effect, the following members of the Board of Córas Iompair Éireann: Ms Angela Coffey, and Ms Kaye Mulrooney on the grounds that such removal is necessary in the public interest because the Government no longer have confidence that the board, as a whole, can function in an effective manner and because they have resolved to restructure the board.</P>
    <P>This decision is not intended to reflect on and should not be taken as reflecting on the integrity, ability or reputation of any individual member so removed.</P>
    <P>The Government thanked Mrs. Tras <Col N="1848" /> Honan, Mr. Colm Brennan, Mr. John Maguire, Mr. Noel O'Callaghan and Mr. Anthony Rooney who resigned from the CIE Board in response to its invitation and acknowledged their public spiritedness in agreeing to the Government's request.</P>
    <P>The Government expressed its appreciation of the work which all former members of the CIE Board had undertaken and assured them once again that the decision to request their resignations was not intended to reflect on their integrity, ability or reputation.</P>
    <P>I join Deputy Brennan in wishing Mr. Brian Joyce, his Deputy chairperson, Mrs. Tras Honan, and the new directors, all the best in their important endeavours in the months and years ahead.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.10 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 29 November 1995.</P>

      <P>While plans in this area have not yet been fully developed the Collins Barracks development will eventually allow for the raising of the awareness of these occupations through the implementation of a programme of practical demonstrations of such craftsmanship in a new and exciting setting.</P>
      <P>The National Monuments and Historic Properties (NMHP) Service, for which I am also responsible, is currently engaged in a number of initiatives both at national and European level relating to the preservation and promotion of traditional crafts, including cross-Border co-operation in relation to the use of thatch on vernacular buildings.</P>
      <P>I understand that discussions have taken place between the various agencies, including the NMHP Service, with a view to preparing a national framework for training in architectural conservation skills.

      <P>I have no <Col N="1629" /> specific proposals to change the provisions of this Act.</P>
      <P>At present the National Archives Act, 1986 provides that records of Government Departments over 30 years old must, in general, be transferred to the control of the Director of National Archives.</P>
      <P>Government Department files under 30 years old may, with the agreement of the Director of National Archives, be transferred to his control, but in general such files may not be made available by the director for public inspection until the 30 years has elapsed.  However the number of such files transferred is insignificant.</P>
      <P>There is also a provision in the 1986 Act stating that its provisions do not prohibit access to a file under 30 years old.  Such access, upon request, may be sanctioned by a member of the Government responsible for the file in question. At the time of passing of the Act this power was envisaged to be used in very special circumstances only and that it was not to form the basis for a &ldquo;freedom of information&rdquo; policy which was regarded as altogether a separate matter, outside the ambit of the Act.  On the question of freedom of information there are legislative proposals in course of preparation in the Office of the Tánaiste.</P>
      <P>Any proposals to relax the 30 year rule would have to take account of the practical issue that any such reduction would lead to a great increase in the number of files coming under the control of the Director of National Archives.  Such an increase would put severe pressure on the resources available to me, in terms of current storage space and staffing.  Accordingly any time-limit reduction would have to take account of the practical difficulties involved.  In the first instance, my priority must be to aid the director to perform his functions, as currently assigned, at the appropriate adequate level.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht (Mr. M. Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>All wild birds, including the grey partridge, receive statutory protection under the terms of the Wildlife Act, 1976.  As Minister with responsibility for the Wildlife Act, I am empowered under Section 24 of the Act to make an order (the open seasons order) whereby certain wild birds can be hunted for specified periods.  The species and periods included on the open seasons order, while traditional in origin, are primarily determined by the conservation status and needs of the species concerned and <Col N="1631" /> with due regard to the principle of wise use specified in the European Directive on the Conservation of Wild Birds (79/409/EEC) known as the &ldquo;Birds Directive&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The grey partridge (Perdix perdix) has been included on the open seasons order for the first 15 days of November each year since the first such order was made in 1977.</P>
      <P>The native grey partridge is now an extremely scarce species in Ireland and its population decline is part of a worldwide trend.  The specific reasons for the decline in Ireland are not known but are likely to be related to the reduction in cereal growing, the removal of hedgerows and the use of pesticides and herbicides which has reduced the abundance of weed species and their associated insect fauna which, in turn, has led to lower chick survival.  The grey partridge is also at the edge of its range in Ireland so it is possible that climatic factors could also be implicated, directly or indirectly, in this demise.  The Irish Red Data Book, written by A. Whilde, and jointly produced in 1993 by the Environment Service Northern Ireland and the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS), indicated that there were less than 200 breeding pairs in Ireland.  The Red Data Book also recommended that shooting of the species should be restricted to released populations (pen reared birds) only.  I am satisfied based on the empirical evidence available to me that the conservation status of this species in Ireland necessitated the removal of the wild species from the open seasons order.</P>
      <P>I am aware through the National Association of Regional Game Councils (NARGC) of the opposition by the game councils to my removal of the partridge from the open seasons order, despite the fact that NARGC had very commendably operated a voluntary ban on shooting this species in the interests of conservation.  Prior to making the Order the NARGC were invited by the NPWS to discuss the proposals for the open seasons order for the current year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1632" /> I understand that one of the principal objections raised by NARGC to the removal of the partridge from the open seasons order relates to the impact of the removal on the release programmes for pen reared partridge operated by some affiliated clubs.  The Wildlife Act, 1976, under section 22 (9)B, empowers me as Minister to issue licences for the hunting and shooting of pen reared birds including pen reared partridge. Gun clubs regularly seek and are granted licences for the shooting of pen reared hen pheasants (hunting of wild hen pheasants is also banned) and a similar facility is available for clubs wishing to hunt and shoot pen reared partridge.</P>

      <P>Since my initial appointment as Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht in January 1993, it has been one of my guiding principles to ensure that the workings of my Department be as relevant as possible to local communities and, indeed, I believe that the precepts of participation, access and consultation have been to the fore in all the initiatives which I have promoted during that time. This I feel has been particularly evident in a number of areas within my Department's remit, including the arts, heritage and broadcasting sectors.</P>
      <P>The functions of An Chomhairle Ealaíon, which is an independent statutory body, are set out in the Arts Acts, 1951 and 1973.  The functions are to:</P>
      <P> (a)  stimulate public interest in the arts;</P>
      <P>(b)  promote the knowledge, appreciation and practice of the arts;</P>
      <P>(c)  assist in approving the standards of the arts;</P>
      <P>(d)  organise or assist in the organising of exhibitions (within or without the State) of works of art and artistic craftsmanship. </P>
      <P>I believe that the functions of An Chomhairle as set out in the Arts Acts make it fully relevant to all sections of the community and I have no plans to amend the legislation in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should also point out that &ldquo;The Arts <Col N="1634" /> Plan 1995-1997&rdquo;, published recently by An Chomhairle Ealaíon, sets access and participation as one of its strategic objectives.  It is the aim of An Chomhairle to encourage real participation in the arts in terms of availability and access, with particular reference to young people, children and people with disabilities and taking account of social as well as geographical barriers.  I will continue to work with An Chomhairle to ensure that this and all of the other strategic objectives of the plan are met.</P>
    <P>The Heritage Council is an independent statutory body established under the Heritage Act, 1995.  Under section 6 of that Act, the council is required to co-operate with public authorities, educational bodies and other organisations and persons in the promotion of the functions of the council.  It is also empowered to provide assistance and advice to any person or body, including a public authority, in respect of any matter related to the identification, protection, preservation and enhancement of the national heritage.  I believe that these functions make the council fully relevant to local communities.</P>

      <P>EC Directive 79/409/EEC of 2 April 1979 (Birds Directive) was transposed into Irish law by S.I. 397 of 1985.  I am at present drafting a statutory instrument to transpose EC Directive 92/43/EEC (Habitats Directive) into Irish law.</P>
      <P>In accordance with the &ldquo;Birds Directive&rdquo;, member states are obliged to protect all wild birds and their habitats. Under Article 4 measures must be taken to conserve the habitat of two categories of wild birds i.e. certain listed rare or vulnerable species and regularly occurring migratory species.  Particular attention must be paid to the protection of wetlands and particularly to wetlands of international importance.  Member states are required to designate the most important areas for these species as Special Protection Areas (SPAs).  To date 75 sites, totalling some 157,000 ha approximately, have been designated as SPAs.  This amounts to 2 per cent approximately of the area of the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In accordance with the Habitats Directive member states are required to designate Special Areas of Conservation (SACs) in order to ensure the restoration or maintenance of natural habitats or species of community interest at a favourable conservation status.  Member states are required to <Col N="1637" /> take steps to avoid any significant deterioration of such habitats or disturbance of such species and any plan or project which would have such effect must be assessed and, if it would have a significant adverse effect on the integrity of the site in question, it must not be accepted by the competent national authority except in exceptional circumstances.</P>
    <P>This directive applies these conditions to SPAs also.  This does not mean that existing activities must be curtailed or that no new developments may take place in or near the vicinity of these areas but it does require that the implications of proposed changes must be assessed having regard in each case to the site's conservation objectives.</P>
    <P>A notice of any proposal to designate sites as SPAs is announced in all the national daily newspapers, local papers and relevant publications.  In addition a copy of the notice is forwarded to relevant planning authorities and to a range of conservation and development organisations including Government Departments and semi-state bodies.  A period of four weeks is allowed for comments and, on occasion, comments received after the four week period have been accepted.  After considering the comments received, the Minister determines whether or not to designate the site as an SPA.  When the order has been made designating a site as an SPA a notice to that effect is published in the national daily newspapers, local papers and relevant publications.  A copy of the order is also forwarded to relevant planning authorities.  In addition copies of the order are laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas for 21 sitting days.  It is evisaged that similar provisions will be made for public consultation in regard to SACs.</P>
    <P>There is no provision for compensation under S.I. 397 of 1985.  I am considering the provisions to be made in the S.I. transferring the Habitats Directive into Irish law.  Since all these areas will be natural heritage areas, farmers <Col N="1638" /> whose lands are within them will be eligible under the Rural Environment Protection Scheme (REPS) for a maximum payment of £6,000 (.i. £150 per ha up to a maximum of 40 ha).  Under this scheme, farmers may be requested to farm in an environmentally friendly manner and will be asked to refrain from undertaking activities that may threaten the habitat e.g. pollution, forestry, reclamation, etc.</P>

      <P>While I have statutory responsibility for the National Archives certain reserve powers under the National Archives Act, 1986 in relation to whether files should remain closed to public inspection remain with An Taoiseach.</P>
      <P>The bulk of the files in the National Archives which are closed to inspection are less than 50 years old.  However, a small but nevertheless significant proportion of the files for the 1920s and 1930s are closed.  On occasion a file of papers recording confidential information of a personal nature dating mainly from the post-1922 period also contains some earlier papers, and it appears that the oldest paper on a file closed for this reason is one dating from 1901.</P>
      <P>Under the National Archives Act, 1986 files of Government Departments over 30 years old must automatically be transferred to the National Archives to be made available for public inspection unless there is a certificate from an officer of a Department of State saying the file is in regular use.</P>
      <P>Under the 1986 Act an officer of the Department of State, with the consent of an officer of the Department of the Taoiseach may also decide that a file may remain closed for a number of other reasons, where there would be a breach of statutory duty, where information has been given in confidence, where information of a personal nature might endanger or distress living individuals, where there is the possibility of a defamation action, or if giving of information would be contrary to public interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1642" /> The Taoiseach is also empowered by a statutory order under the Act to prescribe a class of file that is not to be made available.  He also has an overriding power, notwith standing the restrictions, that files over 30 years old be transferred to archives for release for public inspection.</P>
    <P>Reviews of certificates prohibiting access are required by the relevant Department of State at least once every five years.  There is no legislative bar to an earlier review by the particular Department concerned.</P>
    <P>I am exploring the possibility of a system of review, as a matter of course, taking place at intervals of less than five years and how this might be achieved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht (Mr. M. Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>Natural Heritage Areas (NHAs) will not be designated until the Wildlife Act, 1976, is amended, all known land owners and occupiers in the areas proposed for designation have been informed and any objections to designations have been considered.</P>
      <P>The National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) met with the farming and conservation organisations, prior to the public advertisement of proposed NHAs, and discussed the project with them.  Their views have been noted and taken into consideration and their assistance is appreciated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>NHAs are proposals at present and the consultation process is ongoing and will continue.  The NPWS is attending <Col N="1643" /> public meetings and rural environment protection scheme (REPS) training courses in order to explain the proposed NHA classification to land owners and occupiers.  Efforts to identify all land owners and occupiers with land included within the proposed NHAs are continuing.  The NPWS has met and continues to meet representatives of local communities, and individuals where the communities or individuals request such meetings.</P>
    <P>Where land owners or occupiers find that the inclusion of their lands in a proposed NHA is causing a difficulty they may discuss the matter with the local wildlife ranger or district wildlife officer of the NPWS.  The officer concerned will arrange to examine the land and see if an error has occurred.  In the event that such discussions fail to resolve matters an individual may apply to the headquarters of the NPWS, for the case to be reviewed by scientists, removed from the selection procedures, who have been arranged to examine such cases.</P>
    <P>As the areas included in the proposed NHA were selected on the basis of their specified wildlife conservation value, a successful applicant will have to show that the specified wildlife interest does not, in fact, exist on the land in question.</P>
    <P>The proposed NHAs place no formal conditions on these lands and have no effect on the pre-existing use of these lands pending whatever provisions are made in the amendment to the 1976 Wildlife Act.</P>
    <P>They do not affect ownership rights, including access, grazing, sporting or turbary rights or existing use of land.  It is intended to protect them by obtaining the co-operation and goodwill of landowners and farmers.  Farmers are asked not to engage in development or activities which will damage these areas.  It is EU and Government policy not to grant-aid environmentally damaging developments.  All grant-aiding bodies have been advised of the location of the proposed NHAs and will take account of them when deciding whether or not <Col N="1644" /> any particular development is eligible for a grant.  In the event of refusing grant-aid, the refusal is based on the likely damage to the environment and not the fact that the land is included in a proposed NHA.</P>
    <P>Planning authorities have been asked to include the areas in their development plans and to afford the NPWS an opportunity to make representations or to submit reports on any adverse development likely to impact on these sites.  The NPWS will avail of the planning process to object to any damaging development.</P>

      <P>The migration of coverage of events of national and international significance from traditional public service television services to satellite delivered subscription and pay per view services is not, in my view, in the public interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With the ever increasing number of international satellite delivered television channels, and given the importance of sports events in particular in attracting audiences of sufficient size to interest advertisers, organisations promoting such events now find themselves <Col N="1645" /> in the position of being in a seller's market in which public service broadcasters can be regularly outbid for the rights to cover them.</P>
    <P>In Ireland I believe that many, if not all, of our sporting organisations continue to recognise that they have a social and cultural role that transcends pure commercial considerations. However, one of the purposes of the Green Paper on the future of broadcasting was to stimulate debate on the development of a legislative regime that ensures that the public interest in broadcasting continues to be served.  The question raised by the Deputy is one which I will address as I develop firm proposals for legislative change. However, any changes in legislation which might be contemplated would have to respect the constitutional rights of the organisations concerned.</P>

      <P>I have no particular concerns in the way that the 1995 provision of £89 million for official development assistance (ODA) is being spent this year.  Ireland's total ODA is made up from expenditure not only from the Vote for International Co-operation but also from Central Funds and Votes of other Departments e.g. Agriculture.  Of the total of £89 million, £53.3 million is allocated to bilateral aid and £33.8 million through multilateral agencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1648" /> Multilateral aid is channelled through international organisations such as the EU, the UN and their related agencies for use in developing countries.  All of the payments to the EU and most of those to the World Bank Group and the UN agricultural and food agencies are mandatory, arising from our membership of those organisations.  Contributions to the UN development agencies such as UNICEF, UNDP and UNHCR are voluntary.</P>
    <P>Bilateral assistance comprises direct expenditure by the Government on emergency humanitarian relief, rehabilitation and long-term development programmes in our priority countries.  It also includes such schemes as the Nongovernmental Cofinancing Scheme and the Fellowship Programme.  An annual grant is given to the agency for Personal Service Overseas which is the body responsible for sending skilled Irish people to assist in passing on expertise to developing countries.  Individual project details are available in the report <i>Irish Aid &mdash; Ireland's Official Development Assistance</i> which is published annually by my Department.</P>
    <P>The first priority of official development assistance is to provide assistance to poorer developing countries; this assistance is designed to meet basic needs and to contribute to long-term economic and social development. There is also an emphasis that the assistance provided is both targeted and costeffective. Irish Aid projects are subjected to regular reviews and evaluation from sectoral experts within the Development Co-operation.  They are also subject to the scrutiny of Dáil Committees such as the Public Accounts Committee and the ODA Sub-committee of the Foreign Affairs Committee and to review by international bodies such as the Development Assistance Committee of the OECD.  Agencies in receipt of public moneys for Emergency Assistance and from the NGO Cofinancing Scheme are required to produce reports on how the moneys are spent.</P>
    <P>It is the continuing concern of my <Col N="1649" /> Department to ensure that the money spent both bilaterally and multilaterally reaches its targets and is used in the most effective way possible.</P>

      <P>Officials of the Irish Embassy in London have, on my instructions, made regular consular visits to the relevant prisons. They have met with the prisoners concerned in each case and discussed their complaints with the prison authorities. Visits over the past year were as follows:</P>

    <P>A further consular visit to five republican prisoners at Belmarsh is expected to take place this week.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy is aware, several members of the Oireachtas have also visited republican prisoners in Britain and they have first-hand knowledge of the complaints which I and my Department have been dealing with in recent months.  The health of the prisoners has always been my first concern, particularly so in the case of two prisoners who were until recently engaged in a protest at Whitemoor Prison.  That protest has now ended and both prisoners have been moved out of the special secure unit at Whitemoor.  I hope that they will soon be transferred to prison in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons entered into force in this jurisdiction on 1 November last. The Government believe that this offers a constructive way forward in dealing with the problems faced by the republican prisoners in Britain and their families. We have made clear that we stand ready to receive those who wish to be transferred to this jurisdiction.  In the meantime, Embassy officials will continue to maintain contact with the prisoners through regular visits.</P>

      <P>Under section 20 of the VAT Act, I can make refund orders in respect of VAT borne by bodies who would not be entitled to recover the tax under the normal VAT rules.  A number of such orders have been made over the years; the scheme to which the Deputy refers relates to specialised items of medical equipment costing in excess of £20,000 exclusive of VAT which are purchased for hospitals by means of voluntary subscription.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of introducing a similar scheme for equipment purchased for schools by voluntary fund raising efforts has been raised on a number of occasions in recent years but was ruled out as not being the most suitable mechanism for assisting schools.  In the first place, in order to have any appreciable effect, a refund scheme would have to <Col N="1654" /> be of much wider application than the one for medical equipment which is restricted to expensive items in excess of £20,000.  It would also be very difficult to confine it to schools alone.  There would be understandable pressure to extend it to all educational establishments and, in fact, to the very wide range of voluntary fund raising activity in this country.  As well as being costly in budgetary terms, any such wide ranging scheme would infringe the basic requirement of the EU VAT system that educational and voluntary bodies should bear VAT on their purchases.</P>
    <P>There is also a fundamental practical difficulty with any VAT refund scheme for schools in that it would be extremely difficult to ensure that such a scheme would focus on those most in need &mdash; i.e. those towards whom the State must direct scarce resources.  In practice, a targeted approach is best done through the expenditure side of the budget.  In this connection, I would point out that the level of capitation grants to primary schools had been increased significantly in recent years from £28 per pupil in 1992 to the present grant level of £40 per pupil.  Furthermore, special assistance for equipment, etc. is available for schools in disadvantaged areas.</P>

      <P>While the social welfare treatment of married and cohabiting couples, under social assistance schemes, is primarily a matter for the Minister for Social Welfare, it appears that the Supreme Court held in the Hyland case in 1989 that it was unconstitutional for the relevant social welfare provisions to treat a married couple living together less favourably than an (unmarried) cohabiting couple.  This judgment has been given effect by treating cohabiting couples in the same way as married couples for social welfare purposes.</P>
      <P>In relation to taxation, there are no special income tax allowances for unmarried couples living together.  In this context, I would point out that tax law follows the general law relating to marriage.  The basis on which the married person's tax free allowance (and double rate bands) is given derives from the Supreme Court decision in Murphy <i>vs</i> The Attorney General (1980) which held that it was contrary to the Constitution for a married couple to pay more tax than two single people living together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am conscious of the difficulties which can arise for cohabiting couples in certain circumstances because of the way they are treated by the tax and social welfare systems.  The expert group on the integration of the tax and social welfare systems has been looking <Col N="1656" /> at, <i>inter alia,</i> the type of situation outlined above.  The group is expected to report shortly and I will carefully consider the group's recommendations.</P>

      <Quest>if, in respect of the tax year 1995/1996, he will give details of the disposable income, net of income tax, PRSI levies, travelling to work expenses, FIS entitlements, the value of a medical card, local authority differential rent, and the usual social welfare entitlements of a married employee with a spouse and three dependant children living in a local authority house, with a non-working spouse, earning gross incomes at £1,000 intervals between £6,000 and £16,000 per annum; and the plans, if any, he has to adjust the tax and welfare systems to improve the operation of the labour market.</Quest>

      <P>The net income for an employed married person, with a non-working spouse and three children, earning gross incomes at £1,000 intervals between £6,000 and £16,000 per annum is shown in the following table.  This table also sets out the additions to and deductions from gross income in arriving at levels of net income.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that an unemployed married person with three children would have a net income of £7,124 per annum when account is taken of all allowances, including secondary benefits, medical card, and the costs of local authority differential rent and work-seeking. When this is compared with the information in the table it is clear that at all gross incomes between £6,000 and £16,000 this person is better off in work rather than in unemployment.  Indeed the married person described would be better off in work at any level of earnings from employment when his earnings and family income supplement are taken into account.</P>
      <P>The Government recognises that adjusting the tax and welfare systems to improve the operation of the labour market is an important policy objective. In recognition of the considerable complexities involved, the Government set up a working group of experts in the tax and social welfare area to look at these issues with a view to developing a strategic approach to the closer integration of the tax and social welfare systems. The Government is awaiting the Group's final report.</P>

    <P>Notes on Table:</P>
    <P>1.  The main factors contributing to the apparent decline in net income as gross income increases are the withdrawal rate of Family Income Supplement (60 per cent) and the operation of marginal relief for income tax (involving a 40 pe cent tax rate).</P>
    <P>2.  It is essential in interpreting this table that the mechanism for reviewing Family Income Supplement (FIS) is understood.  FIS is renewable on a 12-monthly basis.  Once awarded it will not be reduced/withdrawn until the end of the period regardless of any upward movements in pay.  Therefore, gross income from employment can increase significantly during the course of a year while any adjustment of FIS will not occur until after the end of the year.  The Expert Working Group has pointed out in its interim report that FIS withdrawal does not generally occur at the same time as a gross pay increase.</P>
    <P>3.  The numbers of people who potentially lose disposable income as gross pay increases are small.  In so far as FIS and marginal relief income tax are the main elements of the trap, the number of people affected by the trap is essentially a function of the numbers who both receive FIS and pay tax. The numbers of people both paying tax and receiving FIS is of the order of 1,500 to 2,000.  The OECD has also concluded that this situation potentially &ldquo;applied only to a very small proportion of the employee workforce (0.75 per cent)&rdquo;. </P>

        <i>Limerick East):</i> The duration of the free fuel scheme is the same for disabled person's maintenance allowance recipients as it is for social welfare recipients i.e. 26 weeks.  The scheme commenced on Monday 16 October 1995 and will operate up to the week ending 12 April 1996.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Southern Health Board pays disabled person's maintenance allowance recipients the free fuel allowance in two <Col N="1662" /> instalments &mdash; one payment of £55 for the 11 week period up to 29 December 1995 and another payment of £75 made in January 1996 for the period of 15 weeks up to 12 April 1996.</P>
    <P>In certain built-up areas of Cork, new regulations banning the sale of bituminous coal came into effect on 28 February 1995.  The Southern Health Board, in determining eligibility for the allowance for 1995-96, had to check each application to ascertain whether the applicant qualified for the basic £5 per week allowance or the higher allowance of £8 per week granted to offset the extra cost of smokeless fuel.  The processing of applications therefore took longer than in previous years when such regulations did not apply.  Nevertheless, the Southern Health Board made all payments for the 11 week period up to 29 December by mid-November.</P>

        <i>Limerick East):</i> I am currently considering the question of representation on health boards in the context of the proposals in the Health Strategy to end direct funding of certain voluntary agencies. I will take the views and concerns of all sectors involved in the provision and delivery of healthcare into account in making my decisions.  The Deputy will appreciate, however, that it will not be possible to appoint representatives of all the many interested parties to positions at board level.</P>

        <i>Limerick East):</i> The information referred to by the Deputy was reported to my Department by the North-Eastern Health Board.  Due to a clerical error by the board the figure of 6,914 adults recorded as being treated by private opticians in 1991 under the sight testing scheme were, in fact, treated by the health board's own ophthalmologist.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> Disabled person's maintenance allowance is the primary income support scheme operated by my Department for people who, because of their disability, cannot work and are not in a position to maintain themselves in the community.</P>
      <P>Under section 69 of the Health Act, 1970, health boards, in assessing eligibility for disabled person's maintenance allowance, are obliged to have regard to the means of both the applicant and his/her spouse.  A disabled person's maintenance allowance recipient is entitled to earn £34.10 in rehabilitative training or employment without affecting his/her entitlement to disabled person's maintenance allowance.</P>
      <P>I am aware of differences between the assessment of means for disabled person's maintenance allowance and for social assistance schemes under the Department of Social Welfare.  The spouse of a social welfare recipient on unemployment assistance is entitled to earn up to £60 per week, including travelling expenses, without affecting entitlement to this allowance.  There is no similar provision under the disabled person's maintenance allowance regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy is no doubt aware, responsibility for the disabled person's maintenance allowance scheme is in the process of being transferred to the Department of Social Welfare.  The Department of Social Welfare took over responsibility for the payment of disabled person's maintenance allowance on 1 August 1995 and it is expected that <Col N="1666" /> responsibility for the administration of disabled person's maintenance allowance will transfer to the Department of Social Welfare in early 1996.  I have no plans to change the existing disabled person's maintenance allowance regulations pending this transfer but I will bring the Deputy's concerns to the attention of my colleague, the Minister for Social Welfare.</P>

      <P>Section 15 of the Child Care Act places a duty on the health boards to make arrangements for the provision of suitable accommodation for children who are taken into care in emergencies.  It is one of the 44 sections of the Act which came into force on 31 October 1995.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Health boards have a range of options <Col N="1667" /> open to them in discharging their responsibilities under this section.  These include short-term residential accommodation, emergency hostels, short-term foster care placements and other crisis intervention supports.  As the House will be aware since 1993, additional funding of the order of £30 million on an annualised basis has been provided to develop child care and family support services.  These developments have strengthened the capacity of the health boards to meet the demands of the new legislation and to respond to emergency situations. However, there is still much room for improvement and, with the support of the Minister for Health, I will be seeking additional resources for child care in the Estimates for 1996.</P>
    <P>In relation to homeless children, as I have indicated here before, I do not regard the use of bed and breakfast accommodation as an acceptable response to the problem of youth home-lessness.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to say that in the Eastern Health Board area, where the use of bed and breakfast is highest, the board is urgently pursuing all avenues open to it to increase the availability of accommodation for the young homeless.  The board is committed to implementing the report of a joint Health Board/Union Working Group which recommends the cesation of the use of bed and breakfast accommodation from the end of this year.  It is my firm intention that the use of bed and breakfast accommodation be eliminated at the earliest possible date.</P>

As in the case of other law centres the staffing of that centre is, I understand, being kept under review having regard to the demands placed on it for legal services.</P>

      <P>As I indicated in my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 31 on 26 October 1995, I and my colleague, Deputy Brendan Howlin, Minister for the Environment, established in February of this year an inter-departmental working group made up of officials of my Department, the Department of the Environment and the Office of Public Works to examine and report back with recommendations on improving the protection for listed buildings, including placing the system of listed buildings on a statutory basis, introducing incentives for the proper upkeep and maintenance of such buildings and undertaking a full national <Col N="1672" /> architectural audit, pursuant to commitments in the policy agreement for Government, <i>A Government of Renewal.</i></P>
      <P>To date, the working group has met on nine occasions.  As I indicated in the aforementioned reply, the working group is engaging in broad consultations with local authorities and with other interested bodies and persons in relation to the issues raised by its terms of reference, and representatives of the working group visited Scotland in August of this year to familiarise themselves with the Scottish listed buildings system and the incentives for the upkeep and maintenance of such buildings, and I am informed that the working group is making good progress and expects to be able to submit its report by early next year.</P>
      <P>The working group has not been asked to prepare a report for publication but to report the recommendations of the officials for the consideration of the Minister for the Environment and myself.  I can assure the Deputy that we will give careful consideration to that report and to the introduction of any necessary new policy initiatives in this area.</P>

      <P>Provision exists for the protection of the architectural heritage, including industrial stone buildings, under the National Monuments Acts and under the local authority listing system.  I have introduced improved protection for monuments by the procedure of Recorded Monuments in the National Monuments (Amendment) Act, 1994.  There is also the existing provisions for placing preservation orders on monuments of national importance and for the State to intervene directly by acquiring such monuments where this is necessary and appropriate.  Prime examples of such interventions are Newmills, County Donegal, which encompasses a flax and a corn mill, which was acquired by the State and restored as a working mill and is now open to the public, and Bunnadober Mill, Ballinrobe, County Mayo, which is a unique and very important example of industrial archaeology, and whose acquisition on behalf of the State I have approved with a view to its restoration and presentation to the public.</P>

The Operational Programme sets out <Col N="1679" /> the road development programme in broad terms, focusing, in the case of national roads, on four key corridors; these were selected having regard to the proposed Trans European Networks, their importance in linking economic and population centres, ports and airports, and their contribution to the promotion of economic integration by improving access to the more remote and border areas.

      <P>The 13th assistant's post was provisionally sanctioned by my Department earlier this year.  The post was sanctioned because the managerial authorities at the school projected that the enrolment of the school in September 1995 would be 424 pupils.  An enrolment of 424 would qualify the school for a developing school post.</P>
      <P>The school subsequently failed to achieve this enrolment.  Accordingly the 13th assistant's post at the school has now been suppressed.</P>
      <P>In the circumstances, I regret that the teacher in question will not be permitted to remain at the school for the 1995-96 school year.  However, she has been offered panel rights.</P>

      <P>As school maintenance is funded from the capitation grant and, therefore, a matter for individual schools, I take it the Deputy's question relates to capital improvement works which receive specific grant-aid from my Department.</P>
      <P>Part of the capital allocation for school building purposes is made available each year, for urgent works, including refurbishments.  These projects have a high priority and, as far as possible are undertaken during the year they are approved.</P>
      <P>The factors which have the greatest influence on the timing of the execution of such works include planning, the availability of the local financial contribution, and whether the work needs to be carried out during school closure periods.</P>
      <P>If the Deputy has a specific project in mind, perhaps she might give the details to my office and I will arrange to have the matter examined.</P>

      <P>I responded to concerns expressed about the circulation of referendum literature in national schools by issuing a statement on Thursday, 9 November last which drew attention to Rule 9 (3) of the Rules for National Schools which states:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;No political meeting may be held nor may any political business be transacted in schools...&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1692" /> I reminded schools that the only exceptions to the rule are (1) the use of schools as polling stations and (2) the use of schoolrooms outside of school hours for public meetings at specific periods during elections.</P>

      <P>The returns in relation to the uptake of the Stay Safe Programme for the school year ending June 1995 revealed that 99.7 per cent of schools had availed of teacher training; 80 per cent of schools had held information meetings for parents; and just under 60 per cent were teaching the programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1693" /> I am awaiting returns from the Child Abuse Prevention Programme (CAPP) on the precise progress made so far in this school year.  However, experience has shown that the number of schools teaching the programme quickly converges close to the number that have held parent meetings.  As soon as updated returns become available from CAPP I will make them available to the Deputy.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that the CAPP team is now assisted by a wider network of 40 teachers.  These teachers are involved in particular in the provision of parent education which is pivotal to ensuring that schools subsequently introduce the programme.  To that end CAPP is targeting the 20 per cent of schools which to date have not held parent meetings and is offering its support.</P>

      <P>My Department has received applications from the schools in question for inclusion in the remedial teaching service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Earlier this year, I allocated 55 remedial teacher posts to the primary school sector with effect from September 1995.  This allocation brings the <Col N="1694" /> total number of remedial posts in the primary sector to 1,188.</P>
    <P>These posts were allocated on the basis of priority of need following the collection and analysis of data by my Department's primary inspectorate. Unfortunately, the schools referred to by the Deputies were not successful on this ocasion.</P>
    <P>I will continue to review needs in this area and consider how best these needs can be addressed within available resources.  The needs of all schools, including the schools mentioned by the Deputies, will be considered in this context.</P>

      <P>Details of the number of remedial teachers, resource teachers and special class teachers operating in each county at primary level are set out in the following table.</P>
      <P>Remedial and resource teachers are allocated on the basis of priority of need.  I recently allocated an additional 55 remedial teachers and ten resource teachers to primary schools with effect from September 1995.</P>
      <P>In addition to the above supports, the visiting teacher service provides special tuition for children with visual or hearing impairment and certain other disabilities. A total of 37 visiting teachers are currently in place.  The service provided by these teachers can straddle a number of counties.</P>
      <P>Teachers are automatically allocated to special classes for mildly handicapped children once the need for such a service has been established.</P>
      <P>The White Paper on Education <i>Charting our Education Future</i> sets out the future strategy for providing a suitable education service for pupils with special needs.</P>

      <P>The structure for In-Career Development is set out in the White Paper <i>Charting our Education Future.</i> At central level, the structure provides for an in-career development unit in my Department.  The unit is advised by two committees, one for primary and one for second level issues, <Col N="1701" /> and representative of management bodies, teachers, providers and parents.  A policy development commitee, composed of senior Department officials and chaired by the chief inspector, advises on the work of the unit.</P>
      <P>Administratively, the in-career unit, in common with other sections-branches of the Department where substantial expenditure is involved, is headed by a principal officer.  There are three senior inspectors working full-time in the unit, as well as some other management and administrative staff.</P>
      <P>Funding to the unit for in-career activity is provided under Vote 26, subhead B6.  Estimated expenditure under this Vote for 1995 is £6.6 million. Administrative costs are provided for under my Department's administrative budget.</P>
      <P>The main functions of the in-career unit are set out in the White Paper <i>Charting our Education Future.</i> Broadly, these are in-career policy formulation, in-career priorities and to manage overall in-career provision in a cost effective way to ensure that programme priorities are met and quality courses are provided.</P>

      <P>The establishment of Education Boards will involve changing the administration framework for education. This process will not result in a completely new area of expenditure, in addition to the present expenditure levels, but rather will also involve the reallocation of funding and administrative responsibilities within the education system. In this process, resources will be freed from some areas to help offset resource needs in other areas.</P>
      <P>The White Paper on Education, <i>Charting Our Education Future,</i> makes clear that the establishment of Education Boards will take place on a phased basis, following the enactment of the necessary legislation.  The gradual transfer of functions to the boards will facilitate careful appraisal of the incremental costs in the context of the Education Estimates for the year in question, within the overall context of the budgetary parameters approved by Government.  It is therefore not possible to be precise at this stage about the administrative cost of the education boards, taking account of all the relevant factors, when the new arrangements become fully operational.</P>
      <P>I should conclude by saying that consideration of any additional costs should take into account the significant benefits which the new arrangements will bring &mdash; benefits in terms of improved regional planning and co-ordination of all education services, and the provision of support services to primary and secondary schools in the most cost-effective way.</P>

      <P>I would like to inform the Deputy that every member of An Garda Síochána is trained to protect life and property, to safeguard the liberties of the individual citizen, to preserve the public peace, to prevent crime and to seek, identify and eliminate the causes of crime.</P>
      <P>Every garda, in the course of his or her duty, recognises that elderly people may feel particularly vulnerable and may suffer greatly from the fear of becoming a victim of crime.  With this recognition in mind, the Garda authorities have assured me that the gardaí pay particular attention to the elderly in all aspects of their duties.  There are a number of community relations schemes in existence which are aimed at those who are especially vulnerable in our community to ensure their safety.</P>
      <P>The neighbourhood watch scheme now covers 326,769 homes through 1,946 schemes nation-wide.  This scheme has proved a great beneift to the elderly in that not only does it prevent crime but it has reduced the fear of crime in their neighbourhoods.  As part of the scheme Liaison members and civilian co-ordinators regularly visit the homes of the elderly and ensure that they do not feel isolated</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1706" /> Another scheme which is community based is the community alert scheme which was established in 1985.  There are at present 799 schemes covering 155,464 homes.  This scheme was originally started as a programme to counteract attacks on the elderly and to encourage a sense of neighbourliness in the community.  I am informed by the Garda authorities that this scheme, with its strong emphasis on the welfare of the elderly, has proved very successful in reducing attacks on the elderly &mdash; in 1985 there were 177 reported attacks on the elderly while the 1994 figure had dropped to 69 attacks.  Visitors in the Community Alert areas regularly call on the elderly residents to give security advice and reassurance.  I recently launched a new video and literature funded by the PMPA and these will help to ensure that our senior citizens, and indeed those providing help to them, have accurate and up to date advice.</P>
    <P>Within the present policing arrangements there are gardaí and sergeants who are employed on community relations duties and part of their brief includes liaising with senior citizens groups.  They are involved in holding security information days, arranging for door locks to be fitted as necessary, and especially for informal calls to individual people in their homes so helping to reduce the fear of crime.</P>
    <P>The Garda authorities are also in liaison with other statutory bodies such as the Department of Health, Eastern Health Board and with Dublin Corporation in promoting the &ldquo;Reach Out&rdquo; campaign.  This is a public information campaign designed to make the public more aware of their old and reclusive neighbours who live alone and who may be at risk, and to encourage members of the public to help where possible. Neighbourhood gardaí in Dublin arrange for the distribution of posters and literature within their area of work and this acts as a catalyst for their involvement with old folk groups.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1707" /> Earlier this year the senior citizens advice leaflet was re-issued by the community relations section of the Garda. It contains detailed information on cash security, care of property, callers to the door and house security.  Garda community relations and crime prevention officers regularly offer advice to the public on the many methods and products available which can be utilised to make prospective criminal targets less vulnerable.  Through the compilation of security surveys on houses, apartments, factories, shops and offices, the Garda authorities try to ensure that the best possible practice in crrme prevention techniques is adopted.</P>
    <P>The Garda authorities have informed me that all of the policing programmes within the community relations field are under continual review and are modified and updated as necessary to meet the changing need of our society.</P>

      <P>Exchange rates can fluctuate frequently.  In view of this and the fact that a considerable number of Irish non-contributory pensioners are in receipt of British pensions, it would not be practicable to re-assess entitlement to old age non-contributory pension each time currency exchange rates move.  A realistic approach for resolving this problem has therefore been adopted by my Department. When calculating means based upon EU pensions, the Department employs an exchange rate mechanism which is used within the EU in relation to certain social security transactions between member states.</P>
      <P>Any person in receipt of a United Kingdom retirement pension whose means have changed as a result of the change in value of sterling may be entitled to an old age non-contributory pension from my Department provided their means do not exceed IR£66 per week.  A United Kingdom pensioner who is already in receipt of an old age (non-contributory) pension and whose means have reduced as a result is entitled to request a review of his or her means assessment at any time.</P>
      <P>People in receipt of United Kingdom pensions, who, for instance, may be waiting for the non-contributory old age pension application to be processed, who are experiencing difficulty as a result of their income falling below the appropriate rate of supplementary welfare allowance for their family size should also contact the community welfare officer at their local Health Centre.</P>
      <P>While I have no plans to change the current arrangements, the position is being kept under review.</P>

      <P>The means test applied in determining entitlement to unemployment assistance, and other analogous schemes, includes a notional assessment of the value of any capital or investments held by the applicant.  The first £400 of capital is assessed at 5 per cent, while the balance is assessed at 10 per cent.  The provisions in question have not been modified since their introduction in 1934.  Successive budgets have instead focused on increasing the rates of payment for all recipients as the best option for targeting those most in need. At present rates of payment, a single person may have capital of almost £33,000, and a couple with two children may have capital of just under £66,000, and still qualify for some unemployment assistance.</P>
      <P>The provisions for the assessment of capital are, however, currently being reviewed in my Department with a view to devising proposals for a standard method of assessment of capital for all social assistance payments, including unemployment assistance.  In view of the substantial costs involved, however, any changes in this area would have to be considered in the context of available resources.</P>

      <P>Increases are payable with most social welfare payments in respect of both adult and child dependants. Where the spouse of a claimant has personal income in excess of £60, however, no adult dependant allowance, and only half the value of the child dependant allowance, is paid.  The estimated full year cost of increasing this £60 threshold to £80 for all short-term schemes, including unemployment benefit and assistance and disability benefit, is £19 million.  An additional cost would be associated with intoducing the measure for long-term schemes.</P>
      <P>In recognition of the difficulties caused by the operation of the threshold, representing a sudden withdrawal of a substantial component of household income, section 15 of the Social Welfare Act, 1995 introduced regulatory powers to enable an increase to be paid in respect of a spouse or partner who is not regarded as being an adult dependant by virtue of having personal income in excess of £60.  Various options for implementing this measure are currently being considered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>The function of the development agencies is to assist industry to become more competitive and thus generate increased economic growth and employment.  It is not practical to calculate the cost per job created in firms assisted by the agencies on a year to year basis.  The reason for this is that the grants paid out in a particular year do not necessarily impact on employment levels in the same year. Equity funding and capital grant payments, for example, are often made prior to the creation of new employment, while employment grants are paid retrospectively.  Research and development and technology acquisition grants are not directly linked to employment, but as they have a significant impact on competitiveness, it is also necessary to take them into account.</P>
      <P>Because the provision of financial support by the State agencies and the creation of jobs in the firms assisted both take place over an extended period, it is necessary to reflect this in the methodology for assessing the grant cost per job.  The indicator employed, grant cost per job sustained, is defined as the sum of all Forbairt and IDA grant payments over a seven year period, divided by the number of first time jobs created and still in existence at the end of that period.  For the purposes of this calculation, a first time job is defined as the increase in employment in a company over and above the peak employment level in the previous five years and related to a specific investment programme agreed with IDA Ireland or Forbairt.  The grant cost per job sustained for the seven year period 1988 to 1994 was £9,930 for Forbairt companies and £12,786 for IDA Ireland companies, giving an overll average of £11,409.  The corresponding cost for Shannon Development was £12,476.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The cost per job sustained methodology has not yet been applied to the enterprise assisted by the county <Col N="1717" /> enterprise boards, which only completed their first full year operation in 1994.  Since their inception in 1993 to date, 35 county enterprise boards have approved £35.8 million in grant aid to 4,244 projects.  These projects have a job creation potential of 6,400 full-time and 1,500 part-time jobs.</P>
    <P>I will be addressing the monitoring of cost per job further as one element in a wider review of performance indicators which will form part of the enterprise strategy which I intend to publish shortly.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, there has been considerable speculation that UK multiples have been considering entering the Northern Ireland retail market and possibly the Republic of Ireland market.</P>
      <P>To date, I am not aware of any specific developments in regard to the Republic of Ireland market.  However, were any of the UK or indeed any other multiples to consider acquiring an Irish retail operation, such an acquisition would be likely to fall within the scope of the mergers and take-overs legislation and, accordingly, would require notification to me.  In examining a proposed merger or take-over, I have regard to whether the proposed merger or take-over concerned would be likely to prevent or restrict competition or restrain trade in any goods or services and would be likely to operate against the common good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From a general competition point of view, my concerns are that markets for goods and services throughout the Irish economy should be competitive, that competition should be fair and that consumers should share in the benefits of competition through greater choice, <Col N="1718" /> improved quality of product and lower prices in particular.</P>
    <P>I would add that, in line with the policy agreement for Government, I propose to strengthen competition law, through the Competition (Amendment) Bill, 1994, by giving the Competition Authority powers of enforcement and by enabling the Courts to impose stiff fines on those found to be engaging in unfair competition.  I intend to seek to have the Bill enacted at an early date.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will also be aware of my decision earlier this year to retain the Restrictive Practices (Groceries) Order, 1987 for a period of two year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned at the number of accidents which take place in Irish industry.  According to the Health and Safety Authority there are many sectors of employment in this country in which the rates of injury, death and illness are well above the national level.  In this regard, one of the principal functions of the Health and Safety Authority is to encourage and foster activities and measures which are directed towards the promotion of safety, health and welfare of persons at work.  However, health and safety standards will not be raised solely through enforcement activities.  Industry itself has a legal and moral responsibility to manage and control risk in the workplace.</P>
      <P>The cost of employers' liability insurance in this country is dictated primarily by the frequency of accidents and the cost of claims incurred.  Clearly, there is an onus on employers to instigate and maintain health and safety procedures in their own interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1719" /> As previously indicated to this House, I have commissioned a detailed economic evaluation of insurance costs in Ireland to identify, among other things, the economic consequences of the relatively high level of insurance costs in Ireland including the effect on competitiveness and employment.  When this evaluation has been completed, my Department will bring forward measures in conjunction, where appropriate, with other Departments aimed at reducing the burden of insurance costs on the economy.  This should lead to an improvement in competitiveness with favourable consequences for employment recruitment and maintenance.</P>

      <P>In the development of the recently introduced standards-based apprenticeship system, FÁS and the National Apprenticeship Advisory Committee which is representative of the social partners, FÁS and the education sector consulted with the National Rehabilitation Board (NRB) to ensure that the needs of persons with disabilities would be catered for.  In addition, regular contact is maintained between FÁS, the NRB and the Rehab Group, formerly the Rehabilitation Institute on a range of apprenticeship <Col N="1720" /> matters relevant to persons with disabilities.</P>
      <P>The rules which were agreed as part of the development of the new system specifically provide a means of access to apprenticeship for persons with disabilities. In circumstances where those with a disability do not meet the requisite educational requirements, provisions is made for them to seek entry by completion of an approved course for persons with disabilities.</P>
      <P>FÁS will receive EU funding of around £65 million at 1995 prices for the operation of apprenticeship during the period 1994 to 1999, part of which already has, and will continue to be, expended in assisting disabled persons. Around £23 million at 1995 prices was allocated to the programme in respect of 1994-95, and this amount has been fully committed.  I am satisfied that the funding allocated for the remaining years to 1999 will also be fully spent. There is no separate allocation identified for disabled persons &mdash; spending in respect of this group is governed by demand levels.</P>
      <P>Following the introduction of the new apprenticeship system, meetings and consultations involving FÁS, the NRB and the Rehab Group took place on the important role of the Rehab Group National Training Centre in Ashtown, Dublin 15.  This Rehab Group Training Centre provides trade-type training for persons with disabilities who would experience difficulties in other open training establishments.  As a result of these contacts, FÁS has formally recognised Ashtown as an authorised training centre for the delivery of the off-the-job training phases of the standards-based apprenticeship system in the trades of cabinet maker, metal fabricator, carpenter/joiner and fitter.</P>
      <P>In a further development, FÁS, the NRB and the Rehab Group are currently piloting an arrangement in which the Ashtown Training Centre, together with host employers, would also provide the on-the-job phases of the programme in these same trades.</P>

      <P>The results of the appeal for reclassification of areas to more severely handicapped status were announced on 27 October 1995.  At that time I stated that farmers whose areas were not successful would be informed of the reasons why their areas had been omitted.</P>
      <P>Over 700 appeals for reclassification were received by the appeals panel, mostly from groups representing particular areas.  These were all examined in detail before the panel drew up their recommendations.  The criteria by which the panel selected areas for reclassification were that:</P>
      <P> (1)  areas must have an agricultural income of not more than 60 per cent of the national average agricultural income;</P>
      <P>(2)  the land quality of the area, as assessed by professional officers of my Department, must not be greater than four on a scale of 0 to nine.</P>
      <P>(3)  areas must be contiguous to the existing more severely handicapped area boundary or, if not contiguous, must be of at least 15,000 hectares in extent.  </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1725" /> Areas omitted from the appeals panel's recommendations failed to meet one or more of these criteria.</P>
    <P>Since the announcement of reclassified areas, I have received a large volume of representations from farmers and groups in unsuccessful areas inquiring as to the reasons for the omission of their areas.  All of these have been, and will continue to be, replied to promptly indicating the reasons why the appeals panel did not include their areas in the submission to the EU.</P>
    <P>Quite a number of the appeal applications received were in respect of large areas, and covered many townlands.  In many such cases, only some of the appealed areas were successful.  It would be a major task to re-examine each appeal in order to isolate the areas which were unsuccessful.  The townlands would then have to be examined and a report prepared in respect of each appeal.</P>
    <P>In order to minimise the size of this task, and to avoid contacting those who either do not require or have already received explanations, I would like to suggest that any farmer or group who wishes to know the position may contact the Department.  I can assure all who do that they will receive a prompt and informative reply.</P>

      <P>The distribution of the free beef under EU Regulation 3149/92 is being undertaken throughout the country by designated charitable organisations such as The Society of St. Vincent de Paul, Lions Clubs, Meals on Wheels etc.  No charitable organisation in this area has applied for the beef in question.  Only a small quantity, mainly corned beef, remains available for allocation. My Department would be pleased to hear from recognised charitable organisations so that this quantity can be distributed in areas which, up to now, have not indicated interest in the scheme.</P>

      <P>To date in 1995 a total of 30 confirmed sheep scab outbreaks have been reported to my Department as compared with a total of 56 for the year 1994.  Since the abolition of compulsory sheep dipping, there have been unverified reports of a rise in the incidence of sheep scab.  I have, accordingly, introduced a confidential phoneline service to assist with the reporting of suspected outbreaks.  Of a total of 69 calls received to date, sufficient information was received for follow-up action in respect of 21 of these calls.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the onus rests on individual flockowners to protect their sheep against scab, I have introduced a package of measures, following consultation with flockowner representatives, to highlight the need to control and eradicate the disease.  In addition, livestock mart managers have been asked to assist in combating sheep scab and my Department has undertaken to increase its vigilance at livestock marts, meat <Col N="1728" /> plants and farm inspections and to follow-up with the Local Authorities if any indications of scab arise.  I shall keep this programme under constant review. It is important to note that sheep scab is by law still a notifiable disease and outbreaks must be dealt with by compulsory treatment of the affected and contiguous flocks until the outbreak is controlled.</P>

      <P>The Ireland US Air Transport Agreement, as amended, provides that each US and Irish airline may operate one scheduled non-stop flight to/from Dublin for each <Col N="1729" /> scheduled non-stop flight that the airline operates to/from Shannon.  The entitlement for non-stop Dublin flights is applied on a 12 month basis encompassing one summer and one winter traffic season.  The entitlement is calculated on the basis of the total number of scheduled flights between the US and Ireland by each airline and not on a route-by-route basis.</P>
      <P>The question of compliance by airlines with the Ireland/US Agreement is closely monitored by my Department. In this regard, Aer Lingus have supplied my Department with full details of their proposed 1996 summer and winter transatlantic programme (commencing 31 March 1996) which includes the new Chicago service.  While the actual number of flights may vary slightly from the current programme, I can say that Aer Lingus propose to operate about 1,500 one way flights to/from Shannon and about 1,000 flights to/from Dublin during the 12 months in question.  On this basis, Aer Lingus will meet the terms of the Ireland/US Agreement.</P>
      <P>My Department and Aer Lingus maintain an on-going liaison in relation to their transatlantic programme and any amendments for operational or other reasons are notified to my Department.</P>

      <P>Under the Operational Programme for Environmental Services 1994-99 some £5.1 million is being invested in coastal protection works.  In order to identify priority works for possible inclusion under the Operational Programme, all coastal local authorities were requested to identify their top four priority protection proposals.</P>
      <P>Wicklow County Council in their submission to the Department of the Marine identified their priority projects as follows: (i) Protection of Bray promenade and seafront; (ii) Protection of North Beach, Arklow; (iii) Protection of cliff face in Greystones town and (iv) Protection of the Murrough, Wicklow.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1733" /> In relation to the Murrough, the Council have proposed extending the existing rock armour scheme by a further 600 metres.  The estimated cost of the works is in the region of £200,000.</P>
