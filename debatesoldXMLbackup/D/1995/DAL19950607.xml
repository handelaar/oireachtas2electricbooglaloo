      <P>Before coming to the Order of Business I propose to deal with a Notice of Motion under Standing Order 30 from Deputy Sargent. I now call on Deputy Sargent to state the matter of which he has given notice to me.</P>

      <P>In the light of the decision by the board of the Irish Press plc to liquidate the company with the loss of 600 jobs.  I seek leave to move Standing Order 30 so that this House can properly direct the Government to actively intervene in the crisis and to enable this House to analyse the expressions of empathy with the Irish <Col N="2" /> Press group, its journalistic tradition and its staff in general so that this empathy might become a constructive proposal to create an Irish Press trust with support from the credit union and trade union movements and the workers within the group in a three way co-operative venture.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="7" />&ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Investment Intermediaries Bill is the latest in a long series of Acts required by the rapidly-changing nature of the financial services industry.  Since 1989 the Oireachtas has enacted legislation in regard to the insurance industry, building societies, certain types of investment companies, the banking system and the Central Bank, as well as financial futures exchanges, Trustee Savings Bank, the ICC and ACC Banks, financial transactions of semi-State bodies, the National Treasury Management Agency and IFSC companies.  The most recent in the series, the Stock Exchange Bill, was recently passed by both Houses.</P>
    <P>This stream of legislation reflects the pace of change in financial markets and the financial services industry.  These markets are becoming increasingly sophisticated and complex.  In the past decade, the whole financial services sector has been subject to revolutionary change.  Deregulation, the removal of exchange controls and rapid technological advances have been to the forefront in this revolution.  Technology in particular has had a dramatic impact on the sector and it has facilitated the development of new and complex financial products.  Understanding of some of these products requires a good honour in leaving certificate mathematics.  In the European Union a new single market for financial services is being establised. The financial sector now operates on a global basis using instant communications.  Financial supervision standards are being intensified.</P>
    <P>This Bill reflects the need to provide regulatory structures to keep pace with these developments, as well as with developments in European law.  It has much in common with the Stock Exchange Bill, 1994 and Deputies will already be familiar with many of its provisions. Both Bills provide for the implementation of the requirements of two closely-related EU directives, the <Col N="8" /> Investment Services Directive and the Capital Adequacy Directive.  These directives require particular standards of regulation for investment firms, which are defined as firms providing a range of services in relation to transferable securities.  Transferable securities include stocks and shares, bonds and certificates of deposit, as well as a range of more esoteric financial instruments.</P>
    <P>The Stock Exchange Bill provided for the regulation of stock exchange member firms to these standards.  However, the vast bulk of investment firms are not stockbrokers and the present Bill provides for the regulation of investment firms covered by the Investment Services Directive which are not members of the stock exchange.</P>
    <P>Implementing the Investment Services Directive is most important.  The directive, as implemented by the Bill before the House, will allow investment firms based in Ireland to have the benefits of a single passport to operate in the European Union.  In other words, once they have satisfied the Irish authorities that they are fit to do investment business, these firms will be able to operate in other EU member states without having to seek a separate authorisation. Therefore it is crucial that we put in place the mechanisms for authorising investment firms in accordance with the directive.  The directive incorporates parallel measures to those contained in the first and second banking directives, namely conditions for granting authorisation to investment firms, vetting of main shareholders and provision for close collaboration among the supervisory authorities in the member states.  Of course, firms trading in a member state other than their home member state will have to abide by local code of conduct rules.</P>
    <P>Ireland is developing a growing reputation as a financial services centre, where modern infrastructure and skilled personnel combine to provide a high quality service and an innovative approach to business.  Reputations are hard won and easily damaged, and it is <Col N="9" /> essential that we put in place a regulatory system which meets European standards.  Moreover, we must go further than merely meeting the requirements of the relevant EU directives, since there are gaps which must be filled in our domestic system of regulation in areas which are not within the scope of the directives.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, the Government has also decided to take the opportunity to provide a regulatory framework for a wide range of investment business including, but not confined to, firms within the scope of the directive.  The Bill therefore provides for a regulatory framework not just for firms covered by the directive, but also for investment intermediaries which act primarily as conduits for investment business to larger financial institutions but do not generally have any discretion in the management of clients' funds.</P>
    <P>The Bill will also deal with the position of accountants and solicitors who may be involved in investment business. Those professional will be covered by the Bill in the same way as any other firm, unless any investment business they do is purely incidental to the practice of their profession.  Where solicitors or accountants carry on investment business in an incidental manner only, they will be subject to regulation by their professional bodies.  In the case of solicitors, the Law Society will perform this function under existing legislation: the recent Solicitors Act, 1994, already provides a regulatory framework for the Law Society's role in this regard.  In the case of accountants, the accountancy bodies will have to apply to the Central Bank for approval to regulate their members' incidental investment business and will be subject to the bank's oversight in this regard.</P>
    <P>Deposit agents and deposit brokers who act on behalf of credit institutions will also be dealt with by the Bill.  In addition, firms which have discretion over client investments and which therefore act as managers of a client's investment portfolio will also be regulated under the Bill, as will firms involved in <Col N="10" /> giving investment advice.  This wide coverage means that the Bill is necessarily somewhat complex, but I think I can assure Deputies that in enacting it they will be doing a real service to the public, to investors and to the financial services industry in Ireland.</P>
    <P>A large number of industry representatives have been consulted in the course of preparation of this Bill, as well as the National Treasury Management Agency, An Post, and the Director of Consumer Affairs, while the Department of Enterprise and Employment, the Central Bank of Ireland and the Department of Justice have collaborated closely with the Department of Finance in preparing the Bill.  The Bill has been the subject of consultation with the European Monetary Institute, which has no difficulties with it.  Copies of the institute's opinion are available.</P>
    <P>I will shortly give the House a description of the basic structure of the Bill, but I want to mention two points before I do so.  The first is that the Bill nominates two key regulators, the Minister for Enterprise and Employment and the Central Bank.  The Minister for Enterprise and Employment is already the regulator for the insurance industry and many of the firms dealt with in the Bill will already be doing business as insurance intermediaries under the Insurance Act, 1989.  The Central Bank is the other key regulator: it already regulates all Irish credit institutions as well as the two exchanges concerned with the selling of futures and options, the Irish Futures and Options Exchange and the Financial futures division of the New York Cotton Exchange, FINEX, which now operates in the IFSC.  The bank also plays an important role in the regulation of financial services conducted from the highly successful International Financial Services Centre, and is the regulator for unit trusts and undertakings for collective investments in transferable securities &mdash; UCITS.  The present Bill, therefore, builds on a very significant body of national law and expertise relating to the regulation of financial institutions and exchanges.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="11" /> The second is that the Bill also provides for the Minister for Finance to give guidelines to the supervisory authorities, as is the case in the Stock Exchange Bill.  This is important to ensure that in giving guidelines regarding the regulation of one group of investment firms &mdash; members of stock exchanges &mdash; the Minister can also provide similar guidelines, where appropriate, for other investment firms.  Such guidelines will only be issued where there is a perceived need to issue them in the public interest, but I am not sure the House will agree that it is proper that the Minister should have a role in this area.  Any such guidelines will, of course, be published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil.</i> There are also other sections of the Act which provide a role for the Minister for Finance and I will refer to these when I am discussing the details of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I now turn to a description of the basic structure of the Bill.  Two main categories of firm are to be regulated by the Bill; these categories are not mutually exclusive &mdash; there will be some overlap.  The two categories are investment product intermediaries and other investment business firms.</P>
    <P>Investment product intermediaries are firms which, for example, take and transmit orders for unit trusts to a unit trust provider, or orders for shares to a stockbroker or bank, or orders for prize bonds to the Prize Bond Company, or which act as deposit brokers, arranging for a client to make a deposit with a bank, for example or as deposit agent &mdash; the key example here is the building society agent, prominent in many smaller towns, who acts almost as a <i>de facto</i> branch of a building society. Almost always, these firms will be involved in some other business, particularly in insurance broking, for which they are regulated under the Insurance Act, 1989.  Some solicitors and accountants will also fall into the category of investment product intermediaries.</P>
    <P>All investment product intermediaries will be covered by what I will refer to as the &ldquo;written appointments <Col N="12" /> regime&rdquo;.  In other words, each will require a written appointment from any institution to whom it passes orders. The written appointment means that where an intermediary takes funds on behalf of an institution, the institution will be responsible for honouring the payment, even if the intermediary absconds with the funds.  This is an important protection for clients.  Of course, the client must be in a position to show that a payment was made, and for that reason it will be an offence for an intermediary to fail to give a receipt for payment.  This system is closely modelled on Part IV of the Insurance Act, 1989, which deals with insurance intermediaries.</P>
    <P>Before an institution gives a written appointment to an intermediary, it must take steps to ensure that that intermediary is an appropriate person for such an appointment.  The institution must therefore ensure that the intermediary is a member of an appropriate representative body with rules which require compliance with this Bill, or is regulated by an approved professional body, or that the person has an authorisation from and is regulated for investment business by one of the two supervisory authorities under the Bill &mdash; the Central Bank or the Department of Enterprise and Employment.</P>
    <P>If the intermediary is not in any of these categories, then the institution giving it a written appointment must ensure that the intermediary is of good character and complies with the Bill.</P>
    <P>The basic rule is that all firms covered by the Bill must have an authorisation from the Central Bank or the Department of Enterprise and Employment to do investment business.  However, where a firm does not provide any investment services other than the services of an investment product intermediary, and where it does not handle client funds other than when acting as a deposit agent or exercise any discretionary powers over clients' portfolios of investments, it is called a restricted activity investment product intermediary. Because, of the restricted nature of <Col N="13" /> its business, it will be allowed to operate without an authorisation from a supervisory authority, provided it has a written appointment.  It will of course be subject to rules and codes of practice. The Department of Enterprise and Employment will, of course, have various powers to make rules and conduct inspections in relation to restricted activity investment product intermediaries.</P>
    <P>I should add that there is a small category of firms, not far removed from the restricted intermediary type, which has a small amount of discretion in respect of switching clients' portfolios from one investment product to another product with the same institution.  While they would not handle clients' cash, these firms will nonetheless have to get an authorisation from the Department of Enterprise and Employment to carry on their business, and will be subject to ongoing regulation by that Department.</P>
    <P>All other investment business firms will come within the remit of the Central Bank, either directly or indirectly. The indirect sort mainly includes accountants who are members of professional bodies and who do investment business only in an incidental way.  They may be exempted from the requirement to be authorised and regulated directly by the Central Bank, provided their professional body has been approved by the Central Bank.  In this case the professional body regulates the accountant, and the Central Bank oversees the regulatory system of the professional body. This system applies only where the investment business being done by the accountant is incidental to his or her normal professional practice as an accountant: it will not apply where an accountant is heavily involved in investment business.</P>
    <P>Otherwise, all investment business firms must be regulated directly by the Central Bank.  This means they must get an authorisation from the bank to enable them to operate, and that the bank will monitor and supervise them on an ongoing basis.  This category will include the fund management firms <Col N="14" /> operating in the Irish market and in the IFSC, for example, those providing fund management services to large corporate clients.  However, the directly-regulated category will also include small businesses or individuals who, on a professional basis, provide investment services to clients, where they have control or discretion over client funds.  The bank will have discretion to vary its requirements to suit the firm &mdash; for example, an investment adviser who never takes client cash and does not get involved in transactions for clients will obviously be more lightly regulated than a firm which has a power of attorney over a client's whole investment portfolio. However, once a firm moves into the area of handling a client's cash or has discretionary power over a client's funds, the Investment Services Directive will require a certain minimum level of supervision and the Capital Adequacy Directive will require certain minimum levels of capital.</P>
    <P>While the smaller firms may be more likely, perhaps, to fail it is of particular importance that the larger firms be properly regulated, as a failure in their case could have consequences for the financial system as a whole.  A good many of such firms are subsidiaries of banks or insurance companies which are already regulated, but the Investment Services Directive requires separate regulation for these firms.</P>
    <P>I have set out the categories of firms which are included in the Bill; I want now to mention certain types of firm which are exempt from the definition of investment business firm and, therefore, from most aspects of the Bill, though not necessarily from the requirements to hold a written appointment if acting as an investment product intermediary. These exemptions are mostly for technical reasons.  The entities excluded include the bodies charged with the management of the public debt, that is, the Minister for Finance and the National Treasury Management Agency, and An Post, but only when it is acting on behalf of the State.  Banks, <Col N="15" /> insurance undertakings and certain collective investments, and member firms of stock exchanges, are also excluded from the definition of investment business firm: these are already regulated under existing legislation or, in the case of stock exchange member firms, under the Stock Exchange Bill just passed into law.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned the position of solicitors <i>vis-à-vis</i> the Bill, and that they are covered by the Bill in the same way as any other investment firm if they do investment business in a manner other than incidental to their legal activities. However, solicitors are excluded from the definition of investment business firm in respect of investment activities arising on an incidental basis in the course of their profession, because the Oireachtas has recently reviewed the regulatory regime for solicitors &mdash; they are subject to Law Society regulation under various Solicitors Acts, particularly the Solicitors (Amendment) Act, 1994.  The Department of Finance and the Department of Justice, together with the Central Bank and the Department of Enterprise and Employment, have engaged in detailed discussions with the Law Society and I am satisfied from those discussions that the Law Society is operating a substantial regulatory system, governed by legislation and backed up by a compensation scheme and appropriate professional indemnity protection.  In these circumstances it was not considered necessary to include solicitors doing only incidental business in the definition of investment business firm.</P>
    <P>The Law Society can be expected to continue to maintain an appropriate standard of protection of solicitors' clients, but if the Minister for Finance were to come to the view that the Law Society was not performing its functions adequately, the Bill provides that the Minister may, by regulation, bring solicitors doing incidental business within the definition of investment business firm.</P>
    <P>The Bill will extend the definition of <Col N="16" /> investment company within the meaning of the Companies Act, 1990, to include closed-ended investment companies. These are a type of collective investment fund.  The effect of the change will be to bring such companies within the regulatory scope of the Central Bank, which already regulates other collective investments.</P>
    <P>The Bill is divided into nine Parts. The first Part contains commencement provisions and definitions and designates supervisory responsibilities.  Part II deals with the authorisation of investment business firms.  Regulation and supervision of investment business firms are dealt with in Part III.  The written appointments regime for investment product intermediaries, described earlier, is dealt with in Part IV.  Parts V and VI concern the responsibilities of auditors, probity, codes of conduct and bonding, as well as the acquisition and disposal of significant shareholdings in authorised investment business firms. Part VII provides for a self-regulatory structure for firms of accountants and solicitors although, as mentioned above, this will not apply to solicitors unless the Minister for Finance makes regulations to bring them within the definition of investment business firm.  Part VIII deals with enforcement, including the appointment of inspectors and other miscellaneous provisions.  Part IX deals with amendments to the Companies Act, 1990, to cover closed-ended investment companies.</P>
    <P>Part I contains standard general provisions about commencement, definitions and expenses.  Section 2 sets out the definitions used in the Bill and is important because in so doing it effectively defines the scope of the Bill. Investment business firm is defined as a person providing investment advice or certain investment business services to third parties on a professional basis. Investment business services include a number of services provided in relation to investment instruments.  The term &ldquo;investment instruments&rdquo; is defined to <Col N="17" /> cover the range of securities and derivative instruments trade on domestic and international financial markets.</P>
    <P>Section 4 defines the areas of responsibility of the Central Bank and the Department of Enterprise and Employment.  It also allows for arrangements to be made between them for the supervision of particular firms or classes of firms, to ensure that there is no duplication of functions.  The Investment Services Directive lays down certain cases in which the definitions contained within that directive can be changed by a Council decision.  Section 5 gives the Minister for Finance power to extend definitions contained within this Bill, where necessary, pursuant to such a Council decision.</P>
    <P>Part II deals with authorisation of investment business firms and related matters.  It will be an offence, under section 9, for a firm to act as an investment business firm or to hold itself out to be one, unless authorised to do so by a supervisory authority in Ireland or by a competent authority in another member state or unless its activities are such that the Bill allows them to be carried on without such an authorisation.  I have already described these cases.</P>
    <P>Section 10 sets out the conditions which must be met by firms seeking an authorisation.  An authorisation under this Act can be subject to conditions laid down by the supervisory authority and the supervisory authorities have various powers under sections 10 and 14, for example, to issue conditions or requirements or make directions in respect of investment business firms.  There is also provision for appeal to the High Court against such imposition.</P>
    <P>The Investment Services Directive, as already mentioned, provides that an investment firm authorised in the State wishing to establish a branch in another EU member state or to provide investment services within the EU on a cross-Border basis, will be able to do so provided that certain procedures are adhered to.  Section 12 makes provision for these procedures.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="18" /> Section 13 makes interim arrangements for firms already operating as investment business firms which will give them a reasonable amount of time to apply for authorisation.</P>
    <P>Section 16 allows a supervisory authority to revoke the authorisation of an investment business firm in limited, technical circumstances.  More importantly, a supervisory authority may apply to the High Court for an order revoking the authorisation of a firm if the firm has acted in a manner which it is felt should disqualify it from doing investment business.  For example, the court may revoke an authorisation where the firm has been convicted on indictment of an offence under the Act or of an offence which involves fraud, dishonesty or breach of trust.  Similarly, an authorisation can be revoked if circumstances have changed since the authorisation such that the supervisory authority would not now authorise the firm or if the firm appears to be insolvent.</P>
    <P>It will, of course, be important for members of the public to be able to check the authorisation status of investment business firms offering services to them and section 17 obliges the supervisory authorities to maintain registers of authorised investment business firms and to provide for public access to them.</P>
    <P>Section 18 enables a supervisory authority to require an investment business firm to maintain a proportion of its assets in liquid form and to maintain an asset: liability ration as specified by the supervisory authority.  This is important in ensuring that the requirements of the Capital Adequacy Directive are met.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill deals with various aspects of the regulation and supervision of investment business firms. Section 20 sets out the general principles for such regulations.  It provides that supervisory authorities will administer the system of regulation and supervision of investment business firms in the interests of investor protection and of the proper and orderly regulation and supervision of investment business firms and that of financial markets, subject to <Col N="19" /> any guidelines which may be issued by the Minister.  The section also provides for co-operation both between the domestic supervisory authorities and between them and the competent authorities in other member states.</P>
    <P>Section 21 equips the supervisory authorities with a general authority to issue directions to investment business firms, their directors and management in the interests of proper and orderly regulation of investment business firms or the protection of investors.</P>
    <P>In addition, where the supervisory authority believes that an investment business firm is insolvent or is not maintaining adequate capital or where the supervisory authority is concerned about the stability or soundness of the investment business firm or where the firm is conducting business in a manner that jeopardises client funds, then the supervisory authority may direct that the investment business firm suspend trading for up to one year.  There is, of course, provision for appeal to the High Court.  The First Schedule to the Bill contains supplementary provisions in relation to directions under this section.</P>
    <P>Section 22 enables a supervisory authority to apply to the court for an order to wind up an investment business firm, or a decree of dissolution in the case of a partnership or an order of bankruptcy in the case of a sole trader, if it believes, for example, the entity is &mdash; or is likely to become &mdash; unable to meet its obligations to its clients or creditors.</P>
    <P>Section 23 and 24 make various provisions for restrictions on advertising.  It will be an offence to advertise investment business services where the provision of such services would be an offence.  An agreement entered into after the issue of such an advertisement, or of an advertisement which contravenes a direction given by a supervisory authority, will not be enforceable unless the High Court finds that the advertisement did not have a bearing on the agreement.</P>
    <P>Part IV deals with the written appointment regime applicable to <Col N="20" /> investment product intermediaries.  As I mentioned earlier, this type of firm is engaged either in part or solely in a more limited form of investment consisting mainly of passing customers' orders to larger financial institutions &mdash; the definition is set out in section 25.</P>
    <P>Where an intermediary provides only the services of an investment product intermediary and where it does not have any discretionary power over its clients' investments and does not hold clients' funds &mdash; except where taking deposits as a deposit agent &mdash; it is termed a restricted activity investment product intermediary, defined in section 26 and it may do business without a specific authorisation from a supervisory authority. Under section 29 such a firm must disclose to its clients that it may not take their cash or manage their funds on a discretionary basis.</P>
    <P>I have already described the safeguards which protect the clients of firms operating under the written appointment regime and these are detailed in Part IV.  I direct Deputies in particular to section 28 (4) which provides that where an intermediary takes a payment on behalf of a product producer, the payment is treated as if it had been made directly to the product producer. This ensures that the client is protected from the moment the intermediary takes a cheque or other payment.  Of course, in the event of a dispute, it will be important that a client has evidence of a transaction and it will, therefore, be an offence under section 30 for an intermediary to fail to give a receipt to a client.</P>
    <P>Part V makes various provisions in relation to auditors of investment business firms, in line with the corresponding provisions in the Stock Exchange Bill.  Among other things, this Part obliges the auditor of an authorised investment business firm to report to the supervisory authority if he or she has reason to believe that there are circumstances which affect the investment business firm's ability to meet its financial obligations or that there are defects in its accounting systems or records or <Col N="21" /> in its safeguards for client money or investment instruments.  The auditor must also report to the supervisory authority if he or she has reason to believe that the investment business firm has breached the rules of any approved professional body of which it is a member.</P>
    <P>It will be an offence for an officer or employee of an authorised investment business firm or of an associated or related undertaking to supply false, misleading or deceptive information to an auditor who requires it under this Bill. There is also provision for a second audit if, on the basis of an initial audit, the supervisory authority has a substantial concern about the accounts of an authorised investment business firm.</P>
    <P>Part VI deals with probity and competence of persons involved in investment business firms, codes of conduct and provisions for regulating acquisition of significant shareholdings in investment firms, as well as with bonding for investment business firms and the protection of client's money.</P>
    <P>Section 36 contains provisions relating to disqualification from employment. Where, on application by a supervisory authority, the High Court finds that a person is not suitable on grounds of probity to be an officer or employee of an investment business firm it may direct the employer to dismiss that person. Where the court finds that a person is incompetent it may direct that the person concerned be removed from a particular position, suspended or dismissed. These substantial powers mirror provisions in the Stock Exchange Bill and are important to ensure that persons who are entrusted with the safekeeping and prudent management of the funds of others are above reproach. Deputies will observe that a direction in respect of any such person will be for the courts to decide, and there are, of course, provisions for a person concerned to apply to the courts at any time for the direction to be revoked.</P>
    <P>Section 37 sets out the broad parameters for codes of conduct which will govern how investment business firms <Col N="22" /> do business with their clients.  Codes of conduct will be drawn up by the supervisory authorities, which may require investment business firms to follow them.  Where members of an approved professional body are concerned, the Central Bank may decide instead that the body's codes or rules of conduct are adequate.  Codes of conduct will cover such issues as ensuring that firms deal honestly and fairly with clients, act with due skill and care, have adequate resources, seek enough information from clients to ensure they provide appropriate advice or services and they make adequate disclosure of relevant information to clients.</P>
    <P>Sections 38 to 48 deal with acquiring transactions, that is major changes in the ownership or control of investment business firms.  The purpose of these provisions is to enable a supervisory authority to prevent undue or excessive influence being gained over an investment business firms, unless that supervisory authority is satisfied that influence will not be harmful.  These provisions meet the requirements of the Investment Services Directive in this regard.</P>
    <P>Sections 50 and 51 deal with information about compensation and with bonding.  While the Bill contains significant compensation provisions, it does not provide for a comprehensive compensation scheme across all investment business firms.  A draft EU investor compensation directive is still under discussion at EU level and when this has been finalised the Department of Finance will put in hand preparation of the necessary legislation.</P>
    <P>I have already explained the protection available for clients under the written appointments regime.  In addition, section 50 provides that an investment business firm must inform a client of the details of any investor compensation scheme.  Section 51 provides for a bonding arrangement for investment business firms on the model of the bonding arrangements which apply for insurance intermediaries.  However, the minimum bond will be higher than that which <Col N="23" /> applies at present in the insurance area &mdash; £50,000 rather than £25,000.</P>
    <P>The Minister may prescribe exemptions from the bonding requirement where an appropriate compensation scheme exists or is set up or where a firm has a high level of capitalisation. However, the Minister does not intend to exempt the normal run of investment intermediaries from the bonding requirement unless it is clear that appropriate schemes providing a high level of protection for clients are in place.</P>
    <P>Section 52 deals with a very important matter, the protection of client money and investment instruments.  It empowers the supervisory authorities to impose requirements on investment business firms in respect of their rights, duties and responsibilities regarding the treatment of clients' money and instruments. Any breach of these requirements will be a matter for the High Court or for a committee appointed under section 74.  In addition, section 52 makes it an offence to fail to keep proper books and records of client money or to fail to have them audited regularly, to hold client money with an institution other than one, specified by a supervisory authority and to fail to designate client money accounts as &ldquo;section 52&rdquo; accounts in the firm's records so as to enable client money to be easily traced.  It will be, of course, an offence for a firm to misappropriate client funds.  An important protection for clients is that in the event of insolvency of a firm, no liquidator or receiver or examiner or creditor of an investment firm will have any right of access to client's money or investment instruments, until the proper claims of clients have been satisfied in full.</P>
    <P>Section 53 provides for an exemption from liability for the supervisory authorities, unless they act in bad faith, and for a disclaimer of warranty in respect of their approval of professional bodies or authorisation of investment business firms.  Under section 54, where an investment business firm is unable to <Col N="24" /> pay its debts and its failure to keep proper books and records, or to comply with client money obligations, has contributed to its insolvency, an officer of the firm may be held personally liable for the firm's debts, on a direction of the court.  In addition, a director who fails to take reasonable steps to ensure his firm's compliance with obligations regarding client money, or books and records, will be guilty of a criminal offence.  However, such a director may not be jailed unless the court believes he or she acted wilfully.</P>
    <P>Accountants and solicitors doing investment business will be covered by the Bill in the same way as other investment business firms, unless any investment business they do is incidental to their professional practice.  Part VII, which deals with approved professional bodies, is relevant to this incidental business.  It provides that the supervisory authority may grant approval subject to conditions or otherwise, to a professional body of accountants or solicitors or of a similar profession to operate as an approved professional body.  Such a body may then regulate its members in respect of investment business which is incidental to their professional activities and its members may then do incidental investment business without a specific authorisation from a supervisory authority.  Solicitors doing incidental investment business will not be affected by this provision; as I have already explained, such solicitors will not be treated as investment business firms for the purposes of the Bill unless the Minister for Finance prescribes otherwise.</P>
    <P>Under section 56 professional bodies must apply to the Central Bank for approval to operate as an approved professional body and the section sets out the conditions they must meet to get such approval.  Section 58 gives the bank powers to impose conditions and requirements on approved professional bodies in the interests of their orderly regulation.  Section 57 makes provision for interim approval to be given to allow existing bodies to operate for a period <Col N="25" /> as approved bodies until such time as they get approval.  Provision is also made in section 61 for the revocation of approval: except in certain purely technical circumstances, such revocation will be a matter for the High Court.  An approved professional body will, of course, be obliged to keep proper books and records, and section 62 makes it an offence to fail to do so.  Part VIII deals with inspections, offences and penalties and is closely based on the Stock Exchange Bill.</P>
    <P>Sections 64 and 65 deal with the powers of authorised officers appointed by supervisory authorities to inspect investment business firms.  These officers will be empowered, for example, to enter premises to inspect documents and to require explanations of documents.  If a person refuses to comply with a request from an authorised officer, the court can be asked to make an order as to the information to be provided.  This section also provides that a supervisory authority may require an investment business firm to supply specified information to it.</P>
    <P>Sections 66 to 72 provide for the High Court, on the application of a supervisory authority, to appoint an inspector to investigate the affairs of an investment business firm.  An inspector appointed by the court will have wide-ranging powers of investigation including, for example, powers to examine people on oath.  The High Court may publish, with or without omissions, the report of an inspector appointed by it.  A court inspector's report will be sent in full to the Ministers for Finance, and Enterprise and Employment, who may decide to lay it before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  On receipt of an inspector's report, the court may make an order for winding up of the firm concerned or remedying damage done to any person by its conduct of its affairs.</P>
    <P>Section 73 provides for the appointment of an inspector by a supervisory authority to investigate particular matters relating to an investment business firm, including their compliance with any requirements of this or any other <Col N="26" /> Act.  The bank may publish, in whole or in part, the report of an inspector appointed by it, and must forward any such report in full to the Ministers for Finance and Enterprise and Employment, who again may decide to lay it before the Oireachtas.  The supervisory authority may, on foot of a report, present a petition for a firm to be wound up.</P>
    <P>Section 74 enables a supervisory authority to set up a committee to determine whether there has been a breach by an investment business firm or professional body of conditions or requirements imposed by the supervisory authority. Such a committee will have three members, drawn from a panel of seven to be nominated by the Minister for Finance with the consent of the Minister for Enterprise and Employment.  If it finds there has been a breach, the committee may issue a reprimand or require payment of up to £500,000 by the firm or professional body concerned to the supervisory authority.  It should be noted that this mechanism will only apply where the firm agrees, and a firm may appeal the determination of a committee to the High Court.  Where an investment business firm or professional body does not want the matter settled by a committee, the supervisory authority may apply to the court to make a determination, and the court may issue a reprimand or require payment of up to £500,000 to the supervisory authority. Detailed provisions relating to committees appointed under section 74 are contained in the Second Schedule of the Bill.  Such committees offer a mechanism whereby breaches of conditions and requirements imposed by a supervisory authority can be speedily determined without the expense &mdash; on either side &mdash; of a High Court hearing.</P>
    <P>Sections 75 and 76 provided for an application for a search and seizure warrant by an authorised officer and for the admissibility of an inspector's report as evidence in civil proceedings, while sections 77 and 78 provide for legal professional privilege and for confidentiality of documents.  Section 79 sets out <Col N="27" /> the penalties for offences committed under the Act.  The maximum penalty will be £1,000,000 or ten years' imprisonment or both.</P>
    <P>Part IX of the Bill consists of section 80 only and deals with the amendment of the Companies Act, 1990, which I have described earlier.  Briefly, section 80 extends the definition of investment company in that Act to bring closed-ended investment companies within its scope.  The effect will be to make the Central Bank the regulator of closed-ended companies.</P>
    <P>To sum up, much of the Bill follows the model of the Stock Exchange Bill and this is entirely appropriate, since the two Bills share the common aim of ensuring that the relevant firms are properly authorised and regulated to the standards of the Investment Services Directive.  In so far as it deals with investment product intermediaries, the Bill follows the general model of Part IV of the Insurance Act, 1989.  Again this is appropriate since many, if not most, of these firms are probably already acting as life assurance brokers.</P>
    <P>This Bill breaks new ground in the sense that for the first time it will ensure that when members of the public and large corporations invest in financial products they can be confident that the activities of the financial intermediaries they are dealing with are subject to regulation under the laws of this State. In ensuring this, Deputies can be happy that they are greatly improving the position of the public in the investment market, and that they are strengthening the foundations for the development of the financial services industry in Ireland.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House and I look forward to hearing the contributions of Deputies.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Bill.  It has been long promised and has been in gestation for a considerable period.  I compliment the officials in the various Departments who have contributed to it.  The drafting of a technical Bill such as this takes an inordinate amount of <Col N="28" /> time and many people have put much time and effort into it.</P>
      <P>I realise that the order of the House is that we complete Second Stage and all remaining Stages today but this is a Bill which it would be appropriate to send to the select committee.  When we dispose of Second Stage perhaps the House would agree that Committee Stage be taken in select committee.  This is a technical Bill containing 80 sections and a number of schedules.  I await views from some professional bodies and other outside experts before I will be in a position to give any great <i>gravitas</i> to the comments I wish to make.  I suggest that Committee Stage be taken in select committee if that is agreeable to the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very difficult to legislate for goodness in any particular area.  The compliant bodies and the professional firms will have no problem with the Bill.  It is only the fly-by-night operators who set up overnight, with the intention of misappropriating clients' funds, who will get into difficulty.  It is very difficult to draft legislation which <Col N="29" /> will protect the public and the investor from all those types of shenanigans.</P>
      <P>The Irish investor has shown considerable sophistication in recent years. One will see from the financial papers the level of investment products available and the new ideas and new types of investment coming on stream all the time.  I am not talking about the big players on the financial market or the people who make it their business to watch the stocks and shares every day. The ordinary investor who gets a few pounds together and who may have some money saved or obtains it as a result of a redundancy has shown considerable expertise in ensuring the best return.</P>
      <P>The Bill is welcome in that it gives the State more direct control over the operations of investment intermediaries.  No supervisory body at whatever level will be able to supervise every investment body because an investigator would be needed there every day.  I welcome the fact that the Bill gives some of the professional bodies the job of regulating the activities of their own profession, such as accountants.  I welcome the hands-off approach at that level.  It is about the best one can do.</P>
      <P>So far as my own profession is concerned we had the displeasure of a misappropriation of funds case some years ago.  The number of firms who will have responsibility for handling clients' funds will be very small.  When that case arose all my friends in the accountancy bodies asked whether I ever had a chance of dealing with funds on that basis or whether any client ever gave me complete authority to do what I wished with their money and I said &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  There have been one or two cases since then which surprised me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill imposes a considerable onus on auditors whose function is to police the accounts of solicitors, for example, to find out what is going on.  The reality is &mdash; I intend to raise this matter on Committee Stage &mdash; that if a rogue operator wants to mislead his auditor and hide from him clients' funds no <Col N="30" /> auditor in the world will be able to discover them.</P>
    <P>The Department of Finance has consulted with a wide range of interested bodies on this Bill which was a long time in gestation. It will take us some considerable distance in regulating an activity which is growing by the day. There are now a number of financial brokers in every town.  I often wonder about their level of expertise, but they seem to be able to attract large sums from gullible people on occasion as evidenced by newspaper reports when a disaster occurs.  I welcome the Bill and hope we will be able to tease out some of these matters on Committee Stage as it is quite complicated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill which is overdue.  It is a long time since the warning lights began flashing on these matters, whether it was investment firms similar to the ones which collapsed in my constituency leaving many people, including constituents of mine, completely bereft of their life savings without any remedy, or members of the clergy who in some parts of the country acted as intermediaries and set up their own funds, sometimes with disastrous consequences, the reality is that we must have a proper regulatory framework.</P>
      <P>In recent years I was alarmed to note that small advertisements appeared in the classified columns at the back of <i>The Economist</i> asking for international investments in Ireland by firms I had never heard of and which cut no dash on the Irish financial scene.  I notice that a few newspapers followed up some of these investment intermediary companies operating from Ireland.  I was worried that these firms were effectively soliciting funds in an unregulated market.  I was worried about the consequences for potential investors if this country did not get its act together.  It is sad that we have to rely on European directives to spur us into this type of legislative reaction but nonetheless the Bill is welcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="31" /> I agree with Deputy McCreevy that one cannot legislate for goodness and there will always be rogue operators.  It is essential that the Government does not make itself the guarantor of investment intermediaries in the long run. That is an important point.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCreevy spoke about his own profession having had a few disasters. The legal profession has also had its fair share of disasters but it has a system for compensating solicitors' clients.  Happily, the Bar has never handled a halfpenny of clients' money and this is probably the only thing that has saved us from even more squalid disasters than those the other professions have come across from time to time.</P>
    <P>I have a simple and straightforward view: this Bill is long overdue and I am anxious that it goes through as quickly as possible but, like Deputy McCreevy, I am convinced that it is hardly perfect and might benefit from some amendment. With the greatest of respect to those who drafted it, if they had got it 100 per cent right &mdash; I note they have two amendments of their own &mdash; I would be the first to compliment them but, like Deputy McCreevy, I would like some time to obtain the views of concerned people and to consider each of the sections before saying that it is 100 per cent all right.  I have no doubt it is 99.5 per cent correct.  It might be useful for this House to refer it to a select committee and devote one day to it to go through each section carefully; to give the Opposition parties the opportunity, in a less formal setting, to tease out some of the implications and to see if anything useful could be said.  I assume Deputy McCreevy would agree that if this is done we would be the first to say Report Stage would be disposed of quickly and we would not lose much time in going through the legislation in those circumstances.  If the Whips can agree I would be fully in favour of such a step.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputies for their contributions.  I am pleased there is broad support for the Bill in the House.  I am sure Deputies will agree that, apart from its European context, it is a worth while Bill which will be important both for the integrity of the Irish financial system and for the reputation of Ireland as a centre for financial services.</P>
      <P>There is nothing radically new in the approach in the Bill which is based in large part on the Stock Exchange Bill, 1994 and on insurance legislation. However it breaks some important new ground.  It aims to ensure that for the first time potential investors can be assured that any investment intermediaries they approach will be subject to a level of outside regulation appropriate to the type of business being done.  The intention is to ensure that life is made much more difficult for any person who is inclined to act unlawfully in the investment market but the old rule of let the buyer beware will still apply in this as in every other area.  No legislation can protect people from all the ups and downs in the financial markets. This point was made by both Deputies sitting opposite.  However this legislation will provide the consumers of investment products with a new set of rights while imposing an appropriate set of rules, duties and responsibilities on investment firms and intermediaries selling those products.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy McCreevy referred to the large number of investment intermediaries who are to be regulated.  This Bill will regulate a wide range of firms from the smallest investment intermediary to the fund management arms of large financial institutions.  Since there has not been a similar regulatory system in the <Col N="33" /> past it is difficult to estimate the exact numbers involved.  These will only become clear when the regulatory system is in place and the registers of investment business firms required under section 17 are put in place.  It is clear however that in some categories, in particular the investment product intermediary and certified person categories, the numbers are likely to be substantial. As an example, there are over 500 building society agents who would be deposit agents for the purposes of the Bill.  Most of these will fall within the restricted activity investment intermediary category.  There are also about 2,700 insurance brokers and insurance agents apart from tied insurance agents. A significant proportion of these insurance intermediaries might also act as investment intermediaries but the vast majority would again fall within the restricted activity investment intermediary category.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that of the order of 1,000 accountancy firms might wish to avail of the opportunity to do incidental investments business under the aegis of their professional body.  In addition to these there would be a small number of more substantial investment business firms, most of whom would fall to be regulated by the Central Bank &mdash; the number is not clear but it is probably fewer than 150, of whom many are already regulated as IFSC firms, but who are now required to be regulated to investment services directive standards.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="34" /> That the Bill now be read a Second time.</P>
    <P>This Bill, which comprises 102 sections and six Schedules, is the first major revision of commercial harbours legislation since 1946.  The purpose of the legislation is to restructure the management framework of port authorities by establishing State commercial companies to manage the 12 bigger ports. Before outlining in detail the main provisions of the new legislation I would like to talk briefly about the existing legislation, the Harbours Act, 1946.</P>
    <P>The 1946 Act had its genesis in 1926 when, by a resolution of both Houses of the Oireachtas, the Ports and Harbours Tribunal was established to inquire into the position of the several ports and harbours in the State.  The tribunal reported in 1930.  Its two main recommendations were that the provisions of the various general Acts relating to harbours should be replaced by a general consolidating Act and, second, that the Department of Industry and Commerce be given the general oversight of harbour administration and placed as regards harbours in much the same position as the Department of Local Government and Public Health occupied in relation to local authorities.  The Bill to implement the tribunal's recommendations was ready for introduction in 1940.</P>
    <P>However, owing to the abnormal circumstances affecting our ports and harbours which then existed, its introduction was postponed.  The Second Stage of the Harbours Bill, 1945, was taken in Dáil Éireann on Wednesday, 28 November 1945.  The Bill was introduced by the then Minister for Industry and Commerce, Mr. Seán Lemass, and contributors to the debate included such well-known figures as General Mulcahy, John A. Costello and Maurice Dockrell. That legislation came into effect in 1946 and still remains the main body of legislation governing commercial seaports.</P>
    <P>In the interim years techniques in shipping and cargo handling have changed dramatically.  On the one hand <Col N="35" /> there has been the growth of large bulk shipments, on the other the almost universal use of unitised systems, either lift-on/lift-off or roll-on/roll-off.  These changes have provided ports across the world with new challenges.  The international response has tended towards the greater &ldquo;commercialisation&rdquo; of ports.  Ireland's ports have been severely constrained in their ability to respond commercially because of the restricted legislation under which they operate.</P>
    <P>For this reason the then Minister for the Marine, Mr. John Wilson, established the Commercial Harbours Review Group in October 1990 whose task was to identify those aspects of existing legislation which constrained a modern port; the structure of harbour boards needed to be examined as did the extent of ministerial and departmental control on day-to-day activities of ports.  The review group included a broad representation of interests associated with ports &mdash; the Irish Port Authorities' Association, IBEC, a transport economist, a port user, a local authorities' representative, a SIPTU representative and a representative from the Department of the Marine.  The group presented its report and recommendations in July 1992.</P>
    <P>I summarise the major findings of the review group as follows: Ireland, of all countries in the EC, was probably the most heavily dependent on external trade for its future prosperity; the crucial importance of seaports to the economy was highlighted by the fact that in 1990, 80 per cent by volume and almost 55 per cent by value of the total external trade of the State passed through seaports; having regard to Ireland's remoteness from the main European and world markets, there was an urgent need to bring the overall performance of Irish seaports up to a level at least on a par with the best international standards; cargo handling and shipping techniques had changed dramatically in recent years with the advent of unitisation and large bulk shipments; the pace of change had outstripped the ability of <Col N="36" /> seaports in Ireland and elsewhere to cope effectively with the challenges arising from it; current legislation i.e., the Harbours Act, 1946, was outdated to present day requirements being unduly restrictive with ministerial controls more in keeping with procedures in local authorities; a survey of international trends indicated that seaports were being restructured and commercialised in many countries and cargo handling &mdash; stevedoring &mdash; activity was identified as a serious disability in many ports.</P>
    <P>The key recommendation of the review group was that, to facilitate commercialisation, commercial State companies should be set up to manage certain ports.  The group also recommended that the commercial mandate under which the new port companies would operate should give them flexibility to operate as truly commercial enterprises.</P>
    <P>The Bill now before the House is based on the main recommendations of the review group.  The Bill provides for: (a)  the setting up of commercial State companies to manage and operate the ports of Arklow, Cork, Drogheda, Dublin Dundalk, Foynes, Galway, New Ross, Shannon, Waterford and Wicklow &mdash; these ports are at present managed by harbour authorities in accordance with the Harbours Act, 1946; (b) the setting up of a State commercial company to manage and operate Dún Laoghaire Harbour which is at present managed and operated by the Department of the Marine; (c) the functions of the companies so established; and (d) a revision of the law relating to pilotage.</P>
    <P>I do not think it necessary at this stage to deal at any length with the details of the provisions of the Bill. However, I would like to briefly described its main provisions.  The new companies will be formed and registered under the Companies Acts and the State will be the sole shareholder in each company.  It is essential of course that thorough preparations will need to be undertaken before the companies are established.  Such preparations include <Col N="37" /> the installation of modern accounting systems; the preparation of commercial accounts, including up-to-date balance sheets; an assessment of pension assets and liabilities; a review of each harbour's trading performance and medium projections of same; a forecast of capital expenditure needs and of how these would be financed and an examination of staffing levels.</P>
    <P>Existing harbour authority boards range in number from nine members to 29 and comprise representatives of local authorities, chambers of commerce, trade union interests, IBEC, the livestock trade, shipping and ministerial nominees.</P>
    <P>The view taken by the review group was that structures of this nature &mdash; large representative authorities comprising up to 29 members &mdash; were no longer attuned to the competitive requirements of a modern port and were not the most efficient way of managing ports.  The group recommended that the board of directors of the new port companies should have seven members, including employee representation, the chairman and chief executive. It further recommended that the non-executive directors should be appointed by the Minister with a five year term of office, should be drawn from the commercial sector of the economy and that persons with a vested business interest in the affairs of a port should not be given board representation. However, following publication of the review group's report there were numerous requests for a continuation of the existing representation.  Having considered the matter the Government decided that the number of directors of each company should be not more than 12 and that three local authority directors should be appointed to each port company.</P>
    <P>The Bill, as now presented, provides that the number of directors of each company will not be more than 12.  The directors, with the exception of the chief executive, the worker and local authority directors, will be appointed and may be removed from office by the <Col N="38" /> Minister with the consent of the Minister for Finance.  Each director, except the chief executive, will be appointed for five years and will be eligible for reappointment.</P>
    <P>In relation to worker directors, the norm in public sector bodies such as Aer Lingus, Aer Rianta, An Post, etc, is that worker directors made up one-third of the board's full membership. However, the numbers employed by the harbour authorities &mdash; and to be employed by the new port companies &mdash; are small compared to other semi-State bodies such as An Post and one-third worker representation on the new port boards could be viewed as over-representation.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, the strategy developed is that the staff of companies whose employees exceed 50 in number will elect two worker directors; the staff of companies whose employees are more than 30 but not more than 50 in number will elect one worker director.  Where the staff of a company is fewer than 30 in number, the Minister will, following consultation with recognised trade unions, appoint a person as the representative of the interests of the employees of that company.</P>
    <P>There was a strong demand for continued representation of local authorities on the new port companies as such representation would maintain the close relationship between city, town and port.  It was argued that local ports play a key role in the economic life of the town or city associated with the port and that there must be close day-to-day interaction between the port and the local authority.  It was suggested that local authority representation on the port authority provided a long established and effective means of ensuring full co-operation between both bodies which the Government agreed was essential and considered that the inclusion of local authority representation was merited on those grounds. Accordingly, the Minister will appoint three persons, nominated in the prescribed manner by a prescribed local authority, to be each a director of a <Col N="39" /> company.  Regulations prescribing the manner in which such persons are to be nominated will be made by the Minister. The chief executive of each port company shall, by reason of his office, be a director of the company.  The remaining directors will be appointed by the Minister for the Marine with the consent of the Minister for Finance and will, in general, be drawn from the professional and business community.  TDs, Senators and MEPs will be disqualified from becoming directors of port companies.</P>
    <P>I will outline the powers and duties of the new port companies.  The principal objects of each company will be to: (a) take all proper measures for the management, control, operation and development of its harbour and the approach channels thereto and provide reasonable facilities, services and accommodation in the harbour for vessels, goods and passengers; (b) promote investment in its harbour; (c) engage in any business activity, either alone or in conjunction with other persons, that it considers to be advantageous to the development of its harbour and (d) utilise and manage the resources available to it in a manner consistent with the foregoing objects.</P>
    <P>In addition, each company will be empowered to: (i) take such steps either alone or in conjunction with other persons as are necessary for the efficient operation and management of its harbour; (ii) appropriate any part of its harbour to the exclusive use of any person; (iii)  engage in activities outside the State, related to functions in respect of its harbour, which will promote the interests of trade and tourism in the State; (iv) charge rates in respect of vessels using the harbour, goods shipped, transhipped, unshipped or stored within the harbour and any service provided by the company; (v) lease, acquire and dispose of property; (vi) make by-laws for the use of the harbour, safety of navigation within the harbour and generally for the regulation of the harbour.</P>
    <P>Each company will be required to <Col N="40" /> submit annually to the Minister a copy of its annual accounts and the auditor's report on the accounts.  Accounts will be audited by commercial auditors.</P>
    <P>Each port company will be empowered to borrow, with ministerial consent, up to a limit of 50 per cent of the company's fixed assets.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance may, in certain circumstances, guarantee borrowings by port companies.</P>
    <P>Persons who immediately before vesting day were employees of a harbour authority or of the Department of the Marine in the case of Dún Laoghaire Harbour will not, while in the service of the port company, be brought to less beneficial conditions of service or of remuneration to which they were subject immediately before vesting day. Each port company will be required to establish and maintain a superannuation fund.</P>
    <P>The Government, in the context of the new Harbours Bill, was conscious of the need to address long-standing pension difficulties in certain ports which arose because many harbour authorities operated a &ldquo;pay as you go&rdquo; system for pensions, instead of a specific pensions fund.  This system no longer accords with acceptable standards and I have now initiated action to tackle the issue.</P>
    <P>As I already stated, it is essential that thorough preparations will need to be undertaken before the new port companies are established.  In this context I have employed Davy Kelleher McCarthy, economic consultants, to undertake a comprehensive study of the financial status of the harbour authorities. I expect a report from DKM in September with recommendations on long-term funding needs for the harbours. I will then consider, in consultation with the Minister for Finance and the harbour authorities, how to ensure that the harbours can meet their pensions schemes requirements.  I have written to the Pensions Board advising it of the measures I am taking to ensure that harbour authority pension schemes are secure.</P>
    <P>The Bill contains a provision whereby <Col N="41" /> port companies may apply to the Minister for amalgamation and the Minister, if of the opinion that, for sound business reasons, the ports concerned should be amalgamated, may by order provide for such amalgamation provided the companies concerned are agreeable.  An amalgamation order will have to be confirmed by a resolution of both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>In respect of each port company the Minister will be empowered to: issue directions to the company relating to safety, the levels of harbour charges, the development of harbours and any other matters; stipulate, in consultation with the company, financial or other targets, including the payment of dividends in respect of shares in the company, to be achieved by the company.</P>
    <P>Each port company will be required to organise pilotage in either of two ways: (i) by employing pilots directly or (ii) by licensing self-employed pilots to undertake pilotage operations.  Each port company will be empowered to make by-laws for the operation and organisation of pilotage services, qualifications for pilots, the grant of pilotage exemption certificates and for other matters related to pilotage.</P>
    <P>The new legislation is designed to ensure that the ports will be able to operate as truly commercial and self-sufficient enterprises free from undue control by the State.  The re-organisation of the commercial seaports together with a continuation of EU aid for port development will give the ports the flexibility they need to operate as truly commercial enterprises and will greatly improve their efficiency and effectiveness to the benefit of exporters, the agricultural and industrial sectors of the economy and our tourist trade.  The main thrust of the new legislation will be to relax ministerial control while increasing accountability for operational and financial performance.</P>
    <P>In tandem with the new legislation, a port development policy is also in place and significant investment in portal development will take place between now and 1999.  The objectives of this <Col N="42" /> investment are to facilitate the expansion of industry and agriculture; to facilitate the expansion of tourism, and to facilitate regional development.</P>
    <P>In line with these objectives the need for more intensive competition; inadequate frequency of services; poor quality-outdated infrastructure leading to inefficiencies; some selective capacity deficiencies; inadequate port handling equipment; capital dredging; and repair of structural faults are being addressed.</P>
    <P>The investment programme of £135 million is designed to achieve the elimination of bottlenecks; and expansion of port throughput by end 2000 of 46 per cent in the case of unitised freight and 40 per cent for bulk freight; a 15 per cent real reduction in combined port and shipping costs and the stimulation of a reduction in shipping charges which will have a significant impact on the productive sectors of the economy.</P>
    <P>The port development programme together with the reorganisation of the commercial seaports will gear the ports to meet the challenges of the 21st century.</P>
    <P>The review group recommended that responsibility for harbours of lesser commercial significance, 13 in all, be transferred to local authorities.  The harbours involved are Annagassan, Bantry Bay, Ballyshannon, Baltimore and Skibbereen, Buncrana, Cappa Pier in Kilrush, Kinsale, River Moy in Ballina, Sligo, Tralee and Fenit, Westport, Wexford and Youghal.</P>
    <P>This proposal was discussed in detail with the majority of the harbour authorities concerned and the City and County Managers Association and did not attract general support.  The Government, having considered the matter, agreed to the proposal that rather than providing for automatic transfer the Bill should contain a framework which would allow these small harbours to continue to operate under the Harbours Act, 1946, (to be set up as commercial State companies or to be transferred to local authorities.</P>
    <P>The Bill, as now drafted, contains <Col N="43" /> these empowering provisions.  The position to be adopted in this regard will be considered on its merits on a port by port basis once the new legislation is in place.  Decisions will be taken based on the present and anticipated level of commercial traffic at the ports concerned and the present and anticipated financial position of the ports concerned. Proposals to transfer responsibility for any of the smaller harbours to the relevant local authority will be subject to the consent of the Minister for the Environment.  Likewise, any proposal to establish a State commercial company in respect of any of the harbours concerned will have to be confirmed by a resolution of both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The Bill contains an enabling provision which empowers the Minister to designate Dingle Harbour as a fishery harbour centre once the new legislation is in place.  This means that responsibility for the harbour would be transferred to the Department of the Marine which already manages and operates five fishery harbour centres.  However, the general question of the management of fishery harbours falls for review in the context of a major review, announced by my predecessor on 1 March 1995, of the organisation and management structures of the fishery services including the fishery harbour centres.  I will assess the future management plans for Dingle Harbour and other major fishery harbours in the light of the outcome of that review which it is intended to have completed later this year.</P>
    <P>In the course of preparation of the legislation a comprehensive consultation process on the purposes and content of the Bill has taken place with interested parties &mdash; mainly the harbour authorities concerned and the Social Partners &mdash; and, in so far as was possible, their views have been taken on board.  I am confident that the principles of the Bill will be generally acceptable; I accept, however, that differences of opinion may arise on its detail.  Further <Col N="44" /> submissions on the legislation and, in particular, amendments which would make it more effective, will be considered and any amendments considered justified will be brought forward on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Throughput at the commercial ports in 1980 amounted to 19.4 million tonnes; the corresponding figure for 1993 was 28.4 million tonnes &mdash; an increase of 46 per cent.  The importance of our ports to the Irish economy cannot be over-emphasised. The measures outlined here today, namely, restructuring of the management framework of port authorities through the early introduction of commercial semi-State enterprises; an emphasis on investment in strategic corridors to increase frequency of service and benefit of economies of scale; the taking of appropriate steps to ensure adequate competition within and between ports and in shipping services; and a major programme of investment, supported by community funds, in-port infrastructure and facilities are designed to ensure adequate and internationally competitive capacity.</P>
    <P>For all those reasons I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the new Minister for the Marine to the House. We on this side welcome the general principles of the Bill.  I hope I do not unnerve the Minister by telling him this is approximately the fifth attempt to bring a harbours or Shannon Estuary Bill into the House.  On each of those occasions the Dáil collapsed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>That will not happen this time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the history of the past ten or 12 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all accept there has been a major shift in the pattern of trade and commerce and it is necessary to be flexible in the management of our harbours and the way we facilitate the corridors which enable us to export so much of our trade.  As the Minister stated, up to 80 per cent of our external trade passes <Col N="45" /> through our ports.  In a very competitive world and at a time when our economy depends to a large extent on exports, the commercial freedom, flexibility and other provisions incorporated in the Bill are desirable.</P>
    <P>It is fair to contend that we were not keeping pace with the international shipping business and that the existing legislation, dating back to 1946, is incapable of exploiting our harbour resources.  There is no argument against the restructuring of the management framework of port authorities and the early introduction of commercial semi-State enterprises, the emphasis on investment in strategic corridors in order to increase the frequency of services and benefit of economies of scale or the taking of appropriate steps to ensure adequate competition within and between ports and shipping services, along with the essential major investment programme with the support of domestic and European Union funds.</P>
    <P>The process by which all this happened began a number of years ago with the establishment of the Commercial Harbours Review Group.  This Bill enshrines most of its recommendations. On that basis the Fianna Fáil Party will be supporting the Bill in principle and will not insist on a vote at the conclusion of Second Stage.</P>
    <P>Since I am not personally constrained by any involvement or work on the earlier preparation of this Bill, I want to put a few points to the Minister which are worthy of consideration.  The first is that, while he has incorporated the main thrust of the recommendations of the review group, the Bill in its entirety provides too much for the heavy hand of ministerial intervention in circumstances in which the principle is to create maximum flexibility and commercial freedom in the management and operation of our harbours.  I will go into greater detail later as to where I perceive that intervention as excessive. On Committee Stage we will table amendments to eradicate some of those interventions.</P>
    <P>The second area of great potential is <Col N="46" /> marine leisure.  In the early stages of preparation of this Bill there may not have been an appreciation of the extent to which this leisure is developing and its further potential.  I would welcome greater direction in the Bill as to how the promotion of these leisure activities can be developed.  Maritime leisure and recreational facilities are taking on a totally new thrust and it is vital that greater emphasis be placed on this aspect of tourism.</P>
    <P>In the orders and regulations laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas, there may very well be detailed provisions the Houses will not have an opportunity to debate.  Matters of fundamental principle should be covered in the Bill rather than introduced later in that manner.</P>
    <P>Referring to specific sections of the Bill, the question of sale and leasing, particularly short term leases, should not require ministerial approval.  The respective State commercial companies, under their new constitution, should have the requisite flexibility to take decisions of this kind.  There does not appear to be reference in the Bill to the appointment of chairmen or how that is to be done.</P>
    <P>The provision with which I have greatest difficulty is section 17 (3) (h) which states:</P>
    <P>...the aggregate amount standing invested (whether by the purchase of shares or the provision of loans or guarantees of loans) by the company in undertakings (other than subsidiaries) shall not exceed £250,000, without the approval of the Minister given with the consent of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>As the Minister well knows, that is the kind of money that would not buy a second-hand tug.  Since he has the broad support of the House in his endeavours, to require the approval of the Ministers for the Marine and Finance at that level is excessive, particularly when one bears in mind that the cost of the terminal building in Dún Laoghaire is in the <Col N="47" /> region of £20 million and that the facilities in their entirety provided over many years will probably amount to £1 billion. We talk about real commercial flexibility, the opportunity for the management of companies to develop, to exploit these resources, to be more competitive. It may well be that certain controls will be required in the case of smaller ports, but in the case of major ones that ministerial intervention is totally excessive and unnecessary and it should be eliminated or at least substantially reduced.</P>
    <P>The Minister might also inform us how he envisages the valuation of the assets and depreciation policy evolving. It is possible to incur very heavy depreciation but where maintenance work in ports is undertaken each year, the depreciation involved should be very low.  Perhaps the Minister would also inform the House how he sees the performance audit developing.  I have in mind responsibility for smaller piers, which have an inherent social benefit.  I am not arguing in any sense against the relevant company being responsible for the upkeep and maintenance of such piers, but it is important that the Minister should state clearly whether the requisite social benefit is deemed to form part of that total competitive business or whether, as was done in some previous Bill, we should insert some extra provision for these types of activities.</P>
    <P>It is crucial that directors be appointed with an interest in our ports and capable of devoting the time and energy to what is involved.  It has been represented to me that the number of directors should be increased somewhat, particularly from the local authorities. On the matter of worker directors the Minister has achieved a balance which is quite acceptable.  It is important that these companies be established as quickly as possible.  We will be tabling amendments to increase the number of directors and in order to ascertain to <Col N="48" /> what extent members of local authorities can be given greater representation. This would be an extremely difficult problem in parts of the mid-west. Obviously the Minister's consideration must extend beyond his constituency of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown where there may not be any problems.  In places like Foynes, Shannon and Limerick harbours, there would be at least five different local authorities involved and one would need to be Solomon to devise regulations to meet the wishes of everybody concerned.  Nobody would wish to return to the days when there was extended membership of the old harbour boards.  Tighter control of boards with wider membership is recommended and widely accepted but a balance of acceptability must be found, particularly in areas that are disenfranchised in the context of the new provisions.</P>
    <P>On the question of the harbour police, queries have been raised by people representing Dún Laoghaire as to whether a warrant should be granted outside the terminal building area or whether the Garda should be involved. Representations have been made to me in this context and I ask the Minister to explain what is involved and whether these considerations can be taken on board.</P>
    <P>On the question of the disposal of land and the ministerial sanction required, where we are talking about property not required for the core business, it is essential that new commercial companies be allowed to operate without the requirement of sanction.  That will augur well for the future in terms of the relationship between Government, Departments and commercial companies in circumstances where we are requiring them to make a profit.  Such freedom is essential to allow these companies operate without the cumbersome legal requirements which have hitherto obtained.</P>
    <P>The question of charges has been raised also and perhaps, during the course of his reply, the Minister might indicate how these will be imposed and <Col N="49" /> how these new areas will be mapped out.  Certain conflicts have already arisen.  Inquiries have been made as to whether Foynes will have responsibility for the Alcan area and other such matters have been raised.</P>
    <P>Overall, the general principles in the Bill meet the requirements of establishing the companies on the basis of the committee report.  It is clear that on many of these aspects there is wide support. Because of the sheer volume of trade and commerce now transacted through the ports, and the need to radically develop and open up these corridors, we must ensure that in legislation we do not adopt the restrictive, heavy-handed approach previously adopted not just by this Government. With regard to various recommendations made over the years, particularly by the Department of Finance, there was always a requirement for ministerial sanction over matters which should have been the responsibility of a truly commercial and flexible board.  The main thrust of our objections, if one could call them that, is primarily in that area.  I have referred already to the nonsensical requirement for ministerial sanction over levels of borrowing which would be so inflexible as to make a nonsense of the notion of commercial freedom.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister when replying, and on Committee Stage, to show a little more understanding of what will be necessary to achieve our aim to see the maximum potential achieved by these ports and the most competitive prices afforded which would enable our products to be exported in increasing volumes.  I ask him to agree to a suitable amendment which would paint a broader picture of our ports, harbours and marine leisure activities so that we can amplify the good that can be achieved in the context of what is provided so far in the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish the new Minister every success in his portfolio.  I have no doubt that, his constituency colleague, the Minister of State Deputy Gilmore <Col N="50" /> and he, will make a cohesive and compatible team at the Department.  I warn him, however, that five or six of his predecessors, including myself, sought to put a Harbours Bill through the Dáil without success; it usually fell with the falling of the Government.  I hope this Bill will not meet a similar fate.</P>
      <P>This Bill designates company status on 12 ports.  That leaves 14 other ports on the schedule, ten of whom have virtually no traffic.  There were four other ports in a different category and among those was the port of Sligo, which had a throughput of between 32,000 and 91,000 tonnes of traffic in 1990.  I am concerned about the effects of this Bill on the port of Sligo.  I know the recommendation of the review group is that the responsibility for most of the small or scheduled harbours should be transferred to the local authorities.  Local authority type practices and controls are not compatible with the market driven approach required in modern commercial harbours.  It would be grossly unfair to leave Sligo port in a type of limbo between State company and local authority responsibility where it would only stagnate and decline because of the absence of EU recognition.  It must have State company status for its harbour if it is to tackle the problems identified in the report and develop commercially and successfully.</P>
      <P>Sligo is the regional capital of the north west and the centre for access to transport by road, rail, sea and air from neighbouring counties both North and South.  A considerable part of the hinterland of the catchment area is located in the North.  It has traditionally served commerce within a radius of 40 or 50 miles and the port has been used as a regional resource for more than 200 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The north west region is always at a natural disadvantage as far as economic development is concerned due to its remote location and relatively undeveloped infrastructure.  To maintain the necessary services and overcome the underlying causes of unemployment and emigration in this region requires <Col N="51" /> special consideration involving both national and EU transport policies to ensure the possibility of a more even distribution of economic prosperity.  I am sure that is something with which the Minister will readily agree.</P>
    <P>The port of Sligo is an entirely commercial port.  It has real business significance for firms in the area as well as providing permanent or temporary employment both directly and indirectly.  The fact that it is the only real commercial port between Derry and Galway gives it a strategic importance for this area. Considerable sums of public and private moneys have been invested in the vicinity in recent times.  The port has been put on a sound financial basis.  The development proposals for it are market driven but its capacity to develop and to meet future needs will be severely restricted unless it can operate on a level with other ports, both North and South.  Major developments are taking place at the port of Derry.  The review group proposes that responsibility for the small ports be transferred to the local authorities but I doubt if the local authority in County Sligo or anywhere else would claim to have the facilities for such activities.  They have neither the experience nor financial resources to manage and develop such an undertaking.</P>
    <P>I have met with Sligo's Harbour Commissioners, as has the Minister's predecessor. They believe they cannot deal in isolation with the problems of excessive cargo handling costs, restrictive legislation, lack of investment, inadequate facilities and the need for more commercial freedom in the conduct of their port business.  They believe the port should be treated in the same way as other significant commercial harbours, benefiting from appropriate State and EU funding, and that the proposed State company status would enable them to address the challenge of providing an efficient, competitive and commercially viable transport service for the whole of the north west.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="52" /> Sligo port dates back many years.  In records as early as 1553 Sligo is referred to as the best harbour town in the country. It has, however, been outpaced in the meantime but the availability of harbour facilities was and continues to be a key to economic activity in the area. Taking into account the remoteness of the west coast and the isolation of the north west, the most peripheral region in the European Union sharing an important internal border with Northern Ireland, there is a clear need for an integrated regional transport system covering road, rail, sea and air.  Sligo port is an established link in this system and should receive appropriate State and EU support to enable it to continue its role of facilitating the overall economic development of the region.</P>
    <P>The peace dividend means enhanced cross-Border activity and there are plans to greatly improve the road network linking Sligo to its neighbouring counties of Fermanagh and Tyrone. There are very real possibilities for increasing commercial use of Sligo port to import to and export from Northern Ireland.  Between Galway and Derry there is no comparable port to serve commercial traffic and it is vital in both the national and regional interest that it is maintained and the facilities are upgraded, reflecting its strategic importance as a vital element in our regional infrastructure.</P>
    <P>Sligo, as part of the Border region, suffers from levels of unemployment that are considerably worse than the average for the EU.  It is affected by its distance from the national capital and as such is covered by the INTERREG II programme, which aims to improve the economic position of the cross-Border regions North and South.  It is clear that Sligo port, the only west coast commercial harbour in the peripheral Border region which is eligible for INTERREG funding, should receive serious consideration for support from this EU programme.</P>
    <P>Considerable sums of money have been spent in recent times by Sligo Harbour Commissioners and by the State in <Col N="53" /> providing and maintaining the facilities at the port.  As recently as 1984, when I was very much involved, major dredging operations at a cost of £619,000 were carried out to increase the depth of the approach channel and berthing areas.  A very good job was done in keeping the port commercially viable.  Since then, from its own resources more than £10,000 annually has been spent on regular maintenance dredging to retain the required depth.  Again from its own resources in the past two years the harbour board undertook the reconstruction of a deep water jetty to enable the port to handle vessels up to 3,000 tonnes capacity.  This involved capital expenditure of £128,000 which was not State aided in any way.  The volume of traffic has been upwards with the importation of coal, timber, fertilisers, salt, cement and bitumen and the export of forest products.</P>
    <P>Towards the end of his speech the Minister indicated that he would have empowering facilities to grant a port such as Sligo State company status or to transfer it to a local authority.  With its potential for increased traffic, its strategic importance and financial viability it merits, even in its present state, inclusion by way of an amendment to the Bill in the designated ports.  The Minister will be convinced of the value of this.  His predecessor, who met the Sligo Harbour Board, was convinced by the arguments put forward.  It would be of value to the region and to the port to be listed among the designated ports.</P>
    <P>The Minister is very well briefed on the situation and I appeal to him to proceed by way of a Committee Stage amendment to this Bill rather than wait. While the drive and enthusiasm is there and traffic is coming from across the Border it is important the Minister should proceed by way of amendment to the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Mr. Browne (Wexford) Mr. Browne (Wexford)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Wexford):</i> I congratulate the Minister on his appointment and wish him well.  During my time in the Department of the Environment he was Opposition spokesperson and I <Col N="54" /> found him courteous and willing to put forward good ideas.  I am sure he will listen to Members from this side of the House.</P>
      <P>This Bill is long overdue.  Our senior spokesperson, Deputy Michael Smith, said that when Bills such as this were introduced Governments fell but the Minister is quite confident it will not happen this time.  The previous Bill was introduced in 1946 by the then Minister for Industry and Commerce, Seán Lemass who, as we all know, became Taoiseach.  Perhaps Deputy Barrett may do likewise at some stage in the future. It is a long time since a Bill was introduced and I welcome this Bill in principle. We have a number of suggestions and will table amendments on Committee Stage.  As an island nation we depend on trade for our future prosperity. It is important that our ports are up to the standard of our counterparts in the European Union so that we can compete.  It is welcome that 12 ports have been named.  Deputy Nealon made a case for including Sligo port in that list and there is nothing wrong with that.</P>
      <P>It is important that the ports are viable and properly represent the regions in which they are situated. Because of industrial relations and other problems in ports like Dublin, they have not operated as they should, to our advantage and many firms export through Northern ports because it is cheaper.  The Minister should examine this aspect because it makes no sense for exporters from Wexford to haul their product through Dublin and Louth to Belfast and still export more cheaply. The setting up of the new boards should see a change in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important that Ireland, on the periphery of Europe, should have ports that are up to standard.  It will be a difficult task for the Minister to get the 12 boards up and running and involved in the day to day running of the ports.  This is the first step.  I agree with Deputy Smith that the Minister is, on the one hand, bringing in a Bill aimed at freeing up the ports and cutting through bureaucracy and red tape but, on the <Col N="55" /> other, the Department of Finance seems to want to have a hand in everything that happens in any Department.  There is nothing wrong with accountability.  To be answerable to the Minister for the Marine is one thing but to be answerable to the Minister for Finance is another.  New authorities should have powers and be allowed to operate freely if they are to be successful.  These boards cannot be successful if the gurus in the Department of Finance have the final say in regard to everything they wish to do.</P>
    <P>I come from a county which has been provided with substantial amounts of money for port development by different Governments.  There is a large port development in Rosslare, which is one of the finest ports in Europe, thanks to moneys allocated by this and the last two Governments.  The Minister of State Deputy Gilmore, visited Rosslare recently and announced an allocation of £10 million for ongoing development at Rosslare Harbour.  As more than one million passengers a year come through Rosslare it is important to continue to develop it and, therefore, I welcome the recent allocation of funds.  It is important also to ensure that tourists coming through Rosslare spend some time and money in the south eastern region.  We have an ideal opportunity for developing a centre of excellence in Rosslare for job creation and the attraction of new industries and investment.  I see that as the next phase of the development of Rosslare Harbour.</P>
    <P>When the Minister was in Wexford he also announced an allocation of £3 million for New Ross harbour which is an important regional port used by 600 ships a year and with an annual throughput of 1.140 million tonnes. There is major importation of petroleum products in this area and, for a number of years, the harbour board in New Ross has been fighting for funds for the development of that harbour. The recent allocation by the Minister was welcome and will open up further opportunities for job creation in the <Col N="56" /> south east.  In recent years there has been much jealousy and guarding of what they have by the various ports. This Bill should encourage the opening up of the ports and encourage further competition and development.</P>
    <P>The Department of the Environment will have a major role in the area of infrastructural development around the ports.  In some areas there is very good road access to ports but in other areas it is not so good.  For example, the road from Enniscorthy to New Ross is a disaster and was recently taken over by the National Roads Authority.  I hope we do not have to wait until 1998-99 for development on that stretch of road as a major port development requires major road development.  I ask the Minister for the Environment to ensure that that road is upgraded to a very high standard as soon as possible so that the development of the port is not stifled because of poor road access.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that the number of directors of each company shall be not more than 12 and that they will be appointed and may be removed from office by the Minister with the consent of the Minister for Finance.  It should be sufficient for the Minister for the Marine to make such decisions.  I see no reason for the involvement of the Department of Finance.  I should also like to know who will be appointed to the boards.  The Minister mentioned local authority members.  Is it intended to include representatives of exporters. the fishing industry etc?  It is important to appoint people who have an interest in the development of the ports and who will see to their long-term development because too often in the past people who were not suitable were appointed to boards.  I welcome the appointment of worker directors.  They make a valuable input and keep workers, political parties and the Government up to date on what is happening on boards.</P>
    <P>The Bill states that the staff of companies whose employees exceed 50 in number shall elect two worker directors and the staff of companies whose <Col N="57" /> employees are more than 30 but not more than 50 in number shall elect one worker director.  The provisions governing the election of worker directors is set out in the Fifth Schedule.  Where the staff of a company is fewer than 30 in number the Minister will, following consultation with recognised trade unions, appoint a person as a representative of the interests of the employees of the company.  Why is the Minister not prepared to allow a company with staff of fewer than 30 to elect their own representative? I do not think the Minister should have the right, in consultation with the unions, to appoint a representative.</P>
    <P>I welcome the appointment of three members by a prescribed local authority. New Ross and Arklow have urban councils.  Will the county council or the urban council nominate the members? The county council is the premier body in any county but I am not sure if it should have the nominating rights to a board or authority in an urban area. Sometimes those elected to the boards are not from the urban area and are not <i>au fait</i> with what is happening there.  In the case of the new structure in New Ross, the Minister should consider allowing the urban council to have a say in who represents it.</P>
    <P>Is the Minister talking about elected members, county managers, county secretaries or finance officers?  There should be a balance.  Elected representatives have a major role to play regardless of their political persuasion.  There are a number of elected representatives on the old harbour board in New Ross and I would not like to see them excluded.  I am sure the old boards will be abolished but will the valuable experience built up by those people in developing the port be lost?</P>
    <P>I read an article recently by Brian Dowling, political correspondent with the <i>Irish Independent</i> entitled: &ldquo;£330 million Port Plan Sails into Stormy Waters&rdquo;. He referred to the problems which may arise with pensions resulting from the new structures taking over the old boards.  How will the pension rights of <Col N="58" /> staff on the new authorities be protected? The figures given in the newspaper are very high.  Will the Minister clarify the position?</P>
    <P>It is important that we develop our ports to take account of the changes in shipping, the size of ships and our dependence on external trade.  In 1980 there was a throughput of 19.4 million tonnes.  That has increased to 28 million, an increase of 40 per cent.  We must ask if it could have been further increased had we had proper structures a number of years ago.  Much of the traffic which should be going through our ports now goes through ports in the North.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  I hope it will allow the 12 new commercial State companies to be viable and operate the ports.  I look forward to teasing out the provisions of the Bill on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  It was brought forward to the House on a number of occasions and returned for revision.  I welcome the Minister for the Marine and the Minister of State who has taken a great interest in this area since he took office.  He visited many of the ports for which he has responsibility. I know he has a great knowledge of port structures.  I had the pleasure of showing him the ports at Arklow and Wicklow, both in my constituency.  Those two viable harbours are in need of reconstruction.</P>
      <P>The ports have operated under the Harbours Act, 1946 and some minor amendments were made to it over the years.  It was a worthwhile Act which stood the test of time.  It was introduced immediately after the Second World War when sailing ships were the norm in many ports.  Many of its provisions dealt with sailing ships which had precedence over steam and power driven ships playing between harbours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Parts III, IV and V are welcome and take account of the changes which have occurred in the type of vessels using the ports and also the modern communications systems operated in the ports. Those changes were not anticipated when the Act was passed more than 50 <Col N="59" /> years ago.  In that respect, this Bill is long overdue.  In the past attempts were made to modernise the Harbours Act and it seems that this attempt will be successful.</P>
    <P>Debate adjourned.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 3, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>As I indicated in the House on 24 May, I have deliberately not set a time-frame for responses by the Northern Ireland parties to my invitations regarding bilateral talks.  It is important that the parties concerned should have as much time and space as they need to consider their responses.  For the same reason, it would be counterproductive to report regularly on the state of play regarding responses to these invitations which, in any event, issued only very recently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Naturally, I would hope that bilateral talks could get under way in the reasonably near future.  We have a unique opportunity to shape a durable political <Col N="60" /> settlement and the bilateral talks which I have proposed would make an important contribution to this process.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach believe that the substantive talks must await participation by all parties, including Sinn Féin?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important that we move as soon as possible to a point where all parties participate on the same basis.  Obviously certain matters, most notably the decommissioning of arms, must be dealt with before we reach that point.  As I said in the House in response to questions from Deputy Ahern and others, I am not keen to develop semantic Chinese walls between one type of talks and another type of talks or to make the issue more complicated than it needs to be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for his reply.  I support his decision to issue invitations to the political parties in the North.  I do not want to ask him questions on this matter every week as this is not useful but will he outline how he proposes, under Strand II, to encourage the parties to talk?  I imagine that some of them will find it difficult to reply in the short term and perhaps the Taoiseach could avail of this opportunity to expand on how the talks will be developed over the next few months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have deliberately not set any precise agenda for these discussions. The agenda is open and the parties can have what they want discussed with the Irish Government as the first set of items on it.  In other words, I want to make the invitation as open as possible in so far as the parties participating are concerned.  I have not specified that this is a Strand II exercise; it is simply an invitation by the Irish Government to all the relevant parties in Northern Ireland to participate in bilateral discussions.  This is probably the best way to proceed.  As I said on a previous occasion, one cannot make progress on Strand II without making <Col N="61" /> progress on Strand I as Strand II feeds into Strand I and <i>vice versa</i>, and Strand III is also relevant.  I do not regard this initiative as separate from the other initiatives but it is important to do it. Part of the value of the exercise is that it requires the parties in preparing for the meeting with the Irish Government to address specifically a number of issues in a way that hopefully will be constructive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach envisage these talks taking place before the marching season or will they take place during the autumn?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope they will take place as soon as possible, and that is my objective.  I have not thought of a date in the context of the marching season. Obviously the parties have other agendas on their minds, for example, the by-election in one constituency which I am sure is taking up some of their attention.  I hope that the talks will take place as soon as possible.  In the event of their taking place during a period when traditional demonstrations take place I hope those demonstrations will be carried out in such a restrained and considered manner that they will not cause any problem.  Any demonstrations should be contemplated with an eye to community relations as the number one priority.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the submission of presentations on the Framework Document by the Northern parties part of the agenda?  Some time ago the Taoiseach stated that they should present any views they had on the Framework Document rather than try to amend it. Will this be part of the talks process?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not looking for their views on the Framework Document or any other document; I am looking for their views.  The important thing is to get their views and to open the dialogue. If we are too prescriptive as to the framework and form of the discussions then the rest of the discussions <Col N="62" /> will not get off on the right foot.  That is why I have deliberately framed the invitation and the agenda in as open a fashion as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>The decommissioning of arms has caused a logjam, even in regard to the Taoiseach's invitations which I hope will be accepted.  Will the Taoiseach agree that President Clinton has gone out on a limb and come under severe political pressure so as to bring all the parties together?  Will he also agree that the paramilitaries owe it to the President and the Ambassador to make a substantial gesture, whether it is the decommissioning of arms or whatever, to enable the parties come together?  What is the opinion on the decommissioning of explosives which could never be regarded as weapons of defence?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for his very constructive intervention. The questions he has put are useful as an expression of his views on these matters. Obviously the objective is to achieve the decommissioning of both offensive arms and those which could be described as being potentially defensive in certain circumstances.  We want to get all these arms out of the equation. However, I do not regard this issue as a barrier to the discussions I have initiated.  I have issued invitations to parties to come and see me and I am not putting any conditions in their way. This is not to say that I do not recognise, as the Deputy does, that the decommissioning of arms issue has to be dealt with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I strongly agree that President Clinton has gone out on a limb.  He has been consistently courageous and imaginative in the way in which he has dealt with this issue.  He has not used this issue in a traditional Irish-American political card mode; rather he has sought to be constructive and fair minded.  For example, his statement at the Washington Conference was very balanced and it showed an appreciation of the concerns of both communities in Northern <Col N="63" /> Ireland.  This is a very important point. Obviously the Irish Government has urged him to go in that direction but he has done so willingly and freely himself.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach has the support of the House in asking the parties in the North to participate in a debate on an open agenda in a friendly way.  I would like to think no party would refuse that invitation.  Is it the Taoiseach's intention to have a meeting, either formal or informal, with the British Prime Minister in Paris at the weekend about the peace process?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not absolutely certain yet whether we will be able to have a meeting.  He is arriving in Paris a little later than I and is leaving a little earlier than I and it may not be possible for us to get together for a bilateral meeting.  We are working on it.  If we can have a meeting we will.  I would like to have a meeting with the Prime Minister but it may not prove possible on this occasion.  As the House is well aware such meetings with the British Prime Minister can be arranged quite easily and there is no great problem with arranging them.</P>

If the Taoiseach has invited the PUP and the UDP to talks will he undertake to listen to what they have to say in relation to the whole issue of prisoners which they feel has not been addressed by the British Government in the same way as it has been treated by the Government and the previous Government in this State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The parties who have been invited are: the Ulster Unionist Party, the SDLP, the Democratic Unionist Party, Sinn Féin, the Alliance Party, the Ulster Democratic Party and the Progressive Unionist Party.  I will listen to any views the Ulster Democratic Party or the Progressive Unionist <Col N="64" /> Party wish to put to me in regard to prisoners. It is an important issue in the peace process.  I believe that peace is sufficiently firmly established now for it to be possible for the British Government to consider making the necessary legal changes to increase the rate of remission of sentences.  There is a legal barrier that they cannot go beyond a certain rate of remission without making changes in the law.  It is quite clear that the circumstances now exist where that change should be made.  In my discussions in Westminster where I met various politicians &mdash; not just Government politicians but also Opposition politicians &mdash; I made that case quite strongly.  It is a case that should be made in any opportunity that one has for interchange with the members of the House of Commons.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The press release clearly indicated that the Government's authorisation to publish the report and their approval, in principle, to the implementation of the recommendations and agreement to <Col N="65" /> make the necessary resources available to the office had been given on 21 February. The press release outlined proposed action to be taken by the Attorney General in respect of organisational changes and stated that he would give progress reports to the Government on these changes after six months, and again after 12 months.</P>
    <P>In my detailed statement of 30 May I stated that the report listed 25 recommendations for early implementation and another ten requiring further consideration. Actions in respect of all of the recommendations had been initiated, was completed in respect of some and was well advanced in respect of others.  I went on to state that, while I was anxious not to pre-empt the content of the Attorney General's six month report, rapid progress was being achieved in respect of the main recommendations. I arranged on 30 May for a short report to be circulated with my statement which went through the individual recommendation and gave the state of play in respect of each.</P>

      <P>May I ask the Taoiseach whether a facility put in place by a previous Attorney General, Mr. Whelehan, that all sensitive cases in relation to sex abuse, whether child sex abuse or otherwise, would be brought to the Attorney General's immediate attention was implemented?</P>

Will the Taoiseach confirm that the arrangements in place in the Attorney General's office prior to the review group report of January 1995 were that written requests and other correspondence received in the office were sorted, numbered and recorded in a hand-written ledger in the registry and that the registry also obtained, when any further information came in, previous papers?

      <P>I am trying to establish why the procedures in place prior to the review group report were not operated in this case.  The registry records the fact that a reply has issued in each of these cases where there is written correspondence.  If that facility was put in place &mdash; which was there prior to the review group &mdash; why was such a reply not recorded?  Why did somebody not pick it up?  Where was the file?  The Taoiseach indicated in the Dáil last week that it was locked in a filing cabinet, a press or a safe.  Who gave the instruction that it be locked up?  Why was it locked up?  To whom did the safe, in which it was locked, belong?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>My understanding is that the correspondence which we spent some time discussing last week was registered in the register but it was not replied to.  Therefore, no reply was registered in the register because no reply was issued until 9 May.  The position is that in the normal course a letter threatening legal proceedings would not actually be dealt with in the Attorney General's office, it would be passed on, having been registered, to the Chief State Solicitor's office to be dealt with there rather than in the Attorney General's office.  As I explained in the House last week that did not happen in this case; the letter remained on the desk of a particular official.</P>

Certainly I have not inspected the registry of correspondence in the Department of the Taoiseach &mdash; I admit that openly &mdash; nor have I inspected the registry of correspondence received by my predecessor, Deputy Albert Reynolds.  I am not sure I would go along with the inference in the Deputy's question that there is some measure of culpability here.  As I explained, in response to Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, the position in regard to these letters threatening legal proceedings within seven days is that they ought to have been passed to the Chief State Solicitor's office for reply.

      <P>The Taoiseach has raised an interesting point. Where somebody writes to the Minister for Health, for example, about a matter <Col N="69" /> which does not concern him, will the Taoiseach confirm that it is normal practice for a civil servant to write to the correspondent stating that it is not a matter for the Minister for Health but for the Minister for Education and for a copy of this letter to be kept on file? Why was that not done in this case? When the Attorney General received the file why did he not pick up on the fact that an acknowledgement had not been sent and that a letter had not been forwarded to the solicitor suggesting that while this was not a matter for the Attorney General's office it was a matter for the Chief State Solicitor's office?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Where a letter is misaddressed it is normal practice to refer it to someone else and to issue an acknowledgement stating this.  It did not happen in this case because the letter in question remained on the desk of a particular official.  It was never associated with or put on the file because, under the direction of the previous Attorney General, it was put in a safe.  There was no other ongoing business other than this correspondence which was not replied to.</P>

      <P>Child sex abuse cases referred to the Director of Public Prosecutions are considered independently by at least two legal assistants and, where appropriate, by a third or the director personally.  No legal assistant in that office is excluded from dealing with such cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="70" /> The expertise required for discharging the director's functions in child sex abuse cases is the same as that required for every other criminal investigation file, which is the ability to assess the available evidence and to form a sound and objective judgment based on that assessment as to whether a prosecution is warranted and appropriate. Every legal assistant is required to acquire and develop that ability and the director is satisfied that all have done so.  His office has available to it, and routinely avails of, a wide range of expertise in the area of child sexual abuse.  These include child psychiatrists and psychologists, paediatricians and other specialist workers.</P>

      <P>Does the Taoiseach accept that the reason I tabled this question is that I want to try to understand why so few cases involving sexual offences are prosecuted by the Director of Public Prosecutions?  In a written reply the Taoiseach indicated that in the four months period from January to April 1995, 279 cases involving sexual offences were sent by the Garda to the Director of Public Prosecutions to be processed.  A decision was taken to prosecute in only 59 of these.  Can the Taoiseach justify this figure?  Does he accept that such a low rate gives rise to justifiable concern?  In 138 cases a decision was taken not to prosecute.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the function of the Director of Public Prosecutions to decide whether there is a case which is capable of being proved beyond reasonable doubt.  This involves an assessment of the evidence in a balanced way and it would not be appropriate to set target rates of prosecutions in respect of files <Col N="71" /> referred to the office.  That would constitute interference with the proper independent function of the Director of Public Prosecutions in weighing up the evidence and deciding in a balanced way whether a case exists which is capable of being proved beyond reasonable doubt and sufficient evidence to achieve that objective.  Cases involving child sex abuse are difficult and complex in regard to the assembly of evidence and ensuring that any genuine case is prosecuted and people not wrongly accused. A careful and balanced function has to be performed.  It is good that the Director of Public Prosecutions is independent in making that judgment.  I would not like to see a situation arising where political pressure, however well intended, is exerted on the Director of Public Prosecutions to achieve a certain rate of prosecutions for any category of case.  The independence of the Director of Public Prosecutions is a valuable protection of the liberty of the citizen in this State.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I disagree with the Taoiseach.  Whereas the Taoiseach insists on independence the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions is accountable, which is undesirable.  The Taoiseach said that sufficiency of evidence is the only criterion used. However, he is aware of one case about which a constituent of mine has written both to him and the Minister for Justice and received no reply and in which the accused confessed to the Garda that he abused two children of the constituent concerned.  Nevertheless, a decision has been taken not to prosecute.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As recently as Friday, 21 April the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Currie, launched the new procedure for the notification between health boards and the Garda of suspected cases of child abuse.  Those new procedures clarify the circumstances in which the health boards and the Garda will notify one another of suspected cases of physical, sexual and emotional abuse or neglect of children and give guidance in a formal way for the consultation that should take place between the two authorities following such notification.  Where a health board suspects that a child is physically or sexually abused, or wilfully neglected, the Garda must be notified immediately by the health board; it is stressed that the health board should not await confirmation of abuse.  There may have been some ambiguity or doubt prior to these guidelines being issued by the Minister of State, Deputy Currie, but I hope that is no longer the case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>Have the Taoiseach or the Minister for Justice put in place mechanisms, such as those in the Attorney General's office, to ensure that files are dealt with sensitively and <Col N="74" /> expeditiously by the DPP?  Are there mechanisms in place to keep the Government informed and ensure there is no undue delay in cases such as this? The information the Taoiseach gave on the expertise available to the DPP on the aspect of criminality was very skimpy.  Has the Taoiseach details on whether specific people are consulted by the DPP, or does he pick some name or names of people with whom to consult in individual cases?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That file referred to the DPP by the Garda would normally contain assessments by psychologists, paediatricians or other relevant people who dealt with the case.  The normal course would be for the DPP to consult them if further information is required rather than bring in a third party, but that option exists if there is doubt.  I understand there is an effective system in the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions for dealing expeditiously with files, but as I said on a previous occasion, I think in response to Deputy O'Dea, there is always room for improvement in every office.  I see no disadvantage in having a form of external audit of the DPP or any other office to ensure its information management systems are up to date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that all files passed to the DPP by the Garda have already been validated by the health board and other agencies so there should be very little need to look into the matter further in terms of validation for child abuse?  Does the Taoiseach stand over all the decisions of the DPP not to prosecute?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The DPP is independent and, therefore, my standing over his decisions does not arise.  I stand over his independence.  I am not in a position to account for individual decisions of the DPP; if I did I would be politicising the office of the DPP and interfering with his independence, and as I explained to the Deputy on about 40 occasions, I am not willing to do that. <Col N="75" /> The Deputy may have a different view on how the DPP should operate and she is entitled to push that view but I do not agree with it.  The independence of the DPP is of paramount importance to the liberty of citizens and I believe that a majority of Members agree.</P>
      <P>The Deputy must understand that the validation carried out in the DPP's office is different from that carried out in the health board.  The health board considers the matter from the point of view of establishing the facts and gathering evidence on child sex abuse.  It assembles the information from a social work point of view.  The DPP has a different function in terms of the file; his function is to establish whether there is sufficient evidence that an offence will be proved beyond reasonable doubt in the courts.  That is a different exercise in terms of the considerations to be brought to bear on the facts from that undertaken in the health board.  The health board simply establishes in a general way that a case is to be answered, whereas a specific requirement rests with the DPP because he has to decide whether a person should be prosecuted. There is a distinction between the burden of proof in criminal law and the burden of proof in administration, that is essentially the difference.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is usually better to prosecute people in the jurisdiction where the offence has been committed because it is more likely the evidence will be available to sustain the prosecution in that jurisdiction.  The practice of trying a person in one jurisdiction for offences committed in another is rare and I am not sure it would have applicability or value in this case.  However, I will ask the Attorney General to advise me on the matter in view of the fact that the Deputy raised it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>While I was on my feet here replying to parliamentary questions on the matter on 31 May 1995, my private secretary contacted the Belfast solicitors for the victims of Fr. Smyth extending an invitation to the families concerned to meet me so that I could convey an apology to them for the discourtesy caused by the failure to reply to their solicitors' letters of November and January and for the earlier <Col N="79" /> delay in processing the Smyth extradition. There were two further contacts between my private secretary and the solicitors on that date clarifying the terms of the invitation.</P>
      <P>The solicitor informed my private secretary on 2 June that as of that time, the families were not prepared to accept the invitation on the terms which I had indicated to the House on 31 May.  I would stress, however, that it was made clear the invitation remained open then, and I would still be happy to meet the families.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I tabled this question before the Taoiseach said he would meet them.  I know his invitation is appreciated, but the family consider that a meeting with the Taoiseach could prejudice any legal action they may take.  Has the Taoiseach reviewed the possibility of the payment of compensation to spare the victims from going through the trauma and the cumbersome process of legal proceedings?  The family find it difficult to understand why the official involved was compensated and not forced to go to court while they are forced to take legal action to secure compensation for the trauma inflicted on them as a result of delays this State forced upon them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The official in question retired under certain statutory rules established here and he got no more or no less than that due to him under a statutory regulation approved by the House.  He did not get special or extra treatment.  Regarding the position of the families concerned, I understand that legal proceedings have issued against the State and I would not feel free therefore to comment in any detail on the points made by the Deputy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>While the official retired or resigned, the Taoiseach told the House that the reason the Government took the view it did and paid almost an extra £50,000 and £3,000 extra by way of pension and added ten extra <Col N="80" /> years in lieu of service outside the public sector was to avoid litigation.  Does the Taoiseach understand why the victims find it difficult to believe that they are forced to take litigation to secure any type of compensation from the State while that official received generous compensation because the Taoiseach did not want to be involved in litigation? The Taoiseach said last week he did not want the long process of litigation, he wanted the matter dealt with speedily.</P>

That information was supplied and the letter replied to within seven days.  I was not aware of that correspondence at the time I spoke in the House.

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Education</askee>
      <Quest>if the 1995 junior certificate results could be issued in the month of August; and if they could be posted simultaneously to each examination student at his or her home and to his or her school.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Ms Bhreathnach)</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret it will not be possible to publish the 1995 junior certificate results in August this year.  The Department's resources are fully committed to publishing the results of the leaving certificate in mid-August. However my Department is conducting a feasibility study on improving the technology so that examination results can issue earlier in subsequent years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In making the junior certificate results available to schools the key objective is to ensure, as far as possible, that all candidates can have access to their results at about the same time and certainly on the same day.  I could not guarantee this if the results were to be posted to 65,000 individual addresses. While An Post can guarantee next-day delivery of the results to the 800 post-primary schools, they could not do so for delivery to students' homes.  Candidates expecting to receive results at home and failing to do so would <Col N="88" /> undoubtedly become very anxious and I would like to avoid this.</P>
    <P>I would also like to stress the positive role played by school principals and teachers in conveying the results directly to their students and the support they provide to candidates who may be distressed by the results.  Candidates who are disappointed can be reassured by the principal and teachers that there are options open to them, including applying for a re-check.</P>
    <P>It is planned to issue this year's junior certificate results on Tuesday, 12 September, as compared with Thursday, 15 September last year.  I hope that by distancing the issue of the results from the weekend, the level of unruly behaviour by a small number of candidates will be reduced.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>My purpose in tabling this question related to the last element of the Minister's reply because I do not want to witness, nor I am sure does the Minister, the almost riotous behaviour we did last year in Cork and in major urban centres.  Thousands of students gathered on our streets and there was an unacceptable level of substance abuse and alcohol consumption by very young people.  Does the Minister agree that in recent years the issuing of the junior certificates results on the one day, when students have returned to school, led directly to this type of unacceptable activity?  Will the Minister agree that it should be our priority to avoid a repetition of those scenes which, in the case of my city of Cork, were quite frightening?  Will she agree that the issuing of results in August, to each home &mdash; and simultaneously to the schools &mdash; should override any administrative or other difficulties?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>Since today is the first day of public examinations I and all Members of the House offer best wishes to the many thousands of students sitting the junior and leaving certificate examinations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I might draw Deputy Martin's attention to what I said in replying to his <Col N="89" /> question about unruly behaviour.  I was very careful to talk about the level of such behaviour by a very small number of students.  When the Deputy's family reaches the stage of sitting the junior and leaving certificates I am sure he would not expect them to be among a certain number of students who engage in such unruly behaviour, in celebrating examination results.  I have initiated a feasibility study on bringing forward the date for issuing the results of the junior certificate examination, in response to calls from parents' associations who are somewhat worried that his behaviour may be receiving more media coverage than it deserves.  I have a responsibility to respond to such calls and ensure that nothing I or my Department do will encourage such unruly behaviour.  Of course, the priority is to issue the leaving certificate examination results. There have been many technological improvements and innovations within the Examinations Division in Athlone, with the aid of whose officials we have been able to bring forward the issuing of the junior certificate results to Tuesday, 12 September, 1995.</P>
    <P>Parents and school principals have a particular role to play.  For instance, when I impart information on schools dismissing children for the remainder of the day, as opposed to neighbouring schools, who allow their students convey the results to their parents and return to school, we must remember there are a number of parties involved in handling such matters, particularly the junior certificate examination results.  With the technological advances now available to my Department we will be able to move forward so that the results can be issued in August.  Since, as is well known, all the papers are corrected simultaneously, it is the departmental priority to feed the leaving certificate results into the system.  If An Post cannot guarantee to deliver examination results to 65,000 individual addresses on one day we should await the outcome of the feasibility study and ascertain what can be done next year.  In the meantime, I <Col N="90" /> would request parents and school principals to respond positively to the earlier date for the issue of the examination results this year, in order that displays of unruly behaviour, to which Deputy Martin referred, are not alone discouraged but, if possible, eliminated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>We on this side of the House are becoming somewhat tired of talk of feasibility studies and research bodies being advanced as excuses for lack of action, since technological developments are sufficiently well advanced to facilitate the type of changes we require.  The Minister's reply indicated some complacency on this matter.  Last year I witnessed very frightening scenes. Many students wanted to enjoy themselves wholesomely but because of the &ldquo;junior certificate night out&rdquo;, certain people in towns and cities provided entertainment in particular locations. Hundreds of students clamoured to gain entrance, leading to very dangerous circumstances. Will the Minister accept that this warrants urgent attention rather than that it is a matter given undue coverage by the media and that steps must be taken to deal with it?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">

      <P>I was requested by the Parents' Association to examine this matter, which I have done.  This year, with the help of officials in the Examinations Division in Athlone, it has been possible to bring forward the date for junior certificate results to the beginning of the week, that is, 12 September 1995.  At present we do not have the technological apparatus to feed the junior certificate results that come in simultaneously with those for the leaving certificate into our computer system&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I know the Deputy's shopping list of changes to be introduced is becoming ever longer and I would introduce them if I could.  It is <Col N="91" /> not appropriate for Members to run down feasibility or other studies. Rather, we should responsibly seek solutions to a problem I have acknowledged. Nonetheless, I must state that the Minister for Education is not responsible for every student who participates in the &ldquo;junior certificate night out&rdquo;; there are others who have a responsibility for students' behaviour.  I ask everybody to bear with us.  I and my Department have responded to a request to deal with the problem and are doing so in the best possible manner. Perhaps this time next year I will be in a position to give a positive reply to the Deputy's question.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Education</askee>
      <Quest>the present position in relation to the implementation of the third-level free fees proposal announced in the budget; whether colleges will be entitled to levy registration fees, capitation fees and library fees; and if she will define what is meant by tuition fees.</Quest>
      <QRef>[10344/95]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated in my announcement following the budget I intend to implement the removal of tuition fees in two stages.  In the 1995-96 academic year undergraduate students will pay half tuition fees and in the 1996-97 academic year undergraduate tuition fees will be abolished.</P>
      <P>Following that announcement I asked the chairperson of the Higher Education Authority to set up a working party to prepare proposals for the implementation of the new arrangements and to report to me.  The working party includes representatives of the Higher Education Authority, the universities, the regional technical colleges, the Dublin Institute of Technology and my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In finalising its report for me I understand the working party is considering the existing practices across all the third level institutions in relation to the fees <Col N="92" /> mentioned by the Deputy and will make recommendations to me in that regard.</P>
    <P>In the strict literal sense tuition fees, of course, means the fees paid for teaching and tutorials.  As the Deputy is aware the coverage of student fees has until now varied between the university sector, the Dublin Institute of Technology and regional technical college sector.  In the universities, the student fee covers tuition, registration and exam fees and capitation fees paid for the funding of student services.  In the Dublin Institute of Technology and the regional technical colleges most students pay fees ranging from £100 to £150 to cover these items.  In establishing the working party my objective is to harmonise the practices across the whole third level sector.</P>
    <P>When I receive the report and recommendations of the working party I will consider them carefully, together with the views of the student interests, before deciding on the detailed arrangements that will apply.  I expect these arrangements will address, among other issues, the questions raised by the Deputy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">

      <P>I cannot give such an indication, other than to say I appreciate that people in the colleges and universities are awaiting this information. As soon as that information is made available to me I will comment on it and I will then bring my recommendations to the notice of the institutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>As this is now the month of June, will the Minister not accept there is an urgency with respect to this issue?  Colleges require some indication as to what they will be charging next autumn and every effort should be made to avoid administrative chaos in our colleges and regional technical colleges in the forthcoming academic year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>In making this matter the responsibility of the Higher Education Authority, there will not and could never be threatened administrative chaos.  I hope to have the report and recommendations of the working party in the very near future.  I am conscious of the need to clarify this matter at an early date in the interests of the students and their parents, and to enable the CAO and third level colleges finalise their arrangements for the next academic year.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>The announcement I made concerned the abolition of tuition fees and I spelt that out in strict literal terms &mdash; tuition fees means the fees paid for teaching and tutorials.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>What was announced in the budget was the abolition of tuition fees to third level students.  Different practices obtain in different colleges and there are various ways in which tuition fees can be a composite fee, particularly for students receiving grants.  It would be useful if the Deputy awaited the working party's report which will outline for him and those involved in the administration of fees what the position will be for the coming year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>This is my last opportunity before the recess to put questions to the Minister on this issue.  I take it that the Minister is not ruling out the possibility that capitation, registration and even library fees will continue to be charged and that, even two years from now, students might continue to face bills of up to £300.  Will registration and capitation fees be means tested?</P>

      <P>I realise this is the final opportunity, before the end of this academic year, to discuss this matter but I repeat that I have not seen the recommendations of the working party which has examined the practices in various situations.  I can only repeat my original. The announcement in the budget concerned the abolition of tuition fees over a two-year period.  To speculate on the recommendations of the working party is not fruitful.</P>

      <P>I do not consider that a statutory system of inquiries to be conducted by my Department would be the best course to adopt in relation to abuse allegations and I do not intend to establish such a system.</P>
      <P>The primary responsibility for the safety and welfare of children in schools and the disciplining of staff rests with the management authorities of schools who act for the owners of the schools. My responsibility is to ensure that schools have put in place appropriate procedures for dealing with abuse allegations and that they are implemented effectively.</P>
      <P>As regards discipline in the teaching profession, arising from abuse allegations or otherwise, the White Paper proposes the setting up of a teaching council on a statutory basis which, among other things, will have responsibility for disciplinary procedures, registration and de-registration of teachers. The White Paper also gives commitments to legislate so as to give a statutory backing to the role of boards of management as employers of teachers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="95" /> Legislation will also give responsibilities to education boards for evaluating and monitoring the quality of education and extend the remit of the Ombudsman to education boards.  This range of proposed statutory provision will provide adequate provision for investigating allegations of abuse and taking any necessary action.</P>
    <P>At present guidelines relating to abuse allegations, agreed between my Department, primary and secondary school managements, parents and teachers, are in place.  I will very shortly issue to all officials in my Department guidelines on how to deal with allegations of abuse of children made to them either in the course of their work or otherwise.  In addition, the Department of Health and the Garda have recently issued guidelines which will co-ordinate their services.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to indicate my incredulity at the Minister's reply.  Will she not agree that she and her Department are abandoning responsibility for the protection of children in our schools?  In the light of the Ardara experience in Donegal, where the Minister saw a role for her Department and where an inquiry was established which later proved to be deficient, will she agree that the fact that parents do not have any facility to make a complaint or have a complaint fairly and comprehensively investigated is an appalling indictment of the Department?  Will the Minister reconsider her position in the light of the Ardara experience and the fact that boards of management do not have the expertise at their disposal to investigate allegations of physical, sexual and verbal abuse of children?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>I absolutely refute the accusation made by Deputy Martin that we are abandoning children.  I refer the Deputy to the White Paper and the various changes proposed in it.  Changes are proposed which will involve the boards of management whose functions will be put on a statutory basis.  An <Col N="96" /> appeals mechanism will be established which will be available to parents through the education boards.  The remit of the Ombudsman will be extended to the education boards.</P>
      <P>To suggest that the expertise is not available to members of the board of management is to totally ignore the in-career investment being made by the Department of Education through the parents' council on the training of parents. I, as Minister for Education am not the owner of most of the schools, including the one to which the Deputy refers which is privately owned but publicly funded.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take the three questions together.</P>
      <P>Let me clarify that the edited version of the Competition Authority's interim report was published on 27 April 1995. The authority's full report contained information which was commercially sensitive and passages which were potentially defamatory and Deputies will appreciate why such passages were exised from the report.  I understand that the board of Irish Press Newspapers has decided to convene an extraordinary general meeting of the shareholders on 28 June 1995 for the purpose of appointing a liquidator to the company.  The board has also decided to convene a meeting of creditors pursuant to section 266 of the Companies Act, 1963, on the same date at a time and venue to be decided and announced.  This decision reflects the requirements of company law in the circumstances. There is no role for me as Minister in the process on which the company has embarked.</P>
      <P>The situation in which Irish Press Newspapers finds itself is essentially a business, one compounded by industrial relations problems.  The business situation is critical.  The Irish Press titles have been suffering radically declining circulation over a long period.  This decline can be seen from the following figures: comparing 1974 and 1994 figures the <i>Irish Press</i> then had a circulation of 92,200 which has dropped to 38,800.  At that time <i>The Sunday Press</i> had a circulation of 427,000 which has dropped to 156,000.  The <i>Evening Press</i> had a circulation of 154,000 which has dropped to 54,000.  The relaunch of the <i>Irish Press</i> in tabloid form in 1988 did not arrest the decline in circulation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The group has also had unhappy investment experiences with the Ingersol Group which have gone seriously <Col N="99" /> wrong.  This has led to protracted litigation. It has to be said that the recent Supreme Court judgment represented a further serious setback for the Irish Press Group.  The issue of costs and the consideration for the Ingersol shares will be dealt with by the Supreme Court on 14 June 1995.  However, the industrial relations record of the company over a long period has been far from good and the current difficulties are a further indication of that.</P>
    <P>Against this background it is extraordinary for the board of Irish Press Newspapers to highlight the absence of a decision on the interim report of the Competition Authority as a contributory factor to the situation the group now finds itself in.  It would have been more honest if the board, instead of seeking to blame others, had publicly recognised its failure to produce a commercial operation.  The new situation that has emerged from the company has meant that it would be inappropriate for me or the Government to finalise a decision on the Competition Authority's recommendation until the outcome of the company's actions become clearer.</P>
    <P>Let me make it perfectly clear that my decision on the alleged breaches in competition law has nothing to do with the current position in Irish Press Newspapers. Stripped of rhetoric yesterday's board statement is an admission of business failure.  The key issue for it is new and additional investment.  I am clear that this investment cannot come from the Irish Independent Group.  I stated that publicly in response to questions and I repeat it today.  If Irish Press Newspapers cannot seek investment from Independent Newspapers it must seek it elsewhere and what efforts have been made to do that?  I cannot answer that with ultimate certainty.  However, my understanding is that it has not sought proposals from other investors on the basis of its recently completed business plan. <Col N="100" /> Turning to the current industrial relations difficulties at Irish Press Newspapers I am disappointed that further progress in reaching a settlement to the dispute has not been made.  I am somewhat encouraged that direct talks took place yesterday between the NUJ and the Irish Press management.  This start needs to be built upon.  The labour relations institutions and, in particular, the Labour Court remain available to provide whatever assistance the parties might require.  In the circumstances I do not see any useful role that I could play directly in helping to resolve the dispute. I urge the management and unions involved, even at this late stage, to use the interim period to resolve their difficulties. I am deeply concerned at the overall situation facng Irish Press Newspapers and the consequences are very serious for plurality and diversity in the newspaper media but especially for the 600 employees.  I hope that solutions can be found to the business and industrial relations problems facing the company. The country would be a better place if a revitalised Irish Press Newspapers could have a viable, vibrant and commercial future.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for clarifying this because in effect that is his decision on the interim report of the Competition Authority, something that has been called for for some time. I am glad it is being raised in the Dáil where matters such as this should be fully discussed.  Is the Minister ruling out any further investment by the Independent Newspapers in <i>Irish Press</i> Newspapers in any shape or form?  I hope there will be a rescue package but the Independent Group is precluded from it.  That is, in effect, the Minister's decision on the interim Competition <Col N="101" /> Authority report.  I noted what the Minister said about the reasons given by Irish Press Newspapers yesterday for closing shop.  However, the Minister's delay and his dilatory performance in attending to the matter&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Will the Minister address the issue of what he can do to save the 600 jobs in the Irish Press Newspapers group of newspapers, including journalists and clerical and administrative jobs?  The Minister says it is a private matter and that the Government does not have a role.  However, as Minister for Enterprise and Employment, he has a duty and a right to make every effort to save the 600 jobs in a fine group of newspapers originally set up to be the voice of the voiceless.</P>

      <P>The issue of resolving the industrial relations problems lies with the Labour Court which is in adjourned session attempting to deal with these issues.  It is open to the parties at any stage to return to the Labour Court to deal with the problems they face.  The decision to go into liquidation is for the company alone and it proposes to have a meeting of members and a meeting of creditors to wind it up. Those issues which are critical to the resolution of the problems are for others to deal with and it is important that the two parties should avail of the facility of the Labour Court if they wish to find solutions to their problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have always said new investors must be found as a way of dealing with the problems in Irish Press Newspapers, and that has been my view at the outset.  I <Col N="102" /> believe it is also the view of Irish Press Newspapers that they need and wish to find other investors but they do not wish to see further control by Independent Newspapers.  It is crucial that we deal with this issue in a way that will introduce new investors and provide a viable future for the paper.</P>

      <P>I am confused.  The Minister says that it is and has always been his view that Irish Press Newspapers needs new investors.  I attended the Minister's forum a few weeks ago and it was not clear to me then that that was his view.  I got the impression the Minister was simply trying to buy time. Why has he delayed issuing his recommendations on the Competition Authority report?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>That report presented problems that had to be investigated with the parties concerned in the first instance.  I met those involved to seek information on how they would proceed from the point where they had received the Competition Authority report.  It was incumbent on me to hear the views of different parties.  I was at a point where I would have reached a decision on the situation as it presented.  The position has now radically changed with the decision by the Irish Press Newspapers to put its company, Irish Press Newspapers, into liquidation.  This requires further assessment by me as Minister of the implications of that decision.</P>

      <P>I am still awaiting what I hoped might be a reasonable reply to my question.  What I heard was a speech on how blameless the Minister is.  The Minister said he did not want to become involved.  However, given the precedent of his intervention in Packard, involving a trip to Coventry with the Minister of State, and the intervention in Digital when the previous Government went to the USA, will the Minister at least facilitate a visit by a very important delegation to Quebec to find out more about the approach of the credit unions <Col N="103" /> in that country when a French-speaking television station found itself under threat from the English-speaking media?  Will the Minister consider the potential of such an approach for Irish Press Newspapers?</P>

      <P>The question of putting together an investment package to provide a viable future for the <i>Irish Press</i> rests primarily with those involved, the new investors or Irish Press Newspapers as it currently exists. The newspaper is owned by shareholders, including a quarter shareholding by Independent Newspapers.  It is up to the shareholders to look to possible future scenarios.  I have no direct role in that.  I am sure the Deputies' suggestions as to new potential investors are worthy of consideration by those at the heart of this issue.</P>

      <P>The word &ldquo;harbour&rdquo; is an old fashioned term for larger ports such as those in Dublin, Cork, Waterford and Galway.  The smaller ports are dealt with in the Schedule and it would be more appropriate to call the Bill the Ports and Harbours Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from brief periods, I have been a member of the Wicklow Town Harbour Commission since 1967.  While this <Col N="207" /> port authority operated relatively successfully under the Harbour Act, 1976, nevertheless it was aware of the anachronisms arising under it.  In 1990 the then Minister for the Marine, Mr. Wilson, set up a harbours review group and many port authorities made representations to it over a period.  There was an urgency about the introduction of changes in the Harbours Act at that time given the problems experienced by larger ports, particularly Dublin port, where there had been a decline in activity.  There has also been loss of trade to the ports in Warrenpoint and Belfast which were set up on a commercial basis.  This review gave smaller ports such as Wicklow, Arklow and New Ross which had not suffered under the Act, an input to the changes required by the larger ports.  This legislation has been introduced mainly as a result of the need to make the larger ports more commercial.</P>
    <P>Even though we are an island nation, people working in harbours and ports have never had much political clout.  For example, those who work at sea were not even given a postal vote.  Thankfully, there has been a change in that attitude and the importance of ports has been recognised.  The airports have a much stronger lobby in this House than harbours and ports.  While there has been major investment in the development and extension of airports there has been a lack of investment in many ports. This Bill will encourage more investment in ports which may be less attractive than airports in many ways but which are much more important from a commercial point of view.</P>
    <P>I have concerns about the proposal to make smaller ports more commercial. The port in Wicklow which has the same turnover as a medium sized shop in my home town will have to change radically if it is to become more commercial. The only full-time employee in the port is the harbour-master secretary. The clerk, dockers and engineer, who has given us excellent advice over the years, work part-time.  The proposal that <Col N="208" /> this port will have to hire professional people gives rise to questions about whether this Bill is the proper vehicle for dealing with small commercial ports. I ask the Minister to take this point into consideration.</P>
    <P>The alternative is to hand responsibility for these ports over to local authorities. I have concerns about this course of action.  It is said that if something works one should not fix it.  This applies to small commercial ports which are of economic advantage to their areas and profitable companies in their own right.  If these port authorities which have been working very successfully have to become more commercial then they will incur major expenses in terms of administration costs, etc.  Alternatively, if responsibility for them is handed over to local authorities they will not receive the attention they deserve.  If small ports want to qualify for EU funding they will have no option but to become more commercial. Recently the Minister allocated substantial funding for the improvement of ports.  If small ports say they should not be in the same league as larger commercial ports then they may be deprived of EU funding.  If this is the case then they will have no option but to stay in the premier division in terms of ports.</P>
    <P>I am glad that ports will be funded with State equity as other semi-State companies such as Bord na Móna which did not get proper State equity at the outset experienced difficulties as a result of its high borrowings.  I am glad the Government has seen the light and decided to change the position of this company.  I am not sure how State equity will be invested in ports but I assume that the property, etc., owned by each of the companies will be converted into shares.  How does the Department of the Marine intend to evaluate these assets?  All ports have outgoing liabilities which will have to be taken over by the new companies.</P>
    <P>The local authorities have guaranteed overdrafts, etc., for work which had to be undertaken when there was no other capital available.  When Arklow was <Col N="209" /> devastated by a storm a couple of years ago Wicklow County Council, with its guarantee of overdraft facilities, ensured that its port continued to be operational.  What is the method used to take over liabilities and will Wicklow County Council continue to be liable for guarantees given in the past?</P>
    <P>In regard to the appointment of company directors, the former position was that local authorities, chambers of commerce, trade union interests, IBEC, livestock and shipping interests and ministerial nominees formed the boards which are being abolished.  In my experience and in the experience of ports throughout the country that worked well.  I have outlined the reasons the Bill is being introduced, to bring about a higher level of commercial activity within the port.  Nevertheless, I am concerned that changes are being made in that area.  In the first draft of this Bill, under the previous Government, local authority members would have been excluded from the boards.  I am pleased that position is rectified in the Bill and the acceptance by the Government that local authorities should be represented on such boards. Local authority members should be represented but I note they are not mentioned: the Bill merely says &ldquo;representation from local authorities&rdquo;.  I accept the competence of county managers, county secretaries, accountants and other employees in local authorities.  We made strong representations on behalf of continued representation of local authority members and I hope that is the intention in the Bill.  The Bill provides that three representatives from local authorities will be on these boards and that the authority taking over some of the smaller ports will comprise not more than 12 members.  Does the Minister intend to reduce that number to seven or nine as was the intention in the original Bill?  If that is the case will the local authority representation also be reduced for the smaller boards?</P>
    <P>I wish to draw to the attention of the Minister that in the case of many of the smaller ports &mdash; indeed probably in all <Col N="210" /> the ports &mdash; they are part of, and situated within one local authority area. Perhaps I can use the example I know best, Wicklow port and Arklow port which are within Arklow and Wicklow urban areas; they have had two representatives from the county and urban councils.  It was necessary that the senior authority, Wicklow County Council, because of the guarantees should have had representation from the county council on it.  I hope that directors will be members of local authorities and that there will be continued representation from county and urban councils.  For small authorities the remainder of the directors will be appointed by the Minister. The Bill provides that where the number of permanent employees is fewer than 50 one director will be appointed in consultation with the trade union movement.  The remainder will come from the professional and business classes and will be appointed by the Minister.</P>
    <P>I have experience over the years of Ministers appointing directors or members of harbour boards.  It is winner take all depending on what parties are in Government.  If this Bill remains in force for 50 years, like the previous Act, the luck of the beneficiaries will depend on what party or parties, is in Government. That worries me.  If a Member of one or two political parties has its directors drawn from their parties it will not be good for the operation of these authorities. I recall that on one occasion the Minister's nominee was a trade union member when 40 dockers were ignored by the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union.  They had to work and operate in the port and were ignored in favour of a member who represented office workers.  The particular member was not from the local area.  I ask the Minister to ensure fair representation for professionals on boards from the area.</P>
    <P>I regret the provision in the Bill that TDs and Senators &mdash; I am not too concerned about MEPs because they are rarely here &mdash; will be excluded.  I say that from a personal point of view <Col N="211" /> because I have now served almost 30 years on a harbour authority and I think my service time was useful to that board.  The state of that board reflects the fact that I could not make immediate representation to the Minister when a problem arose.</P>
    <P>I will take the opportunity, if I am permitted by one of my colleagues, to attend the Select Committee on Enterprise and Employment, to which I expect this Bill will be referred.  The exclusion of vested interests is reasonable; some of the people who have the most knowledge and have been beneficiaries of ports throughout the years have, obviously, had vested interests.  I would have thought it sufficient, where a vested interest was brought to the attention of a board, that a director who had such an interest would be excluded. I regret that people who have worked tirelessly in a particular job and have provided employment, built up the port and have the knowledge will be excluded from the board while people who perhaps have no knowledge have a possibility of being made directors.  The Minister did not refer to gender quota but I am sure this will apply also to directors of the board.</P>
    <P>We have been informed that the chief executive will be chosen by the Minister but we have been given no indication of what professional knowledge he would need to have of ports.  Will he be required to have a master's ticket or to have a knowledge of the sea?  Will he be required, as under the present Act, to have expertise in this area?</P>
    <P>I hope I will have the opportunity to contribute on Committee Stage as I have a direct interest in this area and, perhaps, a knowledge which other Members may not have.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanKenneally" hpid="Mr. Kenneally Mr. Kenneally">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenneally</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on this Bill.  It has been said that Ireland will suffer within the context of the European Union.  With the advent of the channel tunnel we will end up being <Col N="212" /> cut off by road from our European partners. Because of that I broadly welcome the introduction of the Harbours Bill, 1995, although I have reservations which I will outline in my address.</P>
      <P>Ireland is an island nation and dependent on foreign trade.  A crucial part of our prosperity is dependent on the operation of our sea ports which handle approximately 80 per cent of imports and exports.  They also handle a significant amount of our tourist traffic.  One of the first things that strikes me about the Bill is the influence of the Minister for Finance.  Throughout, there are references to various matters which are subject to the agreement of the Minister for Finance, who seems to have more influence than the Minister for the Marine.  Indeed he may even have too much power.</P>
      <P>Under section 11 the new commercial semi-State companies can enter into arrangements with third parties.  This is welcome but it may go beyond the scope of what the Minister intends. Under this legislation the board of any one of these companies will have the power to effectively transfer responsibility for the operation of a port to a company operating in the private sector. This may not necessarily be a bad move but I assume this was not envisaged by the Minister in framing the legislation. If a particular board decides to enter into an arrangement with commercial interests it is possible that the harbour authority will have only one employee, its chief executive.</P>
      <P>Under section 15 all leases and contracts for the sale of land will be subject to ministerial consent subject to an exemption by the Minister under subsection (1) (c).  Is this unnecessarily restrictive?  If the intention is to give these companies more commercial freedom they should not have to run to the Minister each time they want to do something in this respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While section 15 is restrictive the power given in the following section to compulsorily acquire land for portal development is to be welcomed.  Without this power the growth of many ports <Col N="213" /> could easily be stunted.  While local authorities currently have the power to issue a CPO, port authorities do not.  It is possible that a local authority may not get on too well with a port authority for whatever reason.  Accordingly, this section is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>The requirements as regards borrowing by a company cause some concern. Under the legislation the Minister's consent will be required before money can be borrowed for capital purposes. It is also stipulated that such borrowings may not exceed 50 per cent of the value of the company's assets which are treated as fixed assets for accounting purposes.  Within this limit the company should have freedom to act subject to the normal commercial constraints imposed by a lender.  The basis of the valuation of these assets should also be taken into consideration.  This has not been specified.  I presume the Minister will eventually set down the basis of calculation. Whatever basis is used it should be the same for all companies. The method of calculating depreciation should also be uniform whether it be the reducing balance method or the straight line method.</P>
    <P>I am surprised at the content of section 27 which deals with the preparation of a cash flow statement.  This is not required under the Companies Act. Why will such a statement be required for port companies?  A sources and application of funds statement will be prepared in accordance with the Companies Act.  This should suffice.</P>
    <P>On the composition of the boards of the new companies, I broadly agree with Deputy Kavanagh.  The Murphy report of the review group on commercial harbours and pilotage and policy recommended that the board of directors of each of the new port companies should have seven members including an employee representative and the chief executive.  I do not agree with this recommendation and I am glad it is not being acted upon since the review group sought to exclude public representatives from the board.  This is wrong.  We live in a democracy and at the end of the <Col N="214" /> day public representatives are the only people directly accountable to the general public.  Over a period the powers and influence of democratically elected public representatives have been eroded.  This is not a healthy development.</P>
    <P>While I am glad there is a reference to nominees from the local authorities it is not stated specifically in the legislation that it must be an elected representative. As the legislation now stands, this could be a paid official.  In addition, the Minister will only be able to appoint three persons nominated by the prescribed local authority.  I assume there can be more than one prescribed local authority to be consulted in respect of each board.  I hope the Minister will note the views being expressed that a member of the local authority rather than a nominee of the local authority should be appointed as a member of the board.</P>
    <P>On the question of prescribed local authorities, I assume in some ports more than one local authority will be represented on the harbour authority. At present four nominating bodies, Waterford Corporation, Waterford County Council, Kilkenny County Council and Tipperary South Riding County Council, are represented on Waterford Harbour Commissioners. The Minister will have to decide which of these bodies will no longer have a role to play in portal activity in Waterford harbour.</P>
    <P>On the question of ministerial nominations, in making appointments the Minister will have to bear commercial criteria in mind.  Will the directors come from the local community or can we expect a rash of appointees from the Dublin area?  This would place additional costs on any State board.</P>
    <P>I am conscious of the need for gender balance.  If the chief executive, the worker director and the three local authority nominees are all male, five of the remaining seven directors to be appointed by the Minister will have to be women to achieve the 40 per cent minimum set down by the Government. <Col N="215" /> I hope the Minister will be able to find the people with the necessary commercial experience to achieve this objective.</P>
    <P>I am surprised that the Bill does not include a requirement that directors should have commercial expertise.  Perhaps the most important requirement will be membership of either Fine Gael, the Labour Party or Democratic Left.</P>
    <P>I note the requirements as regards worker directors.  Most of the 12 harbour authorities will have less than 30 employees.  As a consequence there will be no worker director on these boards. The Minister will appoint someone, not necessarily an employee, to represent the interests of the workers.  This is not satisfactory.</P>
    <P>Section 34 raises an interesting point about the position of a member of staff elected to either House of the Oireachtas or the European Parliament. It stipulates that such an employee can be seconded to the board while serving as a member of any of these bodies. However, time served in parliament will not count for pension purposes.  Does this apply to other semi-State companies? I understand that the pension entitlements of teachers for instance are not affected while they are Members of this House.  This appears to be discrimination against members of harbour boards.  Members of this House who are also members of harbour authorities and have accumulated vast experience are also being discriminated against.</P>
    <P>The question of pensions needs to be examined closely.  Will arrangements be made similar to those made for employees of Telecom Éireann or will the port authorities have to fund any shortfall?  As things stand, it seems that the liabilities will have to be calculated on vesting day and funds transferred to pension trustees.  The same will apply in respect of liabilities as regards current employees.  If this interpretation is correct Waterford, for example, will have to provide a sum of £5 million which it does not have while the figure for Dublin will be close to £50 million.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="216" /> An unnecessary attempt is being made in this Bill to control the level of harbour charges.  Competition should be allowed to dictate the level of charges above the basic minimum.  A stipulation should be included, however, in relation to the minimum level that might be imposed as the larger, more powerful ports will be in a position to attract traffic away from smaller ports by means of below cost selling.  This should be actively discouraged.  At present Waterford harbour is taking business from Cork harbour by attracting the larger banana boats from South America and so on.  If Cork harbour decides to sell below cost it will be able to attract this business once more.  That should be actively discouraged on the ground that it is unfair.</P>
    <P>The Bill does not refer to rates. Under existing legislation harbour boards are exempt or partly exempt because they are in public ownership for a public purpose.  As a semi-State company they will be in public ownership but not for a public purpose and therefore it is likely they will be subject to full rates on all properties including wharfs.  It is calculated that at present throughput this will put an additional cost of up to 40p for each TEU unit on all container traffic in Waterford. Obviously this increased cost will be passed on to the customer.  I am not aware of the position in Northern Ireland &mdash; I did not have a chance to check it out &mdash; but if its ports are exempt from rates it will have an unfair advantage over ports in the southern part of the country.  This matter needs to be seriously considered.</P>
    <P>This legislation will put certain additional costs on ports.  Initial costs will include the cost of valuation of assets for transfer to the new companies and also the cost of incorporating these companies.  There will be additional annual costs such as the cost of preparation of a report to the Minister under section 28, the cost of a performance audit under section 29, rates, corporation tax and a dividend to the Minister. <Col N="217" /> It is obviously intended that the companies will be liable to corporation tax. The tax regime is important in terms of whether the new companies will be liable at a 10 per cent or 38 per cent rate of corporation tax.  At present the 10 per cent rate applies to ship repairs and qualifying shipping activities.  It also applies to Irish ships working as supply vessels for offshore oil installations.  It has been suggested that the existing exemption for harbour authorities in section 343 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, will be retained.  Perhaps the Minister will clarify the taxation system when replying.</P>
    <P>There are recommendations on pilotage in various harbour areas.  The present position is that basically pilots are self-employed.  Under the new legislation they will perhaps opt to become employees of the various commercial semi-State companies because of the additional benefits that might confer on them.  There are also pension difficulties involved and I am sure the Minister will address that matter.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the Bill is to make ports more commercial and cost effective and to give them commercial freedom. While it sets out to do this, there are so many restrictions on borrowing, commercial leases, sale and purchase of property, harbour rate changes and the general powers given to the Minister under section 44 that the thrust of the legislation seems to negate the underlying principles set out in the review committee report.  The present harbour boards are <i>de facto</i> representational boards.  What was expected were commercial boards for a commercial business but what we are getting is a repeat of representational boards.  The proposed structure in terms of local authority members, trade union members and ministerial gender nominations without an obligation to have regard to commercial representation will result in a reconstituted representational board undoubtedly weakened by the method of appointment.  It is my information that nobody in stevedoring or port industries will be appointed to the <Col N="218" /> boards.  Under the last Government it was policy to appoint to the boards people involved in the ports industry, but unfortunately this Bill does not refer to that matter.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister when considering Committee Stage will bear in mind the many points I have raised in order that an enhanced Harbour Bill will be enacted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMulvihill" hpid="Mr. Mulvihill Mr. Mulvihill">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulvihill</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to contribute to this important Bill.  As a member of the Cork Harbour Commissioners I am very interested in any new legislation to improve the operation of ports, particularly Cork Harbour which is one of the finest natural harbours in the world and is a prime area for job creation.  Up to recently Verolme Cork Dockyard built some of the finest ships and bulk carriers in the world but due to the recent slump in shipping this facility ceased to operate, with the loss of hundreds of jobs.  A previous Fianna Fáil Government sold this fine facility to a foreign company with the promise of 300 or 400 jobs four years down the road, but none of these has been delivered.</P>
      <P>There is also the Ringaskiddy roll-on roll-off berth, a very fine facility for tourist traffic which has increased each year since it was first opened.  The future looks bright in terms of tourism traffic in the Cork harbour area.  There is a cruise berthing facility in Cobh, beside the Queenstown Heritage Centre, which is expected to cater for 100,000 visitors this year.  Cork Harbour Commissioners have invested a great deal of money in upgrading the berthing facility at the deep water quay in Cobh. We must maintain the highest safety standards in Cork Harbour and indeed all our harbours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Cork is the centre of the chemical industry.  A large number of vessels transfer chemicals in and out of Cork Harbour and therefore we need to mantain a very high safety standard at all times.  Pilots play a big part in maintaining the high level of safety required and they should be more involved in <Col N="219" /> drawing up safety standards for ports.  In the Murphy report Cork Harbour is designated specifically as a chemical industry harbour.  The number of dangerous cargoes carried through the harbour has increased significantly.  Inside the harbour is the only oil refinery in Ireland, which also contributes greatly to the number of dangerous cargoes continually traversing Cork Harbour and on the river Lee to Cork city.  The role of pilots is important in any port structure and in the case of Cork Harbour their importance cannot be over-emphasised.  The continuing presence of pilots on vessels carrying dangerous cargoes is absolutely essential.  The Murphy Report on Commercial Harbours and Pilotage Policy and Legislation recommends that PECs, pilot exemption certificates, should not be granted to masters of vessels which carry dangerous cargoes.</P>
    <P>It is proposed that the three local authorities in the Cork Harbour area will have representatives on the new board.  There is slight confusion about this matter because there is in existence Cobh Urban District Council, Cork County Council, Cork Corporation and also Passage Town Commissioners.  Perhaps the Minister will clarify whether there will be one representative from each local authority or whether three members will be nominated from one authority.</P>
    <P>The oil refinery is being upgraded with a massive investment by the State. We hope for an oil find off our coastline, and the oil could be refined in Cork Harbour at Whitegate oil refinery.  The Cork Harbour Board, an example to the country has been run very efficiently and profitably by the present board for a number of years under the directorship of Pat Keenan its Chief Executive. It is very disappointing that changes are proposed at board level, particularly in regard to representation by TDs.  As a TD who represents Cork County Council on the board it will be very disheartening for me to have to vacate my position on it.  I would ask the Minister to reconsider this matter <Col N="220" /> because it is vital that TDs represent public bodies.</P>
    <P>The naval base is situated at Haulbowline in Cork Harbour.  Many promises were made down the years that extra ships would be made available. That would increase the traffic in Cork Harbour.</P>
    <P>In recent months there was much publicity about the use of the Cork coastline for the importation of drugs.  I am sure the new representative body which the Minister for Justice is about to establish will effectively tackle the drugs problem.  It is vital that ports are properly policed.  The pilots in Cork Harbour are playing a vital role in terms of supplying information on the movement of ships in the area.  Having regard to the chemical industry based close to Cork Harbour it is essential that such pilots are retained on ships.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimKemmy" hpid="Mr. Kemmy Mr. Kemmy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kemmy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this long awaited Bill which had many false starts.  I welcome the improvements and efficiencies to which its provisions will give rise.  The main provision which sets out the establishment of 12 State commercial companies is not necessarily a bad one.  The same criteria that apply to any other economic activity must be applied to our ports and harbours.  Harbours and ports by their nature are not museums but places of industry and must be judged by the same economic criteria.  My party and I are not afraid of such commercial activity and the Bill would be lacking an essential element if it was not based on economic and commercial criteria.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill may contain too many areas which will necessitate referral back to the Minister.  I would not like too many impediments and handicaps put in the way of the commercial operation of ports and harbours.  Activities which do not require ministerial decision should not be referred to the Minister.  Ports and harbours should be given a certain degree of autonomy.  If they are operating efficiently they should be encouraged and unnecessary red tape <Col N="221" /> and bureaucracy should not be put in the way of their development.</P>
    <P>I am critical of the proposed names of some of the new harbour authorities.  In the Limerick and Shannon area Shannon Port Company is the name that will be given to the new authority.  That name is ambiguous because the word &ldquo;Shannon&rdquo; forms part of the name of many other companies, such as, the Shannon Development Company.  It is confusing to call a harbour authority the Shannon Port Company and clarity is required regarding its name.  A more appropriate name for the authority would be the Shannon Estuary Authority or the Shannon Estuary Administration which would better define the area of the authority than the title Shannon Port Company, which is too loose, ambiguous and confusing.  I ask the Minister to consider this matter as I do not make this criticism for narrow reasons.  Coming from that area, I consider the name assigned to that authority is inappropriate and one which specifies what the authority is would be more appropriate.  That is a minor but important point.</P>
    <P>As we have a myriad small ports, I support the concept of a central authority to manage areas like Cork Harbour or the Shannon Estuary.  It is inefficient and nonsensical for a potential industrialist, a representative of a foreign company or a foreign government official to communicate with various port authorities when it would be more efficient to communicate with one central port authority.  It is welcome that this will be achieved to some degree in the Shannon Estuary, but it is nonsense to attempt to develop our harbours and estuaries without establishing a central authority to administer their activities. In the past Limerick Harbour Commissioners administered most of that area well and gave a good account of their stewardship.  I favour good central administration and efficiency at all levels not merely regarding harbour activities, but also in the administration of companies and harbour authorities.</P>
    <P>I also favour good industrial relations <Col N="222" /> and efficient work practices, not only in my area of Limerick and Shannon but throughout the country.  In a previous incarnation the Ceann Comhairle worked as a trade union official &mdash; I often worked with him &mdash; and he has considerable knowledge of the Shannon Estuary area.  It is necessary to consider some of the earlier points about work practices and casual labour employed in ports.  I am much older than the Minister of State, but I remember the inhuman treatment in the daily employment of casual labour on the docks in Limerick.  We recall <i>Strumpet City</i> by James Plunkett, a trade union official and member of the Old Workers Union of Ireland who saw that at first hand.  It was degrading and inhuman that some men, most of whom were married, had to go to the docks daily to be employed by stevedores.  A small number were given employment and the rest were told to go away.  Dockers are a tightly knit community.  I also come from a closely knit community of stonemasons, but it is not as closely knit as that of the dockers.  A cliché was often used in Limerick long ago that unless one's father was a docker one could not be a docker.  One could be a doctor, but very few sons of dockers became doctors. One had to be the son of a docker to get employment on the docks and those who were not were regarded as casual labour and subject to daily hire, although many did not get work.  It was most degrading that dockers in Limerick were paid on a daily basis.  To some extent that practice still operates at Foynes Harbour.</P>
    <P>There are three types of labour, permanent workers, semi-permanent workers who work on a casual basis and, when the port is busy, a third group of workers who do not have employment rights or security of tenure are hired. Those casual workers encounter all types of ambiguous difficulties in their dealings with the Department of Social Welfare.  Their income may peak when on overtime for a short period, but their earnings are spread over a period for the purposes of social welfare benefits. <Col N="223" /> I ask the Minister to consider the decasualisation of labour in harbours and Shannon Estuary to give the workforce stability through the employment of a certain number of workers.</P>
    <P>At one time there were hundreds of dockers working on the water front in Limerick, but how many dockers are working there today?  There are eight port employees, who are no longer called dockers.  Many of them drive highly mechanised cranes and other machines around the port.  Containerisation is a feature of the modern world and more efficient work practices.  I do not object to that advance as the old system was inhuman and we cannot turn our face against progress.  I ask the Minister to consider addressing some of those practices in the Foynes area.</P>
    <P>I was surprised to hear Deputy Kenneally chide the Minister about placing appointees on boards, as if the Deputy had arrived from Mars yesterday.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil more than any other party has ruled in this country since the State was founded.  We have heard the cliché about all things being equal, but putting that aside, his party was ruthless in filling posts.  I will not take any lectures or homilies from Deputy Kenneally or anybody else in that regard.  As far as possible I would attempt to bring efficiency into all aspects of public life. In the past too many State boards and companies were staffed with appointees of his party's persuasion and did not give a good account of their stewardship. It is important that people with ability are appointed to such positions. I hope a new era of openness and transparency will dawn when party hacks are not put into important positions.  Otherwise the thrust and purpose of the Bill will be negatived.</P>
    <P>Often I travel from Limerick to Dublin by train and admire the many Victorian stone buildings in stations on the way.  Some buildings, unfortunately, have been dismantled.  Many of our docks comprise stone buildings, embankments and boundary walls and <Col N="224" /> it would be tragic if, following the enactment of this Bill, they were levelled to the ground by bulldozers and the stone dumped.  Even though they were built under a British Administration they are good buildings and should be retained. There should be a provision in the Bill to ensure that local authorities, harbour commissioners and port authorities respect the heritage with which they have been entrusted.  We should not throw the baby out with the bath water. There are many fine structures at our harbours and ports and members of my family worked on some of them.  They should be incorporated into modern buildings or if they must be knocked down the stone should be recycled.</P>
    <P>Limerick city straddles Clare and Kerry and the glorious River Shannon forms into a V at Limerick where the Danes were able to ford the Shannon. The headquarters of the Shannon Port Company should be set up in Limerick city.  It would not make sense to move the headquarters of the Cork harbour company to Ringaskiddy or some other small port in County Cork.  Limerick city is the natural location for the headquarters of the Shannon Port Company. We can learn from the way other countries have tackled difficulties in adjusting to modern mechanisms for loading and unloading ships at ports.</P>
    <P>Members referred to the role of pilots, a job which was frequently passed down from father to son.  In general pilots have given a good account of their stewardship.  Under earlier legislation they were self employed and worked for the good of ports and harbours, but the contents of their pension scheme would baffle Einstein.  They should be incorporated into a proper pension scheme.  They carry out very important work often in dangerous waters in the Shannon Estuary and their service to the community should not be ignored.  Many seamen and pilots were killed during the Second World War. Seamen employed by the Limerick steamship company gave their lives when travelling across dangerous seas to bring essential goods to this and other <Col N="225" /> countries.  While pilots are not necessary for all craft, they are essential in the Shannon Estuary and, therefore, should be incorporated in the Bill under the role of the Shannon Port Company.</P>
    <P>The role of the port is changing.  Ships can be loaded and unloaded at a much faster rate and as a result there are many port structures for which harbour commissioners and others do not have a use.  Docks all over the world have a bad reputation because of the grimy nature of industry located there and the ladies of the night that frequent those areas.  I am aware that many people do not wish to frequent pubs in the docks area at night out of fear of getting a bad reputation, but that is changing.  People have invested money in urban renewal and revitalised those areas.  There has been a tremendous upsurge in urban renewal in Limerick harbour and port.  I would like to see more people living in those areas because offices and buildings that are locked up at night are often an invitation to criminals.  It is my ambition to see the harbour and port in Limerick revitalised so that more people can live in the area.</P>
    <P>Limerick Harbour Commissioners and Limerick Corporation have co-operated to undertake refurbishing and renewing Limerick city.  Many commercial companies, including large oil companies, have located there and many new houses have been built.  The area has taken on a new character and should be used as a prototype for other harbours and ports.  We should not write off an area because of old-fashioned and grimy buildings.  With an enlightened urban renewal programme, good design and modern building materials many ports can play an important role in the life of the towns and cities surrounding them and commerical business can prosper side by side with large shipping companies.  Limerick harbour and port are good examples.</P>
    <P>The Bill will herald many charges in the months and years ahead, perhaps we can bring back the glory to our ports and harbours.</P>

      <P>As chairman of the New Ross Harbour Commissioners I welcome the Bill.  Deputy Kemmy stated that many political appointments were made by my party, suggesting that none would dare be made by his.  It is regrettable he has left the House.  I was not appointed to the chairmanship of New Ross Harbour Commissioners because I was a member of a particular political party but because I had easy access to Ministers and the people who make decisions.  That was the sole reason I was appointed to the position. I am also happy that the Minister of State, Deputy Gilmore, came to New Ross to inform us that we had been successful in our application.  I had met him on many previous occasions and found him extremely courteous.  I take this opportunity to thank all involved in securing those moneys, not least the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Howlin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While generally accepting and commending the Bill to the House, I have particular difficulty with barring MEPs, Senators and TDs from membership of the new port companies.  I was a member of my local harbour board, and had access to departmental officers, which might prove more difficult for the members of the new port companies.  I want the option retained of allowing membership to public representatives to whom I referred.  While accepting that constitutes Government policy, public representatives are demeaned by debarring themselves from membership.  That takes me back to what Deputy Deasy said last week &mdash; that he feels sometimes he is little better than voting fodder for the Government.  This demeaning of ourselves must be addressed, not to protect ourselves but for the overall benefit of our ports.  It amounts more or less to a vote of no <Col N="227" /> confidence in ourselves from which we should be divorced.  I have particular difficulty in accepting that proposal.</P>
    <P>The main thrust of the provisions of this Bill is the creation of a system of local control of our principal commercial ports.  The change from the present system, under which a large measure of control is vested in the Minister for the Marine, is welcome and long overdue. We must remember that ports operate within a commercial environment and therefore it is fitting that their management is also conducted commercially. The ability of the proposed port companies to take speedy decisions without reference to the Minister is a key, welcome feature of this Bill.  My experience of having served as chairman and member of my local harbour board adequately demonstrated that, for the simplest project, we had to consult the Minister and his officials whose reaction was often much slower than we might have wished.  I do not offer that as a criticism of the Minister or his officials but as an example of a problem that has existed for too long.  Therefore, the removal of this element of bureaucracy will be beneficial overall.</P>
    <P>The number of directors of the boards of the new port companies may amount to 12 in total.  In the case of New Ross, that would amount to one fewer than its current membership.  In the case of smaller ports, like New Ross and others, it is felt that a membership of between seven and nine, proposed in the 1992 review of commercial harbours, would be more appropriate.  Will the Minister seriously consider that number in the case of smaller ports?</P>
    <P>The arrangements for the transfer of staff of current harbour boards appears to be reasonable, affording employees adequate protection which I welcome.  I am sure the Minister of State agrees that our minimal staff in New Ross are of excellent calibre capable of undertaking the maximum amount of work.  Recent media reports of a possible State underwriting of the pension liabilities of some harbour boards are <Col N="228" /> disturbing since such action would militate against such ports, like ours in New Ross which has made arrangements to meet its future pension liabilities in full. The Minister of State might comment on where we stand <i>vis-á-vis</i> the new proposals.</P>
    <P>Section 22 deals with the payment of dividends.  Heretofore any surplus generated within a port was retained to fund its further development.  By and large, port developments has been funded by individual port authorities without significant State aid, which was the case also in New Ross up to quite recently.  We welcome the recent input of the Minister of State since we are about to engage in major redevelopment. The Bill proposes that the Minister will become the sole shareholder in all the new port companies and may collect dividends from them.  The current programme of investment in ports, under the Operational Programme on Transport 1994-99, has, as a primary objective, a reduction in port costs of 15 per cent.  The Minister of State must agree that this aim is at variance with the Minister's intention to collect dividends from the proposed port companies, on which he might also comment.</P>
    <P>Section 43 deals with the transfer functions from one company to another. While the level of competition between ports is likely to increase after the Bill's enactment, this should benefit our economy through lower port costs achieved by greater efficiency and economies of scale, the real purpose of the Bill.  In time it is possible that some existing ports might be amalgamated, leading to a reduction in traffic through certain ports.</P>
    <P>Anybody who has had any dealings with ports will have pilotage and the activities of pilots high on their agenda. The provisions of the pilotage service is governed by the Pilotage Act, 1913.  It will clearly be seen it is time that this legislation was updated, which is certainly welcomed by my local harbour board.</P>
    <P>Section 56 deals with the employment status of pilots, addressing their current <Col N="229" /> vague status, by offering the new port companies the option of employing pilots as staff members or licensing them as self-employed contractors.  This has been a bone of contention in New Ross and in all other ports for some time past whereby, whenever it suited them, pilots were deemed to be self-employed and, whenever it did not suit them, were deemed to be staff members, leading to a considerable predicament in our case and others.</P>
    <P>Section 59 deals with the pilotage agreement between company and licensed pilots.  Whenever a company decides to provide pilotage services by means of self-employed, licensed pilots, it must conclude an agreement with them concerning, <i>inter alia</i>, the number of licensed pilots, the collection and recovery of pilotage charges, superannuation benefits and administrative duties.  The Bill appears to imply that, subject to deduction for administrative expenses and other lawful deductions, the income from pilotage charges must be disbursed to the pilots.  That constitutes a fundamental, unwise change from the position whereby income from such pilotage services is deemed to be the revenue of the pilotage authority, disbursed as the pilotage authority deems appropriate and that is how this should remain.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the Bill in regard to the payment of the port company in respect of expenses incurred in administering the pilotage service are welcome. At present, harbour authorities are unable to recover these costs from the pilotage authority.  Section 60 proposes that each port company shall decide the circumstances in which the pilotage will be compulsory within the pilotage district and shall make by-laws accordingly. It is also proposed that the Minister will have the power to give a direction to a port company in regard to the circumstances in which the pilotage will be compulsory.</P>
    <P>Vessels bound to and from New Ross pass through the Waterford pilotage district. At present, these vessels are required to avail of the services of a <Col N="230" /> Waterford pilot until they reach the River Barrow at which time they take on a pilot employed by the New Ross Harbour Commissioners.  The New Ross Harbour Commissioners believe that this situation is based on an incorrect interpretation of the provisions of the Pilotage Act, 1913.  Some discussions have taken place with Waterford Harbour Commissioners but the problem is currently unresolved.</P>
    <P>The payment of two pilotage dues puts our port at a tremendous disadvantage. The need to avail of the services of both Waterford and New Ross increases our overall costs and places us at a competitive disadvantage.  This may seem a minor issue but because we are now facing stronger competition we must pare our costs as much as possible.  If this Act has been incorrectly interpreted, the Minister can help to put matters right.</P>
    <P>In these circumstances the provisions of the Bill give one port company undue influence over the trading position of another neighbouring port.  It is felt that the issue of compulsory pilotage should be determined on the basis of a set of objective criteria and should not be left to an individual port company to determine.</P>
    <P>I wish to comment briefly on the importance of the port of New Ross to the economy.  It has long been accepted that the port of New Ross is the hub of our economy.  Even for social reasons it is vital that New Ross retains or increases its present status.  Ships of 4,500 tonnes currently pass through the port of New Ross.  We want to be in a position to compete in the new climate where commercial transport, be it by road, sea or air, is on the increase.  We must retain our competitive position.</P>
    <P>I intended referring to the ports of Rosslare and Waterford but I promised to share my time with Deputy Sargent. In considering the position of these new port companies, the problem of the illegal importation of drugs must be addressed.  We are all familiar with this problem which affects our ports in the south east and throughout the country. I believe that prevention is better than <Col N="231" /> cure in dealing with this problem.  The Customs and Excise dog known as &ldquo;Jake&rdquo;, which detected approximately £6 million worth of drugs in the port of Rosslare in a seven-month period, has highlighted this whole issue.  I understand that only 10 per cent of drugs illegally imported here are detected by Customs officials.  Any increase in that figure would have an enormous impact on this area and I urge the Minister to ensure that some provision is included in the Bill to address this problem.</P>

      <P>The debate on this Bill provides us with a welcome opportunity to discuss what has been a long neglected area, namely, our ports and harbours.  Like our railways, they were built to last and, with minimum maintenance, they would last but the neglect of our ports and harbours has put them to the test in this regard.</P>
      <P>Part V of the Bill is headed &ldquo;Miscellaneous&rdquo; and deals with issues which I consider to be quite scandalous.  They involve the harbour areas of Balbriggan and Skerries, in my constituency.  These areas have been the responsibility of Dublin Port for many years and, as a result, the sense of pride felt by people living in these areas has foundered greatly due to their neglect by that authority. Deputy Byrne referred to the need for people to be in touch with Ministers but it underlines the sense of helplessness and alienation felt by local communities when they do not have a direct line to the authority and are required to ask Dáil Deputies to make representations on their behalf.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to refer to six specific problems affecting both Skerries and Balbriggan. A lighthouse was electrified in Balbriggan in 1961, the glass top of which was never restored.  That has been an eyesore since that time and highlights the utter neglect of that harbour.  Dublin Port claimed that safety was assured at all times during necessary works but on an occasion when there was a breach of <Col N="232" /> the stone wall, the authority workers simply filled it in with concrete.  Sewage, which is pumped continuously into the harbour, now has another outfall but it remains an affront to users of the harbour. Dredging of the harbour has been completely neglected despite the fact that with the benefits of modern technology such work could be carried out far more easily than in the past.  There is a lack of dumping facilities in the harbour. There is nowhere to dump refuse and the result is further pollution at sea in the vicinity of the harbour.  There are no demarcation lines between the amenity area and the working area in the harbour.  The effect is that any amenity work carried out is quickly destroyed by people working in the harbour area.  It is difficult to distinguish the amenity area from the working area.</P>
    <P>I raised this issue with the Minister of State, Deputy Coveney, and I said at that time that I welcome the allocation of funding to Dublin Port.  I reminded the then Minister that Dublin Port's responsibilities extended further than Dublin city and that capital investment would put the two harbours in question on a footing which would allow the local authority to be responsible custodians of them.  It is senseless to transfer responsibility for derelict harbours to a local authority which basically has a parks department and is often hard pressed to stick a few flowers in the ground.</P>
    <P>Section 52 provides for a ban on nuclear cargoes in harbours.  I hope the Minister is aware of the decision of the House of Commons select committee to transport nuclear shipments, particularly Trident and Polaris missiles over the Irish sea instead of over land.  I urge the Minister to extend the ban to the Irish sea so that we are not subjected monthly to the threat from unstable warheads being transported near our harbours and ports.  Carriers of nuclear warheads may not want to come into our harbours but they come as near as makes no difference should an accident occur on board.  This issue will have to be addressed by the Department of the <Col N="233" /> Marine and the Department of Foreign Affairs.  I urge the Minister to ensure it is not left on the long finger because the transportation of such cargoes is now more threatening.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>It is almost 50 years since similar legislation was enacted and it is time we revise it, taking cognisance of what is happening in our ports.  I welcome the Minister of State to the Chamber and acknowledge his recent visit to Foynes Harbour.  Following his visit the then Minister for the Marine, Deputy Hugh Coveney, allocated over £5 million towards the development of Foynes Harbour to provide new berthage and a good storage facility.  It is significant that Foynes Harbour has been there since 1890 and when one considers the £1.3 million of State investment in the last 100 years it is a significant milestone achievement that this Government could fund it to the extent required.</P>
      <P>I was delighted to bring the members of Foynes Harbour Board to meet Deputy Coveney.  Although we had a long term development plan for the harbour our immediate priority was to minimise delays which were occurring at the port by increasing berthage.  It was anticipated that it would cost £8 million and we were absolutely thrilled when half of that came from the Government. I acknowledge what the Government has done which is very much appreciated in Foynes and I hope it will signal further advances at Foynes Harbour in increased tonnage.</P>
      <P>I was a member of Foynes Harbour for ten years but I resigned recently because with the increasing workload in the Dáil, committees and as a member of the county council I found I could not give it the amount of time necessary.  I appreciate why comments have been made on precluding Senators, Deputies and MEPs from serving on these boards.  We all admit that our workload in Leinster House has expanded considerably.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There were nine members on the Foynes Harbour Board and I endorse <Col N="234" /> Deputy Hugh Byrne's comment that this is the ideal balance for a port of that size, but it is being increased to 12.  I concede that having 29 representatives on Limerick Harbour Board makes it totally unwieldy and is not compatible with what is happening with regard to boards of directors.  Deputy Kenneally commented that the membership of the boards would be from Democratic Left, Labour and Fine Gael but I would like to think when the Minister nominates members to the boards he will take cognisance of the prevailing situation and advance the interests of the port and that businessmen who would inject their enthusiasm would contribute towards the advancement of the port.  I would like to see a degree of balance in the local authority representation because the local authority members represent the local community and can empathise with it, but they do not necessarily have a commercial interest in the port.  In the past it was mainly shipping and stevedoring interests that were represented on the board and it could be said that they would have an interest in developing the port. However, from my ten years experience, regardless of whether a board member had a shipping or local authority background his ultimate objective was the advancement of the port.</P>
    <P>There has been much discussion on piloting ships.  I more than anybody can empathise with pilots because I come from a port and my father spent his life as a harbour pilot in Foynes Harbour operating under the 1913 Act.  I remember the insecurity that prevailed since he was regarded as a self-employed member, an employee of Limerick Harbour Board and as such his income was totally dependent on the shipping generated in the port.  I welcome the fact that the pilot as well as the harbour master will be an employee of the harbour board and anything that enhances their job security is welcome.  In the Shannon estuary certain families, such as the Melicans and the Brennans are synonymous with the estuary.  They gave much and were subject to uncertainty.  That <Col N="235" /> uncertainty should be removed and it is welcome that they have the option to be employees of the harbour board.  It was unfair that their income depended on the whims of commercial shipping activity.</P>
    <P>Harbour boards did not necessarily have to have the Minister's consent to lease a warehouse in the port but I understand the Minister's consent will now be required.  That is regrettable.  If the prevailing situation is effective and the objective is to ensure the semi-State bodies are not stifled by bureaucracy it should be possible for harbour boards to lease whatever is required.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for annual audits by an outside company with performance audits every three years.  Having been a member of the Committee of Public Accounts and seen the internal investigations by the Comptroller and Auditor General, I regret that there is not a role for the local government auditor.  If there is not a role on an annual basis is it not possible that he would carry out the performance audit every three years?  Realistically an accountancy practice is dependent on the whims of the directors as to whether it can continue as the commercial company providing the expertise to a harbour board. A local government auditor, as the watchdog of the public purse, is not dependent on the whims of the company directors.  In the past bigger companies failed, often because specific difficulties were not pinpointed in time.  Is there still a role for local government auditors in the context of harbour boards?  It may be that that decision has been taken out of our hands.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for dividends to be paid back to the Government.  I wonder what type of dividend is in mind.  Will those new companies be subject to corporation tax at 38 per cent? In that case I would be concerned that, having told those people to venture into pastures new, seek new business and expand and become very much involved in their commerical mandate, there would be an implicit penalty in regard <Col N="236" /> to the success of those operations in that the Government takes more money from them, and that that might retard the activities of a port.</P>
    <P>Within the Electricity (Supply) (Amendment) Act, 1987 there was concern about the future role of Moneypoint and that much of the coal brought in there in panamax containers would be off-loaded and brought around the country in trucks, doing much damage to our road structure which is suffering extreme problems at present.  A protection mechanism was included in the Bill to ensure that where trans-shipment took place the coal would be taken from Moneypoint to the various ports around the estuary and the surrounding areas when required.  That, by its nature, generates a certain amount of extra commercial activity in the ports. However, if it is not properly policed the coal may be transported by road. Recently Moneypoint was given extra funding to improve its bulk handling facilities.  If there is a spin-off activity to other ports, I would like to think it would be by way of coal being transported from Moneypoint direct to a port and then on to the customer.</P>
    <P>For many years the Shannon Estuary has been called the jewel of the western world because of the depth of water and the type of shipping it can accommodate. Parallel with that is the industrial activity along the estuary, for example, developments at Tarbert Island, Foynes, Aughinish Alumina, at Wyeth in Askeaton and Cement Limited.  A huge number of trucks use the N69 which is classified by the Minister for the Environment and by all officials as a national secondary route.  In the 1995-99 roads programme it is stated that this road may get funding.  This is essential if those ports are to develop.  There cannot be an inferior road structure serving them.  The Minister for the Marine will have to consult with the Minister for the Environment with a view to providing funds for the Foynes to Limerick route, the N69.</P>
    <P>The question of the jurisdiction of ports needs to be examined.  Foynes was <Col N="237" /> established as a port in 1890, over 100 years ago.  At that time its jurisdiction was just one mile.  One hundred years later we have seen tremendous changes. In 1890 ships weighting 250 tonnes used that port.  Now ships up to 35,000 tonnes dead weight use it.  Parallel with that, £2 million was spent on a dredging programme to develop that port, but the span of activity is still just one mile. Because of a mythical dart thrown in the past, Limerick claims jurisdiction over the entire estuary which, on both sides of the coastline, is 120 miles.  Foynes Harbour Board submitted a proposal to the Minister requesting the extension of the jurisdiction of Foynes Harbour to the county boundary between Limerick and Kerry.  This would extend the jurisdiction to about 12 miles, 10 per cent of the overall area serviced there.  If Foynes is to develop in the future in accordance with the plans it has submitted and if panamax ships which are currently used in Moneypoint are to come in there, its jurisdiction must be extended.  The area I refer to is not being used at present.  There is scope to recognise the passage of time and the commercial success of Foynes and give it that extra coastline.  We are no trying to take from the Aughinish Alumina port which is exactly one mile from Foynes and from which we do not get a brass halfpenny to develop Foynes Harbour because that money goes into Limerick Harbour Board's coffers.  We are asking to develop an area which is not developed at present and which extends to the county boundaries.</P>
    <P>In regard to the board, will the chairman be appointed by the Minister?  I am aware that the chief executive of the harbour board will be on it.  I want to acknowledge the tremendous dedication and commitment of the staff of Foynes Harbour Board who are small in number but who have achieved much over the years.  This has been recognised in recent times by allocations of money for further works.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kemmy referred earlier to casual working at Foynes.  This is difficult to avoid because Foynes Harbour <Col N="238" /> cannot be compared to Limerick Harbour. At Limerick Harbour there is little activity and only about eight dockers in full-time employment.  At Foynes, depending on the type of activity, there could be 300 or 400 employees.  The nature of the activities dictates that the work will be casual.  It appears to operate successfully, and some of the ships generate much revenue in the port.</P>
    <P>The Bill is timely.  I hope its passage will not be delayed and that we can move on the Committee Stage and probably suggest further refinements to it.  I hope it will be implemented as soon as possible because it could herald a new dawn for our ports.  I am not criticising the officials of the Department of the Marine for keeping a watchful eye, but the ports should be given their status and freed from the bureaucracy of the Department.  They should be allowed to expand and develop and I think we will see a continuation of the success story that prevailed in the past and a brighter dawn for all these ports.</P>

      <P>We have been divesting ourselves of power to raise issues in the House.  This Bill sets up commercial State companies and I wonder if this is the last time I will be able to raise in the House matters concerning Drogheda port or any other port.

We are told we must write to the secretary of the company involved.</P>
      <P>This Bill has its genesis in the last Government.  I was hesitant about it. When a Government falls certain Bills go by the board and I thought that might happen to this one.

      <Col N="239" /> If I want to raise an issue concerning the major national roads which go through my constituency.  I must write to the National Roads Authority.  I cannot raise the matter in the House.  The same system applies to regional technical colleges.  I heard Deputy Deasy refer to this on local radio.  He was talking ostensibly about privilege and what was perceived by some as a way of muzzling Members but the conversation came around to this area.  We talk about accountability but are we going down the right road in setting up these companies in such a way that the Oireachtas is not in a position to examine specific issues relating to them?</P>
    <P>There was a member of the local authorities on the review group which recommended that no local authority representatatives should be appointed to the new companies.  I understand the Fianna Fáil-Labour Government proposed to appoint two local authority members.  Local councillors must go before the people and are more answerable than company directors in other walks of life.</P>
    <P>We agree with the Bill in principle. Perhaps the matter I raise could be better dealt with through the committee system where Members would have a better input into the framing of legislation before it comes to the House.  I hope the Minister will reply to the question of whether we will be in a position to ask specific questions and raise specific issues concerning ports on the Adjournment or by way of Private Notice Question.</P>
    <P>The Minister raised the question of pensions and superannuation and said there were difficulties in some areas.  I am aware of a case in Drogheda where problems have arisen.  This area must be looked at.  I compliment the Minister for addressing the issue and hopefully as a result of the report he is commissioning the position will be ameliorated.</P>
    <P>In Drogheda we have had competition from Warrenpoint and Larne.  The Minister gave the figures for exports from our ports but I doubt if they refer <Col N="240" /> to exports through Northern ports.  I compliment Dublin port for the way it has countered some of the competition from Larne.  In this era of looking at Ireland as a whole we should not castigate Northern ports but we must develop communication between the ports in order to facilitate the better movement of goods from the island as a whole.  It is imperative that we get our act together in order to compete properly with the facilities which exist at Larne where there is a quicker turnover time and lower costs.</P>
    <P>The port at Greenore is privately owned.  But for the investment of the family who own it, it would not be what it is today.  Is there any possibility of the State being involved in the development of this strategic port in order to assist it compete with its Northern counterpart and enhance the job opportunities which exist in the area?</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the pier at Annagassan but not to the one at Clogherhead.  These piers are probably in different categories but I believe people from the area would be surprised to see Annagassan pier included in the list of non-commercial ports.  The Minister will decide whether a port should be included in the list on the basis of its merits.  There is a substantial amount of fishing off Clogherhead pier which is in a very bad condition.  While EU funding has been earmarked for the pier unfortunately there is a difficulty in regard to the additional funding which is in the hands of the local authority which has other priorities for example, filling potholes, etc.  Even though it may not come under this legislation I exhort the Minister to look at this issue.</P>
    <P>Our party spokesperson referred to marine leisure and the possibility of giving ports a greater role in this area.  The Minister said that the new companies will be entitled to engage in activities outside the State which will help to promote the interests of trade and tourism within the State.  The ports in my area have great potential to become involved in marine activity.  In my home town of Dundalk there is an estuary and a <Col N="241" /> thriving port which is adjacent to the bridge being built on the main Dublin-Belfast road.  During its construction local interests were in favour of installing a marine leisure facility on the west side of the bridge.  By holding back some of the estuary water it would have been possible for people to engage in marine leisure activities such as sailing. While proposals were put forward to the Department of the Environment there was no consultation between the interests involved.  Local engineers had put forward plans and the port authorities were involved in deciding whether this facility should go ahead.  I accept that holding back some of the estuary water might have given rise to problems but this case is indicative of the lack of co-ordination between some State bodies.  If the Department of the Environment, which would have provided the funding, had given a commitment and there was adequate co-ordination between the local interests and the port authorities then this facility, which would have been of great benefit, could have been provided at no great cost.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the sale of private land in a port area owned by individuals or companies.  Difficulties have arisen when the land has been sold to people not involved in port related business.  If this is allowed to continue then ports will contract and accessibility to them will be greatly reduced.  The Department should look at this issue very closely and ensure that land adjacent to port areas is sold or transferred in such a way that there is no disadvantage to the port.  The Minister should also consider this point in the context of setting up the new companies.  I am concerned that a person who agrees to buy a facility where he will store a different product from the one for which planning permission has been given will not require further planning permission. The Department should give further consideration to this point.</P>
    <P>When the capacity in Drogheda needed to be expanded it was hoped that Mornington would be included under the new tranche of EU funding.  It goes without saying that some interests <Col N="242" /> have ensured that this will not be a possibility in the near future.  One of the disadvantages of this part is its proximity to Dublin.  Will the Minister outline his plans for the development of Drogheda port either in the immediate vicinity or in a place like Mornington which is ideal for a deep port facility?</P>
    <P>There is much competition between ports along the east coast and smaller ports such as those in Dundalk and Greenore which have had to compete with ports in the North.  The port in Warrenpoint is experiencing difficulties at present and is in conflict with other ports.  While I welcome the Bill in principle we are making it more difficult for public representatives to have a hold on what is going on.  I listened carefully to the points made by the chamber of commerce in my area which does not think the Bill goes far enough.  I am a great believer in giving local representatives on committees adequate power.</P>
    <P>While welcoming the whole idea of modernising the structures under which these ports are retained I exhort the Minister to be careful about divesting us of the power to examine how these ports are run.  I hope the day will not come when a Minister will say to me or to my colleague, Deputy McGahon, or any Member from my constituency, that he cannot deal with our query about Dundalk or Drogheda ports as this was a matter for the directors.  I think that is what will happen.  I warn the Minister that that is the wrong road to go down. We should be responsible.</P>
    <P>In regard to the ESB and what is happening there, we cannot raise any questions about the ESB shops in the House. The public want to know why but I think it our fault.  I will not labour the point but we should look at the issue in a broader context.  I have had problems with this legislation from day one because it is divesting us of power and perhaps on Committee Stage the Minister will address some of the points I raised.</P>

      <P>As dtús, ba mhaith <Col N="243" /> liom fáilte a chur roimh an Bhille seo. Is Bille tábhachtach é agus tá sé á thabhairt isteach go tráthúil ag an phointe seo.  Baineann sé go príomha le calafoirt tráchtála ar fud na tíre, atá an-tábhachtach ar fad do chúrsaí eacnamaíochta.  Ní cóir dúinn dearmad gur oileán í an tír seo agus go bhfuil an fharraige thart orainn uilig.  Tá gach calafort sa tír an-tábhachtach, cé acu calafort iascaireachta nó calafort tráchtála atá ann.</P>
      <P>Táimíd ag brath ar na calafoirt tráchtála seo fá choinne na n-allmhairithe, fá choinne na dtáirgí a chuirtear ar fáil sna monarchana agus sna tionscail ar fud na tíre atá ag brath ar na calafoirt sin chun ár gcuid earraí a easpórtáil ar fud na hEorpa agus ar fud an domhain.</P>
      <P>Sílim gur dhúirt an tAire ar maidin go dtéann 80 faoin gcéad de na táirgí amach trí na calafoirt tráchtála.  Mar sin, tá sé iontach tábhachtach go mbeadh na calafoirt seo thar a bheith éifeachtach agus go mbeadh siad ábalta dul ag iomaíocht le calafoirt eile sa chuid eile den tír.  Téann 55 faoin gcéad de luach ár gcuid earraí trí na calafoirt sin chomh maith.  Tá sé thar a bheith in am an Bille seo a thabhairt isteach.  Tá sé beagnach 50 bliain ón uair dheireanach a tugadh Bille den chineál seo isteach.  Ba i 1946 a tugadh an Bille deireanach cúnta isteach agus is iomaí athrú atá tagtha ar rudaí ó shin.  Tá an saol athraithe, na longa agus na báid fharantóireachta freisin.  Tá na nósanna imeachta, oibre agus bainistíochta athraithe go mór idir an dá linn. Sílim go bhfuil sé thar am go mbeadh Bille mar seo á phlé sa Dáil againn i láthair na huaire.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Anois agus arís bíonn orm féin agus go leor daoine ó Dhún na nGall úsáid a bhaint as calafort tráchtála Latharna agus muid ag dul go Sasana nó go hAlba.  Ceann de na rudaí a chuireann ionadh agus alltacht, b'fhéidir, orm ná an méid leoraithe agus trucailí ó gach áit sa phoblacht a bhaineann úsaid as Calafort Latharna.  Sílim gur chóir dúinn ceist a chur orainn féin cén fáth go dtarlaíonn sé seo.  Go minic téann siad ó Latharna go Stranraer agus as sin <Col N="244" /> caithfidh siad dul síos go Londain, agus cén fáth nach mbaintear níos mó úsáide as Baile Átha Cliath, Corcaigh, Ros Láir agus as na calafoirt eile ar fud na tíre.</P>
    <P>Is docha gurb é an príomhfháth leis sin ná gur féidir dul trasna ó Latharna go Straenraer i bhfad níos saoire ná gur féidir dul ó Bhaile Átha Cliath go Holyhead nó ó Ros Láir go Fishguard.  Ta sé in am dúinn mar thír agus mar Rialtas ceist a chur orainn féin cé fáth go bhfuil sé níos saoire do thráchtáil na tíre seo nó do chéatdán den tráchtáil dul amach trí Latharna in ionad dul amach trínár gcuid calafort féin.  Níl mé ina choinne sin ach más féidir le trucail dul ó Chorcaigh go Latharna agus trasna uaidh sin níos saoire sílim gur chóir dúinn ceisteanna a chur agus freagraí a fháil ar na ceisteanna sin.</P>
    <P>Baineann an Bille seo go príomha le cuanta tráchtála.  Ach tá mír amháin as an Bhille &mdash; alt 86 &mdash; a dhéaneann tagairt do chalafoirt iascaireachta.  De réir an ailt sin tá Calafort an Daingin le grádú mar cheann de na calafoirt iascaireachta is mó sa tír agus a bheith ar aon chéim leis na Cealla Beaga agus leis na calafoirt iascaireachta mhóra eile mar Chaisleán Bhéarra, Dhún Mór agus Bhinn Éadair.</P>
    <P>Chomh maith leis sin, feicim ón mBille go bhfuil forlámhas ar 13 de na calafoirt bheaga á thabhairt do na húdaráis áitiúla, sé sin do na comhairlí contae. Is dócha gur mhaith an rud é go mbeadh baint agus páirt agus bainistíocht ag na comhairlí contae agus ag na húdaráis áitiúla ar 13 de na calafoirt is lú.</P>
    <P>Rud a ritheann liom, nuair a bhímid ag caint ar chalafoirt, ar chuanta agus mar sin de go bhfuil an-chuid dreamanna agus údarás sa tír a bhfuil cúraimí orthu.  Uimhir a haon, tá na calafoirt tráchtála ann; tá údarás le bheith orthu sin.  Ansin tá na calafoirt níos lú trádála a bheidh faoi na húdaráis áitiúla.  Tá na calafoirt iascaireachta ann a bheidh faoi cheannas Roinn na Mara chomh fada agus is eol dom agus ansin tá calafoirt sa Ghaeltacht a bheidh faoin Roinn Ealaíon, Cultúir agus Gaeltachta.  Sílim go bhfuil sé iontach tábhachtach go mbeadh ceangal agus comh-thuiscint <Col N="245" /> idir na heagraíochtaí sin uilig agus go mbeadh fhios ag dream amháin cad a bhi ar siúl ag an dream eile.</P>
    <P>I welcome the introduction of the Bill.  It is timely because it is 50 years since a similar Bill was introduced in this House.  We are all aware of the huge developments that have taken place in sea transport and in harbours since.  As an island nation, harbours are of great importance to us because the majority of our exports pass through our commercial ports.</P>
    <P>When introducing the Bill the Minister said that 80 per cent by volume and 55 per cent by value of our exports passed through our harbours in 1990. For a country that is so dependent on exports and imports it is very important that our harbours are efficient.  This Bill addresses that problem.</P>
    <P>I have had occasion in recent years to use one of the harbours in Northern Ireland, Larne, to go to Scotland, like most Donegal people and I was surprised to see a number of articulated trucks, lorries, and other vehicles from various parts of the Republic &mdash; as far south as Cork and other parts of Munster &mdash; using the harbour as a port of departure to the UK with their goods. Why do they have to travel so far north in going to the United Kingdom and, ultimately, the European market? There are questions to be answered.  It seems that Larne is run more economically and cheaply than some of our own harbours.  If this problem can be addressed and rectified in this Bill it should be welcomed for that reason.  I have nothing against those who use Larne.  Nevertheless, in the interests of efficiency, people should not find it attractive to travel from the south of the country to Larne and save money in the process.</P>
    <P>This Bill deals primarily with commercial harbours.  Under section 86, however, Dingle is to be designated as a fishery harbour.  This will place it on the same footing as other major fishery harbours such as Killybegs in my constituency, Dunmore East, Howth, Castletownbere and so on.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="246" /> I remind the Minister and Minister of State that there are a number of important harbours in County Donegal. There is an urgent need for investment and development at the premier harbour, Killybegs.  Burtonport which is close to where I live could double as a fishery and commercial harbour as it is used extensively by fishermen and for commercial reasons.  It was used on a number of occasions in the past by the industrial estate in Gweedore to import raw material.  Steel was also imported for the radiator factory in the industrial estate in Bunbeg.  Unfortunately, this is no longer the case due to difficulties in gaining access to the harbour which badly needs to be extended.  A sum of £250,000 was allocated last year to dredge the harbour but this has not been a complete success.  The previous Minister addressed this problem.  I hope the Minister and Minister of State will deliver on the commitment to dredge and eventually extend the harbour.  This was first promised by the former Taoiseach, Mr. Haughey, but little or nothing has happened since.  The harbour is in a bad state and there will be no further development unless something is done.</P>
    <P>The harbour on Tory Island gives cause for concern.  The Minister of State, Deputy Allen, visited the island during his term as Lord Mayor of Cork when he experienced the hospitality and friendliness of the people.  Arrangements are being made to bring a painting exhibition to Cork.  He had the good fortune to travel by helicopter.  There is no better way of getting there than by ferry, but unfortunately if the ferry does not arrive at the right time one has to travel ashore by currach or small boat. I hope that the promise to build a harbour will be delivered on shortly.  There is now a hotel on the island which was visited by 14,000 to 15,000 people last year.  The ferry sails to the island two or three times daily.  It will be a great pity if landing facilities are not provided there and on the mainland at Magheraroarty.</P>
    <P>Responsibility for a number of smaller commercial harbours is to be <Col N="247" /> transferred to the local authorities.  This is an imaginative step.  It is a good move to provide for local participation in the management of these harbours.  I am concerned, however, that a number of bodies will be responsible for harbours throughout the country from now on. Harbour authorities will be responsible for the major commercial ports, the local authorities for smaller commercial harbours, the Department of the Marine for fishery ports and the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht for harbours in Gaeltacht areas.  It is important that there be understanding and co-operation between these bodies.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  It is important that our harbours and ports be safe, commercially viable and competitive as they are the lifeline through which goods and raw materials are imported and exported.  The efficiency of the economy depends largely on the provision of efficent ports through which access can be gained to and from the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanMcGahon" hpid="Mr. McGahon Mr. McGahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGahon</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  I must confess, however, that when I first glanced at it I said to myself &ldquo;not another layer of bureaucracy&rdquo; but on mature reflection I accept that it is better to have the State involved in running harbours.  I have come to this conclusion because since the foundation of the State our harbours have been neglected. There are hundreds of smaller harbours where no improvement or maintenance works have been carried out since the days of the British.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recent years our harbours have been neglected in favour of airports and other infrastructure, such as roads of reasonable quality, on which a significant sum has been spent.  This has been to the detriment of our harbours.  More goods are exported by ship than by air or lorry.  There is one particular ship which can carry the same amount of cargo as 14 miles of lorry.  This is a tremendous endorsement of the efficiency of shipping. Another advantage shipping has over other forms of transport is that in inclement weather in <Col N="248" /> the depths of winter while lorries are snowbound throughout Europe this is not the case with shipping.  That is the reason most exporters transport their goods by ship.</P>
    <P>A new Harbours Bill is long overdue &mdash; it is 50 years since the last one was enacted.  More money needs to be directed not only to harbours but to the shipping industry.  I have in mind a hugely successful young Cork man, Frank Allen, a former sea captain in his late 30s who lives in my local town of Dundalk.  He now has seven boats valued at £14 million, which ply all over Europe.  He is hugely successful and hopes to put yet another boat on the high seas &mdash; his last boat cost £3.5 million. He is a credit not only to Dundalk but to the Irish shipping industry.</P>
    <P>There should be greater State aid for people and companies involved in the shipping industry.  Of all the bureaucratic aspects of Government, there is no agency from which a person can get State aid to put a ship on the seas, thereby creating employment.  In the case of all other industries there are various State agencies to whom they can go for assistance.  There has been a belief in Government circles that people who fund shipping are high rollers who have no problem providing money and that, consequently, they do not need State aid.  However, every industry needs State aid.  Since we are an island nation, cut off from the mainland of Europe, we should consider increasing investment in the shipping industry, particularly in harbours to modernise them.</P>
    <P>I listened to my friend and colleague, Deputy McGinley, speak of the need for investment in harbours in Donegal.  I agree but there has been a huge investment in harbours in Killybegs and Greencastle while there has been a contrastingly derisory and paltry investment in my native County Louth.  It is a small county and State allocations have always been small.  Clogherhead port is the third largest in the country with a fishing fleet of 33 vessels, many of whom have to land their catch at Howth &mdash; to which the catch is accredited &mdash;<Col N="249" /> because they cannot get into the harbour. Clogherhead has been included in the Department's programme for virtually as long as this country has been a Republic but it has been shamefully neglected.  Many Ministers have come to Clogherhead on propaganda visits but the people of Clogherhead do not want any more fact finding missions.  The Department has victimised and neglected Clogherhead.  I hope the Minister will change that position and allocate money so that the harbour wall which has subsided into the sea can be rebuilt.</P>
    <P>While I am hardly articulate enough to attract people from their tea, it is remiss of the Opposition not to have one person in the Chamber.  Perhaps it is because this Bill is not likely to get RTÉ television coverage, but if we were debating a matter that had a hint of scandal they would be here.  Is their absence a sign that they have no regard for the need for this Bill or is it that while they were in office they allowed many harbours to subside into the sea and do not wish to be told about it?</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill.  On balance the decision to include three members of the local authority on the new board is justifiable, but from my knowledge of membership of Dundalk Harbour Board, the people who make the most meaningful input to running the harbour are nominees of business firms who do business with the harbour.  They have expertise in the commercial running of the harbour, they export and import through the harbour and have a vested interest in ensuring it is run as efficiently as possible.</P>
    <P>In view of the fact that over the years harbours were neglected by Departments it was very difficult for members of harbour boards to get money for the maintenance and dredging of harbours, some of which were in a dangerous state of decay; on occasion there were fatalities when people drove over the edge of the harbour.  The creation of State bodies will ensure a more ready and plentiful supply of money.  If the companies to be set up are to have any merit, they must be given an allocation <Col N="250" /> of money.  State involvement will benefit harbours.</P>
    <P>In Dundalk the harbour is efficiently run.  In recent years under the guidance of a vibrant harbour board great plans have been made which I hope, with assistance from the Department, will be implemented.  In County Louth there is also the port of Greenore in Carlingford Lough which, while a private harbour, is responsible for much of our cattle exports, a business which in recent years has been a viable one.  Has the Minister considered the possibility of a joint venture with the Northern Ireland authorities to build a deep sea harbour in Carlingford Lough which would benefit people living on both sides of the lough from Kilkeel to Newry and Carlingford to Dundalk?  Such a venture has exciting possibilities.  It has been mooted over the years and I hope it will be considered in the future.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  The setting up of State companies in 12 areas should provide a fair supply of State money to allow the maintenance and development of the ports.  I am concerned about responsibility of small harbours being handed over to local authorities.  I fear that measure will be the swan song regarding the potential of small harbours, like the picturesque harbour of Annagassan in County Louth, because local authorities are so starved of cash and have so many priorities in terms of spending money that they will not spend it on developing such places as Annagassan. Some other umbrella authority should be responsible for small harbours. It is a cop out to give responsibility for them to local authorities because they will give roads and other areas greater priority and the small harbours will be relegated to the bottom of the list.  That is understandable, but the transfer of responsibility for small harbours to those authorities is a cop out.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to give an assurance that people who have served on harbour boards and have a vested interest in them, as described in the Bill, will be retained in the interests of the development of various ports.</P>
    <Col N="251" />
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  I understand the previous legislation dealing with harbours was introduced in 1946. One of the finest harbours was in my home town of Westport.  As a young boy I remember waiting for the boat to come in to deliver the slack, manure and coal.  People were well paid when the boats came into the harbour.  For the last number of years boats have not come in and the old people regret that. At one time boats left that harbour to bring people from Achill, Belmullet and Ballycroy to America and Britain.  I regret the decline in Westport Harbour over the years.</P>
      <P>It is regrettable that, similar to railways, harbours have declined.  In Dublin there is talk of bringing a railway line into the centre of the city, a project which will cost million of pounds. Articulated trucks travelling from Dublin all over the country are causing traffic problems in towns and damaging our roads.  Why do we not make more use of our harbours and use ships to carry goods from Dublin to Westport, Ballina and Achill?  Such a measure would reduce traffic on roads and create employment.  I remember people in the past waiting for boats to come into the quay and getting paid over the odds. Such traffic created industry in the town and generated a buzz as money was more plentiful.  It is sad those days have passed.  I talked to people on the quays last Sunday and they agree the derelict state of harbours is shameful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Given that it is proposed that responsibility for non-commercial ports will be handed over to local authorities. I ask the Minister to ensure that such authorities are given adequate funding to develop harbours to a proper standard. I compliment the Westport Harbour Commissioners for the work they carry out on a voluntary basis because of their love of the area.  I hope people serving on such boards will be retained as they do that work out of a love of the harbour, the quay and the boats.  When responsibility for those harbours is handed over to local authorities, we must ensure that, unlike in the past, <Col N="252" /> county managers, assistant county managers and county secretaries are not nominated to those boards while the people from the areas are denied representation on them.  That would be wrong.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will consider measures to revitalise such harbours and introduce legislation to reduce the volume of articulated trucks, relieve traffic problems and make greater use of harbours in the transport of goods, thus creating employment.  I hope people serving on harbour boards will not merely be thanked for their service and told they are no longer needed.  I hope they will be retained and county managers will have only a small representation on them.  I am sure this legislation will have greater effect on larger rather than smaller harbours.  I compliment the Minister for introducing the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with other Deputies in welcoming the Bill.  During the past three years on the Order of Business I asked many times when the Harbour Bill would be introduced and various undertakings were given by the previous Taoiseach.  When my party entered Government I told the then Minister for the Marine, Deputy Coveney, that I wanted the Bill introduced as quickly as possible and I am glad that has been achieved after only five months in office.  I take this opportunity to welcome the new Minister for the Marine, Deputy Barrett, and wish him well in his new post.</P>
      <P>One of the advantages of being in Government is that one is in a position to approach a Minister or parties in Government and outline what needs to be done.  I was pleased to be in a position to outline to the Minister the case for adding Salthill to the line of seaside resorts in Galway designated for renewal.  I am glad that was achieved after only five months in Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>After strong representations made by harbour boards to retain the balance of local authority members on boards, the <Col N="253" /> Minister has conceded that three persons will be nominated by the prescribed local authority.  I am not sure if such persons must be members of the local authority, but I presume they must.  It is essential that there is close liaison between the harbour boards and the local authorities, particularly with the local authority in which the harbour board is located.</P>
    <P>Regarding Galway Harbour Board, I presume it will involve three members of Galway Borough Council as the harbour board is located in Galway city. Since the 1946 Harbours Act Galway has been declared a full county borough with full responsibilities and the county council no longer represents the city. Such liaison between the local authority and the harbour board should continue because, despite the expertise and interests of other members of the harbour board, it is generally members of the local authority who provide the neutral opinion on the harbour board because they are not involved in the daily running of the board.</P>

In many countries it has led to an integrated view of the coastal zone as an entity that must be treated accordingly.  It appears that increasing demographic pressure on the coast coincides with an increase in world wide coastal erosion.  A survey by the International Geomorphological Society has revealed that coasts under the influence of man, as well as virgin coasts, are on average suffering.  The present secular rise in ocean water level may be a significant cause, but in some regions also large development schemes undoubtedly add to the problems by arresting sediments before they reach the coast.  The coastal zone is dynamic and has warranted increased research into coastal processes in recent decades. Universities throughout Europe and elsewhere are devoting much of their research efforts to the study of coastal problems and to developing modern tools.</P>
      <P>All coastal problems have features in common.  After all, wave and tide physics are universal and sandy beaches show similarities in their response to wave action.  Yet, variations in local meteorology, geology, use pattern and so on, call for detailed knowledge of local coastal problems.  It is, therefore, important to develop the local national expertise within those fields concurrently with the exchange of know-how and expertise of foreign institutions. This development should occur with a view to ensuring continuity, and understanding more global trends since coastal processes have to be studied over a considerable timespan.</P>

    <P>The coast of Ireland represents a major national resource.  It offers both <Col N="255" /> economic and energy production potential, yet realisation of such potential must retain the high quality of our coastal environment.  In the next 50 years our coastline faces further pressure from the consequences of global warming &mdash; sea level rise and increasing storm frequency and intensity &mdash; and from general reinforcement of socioeconomic exploitation and development. To deal with this increasing stress, it is necessary to reconsider our policies, plans and techniques for reacting to coastal problems and, in particular, we must view the coast as a natural system which needs to operate freely in order to remain stable.  All developments should aim to work with, rather than against, this natural system.  It is also important that a full inventory is made of our coastal resources as a basis for policy and planning.  Such database should help identify areas at risk, assess the impact of sea level rise and provide an interactive medium for planners, engineers and developers.  There is a requirement to re-educate the public which at present assumes all shoreline change is bad and must be resisted at any cost and with all possible means. The idea that we should adjust to the needs of the coast rather than subjugate it must be accepted by all.</P>
    <P>Of the processes operating around our coast at present, erosion and its repercussions are the most celebrated and widely studied.  Carter and Johnston in 1982 and Carter in 1991 estimated that there are at least 300 recognisable erosion problems around our coast affecting approximately 25 per cent of our coastline.  The removal of shore material by waves and currents is the main cause of erosion, but the extent and form of erosion depends on a number of other factors.  Wide flat beaches, characteristic of our north and west coasts, dissipate wave energy.  Wide beach environments minimise the effects of high energy from the Atlantic swell.  Although of quantitatively lower wave energy, the east coast is where most of our coastal erosion problems <Col N="256" /> occur.  The beaches are narrower and steeper in form and have been developed in relatively soft glacial sediment. Other natural factors affecting erosion on coasts include sea level rise, storminess, changes in sediment budgets and fluctuations in river discharge. Material eroded from the beach is often carried offshore and deposited in relatively shallow water.  This sediment can act as protection for the coast, absorbing much of the wave energy before it reaches the shore.  This sediment can be subjected to further transportation and its movement can result in the focus of erosion moving along the coast.</P>
    <P>Since at least the 19th century with the growth in major engineering works along the coast, people have at all times initiated or increased erosion problems. Dredging, sand mining, ship wake generation, recreational activities, reclamation and the construction of harbours, sea walls and jetties force the coastal environment to change in some way to accommodate them.  These activities may not affect the coast immediately, but they can cause problems over time and in some cases over considerable distances.  For example, reclamation in Wexford Harbour more than 100 years ago has led to erosion problems on an eight kilometre stretch of Rosslare Bay.  This is but one of numerous examples of coastal reclamation having led to subsequent sediment budget, erosion and deposition changes around the coastline.</P>
    <P>The Clonakilty-Rosscarbery Bay area of south west Cork has undergone intensive study on erosion problems. This has resulted in the emplacement of gabions to help stabilise the dune front on two beaches, the reinforcement and rock armouring of a sea wall and the construction of tracks and fences in sand dune systems to control pedestrian access to the beach.  The highest rates of erosion occur in cliffs of glacial material. At Blackwater in County Wexford, for example, erosion rates of up to 2.2 metres per annum have been recorded. The eroded material may be deposited in estuaries and related tidal bedforms. <Col N="257" /> In this case the mouth of the River Slaney is the biggest sink.  In addition, the sediment may form barriers, ridges or dunes downdrift of the erosion points.  Some of the sediment may also be taken offshore and deposited on the shelf forming banks which are common in the shallow water of the west Irish sea.</P>
    <P>The sediment which finds its way into ports, harbours and estuaries can cause problems for fishing and shell fish farming, radically changing local coastal environments.  Sand dunes react to erosion in an equally complex way.  Rates are difficult to quantify and major recession may occur in the wake of a storm, but between storms large quantities of sand may be blown back on to the foreshore causing accretion.  The nature of sand dunes is changing due to human interference.  Golf courses have been constructed on dune complexes modifying the dunes to the needs of developers. Grazing of cattle and sheep on sand dunes and sand sheet systems has influenced the ecology of Irish dunes for centuries.  The recent application of fertilisers to dune soils threatens vegetation more drastically.  Dunes in Ireland have been used as rabbit warrens for food for centuries.  The removal of marram grass from dunes, for thatching purposes had the same effect.</P>
    <P>Storms on the Irish coast between 1987 and 1992 caused severe erosion and extensive damage to coastal structures, many of which were built in the last century and are now in poor condition. An estimate of the cost of carrying out emergency repairs was put at £13 million as far back as 1990.</P>
    <P>Ireland's population has increasingly been concentrated in coastal areas and many coastal towns and cities regularly experience flooding by the sea.  The usual causes of urban flooding, rapid run-off from impermeable surfaces and the failure of storm drains to cope with sudden high volumes of water, are magnified in these estuary locations during high tides as terrestrial water finds its escape route cut off by sea water.  An <Col N="258" /> analysis of flooding in Cork City showed that there had been 292 floods there since 1841, most of them recorded in winter, especially in the months of November and March.</P>
    <P>Much recent coastal work in Ireland has concentrated on the question of management, the ongoing concerns about erosion, storm damage and coastal zone planning added to by a fear of sea level rise which may result from the increasing global warming.  It has been pointed out that, although knowledge of the coastal processes has improved in the past decade, theoretical knowledge of the response of coastal environments to rises in sea level is not yet adequate.  More field measurement needs to be undertaken so that widely applicable models can be developed and put to use in planning management strategies for our coastlines.</P>
    <P>Of course, coastal management is not a problem peculiar to Ireland.  As a member of the European Union we have been involved in a number of programmes aimed at gathering, co-ordinating and improving the consistency of information on the coastal environment within the European Union.  Those programmes have endeavoured to strengthen planning procedures and develop a concept of integrated management of coastal zones but community policy has not yet been developed to the maximum possible extent.  For example, we need better and stronger legal instruments, improved management of Structural Funds in the protection of coastal zones, financial support for coastal pilot projects and, of course, measures to improve public participation.</P>
    <P>A number of those programmes are continuing within the Commission. When faced with the prospect of rising sea levels, it is better to prepare early for planning and investing for change so that developments can be introduced gradually within the financial technological and personal constraints obtaining.</P>
    <P>Traditionally, it could be said that Ireland has neglected this valuable <Col N="259" /> asset, although arguably this country has one of the most scenic coastlines in Europe.  However, it is now realised that coastal systems are frequently fragile, non-renewable and that the important tourism industry of the future will depend largely on the preservation of our coasts.</P>
    <P>In circumstances of projected climate change coasts will be subjected to increased pressure, rendering it necessary to understand what is likely to occur and plan accordingly.  A &ldquo;needs study&rdquo; of the entire coastline was carried out on a county basis to identify the basic land-forms present and to quantify the cost of the immediate remedial action required.  Areas particularly sensitive to change were also identified. That study showed that out of a total coastline of 5,800 kilometres in the Republic over 1,500 kilometres are at risk, with some 490 kilometres requiring immediate attention at an approximate cost of £125 million.</P>
    <P>That figure includes repairs to minor piers and harbours under the control of local authorities but excludes major harbours and those controlled by harbour boards.  More than 500 of these piers and small harbours were generally identified as having been built in the last century.  These have a significant impact on tourism, leisure activities and the livelihood of local fishermen.  However, there is no specific budget allocation for their upkeep, many being in a state of serious disrepair.</P>
    <P>The estimated costs of erosion control are based largely on traditional hard structural solutions whereas it is clear that, in future, a soft approach to coastal erosion management will be required in many cases.  The removal of beach materials is another serious problem for some local authorities.  A potentially more serious problem could arise in the near future if there are moves to exploit offshore sand banks as sources of construction materials.  Both activities must be strictly controlled as failure to do so would be catastrophic for sections of our coastline.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="260" /> The position regarding coastal erosion control in other countries, including Denmark, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and the USA, was examined, and showed a trend towards total coastal management rather than treating erosion in isolation.  Management systems worldwide range from virtually total control in countries like the Netherlands to none in underdeveloped Third World countries.  As in other areas of human activity, it is recognised that development must be sustainable, that is fulfils the needs of the present generation without adversely affecting or compromising the needs of future generations.  This is especially germane to coastal development where the resource is not infinite, when even minor adjustments to coastal processes can seriously affect the overall pattern, often over a timescale well beyond human life spans.</P>
    <P>Present European Union policy and that in the immediate future must be seen to favour this total approach. While funding is generally not available for erosion protection schemes in anything like the volume required, there is at present a movement towards the development of a coherent strategy for coastal Europe involving the production of regional management plans.  For example, the position obtaining in Denmark and the Netherlands is considered to be a good, general model for Ireland, with suitable modifications.  It is interesting that the Danes have been able to advance technological solutions which would appear, at face value, to incur reasonable cost and be quite effective.</P>
    <P>It is recommended that an agency charged with overall management of coastal affairs be established within a Government Department, most likely either that of the Marine or the Environment.  The Department of the Marine has the requisite expertise in coastal engineering formally vested in the Office of Public Works and is the responsible authority under the Coastal Protection Act, 1963 and the Foreshore <Col N="261" /> (Amendment) Act, 1992.  The Department of the Environment controls planning matters on the coastline and, within the coastal zone, will also have responsibility for the Environmental Protection Agency.</P>
    <P>In other countries it is considered essential that a single authority should have the regulatory role for onshore and offshore development within the coastal zone but the most important factor is the need for close co-operation and interaction between all relevant agencies. The proposed agency &mdash; the national coastal authority &mdash; would have close interaction with the Environmental Protection Agency and the Marine Institute along with local authority planning departments.  It is envisaged that the new agency would be staffed largely from existing resources and would not require increased public sector employment. The national coastal authority would be responsible for developing policy on the needs of the entire coastal zone, including both the land and offshore waters contiguous to the coastline. Maritime local authorities would continue to manage the coastlines falling within their remit but central guidelines would be developed to ensure uniformity of approach.</P>
    <P>When dealing with coastal erosion it is considered necessary to draw a distinction between response to slow, continuous erosion, where sediment is lost to the coastal system, and that to damage caused by infrequent storms.  Following the Dutch model, the slow, continuous erosion would be the responsibility of the new central agency along with dealing with the implications of climate change, while the response to storms would continue to be a local responsibility.</P>
    <P>New legal and financial arrangements are recommended.  The existing Foreshore and Coastal Protection Acts should be replaced by a single coastal zone management Act similar to the United States Coastal Zone Management Act enacted there in 1972 and subsequently amended.  In most other countries, including Ireland, a local <Col N="262" /> contribution is required for most capital coastal works.  However, in Ireland, as local authorities have limited scope for raising local taxes, it is recommended that a fund be established to respond to emergencies caused by storms.  That fund, with annual contributions by local and central Government, should be available whenever such emergencies arise.</P>
    <P>In a small country like ours, where most of the population lives within 80 kilometres of the sea and everybody benefits from the coast, strong central financial support can be justified.  I am not saying, however, that the overall estimate for the cost of doing all the works could be undertaken immediately. It is clear that they would have to be carried out on a phased basis but we need the instruments, the authority and the necessary legislation to ensure a coherent response to what everybody recognises is a serious problem.</P>
    <P>The accumulation of the basic data needed to manage the coast is perhaps the most vital need of all, especially in a situation of projected climate change. This includes water levels, tide patterns, wind and wave data as well as studies of sediment supply along the coast and the natural processes taking place.  It is interesting that even on a cursory study, the difference between the west and east coast is evident.  The collection of this data would be the responsibility of the new agency with the field work being carried out by staff of local authorities, the private sector and educational establishments, with possible input from voluntary bodies such as Coastwatch and An Taisce.</P>
    <P>It is recommended that the local coastal zone management plans are developed for the coast under the general control of the central agency.  The planning could be on a county or regional basis, although it might make more sense to combine areas of similar coastline as coastal processes do not recognise administrative boundaries. The recently published <i>Coastline Management Plan &mdash; Brady Shipman Martin</i><Col N="263" /><i>1992</i>&mdash; for the Wexford coastline provides a good model for planning.</P>
    <P>It is considered that a favourable response could be expected to a request for EU funding on a much greater scale for both basic data collection and coastal zone planning as the approach appears to complement projected EU policies.  The cost of running and administering the national coastal authority might even be partly funded in this way.</P>
    <P>Education and expertise needs are considered.  Traditionally, civil engineers have been mainly responsible for combating erosion, adopting a fairly rigid structural approach.  While engineers should continue in a lead role in coastal management, they will require a much broader appreciation of the natural processes at work and of the contributions required from other disciplines such as geographers, environmental scientists, ecologists, etc.  Solutions will be developed by a multidisciplinary approach but engineers with environmental training would appear to be in the best position for overall co-ordination.</P>
    <P>All civil engineering students should have a basic appreciation of coastal management and mid-career training in specialist aspects should be available to keep abreast of modern developments. Mathematical modelling techniques have recently become available which vastly increase the capability for coastal management and which have directly led to a surge in understanding of the various coastal morphological processes over the past few years.  Courses in physical planning should also include a module on the special needs of the coastal zone.</P>
    <P>Relationships should be established between bodies in Ireland and expert agencies elsewhere, such as developed between Eolas and Danish Hydraulics. The Hydraulics Research Establishment would also be involved.  The facilities of these and of other local educational establishments with special expertise would be used in the various studies required.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="264" /> It is essential that a close working relationship is maintained with the relevant authorities and sources of expertise in Northern Ireland.  Coastal problems span political boundaries and assistance for joint projects might be available from the International Fund for Ireland.  All the above relationships would assist the exchange of expertise and technology transfer to take place and allow the development of a coherent European approach to overall coastal management.</P>
    <P>A single new agency, the national coastal authority, should be established within an existing Government Department following the approach adopted in other countries.  This agency would be responsible for all coastal matters and would have a regulatory role in development within the coastal zone.  Central Government, through the proposed national coastal authority, should be responsible for combating ongoing coastal erosion, including dealing with the effects of climate change.  Large scale beach nourishment at selected locations will probably be required and this should be managed and funded centrally.</P>
    <P>Responding to isolated storm events would continue as a local responsibility but a funding system is required to ensure immediate and appropriate response to each emergency.</P>
    <P>A single new Act, the coastal zone management Act, should replace the existing Foreshore Act and Coastal Protection Act.  The coastal zone would be clearly defined and the public's right of access to beaches enshrined in law. Activities such as beach and offshore material removal would be strictly controlled. The legal status of areas of scientific interest should be strengthened by national by-laws, especially for sand dune systems.</P>
    <P>The strategic importance to Ireland of the coastal zone should be recognised in all submissions to the European Union for Structural Fund assistance.  Extensive data collection is required, including the establishment of an expanded network of water level measurement <Col N="265" /> stations.  This is especially important when considering the effects of predicted sea level rise.  The cost of this data collection, research and necessary capital works should be included in these submissions.</P>
    <P>The concept of coastal management, rather than coastal protection, would be in accord with policy trends in Europe and worldwide.  Coastal zone management plans should be prepared for the coast, either on a regional or county basis.  Overall planning guidelines should be issued and should reflect the sensitive and non-renewable nature of much of the coast with procedures to limit development within the coastal zone.  The cost of developing these plans should also be included in European Regional Development Fund submissions.</P>
    <P>A code of practice for coastal protection should be drawn up to ensure the uniformity and appropriateness of all works.</P>
    <P>Recommendations for maintaining a large number of minor piers and harbours should be made by the new agency as a matter of urgency and specific funding provided to local authorities for this function.  Expertise needs require expansion of existing technical and planning courses with in-service training provided for practising engineers and scientists.  Education of the general public is also required to counter unrealistic expectations of coastal usage and performance.</P>
    <P>Relationships should be established between Irish agencies and specialist organisations in other countries to facilitate technology transfer.  In particular, close liaison should be maintained with authorities in Northern Ireland as coastal processes do not stop at political boundaries.  Funding for joint projects should be sought from sources such as the International Fund for Ireland.</P>
    <P>As a result of global warming, the world's temperatures are expected to rise over the next 40 or 60 years bringing about a rise in sea levels of up to 1.3 metres.  In 1990, Devoy considered that &ldquo;a rise in temperature overall in Ireland <Col N="266" /> as a consequence of climate warming is, therefore, likely to be associated with fewer storms from the Atlantic, drier conditions in the west at least, and more of our weather dominated by continental conditions from the east, including increased frequency of easterly storms&rdquo;. He further felt that in the short term there would be increased intensity, if not frequency, of westerly storms over Ireland.</P>
    <P>Devoy suggested that the likely impact of this on coastal erosion and damaged sea defences would be high. He concluded that &ldquo;storms generated from the east will be able to gain greater access to the open west-east geological structure along the south coast&rdquo;.  This scenario has obvious implications for County Waterford, in common with neighbouring coastal authorities.  The problem areas are known in Counties Waterford and Wexford but the ability of local authorities to fund new sea defence works has been eroding faster than the nation's shores.  Waterford County Council has spent almost £0.9 million as a result of storms over the years.  Grant assistance was received from the Department of the Marine as part of a relief package introduced by the Government to remedy the destruction caused.</P>
    <P>I want to make a final reference to this lest there be any misinterpretation of what we are seeking.  It is clear that it will not be possible to cope with all these problems together.  There has been a certain amount of neglect in the past.</P>
    <P>I do not expect this Minister to immediately come up with solutions to questions that could not be solved up to now, but there is sufficient evidence to show that there is a dire necessity for change, for a new authority and new funding.  It is possible now, because of the state of the national finances and the most privileged position of any Government for years, to do things which were not possible up to now.  I hope that the response from the Minister will demonstrate his and the Government's commitment to ensuring <Col N="267" /> that our natural resources, our coastline which is so vital for tourism and for our communities are adequately protected. The proposals we have put forward will greatly assist the Minister in his work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my colleague for tabling this very important motion. Coastal erosion and the problems associated with storm damage hit the headlines occasionally but are soon forgotten. With the onset of summer, everybody but the people living with and suffering the consequences has forgotten the terrible storm damage of January last.  In my constituency we are still trying to pick up the pieces after that storm.  Roads are still unrepaired and piers are so seriously damaged that the next storm could take them away.  Land is vulnerable to further storms and nothing of any consequence has been done to repair the damage and prevent further coastal erosion.</P>
      <P>Some time ago Galway County Council was asked by the Government to submit proposals for the prevention of coastal erosion in Galway.  The county council promptly put forward proposals relating to areas of Galway Bay, Roundstone, Inisbofin, etc. but received no definitive commitment from the Department to provide funding to prevent further damage in these areas.  In each of the cases mentioned not only is land likely to be lost through further storms but basic infrastructure like roads is at serious risk unless something is done. The Minister should visit some of these areas, particularly Inisbofin where the main road along the island is seriously at risk because no protective work has been carried out in the last few years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This problem predates the present Government, but the Government has been handed, through the Structural Funds, the wherewithal to begin tackling the problem on a small scale.  It is because of the work done by the previous Government that that money is available.  It is incumbent on the present Government to draw up a programme of work and let us get on with it.  We are <Col N="268" /> now nearing midsummer's day and the sooner this work is done &mdash; and it should be done during the summer &mdash; less likely we are to have a huge extra bill in the wake of next winter's storms.</P>
    <P>Legislation is necessary to provide statutory compensation to farmers who lose land through coastal erosion.  There are areas where there is little possibility, in the context of available resources and the cost benefit, of keeping out the sea in the long term.  However, where a sizeable part of a farmer's land is swept into the sea it is extraordinary that we shrug our shoulders and have no system to compensate farmers for such loss.  Year after year, in the area adjacent to Cleggan in my constituency, the sea takes the few valuable acres that farmers have.  To farmers in the better farming areas the loss of two or three acres of land might not be so serious but to lose 30 per cent of ten or so acres of Connemara land to coastal erosion over five or ten years is of serious consequence. Where the cost benefit would not justify major erosion prevention work, steps should be taken to compensate farmers for the loss of their land.</P>
    <P>There are areas where the innovative use of small grants and community employment schemes could enable quite substantial works to be carried out to prevent further coastal erosion.  I have in mind areas like Inis Meán and the other Aran Islands which contain good land which is at serious risk and where a small capital grant from either the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht or from the Department of the Marine, allied to the work that could be done under community employment schemes, would ensure that this land was protected from the sea.  I cannot understand the lack of flexibility and initiative and total inertia in regard to this problem.  There seems to be a general lack of interest in the small coastal communities because they tend not to have much influence, particularly with the parties in Government.</P>

    <P>When the scheme for seaside resorts was announced earlier this year, I highlighted the lack of interest in the more remote areas.  I was amazed that the town of Clifden in my constituency, which has been a tourist resort for over 100 years, was omitted from the list. This town is in urgent need of refurbishment. In the last few years the people there have made efforts to do something about the appearance of their town.  There is a need for major investment.  However, the Government in its wisdom seems not to be aware that the town exists.  I ask the Minister for the Marine, Deputy Barrett, and the Minister of State, Deputy Gilmore, to reconsider this oversight and include Clifden in this scheme.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No.1: To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;... Dáil Éireann supports the Government's commitment to develop and implement a targeted coast protection programme in <Col N="270" /> respect of the worst affected areas in the country, including Bray.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am confident that the Dáil will carry this amendment because the Government recognises that coastal erosion is a very serious problem; the moneys assigned to coastal protection under the National Plan is a significant increase on recent years; the Government is committed to looking at the allocation of funding to see what more can be done; is drawing up a priority listing of works; a major scheme planned for Bray is due to start in autumn this year; and the Government is committed to the wider concept of coastal zone management of which coast protection is a part.  In short, the Government has demonstrated a comprehensive targeted strategy in its approach to coastal erosion and related issues.</P>
    <P>Before addressing the general issue of coastal protection, I would like to clarify any possible misconception regarding special incentives to encourage private investment to facilitate the refurbishment of areas affected by coastal erosion.  There are no special incentives for such purposes in areas affected by erosion.  The Government provides grant aid towards the cost of undertaking certain essential coastal protection works all around the coast.  I will detail the aid being provided and the circumstances in which this aid is provided for erosion works in the course of my speech.  There is however, a pilot relief scheme for certain resort areas, as detailed in Chapter III, sections 46-53 of this year's Finance Act. This scheme, which will apply for three years from 1 July 1995, on a pilot basis, recognises that certain resort areas require renewal and the development of modern facilities. The objective of the scheme is the renewal and updating of the tourist amenities and facilities in the designated resorts.  The Finance Act provides that all Bord Fáilte registered and approved visitor accommodation, together with any tourism building or structure, may benefit under the scheme.  The issue of <Col N="271" /> erosion is not a factor that has been considered in terms of the designation of resorts.  This is a pilot scheme drawn up in the interest of encouraging development in resort areas.  Its extension or otherwise to other areas will depend on its success over the next three years.</P>
    <P>I am sure the House will join with me in congratulating my colleague in Government for having the foresight to introduce this scheme &mdash; something which Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív seems to forget was introduced only this year. While many areas have been omitted certain areas have been selected on a pilot basis.  I hope the scheme will turn out to be very successful and new areas will be incorporated in it in future.</P>
    <P>I would now like to address the specific issue of erosion and Government actions in respect of it.  Ireland is surrounded by one of the most scenic coastlines in Europe.  The coastline is recognised as a resource of immense value in economic, environmental, ecological and sociological terms.  However, in recent years it has become generally accepted that coastal erosion is a major threat to the coastal environment.  The coastal resource is fragile and non-renewable and the systems operating in the coastal zone will significantly depend on the preservation of the coast.</P>
    <P>Ireland has a coastline stretching some 6,500 kilometres, of which approximately 5,800 kilometres falls within the jurisdiction of the Republic of Ireland.  A &ldquo;needs study&rdquo; carried out in 1992 by the national coastal erosion committee of the County and City Engineers' Association showed that out of that total coastline of 5,800 kilometres, over 1,500 kilometres are at risk and some 490 kilometres require immediate attention, at an approximate cost of £125 million.</P>
    <P>Many of the areas under threat from coastal erosion, such as Bray Promenade, County Wicklow and Rosslare Strand, County Wexford are major tourism amenities.  My colleague, the Minister of State Deputy Gilmore will deal with the projects in more detail during <Col N="272" /> the course of his contribution to the debate.  The erosion and possible loss of such amenities will pose serious economic difficulties for local communities, who to a large extent depend on these tourism amenities for their economic survival.  This is in additionn to the economic loss of State owned property, incurred due to erosion.</P>
    <P>Coastal erosion also impacts on the local ecological environment.  Loss for example of sand dunes or other shore areas can disrupt flora and fauna and the natural habitats of a number of birds and animals.  Erosion in certain instances poses a social threat to isolated coastal communities.  Apart from the economic disruption, erosion is threatening the communication and transport links for these communities. Being cut off from the mainland will have serious and potentially catastrophic consequences for these communities.</P>
    <P>The Government is conscious of the threat posed by erosion and the need for coast protection.  To this end EU Structural Funds are being made available for the first time to help address the serious erosion problem.  Under the operationl programme for environmental services, some £5.1 million is being made available for coastal protection works during the period 1994 through 1999.  The primary objective of the funding available is the preservation of: the State owned foreshore; local authority owned property; tourism amenities, including beach and dune systems; and natural habitats-ecology.</P>
    <P>Preservation is the objective where this can be undertaken at economic cost.  Such preservation works support rural development, tourism, environmental protection and other activities which contribute to increasing the economic potential of coastal regions.  A subsidiary, and important, objective is to address the fragmented nature of &ldquo;coastline responsibility&rdquo;.  Given the numerous public bodies responsible for or using the coastal zone, there is a need for coherence in the approach to coastal zone management.  To this end the <Col N="273" /> development of a system of integrated coastal zone managment will be examined. The Minister of State Deputy Gilmore will detail the Government's actions in this regard.</P>
    <P>Some £5.1 million is being made available to the end of 1999 for protection works.  In order to draw up a targeted programme of priority coastal locations, consultations were held with and submissions have been sought from the various coastal local authorities.  The local authorities have been requested to submit full details of their top four priority proposals for consideration. They have also been advised that given the level of demand upon available resources, value for money from investments in coastal protection schemes must be achieved.  Thus the cost of undertaking any scheme must be considered against the benefits, tangible or intangible, arising.  Such benefits would include property, infrastructure, transportation, livelihoods, community concern, conservation value and commercial value.</P>
    <P>The bulk of priority proposals have now been received by my Department. These proposals will be assessed by the Department of the Marine having regard to rates of erosion, benefits arising, nature of works required, outline design requirements and cost.  Given the detailed nature of the assessment required, the need for further discussion with a number of the local authorities and the need to visit the locations in question, the assessment will take a couple of months to complete.  At that stage a targeted programme of works to be undertaken over the next number of years will be drawn up.</P>
    <P>I will outline the proposals submitted by Wexford and Meath County Councils as they are of particular interest to Deputies Browne and Dempsey respectively.</P>
    <P>Wexford County Council has proposed the following order of priority for coast protection works: Courtown-Ardamine; Cullenstown' Cahore and Duncannon.</P>
    <P>At Courtown-Ardamine the council <Col N="274" /> proposes three actions.  First, emergency repairs comprising extension of rock revetment along a 60 metre section of Courtown north beach where public walks and picnic-parking areas are at risk due to the locally increased erosion rate.  Public access from the &ldquo;cricket pitch&rdquo; picnic area to the beach has caused damage over the last two winters and access has now been blocked. Second, study and modelling of wave and sediment movement in Courtown-Ardamine area and design of a phased soft engineering response to the ongoing erosion, while maintaining or improving the harbour entrance channel, which is subject to infil due to the longshore drift and, third, phased construction of soft engineering response recommended in the study and modelling. The county council estimate of the cost of these works is in excess of £450,000.</P>
    <P>At Cullenstown the mouth of the Cull lagoon has been moving progressively westwards, pushed in this direction by the steadily growing Ballytigue Burrow, itself a designated area of scientific interest.  If the erosion continues there is a risk to the public road access to commercial and residential properties and a risk of loss of livelihood, housing, tourist accommodation and amenities. The council proposes strengthening and extending the existing groyne, cutting through the burrow and placing sand in the old channel at an estimated cost of £108,000.</P>
    <P>At Cahore, where the coastline retreated some 20 metres during the 1978-1989 period, the council proposes strengthening and extending the existing rock revetment to afford long term protection to the bay at an estimated cost of £90,000</P>
    <P>Duncannon is a popular holiday resort and fishing village in the Barrow estuary area.  The bulk of the strand at Duncannon, which is a blue flag beach, is stable.  However, a section of the dunes at the northern end of the strand is under attack from high waves and is receding.  The council proposes the construction of a 150 metre rock revetment <Col N="275" /> to protect the lower face of the dunes from scour.  It estimates the cost at approximately £75,000.</P>
    <P>Meath County Council has proposed works at three priority locations: Laytown; Bettystown and the area of beach fronting Laytown-Bettystown golf course.</P>
    <P>At Laytown, the council proposes to extend the existing gabion protection as far as Netterville Terrace to link up with the gabion protection work carried out there in 1991.  The completion of this work will also assist the development of car parking facilities and the amenity park.  The council's estimate of the cost is £210,000.</P>
    <P>The stretch of beach south from the beach access at Bettystown has suffered erosion because of the long term result of scouring action of the vertical retaining wall.  The council proposes building up beach material against the vertical wall using soft engineering techniques over a distance of 600 metres.  In addition, it proposes continuing the gabion protection, commenced in 1990, as far as the golf course at an estimated cost of £150,000.</P>
    <P>The third location requiring protection is the area of beach fronting the Laytown-Bettystown golf course with which I am familiar and as far as the training bar at the entry to the estuary. A new beach and dune system has developed at Mornington because of the construction of the training bar which trapped the longshore drift.  Intensive use of the dunes and beach between there and Bettystown has given little opportunity for dune regeneration from year to year.  The council proposes initially to construct a gabion and groyne system for one kilometre to initiate the development of a new dune system.  Marram and sea-lyme grass planting and access-traffic management to the beach is also required.  The cost of these works is estimated by the council to be £100,000.</P>
    <P>The proposed projects I outlined represent the top priority projects of only two coastal local authorities.  Proposals <Col N="276" /> have also been received from most other coastal local authorities.  As I already stated, the funding available for these works is £5.1 million over the period to the end of 1999.  The cost estimate of the proposals submitted to date amounts to almost £25 million.  Therefore, aid can be given to only a limited number of priority projects having regard to the economic, environmental and ecological benefits arising.  The Government is aware of the need for increased funding for coastal protection and will make every effort to provide additional funding for this area.  That said the £5.1 million, apart from being the first time that structural funding was made available for protection works, represents a significant increase in funding in recent years, where, for example, only £100,000 per annum was made available for capital works on coastal protection schemes during 1992 and 1993.  There is no need to remind Deputy Browne that his party was in Government during that period.</P>
    <P>This year, £670,000 has been allocated for coastal protection works.  The available funds will be utilised to continue the works at Rosslare Strand, County Wexford, and to commence a new scheme at Bray, County Wicklow.  I am pleased that my Department has designed a scheme to provide an optimum level of protection at Bray which will be undertaken on a phased basis over a three year period.  The scheme will cost £2.3 million and phase 1 will commence in late summer or early autumn this year.  The engineers in my Department are confident that this new scheme will provide a long term solution to the erosion problem at Bray.  I mention Bray as it was mentioned in the Opposition motion before the House.</P>
    <P>Other schemes are under consideration in the context of available funds and the priority projects identified by local authorities.</P>
    <P>I remind Deputies that they cannot speak simultaneously about increasing public expenditure and about controlling it.  It is time for them to make up their minds whether they want a <Col N="277" /> Government which will increase public expenditure beyond what it is capable of meeting, thus incurring the risk of higher interest rates and inflation.  The Government does not intend to go back to the bad old days of high spending.  It will manage its resources as best it can in line with the policy I outlined.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. Gilmore) Eamon Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. Gilmore)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister said, £670,000 has been allocated for coastal protection works during 1995.  It is more than the amount spent by the previous Government in the last three years.  Among the projects to be undertaken are a new scheme at Bray and the continuation of works at Rosslare Strand.</P>
      <P>The beach at Bray has been eroded to a depth of up to 12 feet over much of its length thus exposing the sea wall and promenade to the direct force of storm waves.  The loss of the beach has also resulted in overtopping of the sea wall with consequent flooding of the whole seafront area.  Erosion at Bray is a long standing problem.  In 1881, Bray town commissioners were given powers to build a wall to &ldquo;protect the Esplanade from the encroachments of the sea which are constantly taking place&rdquo;.  The sea wall and promenade was built in the years 1884-1886.  Two years after the wall was completed the promenade behind the wall was damaged due to a south-easterly gale.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present harbour was constructed between 1890 and 1895.  Since then there has been progressive erosion of the beach from the harbour southwards. As the beach dropped and receded southward there were numerous occasions of damage.  The most spectacular break occurred in 1941 when more than 500 metres of the sea wall was undermined.  A major scheme was undertaken by the Office of Public Works to rebuild the wall and underpin its foundations.  Subsequently more major works were undertaken in 1954 when steel sheet piling was installed to underpin a further section of the foundation. After that, works of varying sizes <Col N="278" /> were undertaken in 1970, 1979, 1980, 1981, 1982 and 1986.  Despite the efforts made over the last century the problem remains.</P>
    <P>The basic problem is that the sea wall type of protection technique is not the correct type of protection for the seafront at Bray.  The vertical faced wall carries the seeds of its own destruction. The breaking waves undermine the face of the wall.  The more the beach level is lowered, the higher the waves breaking at the wall and the greater the scouring force exerted by the waves.</P>
    <P>In 1990, the Department of the Marine, in an effort to identify a permanent solution to the erosion problem at Bray, engaged the services of Hydraulics Research Limited to undertake a model study of the Bray dynamics.  The near-shore littoral regime at Bray is both complex and varied and for that reason it was necessary to evaluate the situation and predict the potential changes resulting from the various protection options.</P>
    <P>Arising from the study undertaken, the Department of the Marine's Engineering Division has designed a scheme to provide an optimum level of protection at Bray.  This scheme, which is to be undertaken on a phased basis over a three year period, will involve the construction of a rock armoured breakwater extending for some 70 metres in length at right angles to the southern arm of Bray Harbour; the provision of a rock groyne extending at right angles from the promenade to control the littoral transport along the sea-front and the provision of shingle beach nourishment, to be obtained from offshore banks, to the beach fronting the promenade. This involves building up the beach to the level of the esplanade out a distance of 20 metres and then gently slopping down to below low tide for a further distance of about 40 metres.</P>
    <P>The scheme, which will cost some £2.3 million, will commence in late summer-early autumn this year.  Last night officials from the Department of the Marine met the members and officials of Bray Urban District Council to <Col N="279" /> explain the details of the scheme, and I am pleased to say that overwhelming support was expressed for it.</P>
    <P>On that note, I would like to give credit to the engineering staff of the Department of the Marine who have been unstinting in their efforts to assist local authorities in the design and completion of coast protection works.  The Department's engineers are confident that the new scheme will provide a long term solution to the erosion problem at Bray.</P>
    <P>The Department's engineers are also about to complete a scheme designed to provide a permanent solution to the erosion of Rosslare Strand, County Wexford.  This scheme forms one element of a European Union part-funded project entitled ECOPRO.  In June 1992, the ECOPRO project was selected for funding under the European Union's NORSPA framework. The project aims to develop a method for the assessment of coastal erosion, to devise a system for monitoring erosion and to optimise the selection of an appropriate response.  As the project title suggests, the emphasis will be on using environmentally friendly coastal protection techniques, sometimes known as &ldquo;soft engineering&rdquo;, wherever possible so as to mitigate the impact of coastal protection on the environment. These techniques attempt to emulate the natural processes rather than directly oppose them.  The final product of ECOPRO will be a code of practice. This will be of considerable use as a guide to current best practice.  It is hoped that this code will help those involved in coastal protection works avoid the instant palliative response to storm damage and also ensure that they look first at the &ldquo;soft engineering&rdquo; techniques. The code will also consider the question of grading the sensitivity of the coast to erosion.  This should prove particularly useful and will require practitioners to look at the erosion problem in a much wider context than they might otherwise.  It is intended that this code of practice will be completed in the next <Col N="280" /> 12 months or so and I am confident it will be of great benefit to coastal local authorities and landowners in understanding the dynamic nature of erosion and environmentally friendly protection techniques.</P>
    <P>In the ongoing struggle with the sea, there is a growing consensus among coastal protection practitioners that the line cannot and should not everywhere be held against the sea.  Three very important arguments, which everyone living in coastal areas should remember, underlie this view.  The first is geomorphological: erosion provides the sediment that builds up the natural coastal defences of other areas of coastline by forming marshes or beaches, shingle bars or mud flats.  The second is economic: sea walls for example cost anywhere between £1 million and £5 million per kilometre, depending on location and circumstances, and have a design life of 50 years maximum.  Away from urban areas, the benefits of preserving thin strips of land simply do not justify the cost.  The third is environmental: the natural mud flats and salt marshes of the coast are havens for thousands of birds and other wildlife.  These could be lost in any squeeze between protection works and sea level rises.  In many instances, therefore, the appropriate action is not protection but managed retreat.</P>
    <P>Earlier the Minister referred to the provision of £5.1 million under the Operational Programme for Environmental Services and the fact that a subsidiary but nonetheless important objective was the need to address the fragmented nature of coastline responsibility and to this end develop an integrated coastal zone management strategy. It is important to recognise that coastal erosion is only one of many concerns arising in relation to the coast.</P>
    <P>In view of this, an interdepartmental working group involving the Departments of the Marine and the Environment and the Office of Public Works has been established.  This group is investigating the establishment of an overall framework for coastal planning <Col N="281" /> and management covering land use planning and control, coastal protection, nature conservation, marine resource development, marine environmental parotection and the links between these.</P>
    <P>Coastal areas provide important shared resource benefits &mdash; recreational, aesthetic and economic &mdash; as well as accommodating many sensitive ecosystems. Such benefits could be endangered by future development if the coastal zone is not properly arranged.  It is intended therefore, to develop a comprehensive management policy for the entire coastal zone, both on the seaward and landward sides and to provide a framework for conservation and sustainable use.  Such a management policy will come from a dynamic process and will be based on the premise that the coastal zone, as a unit for both use and planning purposes, is an area which requires special attention.</P>
    <P>The intent of this comprehensive management process for the coastal zone is the promotion of sustainable use, the balancing of demand for coastal resources and the promotion of both environmentally sensitive use of, and strategic planning for, the coastal zone. The implementation of this policy will require an integrated approach.</P>
    <P>In order to progress the development of an overall policy for coastal zone management, the interdepartmental working group is about to commission a major consultancy study.  The group publicly sought preliminary submissions from interested parties and some 31 submissions were received.  These were examined in considerable detail by the group and five parties were invited to make a more detailed submission.  These have now been examined and it is hoped to award the contract very shortly.</P>
    <P>The consultancy, when awarded, will be required to make recommendations for a coastal zone management policy, taking account of the specific potential and problems of the coastal zone including issues arising from overlapping <Col N="282" /> administrative structures and boundaries. In particular, it should recommend an overall policy for coastal zone management at national and local level. The strategy study should consider and suggest the criteria to be used to delimit the coastal zone landwards and seawards in a flexible rather than spatially precise manner for the purposes of applying coastal zone management policy to the coastal zone or zones.  It should also provide a coherent framework for sustainable forms of development, having regard to existing responsibilities and structures, and should enable clear objectives to be set which would provide for a coherent overall policy for managing the coastal zone based on the principles of conservation and sustainable use.</P>
    <P>I am sure the House will recognise that the development of a coastal zone management policy will be of immense importance in the ongoing struggle to sustain the coastal resource and ensure it remains available for future generations. We must aim to achieve a balance between economic, social and environmental good.  The consultancy, when undertaken, will take about six months to complete.  I look forward to receiving the report.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Mr. Browne (Wexford) Mr. Browne (Wexford)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Wexford):</i> I support the motion so ably put by my colleague, Deputy Michael Smith.  Coastal erosion is recognised in Ireland as a major problem for landowners, seaside resorts and the environment generally.  There are major economic implications in this scenario both in terms of property and commercial activities in the areas affected.  We need a proper national strategy and a broadly based approach to the problems of coastal erosion. Ireland has over 1,500 kilometres of coastline at risk from coastal erosion, at least one third of which requires immediate action if we are to protect the livelihoods of farmers, business people, tourism operators, fishermen and the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every year thousands of acres of valuable lands are washed into the sea while <Col N="283" /> this Government stands idly by, paralysed by a lack of a proper coastal protection policy and a lack of funds.  The policy of local authorities appears to be to forget about saving or protecting acres of valuable farmlands.  The point made by Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív is relevant. The policy of county engineers and county councils seems to be that it is cheaper to let this land slip into the sea than to protect it.  This begs the question as to whether we should have a policy of compensation for farmers, particularly small farmers.  It is very difficult for a small farmer who loses three or four acres of land over a five or ten year period to survive.  The issue of compensation should be examined.</P>
    <P>The communities living along our coastline have been deserted by the Government and left to the ravages of the sea.  I call on the Minister for the Marine urgently to seek funds from the EU to tackle the major problem of coastal erosion.  I stress the need to develop a co-ordinated national coastal policy, including the production of guidelines for local authorities to draw up coastal management plans.  I welcome the statement by the Minister of State at the Department of the Marine, Deputy Gilmore, that the interdepartmental group has been working on this matter.  When I was Minister of State at the Department of the Environment I was involved with the Department of the Marine and the Office of Public Works in setting up this interdepartmental working group. Obviously they are making strong recommendations and are dealing with the entire coastline, not simply with coastal erosion.  I urge the Minister to ensure that the body which will take over responsibility will make a report as soon as possible.  It is important that there are no undue delays in making the required recommendations.</P>
    <P>Our coastline is under threat from both natural and man's activities.  Natural causes such as severe storms have caused extensive damage to the coastline in recent years.  The east coast has been severely affected by storms and <Col N="284" /> many communities there live in dread of the winters and the bad storms which affects their property and lands.  Man's activity such as the removal of beach materials is a serious problem for some authorities and a potentially more serious problem could arise in the future if there are moves to exploit offshore sand banks as sources of construction materials.  Both activities must be strictly controlled by our local authorities as failure to do so could be catastrophic for sections of the coastline.</P>
    <P>What plan of action has the Government to deal with the serious problem of coastal erosion?  I have listened to the two Ministers this evening and it seems there is no plan.  Every request to the Minister's Department for financial support is met with a negative response, despite the offer from local authorities and local communities to raise some finance towards the cost involved.  I admit there is money for the major schemes such as Rosslare and that is welcome, but for smaller areas which are very valuable to local communities for fishing, tourism and farming purposes, no funds are forthcoming from the department despite the fact that many local communities are prepared to raise significant amounts of money.</P>
    <P>We have heard case after case where local communities would be prepared to raise funds in the region of £15,000 to £30,000, where the county council would be prepared to give some financial aid, yet when they arrive at the Department of the Marine they are refused assistance. In an area where local communities are prepared to raise substantial amounts of money, the Department of the Marine should be prepared to look at cases on an individual basis and match them pound for pound.  Even in some of the cases outlined by the Minister £100,000 or £75.000 could solve their problem.  If the Department of the Marine was sympathetic to providing some funds there could be a three way split where local communities, the local authority and the Department of the Marine could set about funding a project and have the problem resolved at a <Col N="285" /> reasonable cost whereas if the problem becomes worse four or five years down the road the Department would possibly have to carry the full cost.  I urge the Minister seriously to consider making some funds available where communities are prepared to raise money.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister and his Department that erosion control cannot be treated in isolation.  We must have either regional or local coastal zone management plans for the entire coastline to enable the preservation of a priceless but diminishing and non-renewable resources.  EU policy would seem to favour this approach.  While funds generally are not available for coastal protection, there is a movement towards the development of a coherent strategy for coastal Europe.  The time is ripe for the Minister and the Government to go back to the EU and seek substantial funds to combat coastal erosion. A former Minister of the Marine, Deputy David Andrews managed to convince the EU, for the first time, to make funds available throught Structural Funds.  It is important that the Government should secure further funds because the £5.7 million or £5.9 million, which the Minister said will be available up to 1999, will go nowhere towards meeting the cost of implementing a coastal erosion policy in Ireland.  All we can do is deal with the bigger problems of coastal erosion while the smaller areas which are important to local communities are left to one side.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that money is being provided for Rosslare and Bray over the next two or three years.  I am pleased that substantial sums of money are going to Wicklow.  It is a pity we do not have a by-election from time to time in different constituencies to avail of the windfalls that come during a by-election. I welcome the money for Bray which has had severe problems over many years.  It is only right that the problem there should be tackled. The major schemes such as Rosslare, Bray and so on are being looked after while the smaller schemes are abandoned to the weather and communities are left to <Col N="286" /> the mercy of local authorities who have no money.</P>
    <P>What role does the Minister see for his Department in dealing with coastal erosion in the future?  Has his Department studied the way in which other countries deal with the problem?  In the UK, Denmark, the Netherlands and the USA there is a leaning towards coastal management rather than treating erosion in isolation.  Many suggestions have come from the Department of the Marine in recent times on how coastal erosion should be dealt with.  Governments have neglected the problem.  The Department of the Environment dealt with it on occasion.  The Department of Finance, through the Office of Public Works, was the last Department to deal with it before responsibility was transferred to the Department of the Marine. As no Department has the moneys required transferring responsibility from one Department to another has not solved this serious problem which I hope the Minister and Minister of State will face up to and deal with.</P>
    <P>Funds are required from the European Union for major capital projects and associated data collection.  While capital projects are important to deal with emergency cases the accumulation of basic data is vital, especially at a time of climatic change.  This includes information on water levels, tidal patterns, wind and wave data as well studies of sediment supply around the coast and of the natural process.</P>
    <P>Because of the lack of interest shown by the Government in dealing with coastal erosion the Minister of State should consider setting up a national coastal authority with responsibility for the development of the entire coastline. The National Coastal Erosion Committee in its report <i>Coastal Management &mdash; a case for action</i> makes a strong case for the establishment of such an authority and suggests a number of possible solutions to the problem.  I am sure that its recommendations have been considered by the Department of the Marine.  Does the Minister of State have any ideas on how some of these <Col N="287" /> might be implemented?  National coastal authorities are operating successfully in a number of other countries.  Such an authority would have the power to raise funds from local authorities, the general public and the European Union.  We should serously consider such possibility.</P>
    <P>Our seaside resorts and amenities &mdash; beaches, etc. &mdash; can be enjoyed by everyone.  The report to which I have referred states that no person is living more than 80 kilometres from a seaside resort.  It should not be left to the coastal counties to resolve the problem.  The cost must be met by the community generally. We must get the message across that any money spent on measures to tackle the problem of coastal erosion is money well spent in that it is for the protection of a vital and valuable national asset.</P>
    <P>The coastal erosion problem has an impact on the economy to the extent that as it affects the development of the tourism industry, fishing, farming and other developments along the coastline. The Minister and the Government should realise that communities are enduring hardship in the fight against coastal erosion.  We have not faced up to this problem and have let the people living in coastal counties down.  I call on the Minister to give a lead.  The European Union is not eager to make funds available because of the large sums required but we must take the fight to it and encourage it to make as much funding available as possible.</P>
    <P>While I appreciate that the problem is serious in counties such as Waterford it is more severe in County Wexford. Areas such as Rosslare Strand, Courtown, Cahore, Ballyconnigar, Ardamine, Pollshone, Curracloe, Ballyteigue, Cullenstown, Morriscastle, Tinaberna, Clone, Ballyvaldon and Ballyvaloo have been severely affected for many years. These are valuable tourist resorts where amenities such as caravan parks are provided and it is of importance to the economy of County Wexford and its tourism sector in particular that moneys <Col N="288" /> be made available to combat this serious problem.</P>
    <P>Wexford County Council has been to the forefront in devising strategies to deal with the problem of coastal erosion but is being hampered because of the lack of funds.  In a report prepared in September 1991 the county engineer stated that it would cost £15.2 million to rectify the problem in nine of the 15 areas I have mentioned.  No county council would ever be in a position to cope with such a financial burden.  It therefore needs financial support.  It is important for us to impress upon the Government the need to secure extra funding from the European Union.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned Rosslare Strand.  I acknowledge that the Government has made funds available to deal with the problem of coastal erosion at this location.  Rosslare is one of our major holiday resorts and the gateway to Europe.  Over one million people pass through the harbour each year.  It has a valuable hotel industry which provides employment throughout the year and an important golf course which attracts many visitors to the area as well as many other public amenities.  It is only right therefore that the Government should continue to provide funds to solve the problem of coastal erosion at Rosslare Strand.  It seems, however, that most of the money has been allocated to certain areas&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I suggest to the Minister of State, Deputy Gilmore, that it is important that he continue to try to secure extra funding from the European Union to combat the problem of coastal erosion. The Government cannot provide the amount required to solve the problem; a substantial allocation is required from the European Union.  The former Minister, Deputy Andrews, secured extra funding from this source.  The Minister, Deputy Barrett, and the Minister of State should continue to fight in Europe to secure extra funding for the period 1995-98 and not accept the figure of £5.7 million or £5.9 million.  A sum of £15 million is required in County Wexford alone during the next five years to deal with the problem.</P>
      <P>It is not good enough to say that the previous Government negotiated the deal under which we will receive over £5 million.  It is up to this Government to seek an increase in the amount we received.  If it does, it will be a job well done.  From the speeches of both Ministers, apart from dealing with the problem in Bray, which is very important, there is very little money in the kitty for the rest of the country, and that is regrettable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>The maritime unit of Customs and Excise in Waterford is equipped with a sea-going boat to combat smuggling and particularly the importation of drugs, which is the cause of considerable problems in the city and surrounding areas.  Unfortunately, because of a disagreement among staff the boat has lain idle since August 1994. In the wake of the Maastricht Treaty <Col N="290" /> the duties of Customs and Excise officers have changed in many cases but there has been a reluctance to accept change by some staff.</P>
      <P>In this instance a dispute has arisen as to who will operate the Customs and Excise boat.  Pre-Maastricht it would have been the duty of the outside staff but post-Maastricht the duties may be shared between indoor and outdoor staff.  I think we are all aware that as a result of the passage of the Maastricht Treaty Customs and Excise staff were reassigned to various duties; in particular they were removed from the Border and assigned to other duties.</P>
      <P>In Waterford the outdoor staff want to retain their duties and do not want the staff who previously worked indoor to share in the performance of those duties. As a consequence the boat and gear which cost approximately £60,000 have not been used for the past ten months. In addition, a jeep for hauling the boat, which cost approximately £25,000, is also lying idle.  The cost of storing the equipment in question is in the region of £8,000 to £10,000 per annum.  There are two major scandals involved here: first, a waste of public money and, second, a reduction in the capacity of Customs and Excise to prevent the smuggling of drugs. As I understand it, no blame attaches to senior management in Waterford who have done everything in their power to resolve the problem.  I ask the Minister to intercede immediately to ensure this scandalous position is rectified without delay.</P>

      <P>I apologise on behalf of the Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, who is unable to be here but I will certainly convey Deputy Deasy's views to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position is that the Waterford maritime unit in common with the units located in Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Sligo, is used mainly to act on information received and to support intelligence gathering operations.  The semirigid inflatable craft are suitable only for inshore use or for use close to the shoreline. Their use is also restricted <Col N="291" /> depending on weather conditions.  They are not suitable as patrol craft.</P>
    <P>The Waterford maritime unit has not operated in recent times because there has been no operational requirements for its use in the Waterford region.  The costs involved are the normal maintenance and running costs which are determined by the extent to which the craft is used and rent for the secure storage of the craft.  The unit is staffed on a part-time basis with staff being assigned as required.</P>
    <P>The commissioners have had under consideration the location of their maritime units from the point of view of their effectiveness.  They have now decided that the craft located in Waterford should be relocated to Cork.  They consider that having two craft in Cork would be a more effective use of resources, having regard to the dangers faced by the level of drug smuggling encountered along the south-west coast. It is also the situation that the training of staff for maritime duties is carried out in Cork, and having two craft located there will ensure that one is always available for operational purposes if the other is in use for training.  It is also pointed out that all the craft are capable of being transported between locations and launched to meet operational requirements.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will recall that his Department requested a waste management plan in the various health authorities, the reasons being to minimise the impact of waste on the environment and to bring about better conditions generally for those handling waste.  Incinerators which operated in University Hospital, Cork and St. Finbarr's Hospital were closed down on 22 October 1994 because their emissions <Col N="292" /> were outside the permitted limits.  In October it was decided to export the waste until a microwave unit was put in place.  Such a unit which had been recommended by the Department was tried and tested, it is now in place and matters are proceeding satisfactorily.</P>
      <P>There is a cost involved in implementing a strategic management plan for waste, while the health board has complied with the request from the Department of Health, no funding has been provided.  The Minister should take into account that between October and the end of March the cost of exporting waste from St. Finbarr's, University Hospital Cork and other hospitals was £350,000.  In addition, putting in place the microwave unit on a lease basis costs a further £600,000 per annum.</P>
      <P>The Southern Health Board stands to lose almost £1 million by keeping up to date, as requested by the Department, and in line with what the Minister for the Environment has introduced in terms of waste management.  That health board does not have £1 million pounds to throw away and unless and until the Department is willing to provide such funding vital hospital and patient services will be hit.  At the end of the financial year that health board will encounter major difficulties.  As recently as last week that health board encountered major difficulties in providing hospital beds for patients with acute illnesses and operations had to be postponed as the board did not have the necessary resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister is demanding that standards be put in place for proper waste management he will have to pay the piper.  Members of that health board will hold the Minister and his Department responsible if money is not forthcoming when vital services are affected in the autumn.  For that reason it is timely to indicate that this provision should be made.  I ask the Minister to ensure that almost £9.500 is made available to the Southern Health Board to alleviate the cost of putting in place a <Col N="293" /> proper waste management system, as requested by him and his Department.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy O'Keeffe for giving me the opportunity of responding to this question.</P>
      <P>Waste disposal in the health services in a manner that is safe, efficient, environmentally friendly and cost-effective has become a very difficult problem to resolve.  Considerable progress is being made in tackling this problem, although there are still many difficulties to be overcome, not least in the technical field.  The approach of the Department to solving the problem of disposal of healthcare waste is one which has four stages: (1) putting in place an environmentally conscious healthcare waste policy; (2) examination of the technical and organisational options for the treatment and final disposal of healthcare waste; (3) preparation of a strategic plan for an integrated system for the treatment and final disposal of healthcare risk waste on a nationwide basis: and (4) implementation, following consultations, of the strategic plan.</P>
      <P>The first stage has been completed and the policy document has been issued to health agencies.  The policy promotes good waste management practices, including prevention, reduction and segregation as well as the preparation of waste management plans by each hospital.</P>
      <P>A strategic plan for an integrated system for the treatment and final disposal of healthcare risk waste has also been circulated to the health agencies.  The plan proposes four central treatment facilities nationally, two in Dublin, one in Cork and one in Galway, utilising one or more of the new technologies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Southern Health Board has started a pilot scheme using the microwave process of pre-treatment by decontamination and shredding of healthcare waste prior to disposal.  I accept that this new method of treatment is more expensive than the previous incineration method and the question of increasing the board's revenue <Col N="294" /> allocation for 1995 to cover the extra cost will be considered in the light of the results of the public scheme.  It is not possible at this stage to determine the precise additional annual cost that will be involved and discussions in this regard are ongoing between officials in my Department and the health board.</P>

      <P>Tá an-díoma orm an dara seachtain as a chéile nárabh fhiú leis an Aire teacht isteach agus éisteacht lena bhfuil le rá sa Teach seo.  Ní fios dom cé mhéid rún a d'ardaigh mé ar an Athló a bhain leis an Roinn Oideachais ó toghadh i mo Theachta Dála mé.  Ach ní dóigh liom gur tharla sé oiread agus uair amháin go raibh an tAire féin ann le mé a fhreagairt.  D'fhéadfaí mé a cheartú ar an méid sin ach tá mé a cheapadh go bhfuil an ceart agam.  Cuireann sé as dom nach fiú léi plé le gnótha a bhaineann go díreach léi.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>De réir mar a thuigim an scéal seo, baineann ceist an Ghúim leis an Aire Oideachais agus leis an Aire Ealaíon, Cultúir agus Gaeltachta.  Mura raibh sí féin in ann a bheith i láthair is cúis áiféala é freisin nach raibh mo chomhghleacaí as mo Dháilcheantar féin, an tAire Ealáion.  Cultúir agus Gaeltachta in ann a bheith i láthair ach oiread leis an gceist seo a thógáil.  Bíodh sin mar atá ba mhaith liom a mholadh go n-aistreofaí An Gúm siar go dtí an Ghaeltacht agus, más féidir, go Gaeltacht Conamara, go Ros Muc.  Is iomaí údar atá agam leis an moladh go mba cheart An Gum a aistriú go Ros Muc.  Ar an gcéad dul síos tá baint ag an nGúm le foilsiú leabhar agus tá cáil ar Ros Muc ar fud na tíre agus go deimhin taobh amuigh den tír mar áit ar fháisc litríocht an-mhaith as.  Níl le déanamh agam ach tagairt a dhéanamh mar shampla do <Col N="295" /> Phádraic Ó Conaire, do Phádraic Óg Ó Conaire agus don Phiarsach féin a chuaigh siar go Ros Muc ag foghlaim na Gaeilge.  Sa lá atá inniu ann is pobal é Ros Muc a bhfuil an imirce agus an t-ísliú daonra tar éis scrios a dhéanamh air le 40 bliain.  Thaispeánfadh figiúr amháin é seo, is é sin go bhfuil laghdú 40 faoin gcéad tagtha ar dhaonra Ros Muc le 40 bliain anuas.  Is é sin le rá íslíonn an daonra aon faoin gcéad gach bliain.</P>
    <P>Mar sin tá géarchéim ní amháin ó thaobh na Gaeilge de i Ros Muc ach níos tábhachtaí tá géarchéim ann sa mhéid nach mbeidh éinne fágtha ansin go gairid.  Ag an am céanna tá áisíneacht ag an Rialtas a bhfuil gá lena fhorbairt. Tá gá go ndéanfaí An Gúm a fhorbairt sa chaoi is go mbeidh sé in ann téacsleabhair a chur ar fáil do na gaelscoileanna ar fud na tíre agus do na scoileanna eile a bhfuil spéis acu i dtéacsleabhair Ghaeilge.</P>
    <P>Cén áit níb fhearr len é sin a dhéanamh ná sa Ghaeltacht?  Cén áit níb fhearr lena chinntiú gurb í gnáththeanga an phobail a bheadh sna téacsleabhair seo ná thiar i Ros Muc?  Le fada tá an bheirt Aire ag rá go bhfuil siad ag breathnú ar an gceist, féachaint cé acu a bheadh freagrach as An Gúm. Tá sé thar am an cheist sin a fhreagairt agus cinneadh a dhéanamh, ní cé bheidh freagrach an An Gúm ach cá mbeidh sé. Cén mhaith é a fhágáil báite thuas anseo sa phríomhchathair, áit ina bhfuil iliomad gníomhaireachtaí, áit nach ndéanfadh gníomhaíocht bheag ar nós An Gúm mórán difríochta ó thaobh fostaíochta de?  Cén fáth nach gcuirfí siar é go pobal a ndéanfadh sé a leas go hiomlán da mbeadh an cineál fostaíochta a bheadh i gceist leis An Gúm curtha ar fáil ann?  Ba shlánú do Ros Muc é dá gcuirfí An Gúm siar ann.  Feictear dom go mba shlánú don Gúm é freisin mar bheadh sé mór, tábhachtach agus bheadh meas air i Ros Muc.  Ar deireadh tá sé in am ag an tír seo tosú ag tabhairt cúnaimh do phobail atá ag obair ar a son féin.  I gcás mhuintir Ros Muc tá iarracht mhór déanta acu le cupla bliain anuas teacht aniar aduaidh <Col N="296" /> ar na fadhbanna atá acu.  Ní beag le háireamh.</P>
    <P>Ní beag le háireamh, mar shampla, go bhfuil áiseanna spóirt curtha ar fáil dóibh féin, go bhfuil £15,060 bailithe acu le páirc pheile a thógáil.  Tá sé in am fóirithint a dhéanamh ar na pobail bheaga seo agus mar sin ba mhaith liom iarraidh ar an Aire nó ar an Aire Stáit a chur i láthair an Aire go n-aistreofaí An Gúm siar go Conamara láithreach.</P>

Glacann an Rialtas go bhfuil fíorthábhacht ag baint leis an Ghaeilge i saol, i gcultúr agus in oidhreacht na tíre.  Tá sé mar pholasaí ag an Rialtas úsáid na Gaeilge a chothú agus a leathnú i ngnáthshaol an phobail i gcoitinne agus phobal na Gaeltachta ach go háirithe.  Chun na críche seo, leanfar le feabhas a chur ar an seirbhísí Stáit atá ar fáil trí mheán na Gaeilge.</P>
      <P>I gcomhthéacs an pholasaí seo aontaíodh mar chuid de chlár an Rialtais &mdash;<i>A Government of Renewal</i>&mdash; go n-aistreofaí An Gúm ón Roinn Oideachais go dtí An Roinn Ealaíon.

    <Speaker pid="NedOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. E. O'Keeffe Mr. E. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you for allowing me to raise this matter on the <Col N="297" /> Adjournment and the Minister for Enterprise and Employment for coming into the House to reply.</P>
      <P>The recent and well signalled problems of one of our largest newspaper publishers have evoked much sympathy for the print, distribution, commercial and administration workforce involved. The demise of old titles brings out the best of us.  However, the readers and advertisers did not like the product enough to support it and make it financially viable.  New competent management with commercial instincts, adequate financial strengths and an unrestricted workforce of 300 may, I hope, be able to relaunch some of the Press group titles.</P>
      <P>The long term future of other newspapers is also a matter of concern.  Competition is tough in the marketplace and while we write reams and talk tirelessly of dominance in our print media, we may be aiming at the wrong target. Where is the Competition Authority report on the Independent group?  Can it be presented to the Dáil?</P>
      <P>Since the launch of the <i>Evening Press</i> approximately 40 years ago there have been many changes.  The <i>Evening Mail</i> is gone and the <i>Sunday Review</i>, the <i>Sunday Journal</i> and the <i>Sunday Tribune</i> mark 1 have all come and gone.  The <i>Sunday World</i> and <i>The Star</i>&mdash; papers with many aspects of a successful UK formula &mdash; have been success stories and publication of the <i>Sunday Tribune</i> mark 2 continues.  The most significant change started with a trickle in 1947, aided by air freight since 1949.  In the last decade of this century English newspapers and tabloids present major competition to Irish organs.  Since they started publishing Irish editions, the British commonwealth publishers are well placed to fill the void created by a silent <i>Sunday Press.</i>  The <i>Sunday World</i> circulation has increased due to competition and the other recent successful entrant to the market, <i>The Star</i>, is 50 per cent UK owned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Are the <i>Cork Examiner, The Irish Times</i> and the <i>Irish Independent</i> safe? <Col N="298" /> Big names have already fallen in Washington, New York and London.  With the economies of scale enjoyed by British tabloids and the price wars the London broadsheets can maintain due to very rich owners who like a fight, Irish newspapers selling at 80 pence to £1 are exposed.  Each Irish daily can cost up to £5.70 per week whereas, on average, English tabloids cost £2.70 per week, the lowest being £2.40 per week; English qualities are even cheaper.</P>
    <P>While the National Newspapers of Ireland has, with some justification, complained about the price of British newspapers here, the Competition Authority was not impressed.  Even if the National Newspapers of Ireland make a better case, European competition law may favour UK publishers.  If it is not possible to force an increase in UK prices, can Irish papers reduce their charges?  In an effort to avoid a recurrence of recent events, radical changes in production methods and costs, together with the pooling of resources, are urgently required.  This should be done now, otherwise it may be too late.</P>
    <P>In the short term Sunday and daily newspapers, including English newspapers, should be exempted from VAT. Similar revenue could be raised by a newspaper registration tax shared on the basis of circulation, similar to the bank levy on deposits.  In that way, Irish newspapers would benefit by approximately £3 million per annum.  I urge the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, to request his colleague the Minister for Finance to make this revenue neutral change.  It would protect Irish jobs and would not affect the considerable workforce involved in distributing and selling English newspapers here.  I look forward to a satisfactory reply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton) Richard Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will have to forgive me if my response is more unprepared than the norm because I did not realise that under the heading of &ldquo;the price of newspapers in Ireland&rdquo;, the Deputy would raise such <Col N="299" /> a wide range of issues.  I will attempt, however, to respond to them.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt that Irish newspapers have faced price competition which has caused difficulties in the market.  Over the past 20 years the price of Irish newspapers has increased by 90 per cent in real terms &mdash; 90 per cent faster than the cost of living &mdash; pushing up the real price of Irish newspaper titles. While the price of British titles also increased during that period, the increase was only half that real rate. Therefore, in recent years Irish newspapers have become more expensive relative to British newspapers and this has adversely affected the marketplace. At a time when the sale of British titles has been increasing there has been a decrease in sales of Irish titles.  The Deputy correctly indicated this is not solely a question of price and that much of what happened in recent years resulted from the rapid growth of tabloids. The 16 per cent increase in the sale of daily newspapers was entirely driven by the increase in tabloid newspaper titles. The tabloid market is dominated by British titles which sell 60 per cent more per week than Irish titles. As the Deputy pointed out, the emergence of <i>The Star</i> brought an Irish presence to the daily tabloid market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy correctly identified the tough competition from British titles. The Competition Authority considered the issue of predatory pricing, the only issue that would be amenable to competition law.  Authority concluded that predatory pricing which has a specific meaning in competition law was not taking place.  First, one must prove dominance in the market concerned second, that the paper is being sold below cost and, third, that the intention was to inflict damage from which the newspaper inflicting the damage would benefit. Under none of those headings did <Col N="300" /> the Competition Authority find that action by the British newspapers constituted a breach of law and as a result did not conclude that there was predatory pricing.</P>
    <P>I know that the National Newspapers of Ireland are anxious to look at a different issue, namely, simply the banning of below-cost selling, which would be a new issue not covered by competition law which would, of course, require careful assessment.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy knows, there is no detailed price control in Ireland at present; that has been abandoned since 1986 with the support of all Governments since then.  However, we are determined that the effectiveness of competition law will be enhanced.  I am glad that all parties in the House are supportive of measures to give the Competition Authority enforcement powers to allow it to investigate third party complaints about unfair competition and instigate its own investigations. Stronger competition powers will be important in ensuring there is fair play.</P>
    <P>The other issue Deputy O'Keeffe rightly raised is the need for our newspaper industry to address its costs problems. As I indicated earlier, there is no doubt that the price increases have been out of line with the British press and our newspapers face serious problems as the costs of many of the British titles are much lower.  This has not arisen solely from longer production runs; there is an issue there remaining to be addressed by the industry.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also raised two issues in relation to tax.  As he rightly pointed out, essentially these are matters for the Minister for Finance to whose attention I will draw the Deputy's views on this matter which, in turn, would have to be considered within the context of budgetary preparation.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.5 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 8 June 1995.</P>

    <P>In order to assist schools in preparing for the introduction of the programmes, <Col N="111" /> three groups are currently working with my Department.</P>
    <P>First, I have asked the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment to develop curriculum guidelines, teaching and learning strategies and assessment-evaluation procedures.</P>
    <P>Second, I have established an implementation group, representative of my Department, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment and the Partners in Education.</P>
    <P>Third, I have established an interdepartmental group, representative of my Department and the Department of Health.</P>
    <P>A programme of in-service training in connection with the Relationships and Sexuality Education Programme will be initiated following receipt of the report of the Implementation Group and the guidelines being prepared by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment.</P>
    <P>Adequate in-career development is vital to the success of the relationships and sexuality programme and, indeed, such in-career development programmes have been demanded by the teacher unions.  It would be a great shame if the programme of relationships and sexuality education, which has been so warmly received by the partners in education, or the associated in-career development programme, were to be jeopardised by the current industrial relations difficulties.</P>

      <P>The number of traveller <Col N="112" /> children enrolled in special schools and special classes over the period in question was 2,039 in 1990; 2,149 in 1991; 2,170 in 1992; 2,352 in 1993 and 2,498 in 1994.  Approximately 250 traveller children attend the Junior Education Centres.  Also, some 550 travellers attend Senior Training Centres which cater for travellers in the 16-25 year age group.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that approximately 1,500 additional traveller children attend ordinary primary schools on a fully integrated basis.  Information regarding attendance by traveller children in mainstream second level schools is not readily available.</P>
      <P>There is also an absence of data on the ages at which traveller children leave the school system.  However, the indications are that the majority withdraw at around the ages of 12 or 13 years.  With a view to clarifying the position, I intend that a quantitative/ qualitative survey of traveller education at first and second levels, including attendance patterns, will be undertaken this year.</P>
      <P>The White Paper on Education recognises that the participation rates of traveller children in the education system are still unacceptably low.</P>
      <P>To address this, a series of targets is proposed.  These include:</P>
      <P>all traveller children of primary school age being enrolled and participating fully in primary education, according to their individual abilities and potential, within five years;</P>
      <P>at second-level, all traveller children of school-going age completing junior cycle education and 50 per cent completing the senior cycle within ten years.</P>
      <P>As part of the strategy to achieve these targets.  I intend that a further 15 teachers should be appointed this year to the Visiting Teacher Service for travellers.</P>

      <P>I am aware that the strong view of many of those involved in the provision of adult education is that it should be treated as an integral part of the education system.  I share that objective.  The White Paper on Education states that &ldquo;adult education and training will be an integral part of the framework for the future development of education&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The objective of integration will be assisted by the establishment of the Further Education Authority which will provide a coherent national development framework for adult and continuing education.  The Authority will ensure that each education board has arrangements in place for the development of adult education in line with identified needs.  The Authority and the education boards will encourage a wider range of second level schools to provide programmes and activities in this area.</P>
      <P>The measures will promote the integration of adult and continuing education into mainstream education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, the White Paper explicitly provides that an important consideration in the future approach to adult education policy will involve &ldquo;the integration by schools and colleges of adult education into their mainstream planning processes and the affording of a status to adult education commensurate with its importance&rdquo;.  It also states that learning is a lifelong process and that it should build on the foundation of formal schooling and in this way is, of <Col N="114" /> course, an integral part of the education system.</P>

      <P>I am aware that the school in question has applied for inclusion in the disadvantaged areas scheme.  To date, the level of need demonstrated by the school in its submission to my Department, relative to the competing needs of other schools, has not resulted in its inclusion in the scheme. However, I can assure the Deputy that the needs of the school will be considered in the event of an expansion of the scheme being undertaken.</P>
      <P>Schools are selected for inclusion in the scheme on the basis of priority of needs as reflected by a range of socioeconomic indicators.  Factors taken into account include the incidence of unemployment, local authority housing occupancy and medical card holders among the parents of the children concerned. Account is also taken of the views of my Department's inspectorate on the relative levels of need between schools and the prevailing pupil teacher ratios.</P>
      <P>The approach currently adopted was agreed by a working party comprised of representatives of school management, the Irish National Teachers' Organisation and my Department and has been in place for some years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have commissioned the Combat Poverty Agency to conduct a detailed study of current approaches to the identification and support of pupils in disadvantaged areas.  The criteria used to determine eligibility for inclusion in the disadvantaged areas scheme will be <Col N="115" /> among the matters covered by this study.  I expect to receive a report on the outcome of this study by the end of June and this will provide a basis for the development of future approaches in this area.</P>
    <P>I should also mention that as this school is a Gaelscoil it has an additional teaching post and receives 50 per cent additional capitation grant.</P>

      <P>I am not aware of any recent survey which addressed the level of morale in the teaching profession as a whole.  In November 1994 the INTO published a report entitled <i>A Career in Teaching</i> which contained the results of a survey of a sample of primary teachers.  In that survey, teachers were asked to indicate their level of morale.</P>
      <P>Under the heading &ldquo;<i>Morale of Teachers</i>&rdquo; teachers in the sample were asked to indicate their current level of morale.  The replies received (361) were presented as high 47 per cent; neutral 35 per cent; low 18 per cent.  A summary of the survey indicated that, of the various aspects of their careers affecting their morale, teachers were most concerned about the lack of a continuum of teacher education, the lack of promotional opportunities, barriers to promotion and the status of primary teaching as an occupation.</P>
      <P>Issues addressed in the White Paper include proposals in relation to pre-service education, in-career development, the establishment of a teaching council, the restructuring of posts of responsibility, the introduction of comprehensive school planning processes, the development of a teacher welfare service and agreed systems for appraising teachers.  These proposals are aimed at ensuring that teachers enjoy a cogenial working life, develop opportunities for increasing self-esteem, personal development and influence in the decision making process in their respective schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am also addressing what the INTO publication identified as objective aspects of career of concern to teachers. These were the length of the salary scale, the payment of qualifications allowances to 8,000 teachers who are non-degree holders, and promotion posts.  These issues were the subject of <Col N="118" /> recent offers made to the teacher unions in negotiations under the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i></P>

      <P>A number of ordinary primary schools will be designated by the education boards as centres where children with particular disabilities may be educated.  The key criterion in selecting such schools will be the level of special needs in a particular area.  In addition, designated schools will have to be centrally located in the regions they serve and have suitable facilities available to accommodate their role in dealing with children with disabilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another important consideration in the selection process will be that all those involved in the school should be <Col N="120" /> positively disposed towards catering for children with disabilities and willing to integrate these children with other children to the maximum possible extent. Finally, schools will have to be willing to work closely with other agencies providing support services for children with disabilities, including psychologists, speech therapists, social workers and visiting teachers.</P>
    <P>The fundamental objectives of the commitment in the White Paper to which the Deputy refers is to ensure to the maximum possible extent that all children with disabilities will have access to suitably resourced education services in their own area and within the ordinary school system.  There will always be cases where the severity of a child's disability is such that placement in a special school may be the preferred option.  However, I am most anxious that, wherever possible, children with disabilities should have the opportunity of sharing their school experience with their peers through participation in the ordinary school system.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The recent White Paper on Education stresses the importance of continuity in the teaching of Irish between primary and second level education.  It states <Col N="122" />&ldquo;the aim is to build on the knowledge and skills developed during the primary years, allowing the students to acquire such competence as will enable them to achieve success and satisfaction in learning Irish&rdquo; Page 49.</P>
    <P>At primary level the White Paper puts the emphasis on achieving basic oral and aural skills, the acquisition of a knowledge of the basic structures of the Irish language and on developing an awareness of Irish history and culture.</P>
    <P>This objective is fully consistent with, and supportive of, the policy intention to increase the proportion of marks awarded for oral and aural competence for Irish and other modern languages in the junior and leaving certificate examinations.</P>
    <P>The existing structure and procedures of the NCCA will ensure that community is achieved.  Regular consulation takes place between the council's primary and post primary specialist personnel on the question of continuity.</P>

      <P>Provision exists for the payment of grants in respect of pupils whose homes are outside the range of transport services to a second-level school providing suitable post-primary education.  To qualify for this grant, an applicant must be resident at least three miles from a centre where suitable free post-primary education is available, or from a pick-up point on a bus route to such a centre, and be a recognised pupil <Col N="126" /> in a boarding school in which the boarding or lodgings fee charged to parents does not exceed £1,700 per pupil per annum.</P>
      <P>All eligible students receive a grant of eight-fifteenths (8/15) of the total boarding fee charged to parents.  An additional allowance of seven-fifteenths (7/15) of the boarding fee is payable, which brings the boarding grant to 100 per cent in the case of needy applicants whose sole income consists of social welfare assistance or in the case of other applicants whose income does not exceed £9,100 per annum, with a further £299 for each dependent child after the first child.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 39 and 53 together.</P>
      <P>The general legislative provisions regarding the supervision of pre-school services are contained in the 1991 Child Care Act.  These matters are the responsibility of the Minister for Health.</P>
      <P>My Department provides a range of educational initiatives in the pre-school area.  These include the early start pre-school programme, the pre-school service for traveller children and the Rutland Street pre-school project.  Each of these initiatives has a particular focus.  I do not propose to extend these services to all schools.</P>
      <P>I established the Early Start Pre-school pilot programme in September 1995 and I propose to establish a further 25 pre-schools under this programme in the coming school year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From September next, the special capitation grant paid in respect of this <Col N="129" /> programme will be increased to £65 per pupil which represents an increase of £10 per pupil on the current rate.</P>
    <P>A special grant of £4,500 is paid in respect of each pre-school class to facilitate the purchase of necessary materials and equipment.  A grant of £1,500 is also provided to each pre-school for the development of parental involvement in the programme.</P>
    <P>The objective of the early start programme is to provide young children with an educational programme which will enhance their overall development and lay a foundation for successful attainment in future years.  The service is being targeted on areas of particular disadvantage.</P>
    <P>My Department also provides grant-aid towards the cost of tuition for 700 traveller children attending 57 pre-schools operated by voluntary organisations. My Department also funds the provision of special transport services for the children in question.</P>
    <P>In addition, my Department meets the total operating costs of the Rutland Street pre-school project which has been in existence for many years.  The project was established to address the problems of educational disadvantage in the area in question.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied with the level of funding provided in each of the pre-school areas with which my Department is involved.</P>
    <P>I am fully aware of the valuable work being done by many local voluntary and community groups in catering for children of pre-school age.  However, it should be recognised that the pre-school educational initiatives supported by my Department have a fundamentally different focus from the social development and care orientation of such voluntary initiatives.</P>

      <P>The staffing of a national school for a particular year is determined by the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous year.</P>
      <P>The total enrolment of the school referred to by the Deputy, on 30 September 1994, was 88 pupils, which warrants a staffing in the 1995-96 school year of a principal and two assistants.</P>
      <P>I regret that it will not be possible to depart from agreed procedures in this case.  Accordingly, the post of third assistant will be suppressed at the end of the current school year.  The teacher in question has been given the option of having her name placed on the diocesan panel for redeployment, which will not take place before 1 September 1995.</P>
      <P>I should also point out to the Deputy that the school has the services of a shared remedial teacher.</P>
      <P>If the school is in breach of the maximum class size guidelines in the 1995-96 school year, the school authorities should submit enrolments to my Department in September 1995.</P>

      <P>I am aware that certain primary schools experience difficulties with funding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="133" /> My Department provides funding towards the day-to-day running costs of primary schools through capitation grants.  Schools are required to match the capitation grant with a local contribution of £10 per pupil or £9.50 in the case of schools designated disadvantaged. Some local communities choose to raise the local contribution by fundraising.</P>
    <P>I have secured substantial increases in the capitation grant for primary schools since taking office.  The standard rate of capitation grant has been increased from a level of £28 in 1992, to £33 in 1993, £38 in 1994 and £40 in 1995.  These increases amount to a cumulative 43 per cent increase on the 1992 rates.</P>
    <P>Significant additional funding, over and above the standard capitation increases, is provided in the case of pupils with special needs and also for schools designated as disadvantaged.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the increases which I have made represent a very positive step towards improving the financial position of primary schools.</P>
    <P>It is my intention to further increase funding to primary schools as resources permit.</P>

      <P>The White Paper on Education recognises the fundamental importance of an effective system of assessment in order to ensure the earliest possible identification of pupils with special needs.</P>
      <P>Although some children will have been identified as having special needs before commencing school, the classroom teacher carries the main responsibility for identifying and responding to learning difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The White Paper also states that all <Col N="139" /> primary schools will be required to develop a policy on assessment within the framework of the school plan.</P>
    <P>At present, responsibility for arranging assessments of primary school children rests with the regional health boards, through the appropriate Director of Community Care.  However, it is intended to develop the school psychological service on a phased basis to undertake an expanded role in this area.</P>
    <P>In the current year, the number of psychologists attached to this service is being increased from nine to 19.  My intention is to maintain the momentum in the coming years to ensure full national coverage by the service.  Remediation of learning difficulties can take a variety of forms depending on the particular needs of the individual child.</P>
    <P>In the majority of cases, access to the remedial teacher service would be the most appropriate response.  When more serious learning problems arise, a more suitable response may involve placement in a special class in an ordinary school or in a special school dedicated to the particular needs identified.  A range of such facilities is currently provided.</P>
    <P>The White Paper proposes that the existing range of services will be further refined to ensure that all special needs children will have access to the necessary support services in their own areas, wherever possible.</P>
    <P>My Department is currently drawing up an action plan to give effect to the objectives set out in the White Paper, including those in relation to special needs.  This action plan will identify the measures required and a time-frame for their introduction.</P>

      <P>An analysis of expenditure on ESF-aided training courses for the hotel, catering and tourism industry which are provided by colleges in conjunction with CERT indicates that, in the period 1990-93 a total of £23.09 million was expended on such activity.  The analysis of ESF-aided expenditure in 1994 is being carried out at present. These courses are delivered in the regional technical colleges in Athlone, Cork, Galway, Sligo, Tallaght, Tralee and Waterford as well as Dublin Institute of Technology Cathal Brugha Street and the Tourism College in Killybegs.  Separate costings are not available for non-ESF-aided activity.</P>

      <P>My Department has responsibility for ensuring that all pupils, regardless of their personal circumstances, have a right of access to and participation in the education system, according to their potential and ability.</P>
      <P>The term &ldquo;special needs&rdquo; was defined by the Special Education Review Committee as including:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;All pupils whose disabilities and-or circumstances prevent or hinder them from benefiting adequately from the education which is normally provided for pupils of the same age, or for whom the education which can generally be provided in the ordinary classroom is not sufficiently challenging&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>My Department has responsibility for ensuring that the diverse educational needs of all of these groups are adequately met.  This involves the provision of a range of special support services tailored to the needs of pupils with disabilities and those whose socio-economic circumstances are such that special education supports are required.</P>
      <P>In the case of children with disabilities, provision is made through a range of special schools and special classes and through the delivery of special support services in ordinary schools.  In addition, a special school transport service is provided for pupils attending special schools and classes.</P>
      <P>In the case of children from disadvantaged backgrounds, support is provided through the disadvantaged areas schemes, which target ex-quota teaching posts and extra funding for the schools concerned.</P>
      <P>The measures set out in the White Paper in relation to special needs pupils are intended to refine and develop the current range of responses.  A key objective will be to ensure that all children with special educational needs will have the opportunity of having these needs addressed in their own areas, wherever possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department is currently preparing an action plan to give effect to the objectives set out in the White Paper. <Col N="142" /> This plan will identify the specific actions required and a time-frame for their implementation.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 57 and 62 together.</P>
      <P>One of the priorities in the programme <i>A Government of Renewal</i> is the making of adequate provision for the establishment and maintenance of school book rental schemes at primary and secondary level for disadvantaged pupils.</P>
      <P>I have already provided specific funding to encourage the operation of book rental-loan schemes in schools.</P>
      <P>In the case of primary schools I decided to use the scheme of book grants towards the cost of school books for needy pupils as a vehicle to encourage the wider use of book loan-rental schemes.</P>
      <P>On that basis primary schools designated as disadvantaged prepared to operate such schemes received additional grant aid in 1994.</P>
      <P>At second-level I am pleased to have been in a position to provide £391,000 for the 1994-95 school year to 86 schools for the purpose of setting up rental schemes for schools which have been designated as disadvantaged and which did not operate such a scheme prior to the 1994-95 school year.</P>
      <P>A total of 18,858 pupils benefited under the scheme in 1994-95.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The funding for the scheme has been increased by approximately 30 per cent this year to total £2.46 million at primary level and to £4.2 million at postprimary level.  I propose to use a significant <Col N="143" /> element of the increase to provide additional funding to schools which are designated disadvantaged to assist with the setting up of book rental schemes.</P>

      <P>Under present arrangements schools are selected for inclusion in the disadvantaged areas scheme on the basis of a range of criteria agreed some years ago between my Department, school management and the Irish National Teachers' Organisation.</P>
      <P>Factors taken into account include the incidence of unemployment, local authority housing occupancy and medical card holding among the parents of the children concerned.  Account is also taken of the views of my Department's inspectorate on the relative levels of need between applicant schools and the prevailing pupil teacher ratios.</P>
      <P>Data under these headings is collected from applicant schools and, having regard to available resources, schools are selected for inclusion in the scheme on the basis of priority of need.</P>
      <P>Applications for disadvantaged status from primary schools in counties Cavan and Monaghan are assessed and prioritised on the above basis, in common with all other applications.</P>
      <P>To date, the level of need demonstrated by the schools in counties Cavan and Monaghan relative to the competing needs of other schools throughout the country has resulted in a relatively low percentage of primary schools in these counties qualifying for inclusion in the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have commissioned the Combat Poverty Agency to review the adequacy of current approaches to the selection <Col N="144" /> and support of schools in disadvantaged areas.</P>
    <P>I expect to receive their report by the end of June next.  This will provide a basis for the development of future approaches to the identification and support of pupils in disadvantaged areas.</P>

      <P>The case to which the Deputy refers is that of an Irish citizen who was arrested in Canada in 1984 on a charge of killing a Canadian citizen. He stood trial in June 1985 and was found guilty of first degree murder which carries a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment, a minimum of 25 years.  His appeal to the Quebec Appeal Court was turned down in 1989 and leave to appeal to the Canadian Supreme Court was refused in 1990.  A provision in the Canadian Criminal Code for the exercise of clemency was then invoked but the Canadian Minister for Justice concluded in 1991 that there was no basis for her to intervene.</P>
      <P>The Embassy in Ottawa has monitored this case from the beginning and has maintained contact with the citizen in question and his legal representatives. A representative of the Embassy attended the appeal hearing in 1990.  At the citizen's request, the Embassy has made representations to the appropriate Canadian authorities to secure improved prison conditions and it also supplies him with Irish newspapers and other materials.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Embassy will continue to supply all the normal help and support extended to Irish prisoners abroad; however, it would not be appropriate in the circumstances of the case to ask the Canadian Government to arrange a retrial.

      <P>At the Council of European Summit held in Vienna in October 1993 Heads of State and Government instructed the Committee of Ministers &ldquo;to draft with minimum delay a framework convention specifying the principles which contracting states commit themselves to respect in order to assure the protection of national minorities&rdquo;.  An <i>ad hoc</i> Committee for the Protection of National Minorities (CAHMIN) has been mandated to carry out the task which was set by the summit in this regard.</P>
      <P>The draft Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities drawn up by the CAHMIN was adopted by the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe on 11 November 1994.  It was opened for signature on 1 February 1995; Ireland was among 21 Council of Europe member states who signed the instrument on that occasion. To date there have been 27 signatories of the framework convention, which will enter into force upon ratification by 12 member states.  Romania recently became the first member state to ratify the instrument.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The framework convention sets out a number of principles and objectives for the protection of national minorities in a wide range of areas including the legal, economic, social, and cultural fields.  I consider that the implementation of this instrument will make a significant contribution to the developing corpus of measures for dealing with this important and sensitive area.

      <P>Ghana is not a traditional supplier and accordingly does not benefit from these advantages.  Under the recently completed Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations, 90,000 tonnes of bananas per annum may be imported duty-free from non-traditional ACP suppliers.  The Commission has allocated 5,000 tonnes to Ghana and a few other small suppliers.  Provisional figures for 1994 show that Ghana exported only 100 tonnes to Europe, one-fiftieth of the available quota.  No representations have been made to the Government in recent times about this issue and we are not aware of any discussions in the EU on the matter.</P>

      <P>Duleek is one of the nine areas which are subject to periodical localised flooding where there is an urgent need to undertake relief work and in respect of which the Commissioners of Public Works have sufficient data available to enable the design of a flood relief scheme to commence immediately.  The Commissioners are in the process of engaging consulting engineers to design the scheme.  It is intended to commence work on the proposed scheme as quickly as possible subject to the results of the environmental impact assessment and cost benefit analysis being satisfactory and to funds being available.</P>
      <P>The Government has already decided to introduce a Supplementary Estimate for the Office of Public Works to defray costs incurred by that office arising from the bad weather earlier this year.  This will include the 1995 cost of any flood relief schemes commenced this year.</P>

      <P>While the social welfare treatment of married and cohabiting couples, under social assistance schemes, is primarily a matter for the Minister for Social Welfare, it appears that the Supreme Court held in the Hyland case in 1989 that it was unconstitutional for the relevant social welfare provisions to treat a married couple living together less favourably than an unmarried cohabiting couple.  This judgment has been given effect by treating cohabiting couples in the same way as married couples for social welfare purposes.</P>
      <P>In relation to taxation, there are no special income tax allowances for unmarried couples living together.  In this context, I would point out that tax law follows the general law relating to marriage.  The basis on which the marriage person's tax free allowance, and double rate bands, is given derives from the Supreme Court decision in Murphy v. the Attorney General, 1980, which held that it was contrary to the Constitution for a married couple to pay more tax than two single people living together.</P>
      <P>I am conscious of the difficulties which can arise for cohabiting couples in certain circumstances because of the way they are treated by the tax and social welfare systems, in particular people who are not in a position to enter into legal marriages within the State.  An Expert Group on the Integration of the Tax and Social Welfare Systems has been established and this group will, <i>inter alia,</i> be looking at the type of situation outlined above.  I will consider the recommendations of the group in due course.</P>

      <Quest>the changes, if any, that have been made in the method of appointment of consultants to Office of Public Works projects; the manner in which such appointments are made; if a rota system still exists; and the basis on which a firm of quantity surveyors was recently appointed to a project (details supplied) when it had only recently completed a large project for the Office of Public Works.</Quest>
      <QRef>[10319/95]</QRef>

    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Coveney) Avril Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance: (Mr. Coveney)</NameTxt>
      <P>There have been no changes in the method of appointment of consultants to the Office of Public Works in recent years. The selection of consultants for appointment is made by an in-house consultants selection committee from a list of firms-individuals in each discipline who have asked to be considered for work for the Office of Public Works.  Selections are in all cases referred to the accounting officer and Minister of State for approval.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Selection from the lists is based on the following criteria: (a) the requirements of the subject needing the consultant. For example, for very large projects or projects of a specialist nature, <Col N="154" /> criteria such as the capacity of a firm, special expertise, experience etc. are taken into consideration.  These include in the case of quantity surveyors, a proven ability to manage and control construction costs effectively.  (b) The proximity of a firm's offices to the project requiring a consultant.  (c) The number and value of commissions awarded to a consultant by the Office of Public Works in recent years.</P>
    <P>For projects estimated up to IR£1 million one firm is selected and a suitable fee is negotiated with that firm. Where a project is estimated to cost in excess of IR£1 million submissions are normally sought from at least three firms.  Discussions are held with these firms on the basis of an outline brief, consultant's approach to the project etc. One firm is then chosen on the basis of the submissions and discussions and the best technical advice available.</P>
    <P>In cases where it is estimated that the value of a consultancy commission will exceed 200,000 ECU, approximately IR£156,000, the commission is publicly advertised in the Official Journal of the European Communities as required under European Council Services Directive.  In certain cases specified in the Directive, for example security, derogations from this requirement can apply.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances of the particular case referred to in the question, as access by civilians to areas occupied by military personnel would be involved, the Department of Defence considered that a derogation from the European Council Services Directive should be invoked.  This was done.  As this commission was unusually demanding because of extraordinary time and logistical constraints the selection procedures were varied in this case.  The selection committee having chosen three quantity surveying firms for consideration initiated negotiations with the firm which was considered most suitable.  The Government Contracts Committee accepted this approach.  Had these negotiations been unsuccessful the <Col N="155" /> next most suitable firm would then have been considered.</P>
    <P>Following the negotiations and having regard to their particular experience on another complex contract, it was considered that the firm selected would provide the level of expertise and service required to ensure that the contract could be completed within the budget and their employment was approved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 77 and 78 together.</P>
      <P>Withholding tax does not impose any additional tax liability.  Full credit for the tax deducted at source is allowed against the normal tax liability of the taxpayer in question.  In calculating normal tax liability, the taxpayer is allowed relief-credit for all the usual deductions such as legitimate expenses, business loan charges etc. as well as personal allowances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report of the Task Force on Small Business recommended that, as a first step, withholding tax should no longer be deducted from payments for professional services to enterprise with a turnover below £1 million per annum <Col N="156" /> and in possession of a valid tax clearance certificate.</P>
    <P>It is not possible to identify separately the withholding tax yield from enterprises with a turnover below £1 million per annum.  Consequently it is not possible to anticipate how the abolition of the tax for such enterprises holding a tax clearance certificate would affect the tax yield.  However, in the vast majority of cases withholding tax is applied to individuals-professionals or to small companies all of which would have a turnover of below £1 million per annum.  It follows that any concession in this area could seriously erode the significant cash flow gain to the Exchequer associated with withholding tax.</P>
    <P>Concerns that withholding tax should be on a current year basis have already been raised and the operation of the scheme in this context has been considered. To move to a current year basis would lead to a situation in which either the tax credit available for the following year of assessment would be dropped; this would &ldquo;freeze&rdquo; that amount of withholding tax for all time and it would never be available for set off; or the tax credit &ldquo;dropping out&rdquo; could be added to the tax credit for the current year effectively doubling the amount of credit available for that year.  This option has a very high flow cost estimated to be in the region of £68 million.</P>
    <P>It is obvious that each of the options outlined above would cause considerable difficulty.  In particular the £68 million cost of the double credit option could not be accommodated due to current budgetary constraints.  However, this issue is reviewed on an ongoing basis and should budgetary conditions permit, changes may be made in the future.</P>
    <P>I would like to take this opportunity to draw the Deputy's attention to the system of interim refunds which operates to alleviate the impact of the tax in certain situations.  Interim refunds ensure that deductions do not exceed the taxpayer's liability in the previous tax year.  Adjustments are also made where the previous year's liability is <Col N="157" /> unusually high and there are special provisions for the first year of operation and for hardship cases.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, section 54 of the Health Act, 1970, was repealed by the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990.  Payments made to persons under the section at the time the Nursing Homes Act was commenced are protected.

In the Eastern Health Board, all section 54 payments ceased six weeks after the Act was commenced in September 1993.</P>
      <P>Section 26 payments arise where a health board enters into an arrangement with an organisation to provide services under the Health Acts for eligible persons. Not every health board uses this section.</P>
      <P>Health boards are funded by a block allocation for their ongoing commitments. It is a matter for each health board to decide on the allocation of funding for payments under sections 54 and 26.

    <P>The provisions of article 8.2 of the Nursing Home (Subvention) Regulations, 1993, require health boards to disregard the equivalent of 20 per cent of the non-contributory old age pension when assessing the means of an applicant for a nursing home subvention.

My Department regularly furnishes the Revenue Commissioners with an up-to-date list of registered nursing homes in all eight health boards to facilitate the prompt processing of applications for tax relief in such cases.</P>
      <P>Where an individual submits a claim for income tax relief in respect of fees being paid to a nursing home in Northern Ireland, it is necessary to ascertain from the relevant health and social services board in the North whether the particular home is registered with that board.</P>
      <P>I will have officials of my Department contact the relevant health and social services board regarding this case.  On receipt of their reply I will forward the relevant information to the Deputy.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> The policy of the Department is that the waste arising in hospitals should be segregated into its component parts and that the most appropriate disposal method be applied to each waste stream.</P>
      <P>The first segregation is into domestic type waste and healthcare risk waste. The former, accounting for up to 80 per cent of the waste, should follow the municipal waste disposal route.  The healthcare risk waste is that which requires special treatment and its major components are infectious waste and sharps.  The Department has proposed to the health agencies a disposal strategy which recommends that these categories of waste should be shredded and disinfected and then disposed of to landfill. Implementation of this strategy implies the phasing out of existing on-site hospital incinerators.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Technological change in disposal methods has been rapid in recent years and is likely to continue into the future in respect of both incineration and non-incineration methods.

        <i>Limerick East):</i> The Deputy will be aware that the Status of Children Act, 1987, (No. 26 of 1987) was enacted to equalise the rights of children and amend the law relating to their status. That Act extended the provisions relating to the registration and reregistration of children born to parents who are not married to each other.  Section 49 of the Act of 1987 introduced a number of procedures facilitating the entry of paternity details in the register of births including procedures which do not require the co-operation of both parents in the registration process.  Subject to the provisions of the Act being met paternity details can be entered on the application of either parent.</P>
      <P>In addition a person, other than an adopted person, may apply to the Circuit Court for a declaration of parentage under section 35 of the 1987 Act.  The Act also provides that An tArd-Chláraitheoir, the Registrar-General of Births, Death and Marriages, is to be notified of any declaration made so that the births register can, if necessary, be amended.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor)</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the law as it stands in the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act, 1976, either parent of a child who is born outside marriage has the right to institute proceedings against the other parent for maintenance of the child.  In determining the amount of any payment of maintenance the court must have regard to all the circumstances of the case and, in particular, the income and other financial resources of the parties. Income includes social welfare payments with the exception of certain social welfare allowances.  Where a parent defaults in payment of maintenance the court has power under the 1976 Act to order enforcement by way of attachment of the earnings of the parent, that is, an order directed to the parent's employer to make periodical deductions from his or her earnings.  Arrears of maintenance can also be pursued under general legislation of 1940 for the enforcement of court orders.  I have made provision in the Family Law Bill, 1994 &mdash; at present before the Seanad having been passed by this House &mdash; to allow the court in certain circumstances to order attachment of earnings at the same time as when making a maintenance order.  On that basis the attachment of earnings procedure will not have to depend on proof of arrears of maintenance and it will help to strengthen the position of the maintenance creditor.</P>

      <P>I refer to the reply to Question No. 54 of 9 May 1995 which indicated the recent measures taken by Meath County Council to improve the water supply to Ashbourne.  The position in relation to the revised preliminary report for a new Ashbourne scheme was also explained; this proposal would additionally benefit Dunshaughlin and Ratoath.</P>
      <P>As regards the improvement of the Dunboyne water supply, my Department recently asked Meath County Council to consider an alternative approach to their earlier proposal which was linked to the new Ashbourne scheme mentioned above.  The county council's detailed response to this request is awaited.</P>

      <P>Pollution control and water quality management functions have been assigned principally to the major local authorities; these are now supported at national level by the Environmental Protection Agency and by the regional authorities.</P>
      <P>The Water Pollution Acts, 1977 and 1990, permit a co-ordinated approach to the development of water quality management plans.  The statutory management plans which have been jointly adopted by the local authorities concerned for the upper Shannon area and the Shannon Estuary reflect this co-ordinated approach.</P>
      <P>I have indicated that I favour an integrated approach to water quality management, particularly in relation to lake catchments.  I intend to announce pilot projects on these lines in the near future.  However, the overall River Shannon catchment, because of its size and diversity, would present difficulties for a new administrative structure which would have to interact with existing bodies having responsibility for pollution control and environmental management. I have no proposal at present for such a new structure or body.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 120, 127 and 134 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Educational provision for children with specific reading disability is generally capable of being made within the ordinary school system, with the assistance, where appropriate of a remedial teacher.  Fully qualified primary <Col N="177" /> teachers are trained to deal with a variety of reading problems, including those which are accompanied by perceptual difficulties.  In addition the special training programme for remedial teachers includes a module on specific reading disability. Where cases of more serious difficulty arise, provision is made in one of the four special schools dedicated to children with specific reading disability.</P>
    <P>Over the past two years I have implemented a range of measures to further improve educational provision for children with special needs.  I have allocated an additional 186 remedial teachers to ordinary primary schools. This brought the number of such teachers in place at primary level to 1,133.  I also sanctioned the appointment of an additional ten psychologists to the primary school psychological service.  I propose to maintain this momentum in the current year with the appointment of 55 additional remedial teachers and a further ten psychologists.  The special educational needs of all children with disabilities, including those with specific reading disability, are reviewed on a regular basis.  My Department is currently reviewing the needs in this particular area and consideration will be given to additional provision, if this is deemed necessary.</P>

      <P>Under new staffing arrangements for primary schools, teaching posts which would have been lost due to declining enrolments are being retained in the system.  This will allow the pupil-teacher ratio to be reduced from 23.4:1 in September 1994 <Col N="178" /> to 22.9:1 in September 1995.  Notwithstanding these improvements, there are, of course, a number of schools where teaching posts are no longer warranted because of declining enrolments, as a result of which the teachers concerned will be redeployed under the panel arrangements.</P>
      <P>Each of the following schools in County Meath is due to lose an assistant's post at the end of the current school year: St. Michael's Boy's Primary School, Patrick Street, Trim; Carnaross national school, Carnaross, Kells; Scoil Náisiúnta Muire, Moynalty, Kells; Duleek Girls national school, Duleek; Carlanstown national school, Kells; Scoil Déagláin, Ashbourne.</P>
      <P>The staffing of national schools for a particular year is determined by the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous year.  The enrolment in each of the above schools on 30 September 1994 had declined to the extent that a teaching post must be suppressed with effect from 1 September 1995.  All of the teachers in question have been given the option of having their names placed on the diocesan panel for redeployment, which will not take place before 1 September 1995.</P>

As the Deputy will be aware from my written reply of Wednesday, 31 May 1995, the allocation of £2 million for the recreational facilities scheme in 1995 is fully committed to projects where grants were allocated in 1994 and where claims for payment will arise this year.  Grant allocations to new projects can only be considered in the event of additional funds being provided for the scheme and consequently, the question of inviting applications does not arise at this stage.  I would also point out to the Deputy that grant allocations under the 1994 recreational facilities scheme were not made until August 1994 and in September 1994 all unsuccessful applicants were notified by my Department.</P>

      <P>Pupils in need of remedial teaching normally have clearly observable difficulties in acquiring basic skills in literacy and-or numeracy or some difficulties in learning of a more general nature.  Remedial teachers are appointed to schools on the basis of priority of need.  Schools are selected for inclusion in the service following an evaluation of their levels of need by my Department's inspectorate and the school psychological service.  I am satisfied that the evaluation carried out is such that remedial teachers are allocated to those schools which have the greatest need.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="182" /> The number of remedial posts allocated in any year is governed by the teaching resources available for distribution in that year.  At present, a total of 1,133 remedial teachers deliver the service to 2,062 primary schools.  A further 55 remedial teachers are being allocated to the primary sector with effect from September next.  A total of 277 ex-quota remedial teachers are currently in place at second-level and a further 73 posts will be put in place for the 1995-96 school year.  I am satisfied that the significant increase in remedial teacher allocations in recent years will be of major benefit to children with learning difficulties and I hope to maintain this momentum in the coming years.</P>

      <P>The background to the matter is that in 1975 Galway County Council lodged a scheme map for the purpose of registering various cottages under the Labourers Acts, 1936.  This map conflicted with that previously lodged by the county council in respect of the registration of cottages and lands in the Land Registry.

      <P>The conditions for receipt of unemployment payments from my Department require applicants to be capable of, available for and genuinely seeking work in respect of each day of unemployment.  In addition, certain PRSI contribution conditions must be satisfied for receipt of unemployment benefit while applicants for unemployment assistance must satisfy a means <Col N="192" /> test.  Those conditions apply equally to people with or without disabilities.</P>
      <P>Provision has also been made in legislation to deem a person to be available for employment on any day on which that person is undergoing a course of rehabilitation training provided by an organisation approved for that purpose by the Minister for Health.</P>
      <P>Apart from unemployment payments, people with disabilities may also be eligible for disability benefit or invalidity pension subject to satisfying the relevant conditions.  In general, a recipient of disability benefit or invalidity pension is precluded from engaging in work whether on his or her own account or on behalf of another person.  Such a recipient may, however, be exempt from the operation of the rules relating to work if he or she is engaged in part-time work in the nature of rehabilitation or occupational therapy and in that regard there is no restriction on earnings. These exemptions are issued only on the advise of the Department's chief medical adviser.</P>

      <P>The Deputy's question refers to an interview given by me on the occasion of the White House Conference on Trade and Investment in Ireland which was held in Washington on 24-26 May.</P>
      <P>One of the results of the peace process will be to enhance the economic competitiveness of Northern Ireland as a location for new business and I welcome this unreservedly.  It may well be that some firms in the Republic will decide to locate facilities in the North. At the same time, in the new climate of economic co-operation, I can envisage Northern firms looking at the possibility of starting or developing businesses in the South.  Furthermore, I believe that increased North/South economic co-operation and perhaps more importantly trade and investment will be to the mutual benefit of North and South.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my interview, I was also drawing <Col N="195" /> attention to the importance for us, in any event, to maintain and improve our competitiveness <i>vis-á-vis</i> the UK generally, particularly on aspects on which we are at some disadvantage at present, for example, labour costs.  The Government, for its part, has taken action in this year's Budget to help labour intensive industries by reducing PRSI levels.</P>
    <P>As regards infrastructure in our Border Counties, substantial public investment, aided by European Union Structural Funds, is planned for the period 1994-99.  This will result in considerable improvement, particularly in relation to the road network, and will help to enhance economic development in those counties.</P>

      <Col N="196" /> There are no negotiations in progress under the aegis of my Department with a view to developing a new apprenticeship system specifically orientated towards the requirements of the semi-State sector.  In that regard the new standards based apprenticeship system which was agreed under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>&mdash; and which applies to all apprentices, whether in the public or private sector &mdash; is expected to be fully operational later this year.</P>

Milk quota surrendered under a restructuring scheme is made available to other suppliers within the same co-operative/dairy area at a price similar to that paid to the outgoing producer.  It has not been possible to finalise the conditions governing the sale of quota thus surrendered pending the outcome of negotiations with the EU Commission on the terms of the accompanying subsidy scheme.  It is hoped to have this process completed very soon.</P>

      <P>The competition for the award of a licence to a second operator of GSM mobile telephony within Ireland was announced on 2 March, 1995.  The closing date for submission of applications is 23 June 1995.  A Danish firm, Andersen Management International, has been recruited to advise on the evaluation of applications and on the conditions of the licence which will ultimately be awarded.  A decision on the new licensee will be made by 31 October next at the latest.  The actual licence will be issued as soon after that date as negotiations with the successful applicant can be completed.</P>
      <P>The introduction of competition in mobile telephony is fully consistent with our strategy for the future development of the telecommunications sector.  The penetration of mobile telephony in Ireland at 2.3 per cent of the population is low by European standards.  The licensing of a second operator will inject a new dynamism into the market and lead to rapid expansion of the market, an improvement in the quality of service and reduction in tariffs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new licensee will be selected according to a range of criteria including a financial and technical capability, approach to market development, tariff proposals and the amount the applicant is prepared to pay for the right to the licence.  Applicants are free to propose the licence fee subject to a minimum of £5 million.  I want to make it clear that the Government has not at any stage indicated a requirement for any amount other than the minimum.  We are seeking to license a strong competitive player in the mobile telephony market. It is up to applicants to put a value on <Col N="201" /> the licence that will achieve this objective.</P>

      <P>It is understood that the two Irish citizens referred to lost their lives in the <Col N="204" /> collision between the tanker, <i>British Trent</i> and the bulk carrier, <i>Western Winner</i> off the Belgian coast on 3 June 1993.</P>
      <P>The Marine Accident Investigation Branch of the United Kingdom Department of Transport which carried out an investigation into the casualty attributed death of the nine crew of the <i>British Trent</i> to smoke inhalation following jumping into the sea among patches of burning cargo.  Both vessels had failed to comply with the International Regulations for the Prevention of Collisions at Sea in conditions of restricted visibility. The Dorset coroner attributed death to unlawful killing by the master of the <i>Western Winner.</i></P>
      <P>The Minister for the Marine has no function in relation to the holding of inquests but he is prepared to use his good offices in co-operating with other Ministers with responsibilities in this area.  The attention of the Minister was first drawn on 27 March 1995 to the fact that inquests had not been held into these deaths.  At that stage the relatives of the four English seamen who were lost in the collision have succeeded in retaining a Coroner in Dorset to carry out an inquest into the deaths of the UK nationals.  The Dorset coroner was unable to conduct an inquest into the deaths of the two Irishmen as their bodies had not been returned to England and, therefore, he had not got jurisdiction under the UK Coroners' Act, 1988.</P>
      <P>An inquest could not be held under the Irish Coroners' Act, 1962 as there was no post-mortem/autopsy or inquest report from the Belgium authorities and the Irish authorities had not been notified of the arrival of the remains in the State in mid-1993.  So far attempts by the Departments of Foreign Affairs and Justice to establish a case for an Irish inquest have not been successful.</P>
