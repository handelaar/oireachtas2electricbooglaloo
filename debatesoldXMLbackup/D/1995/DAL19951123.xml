      <P>Will the Tánaiste agree that the blinkered approach shown once again yesterday by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland is delaying and stalling the peace process?  Will he also agree that a glorious opportunity to consolidate and move the peace process forward is being lost?  Has the Taoiseach <Col N="1422" /> informed President Clinton of that view?  Does the Tánaiste agree that President Clinton's decision to shorten his visit to Britain and Ireland is in part a sign of growing American impatience with the peace process and the snail's pace progress which is being made?</P>

      <P>First, nothing is lost. We are in consultation and discussions with the British Government to try to avail of the window of opportunity which exists.  It is very obvious that we want to make progress, we are devoting all our energies to that at present and shall continue to do so.  It is important to resolve the impasse, avail of the opportunity which exists and have a political underpinning of the peace process, which we all want to continue.  I am optimistic that we can make the breakthrough.  Although it takes time and is painstaking and difficult, we all want to see progress being made and I hope we can do that.</P>

      <P>I wish the Tánaiste well in his efforts to achieve that. However, as Leader of the largest party in the House, I find it upsetting that each day on the Order of Business and at Question Time we seem unable to talk about this but as soon as we leave the Chamber everybody feels free to do so in an open way.  I ask the Tánaiste to keep up the efforts.  As far as we are concerned, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland is holding up the peace process and has been unhelpful to <Col N="1423" /> the Government and the people.  It is time he moved away from this intransigent position.</P>

      <P>I would like to ask the Tánaiste about promised legislation to deal with the drugs crisis.  I know there are legislative proposals to deal with drug trafficking in the justice area.  As regards public education, has the Government any proposals, through the Department of Health or the Department of Education, to introduce a programme to protect young people from their own foolishness in relation to taking ecstasy and on other drug abuse matters?  Can the Government promise any measures to deal with the growing concern among parents in relation to drug abuse, particularly ecstasy, which has caused the deaths of many young people?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="The Tánaiste Dick Spring">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government is very conscious that our response to the drugs problem must be multifaceted, involving the Departments of Justice, Health and Education.  The Government has agreed the Heads of a Bill for a general scheme on drug trafficking. The Minister for Education introduced an information programme in senior schools last October &mdash; the documentation was made available to every Member &mdash; and we will continue with that effort.  No legislation is necessary in that area.  The Government set up an interdepartmental committee of the Departments to which I referred so that a co-ordinated Government response would be made to the issue.  We are also seeking assistance from the EU in that regard.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this measure.  It is the first radical approach to the disease eradication programme which has been in operation since the mid-1950s and subject to much criticism in the sense that great emphasis has been placed on its lack of achievement &mdash; less emphasis has been placed on its achievements. When the eradication programme was first instituted in 1954 the incidence of bovine tuberculosis was prevalent in about 25 per cent of herds, with a greater percentage in terms of the total number of live cattle at that time.  Since then the incidence of disease has been reduced to about 3 per cent of herds and about 1 per cent of all bovine animals, which is a great achievement.  The problem is that, notwithstanding the establishment of ERAD in the mid-1980s and the introduction of other measures, we have not succeeded in reducing the incidence of disease in a significant way in the last ten years.  Obviously there are many reasons for that.  As is true of the human population, there is probably a residual level of tuberculosis in the herd that may never be eradicated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many opportunities have been missed in recent years.  I wish to respond to remarks by the Opposition spokes-person, Deputy Cowen, yesterday.  He implied that rotational testing was not acted upon quickly by the Minister, but that is not true.  The programme of rotational testing, introduced with EU assistance, was negotiated by the Minister's predecessor, Deputy Joe Walsh. Almost two years ago agreement was reached with the EU by which it would transfer significant funding to Ireland for the bovine disease eradication programme.  It was the responsibility of the then Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry to implement that programme, but bereft of ideas and courage, he <Col N="1427" /> failed to do so.  He got bogged down in the row with farming organisations and particularly the veterinary organisation and did not proceed with the programme, thereby costing the country a substantial sum of money.</P>
    <P>In 1991 the EU promised funding for a three year programme to eradicate bovine tuberculosis, but those funds were not drawn down.  If they had it would have saved the farming community and taxpayers several million pounds &mdash; the Minister referred to these figures in his speech and it is important to outline them again.  He stated: &ldquo;we have received minimal EU funding for the TB programme over the years: because of IVU and farmer difficulties with aspects of the proposed programmes we failed to secure potential EU funding of about £10 million for three years which was agreed in 1991 and also to secure potential funding of £20 million a year over three years from 1993.&rdquo;  None of the programmes has been implemented.  The loss to the country by inaction is evident from these figures.  It is, therefore, unacceptable for the Opposition spokes-person to come into the House and level criticisms at the Minister for lack of action.</P>
    <P>As a farmer and Deputy who represents what is by and large an agricultural constituency &mdash; agriculture is the greatest economic activity in the constituency &mdash; I congratulate the Minister on his actions in this area.  One of the major sources of irritation for the farming community is the disease eradication programme.  It is irritating in its implementation and, of course, its failure to achieve its objective.  However, the Minister has tackled the problem head-on with these measures and I compliment him for that.</P>
    <P>Let us look at what the Minister proposes to do.  He proposes that the payment for annual herd testing should be devolved from the taxpayer directly to farmers.  That is good news for farmers. Taxpayers have been angry about this for many years and there has been a <Col N="1428" /> great deal of media publicity, much of it unfair.  The publicity focused on what the taxpayer was contributing to the bovine TB eradication programme but there was no focus on the level of contribution by farmers, which was first introduced in 1979.  Last year it was about £28 million.  This contribution is composed of levies deducted at all points of sale from farmers, whether they sell milk or animals at a mart or to a meat factory for slaughter.</P>
    <P>The new procedures will reduce farmers' levies from 1.3p per gallon on milk delivered to creameries to 0.5p per gallon and on cattle disposed of through marts or factories from about £7.30 per head to £2.50 per head on smaller animals.  This amounts to a reduction of £18 million per year in farmer contributions. When the cost to farmers of paying their local vet for the annual round is taken into account the net saving will be £4 million.  Farmers will now have to pay their local veterinarian for the first round test.  Any further tests where disease is shown to be present will be paid for by the Department.  This is an important step forward.  Farmers can now negotiate the cost of the annual test directly with their local veterinarian.  It will introduce a market into that professional area.  Farming organisations and individual farmers will be able to negotiate price scales and professional fees for carrying out these tests with individual vets or the Irish Veterinary Union.  Heretofore, the Department paid vets certain fees by agreement and it proved to be very costly.  The introduction of an open market in this area is bound to have a beneficial effect and I welcome that.</P>
    <P>Another major improvement is the abolition of compulsory 60-day pre-movement tests for animals traded or sold within this country.  These tests have been a source of great irritation to farmers.  The principle behind the tests was good in that it attempted to identify animals which might be diseased being transferred or sold from one herd to another and thus prevent the spread of <Col N="1429" /> infection.  The number of animals identified as being TB infected by the 60-day pre-movement test has been minimal. Over the years the disease has been identified in only a few thousand cattle even though millions of cattle have been put through the test.  I am delighted the Minister has abolished the compulsory element.</P>
    <P>Of course, it will be right for prudent and careful farmers to insist in some cases that the animals they buy are tested and to test animals they have taken into their herds to ensure they are free of disease.  The Minister has given an incentive in this regard which I welcome.  Farmers who have insisted on pre-movement testing or testing after movement has taken place will be paid a greater level of compensation where a reactor shows up because they have gone through that procedure.  It is appropriate that such an incentive be given because it is necessary to ensure that the small percentage of reactors identified in blanket 60-day pre-movement testing should, as far as possible, be detected before they might cause further infection in another herd.</P>
    <P>Another cause of irritation for farmers is non-specific infection in herds. That happens when, after a test on a farm, an animal is found to be a reactor with no specific reason why that should be so.  The tuberculin test is not perfect; it probably has a margin of error &mdash; although there is debate about this &mdash; of 10 or 15 per cent.  In other words, when the animal is given the tuberculin injection it might produce a reaction which manifests itself as a lump on the animal's neck and which might suggest that it is a tuberculin reaction.  In many cases, however, it is not.  In up to 15 per cent of cases it has nothing to do with bovine TB.  Nevertheless, it is a clinical reaction and that is taken by the Department, because of the way its regulations are implemented, to mean that the animal is a TB reactor and must be taken out of the herd and slaughtered.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1430" /> It is bad enough for a farmer who believes he has a clean herd to lose a valuable animal &mdash; the level of compensation always represents a loss &mdash; but the greatest scourge is the fact that no animals from that farm can be disposed of except by permit to a meat factory. That is still an option for a minority of small farmers but most small farmers do not raise finished animals but sell them on through marts or transactions with other farmers or dealers.  That means that their herds are locked up for at least two 60-day test periods.  If farmers do not have finished animals they have to refrain from all sales and that imposes great hardship on them.</P>
    <P>The Minister has said that additional scientific methods, including laboratory analysis and epidemiological considerations, will be used by the Department in order to reduce the sales restriction period for some herds which have a single reactor with non-specific infection. Thousands of farmers will welcome the Minister's statement.  There are about 5,000 herds with what is called singleton infection, that is, a single reactor showing in an annual test.  It is estimated that at least 2,000 of these herds could be released from sales restriction after the first 60-day period.  The Minister has not made a specific statement about that and I accept that it would be difficult for him to do so.  The IFA has been more specific: &ldquo;Furthermore all cattle herds with proven non-specific TB infection will be de-restricted after passing one TB clear test.  This will alleviate unnecessary hardship&rdquo;.  The IFA is right in its comment but it might not be accurate to say that in all cases of singleton infection the restriction can be confined to a 60-day test period.  Although the Minister has to negotiate with the European Union about this matter, I urge him to do as much as he can to ensure that the greatest possible proportion of these so-called singleton herds are restricted for only one period of 60 days after a reactor has been detected.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1431" /> I want to refer to some of the hardships suffered by farmers who have a disease outbreak in their herd, farmers who do not produce finished animals and must dispose of their beef animals in the marts or by some system other than slaughtering.  It is not so bad if store cattle producers in the west suffer a disease outbreak in their herd in the spring as they will have approximately 120 days of reasonable grass growth, even though they may plan to sell many of their animals between March and August.  Such a disease outbreak may not be so devastating if it occurs at the beginning of the growing season, but picture the awful dilemma of a store cattle farmer when a disease outbreak is detected in his herd at this time of the year or a little earlier on the eve of his intended autumn sale.  He must lock up his animals and his forage and feed become exhausted with the approach of the end of the growing season.  His level of forage would be the normal level he would have saved for the winter, be it hay or silage.  He may have to lock up his animals from, say, September to March, crucial months in terms of feeding his animals from non-growing forage.  Proper recognition has not been taken of the enormous hardship and financial cost and ruin which such a disease outbreak has caused to many farmers.</P>
    <P>While compensation was provided for animals taken out of a herd, it only amounted to approximately 80 per cent of the economic cost of an animal.  Meat factories purchase such animals from farmers at a greatly reduced price.  The payment made by meat factories to farmers for reactor animals should be a subject of lengthy debate.  We often wonder what happens to them after they are slaughtered in the factory.  Are they put into intervention?  The findings of the beef tribunal revealed they were. Are such animals used for tanning purposes, as is usually expected, or are they passed to the fresh meat retail industry for vacuum packing and so on?  We do not know if that is the case.  There <Col N="1432" /> should be more transparency in that area.</P>
    <P>Following the sale of such animals for approximately 60 per cent of their economic value, the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry paid some compensation to farmers, but that accounted for only 20 or 25 per cent of the cost of the animal.  It is important that the question of compensation be examined, particularly in cases where farmers suffer hardship.  It is not unreasonable to expect that such farmers should be paid the economic cost of their animals.  In the light of this important change in the procedures governing disease eradication, on which we congratulate the Minister, it is important that this area be closely examined.</P>
    <P>There are hundreds of cases of disputes over disease eradication between farmers and the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, some of which have wound up in the courts. There are rights and wrongs on both sides of these disputes.  We hear of dozens of such cases in our constituencies which are intractable because district veterinary officers and the Department take up a position and as a matter of principle farmers take up another position.  The parties often wind up in court and farmers may be restricted in their sales.  I ask the Minister to examine those cases in the light of the changes he is making and to try to do everything possible to achieve a compromise settlement.  These procedures mark a new beginning and the Minister's officials should examine all these cases to ascertain what can be achieved by means of negotiations and compromise rather than conflict in court.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a small Bill which deals with one or two relatively minor technical points, such as substituting the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry as being the person to collect disease levies on live cattle exports, instead of the Revenue Commissioners, because of the advent of the Single Market.  It also deals with increases in the <Col N="1433" /> level of some fines.  These matters are not of great importance.  The Bill provides an opportunity to discuss the broader question of animal and, in particular, bovine diseases.</P>
      <P>Last night the Minister said that he had given Opposition spokespersons a copy of the data on the new bovine TB programme he announced yesterday. Unfortunately he did not do that.  As I have not got it nor have I been able to get it, I cannot speak on the detail of the matter.  I could not get that data this morning as neither the Minister, the Minister of State nor an official of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry is present.  I have been a Member of the House for 28 years and I have never seen a Bill debated in the absence of the Minister, the Minister of State or an official of the Department concerned.  I put this down to an oversight or a mistake and take it that it is not a deliberate snub.  If this were to become the norm, it would be impossible to carry on business here.  To some extent I feel I am wasting my time, as was Deputy Connor, as I am speaking largely to fresh air in the absence of anybody.</P>
      <P>There is some minor significance in the increase in fines, particularly the increase in the fine on summary conviction to a sum of £1,500.  This is the first time I can recall any Bill in which a fine in excess of £1,000 was allowed.  I recall successive Attorneys General advising that a fine above £1,000 could be regarded as too severe and it would be unconstitutional to have it imposed by the District Court.  I could not see the point in that because that court had power to imprison people for 12 months, a sanction which is a good deal more severe than a £1,000 fine.  I am glad the limit has been breached and hope it may be increased because it is ridiculous that the jurisdiction of the District Court is confined to such low figures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the broader issues of bovine disease, particularly tuberculosis, I remind the House that ten or more years ago the then Senator Ken Whitaker, who <Col N="1434" /> had previously been Secretary of the Department of Finance for a long time and if I recall correctly was nominated to the Seanad by Jack Lynch, made a speech on bovine TB and the State's efforts to eradicate it.  He said that in his experience it was the greatest financial scandal in the history of the State and that a larger sum had gone down the drain to no avail for that purpose than any other he could recall.  He said that approximately ten years ago, but unfortunately the position has not changed. What he said then was true and a further ten years have passed during which more money has gone down the drain, substantial amounts of Exchequer money and farmers' money.</P>
    <P>The total expenditure is in excess of £1 billion, yet this country is still seriously affected with bovine TB.  The Minister set out the position in his speech when he said:</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding this major expenditure, it has not, unfortunately, been possible to make progress in reducing the residual level of TB over the past 20 years.</P>
    <P>In other words we are, today, exactly where we were 20 years ago, notwithstanding huge expenditure.  That is deplorable and regrettable and I think a major change is needed in our approach to this scheme.</P>
    <P>The Minister did not send me details of his announcement yesterday.  I hope he will see fit to send me those details.</P>

      <P>I have not obtained those details.  Any change must be one for the better.  In that sense I welcome what is proposed as an improvement on what existed but I cannot give a final judgment on it until I see the details and get advice from those who understand how these things work in practice.  Often they work in practice somewhat differently from what is set out on paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1435" /> I wish to make some observations about the bovine TB scheme.  It seems that over the past 41 years of its existence it is an example of a considerable restrictive practice, inasmuch as all the testing was done by qualified veterinary surgeons.  I do not know the need for that.  That work could be done by technicians after completing a training course that would take, perhaps, a couple of months.  It is curious that in order to test a bovine animal it is necessary to have a highly qualified veterinary surgeon but in order to test a human being for the same condition, somebody with no medical qualifications can carry out the test.  I wonder why our cattle are so precious that they need such extraordinarily highly qualified people to go near them and that the average lay person or technician cannot approach them.  The amount of money wasted by that in contrast with other countries where this type of work is carried out by people of an appropriate level of skill amazes me. It has been a huge loss to this country that we have had and maintained over 40 years this extraordinary restrictive practice.</P>
    <P>The other question we should ask ourselves in regard to bovine TB in the Republic is why the incidence is so much worse than in Northern Ireland where all the factors, the land, climate, geography, breeds of cattle and feed are roughly the same as they are here. There is no significant difference and still the incidence there is very much lower, the reason being that the regulations are much tighter.  The big difference I see as a layman, looking at it from the outside and listening to some of the people involved, is that the movement of cattle down here is much freer and more frequent than in Northern Ireland.  We have here an extraordinary tradition of moving cattle all over the country, not so much cows or dairy cattle but beef cattle.  It is estimated that many cattle move six or seven times in their short lives.  That seems unnecessary and it should be discouraged.  It happens because it is traditional but is very <Col N="1436" /> dangerous because in that movement the disease is spread.</P>
    <P>The other factor that strikes me as a big difference between here and the North, and between here and other countries, is that we still have &mdash; or certainly had up until recently &mdash; a primitive manual form of checking on cattle and of keeping records of cattle, known as blue cards.  They may have a different colour now, but it is essentially the same idea.  It is beyond me that cattle, their numbers and identification particulars cannot be computerised so that any beast turning up anywhere in the country can be checked instantly.  The reason we have to retain this primitive system where farmers, vets, factories and so on have to handle manually large numbers of cards which are open to being interfered with from time to time is beyond me.  It contributes greatly to the unnecessarily high incidence of disease here.</P>
    <P>We are fortunate, notwithstanding our poor disease record &mdash; at least so far as bovine TB is concerned &mdash; that the European Union has not imposed much heavier restrictions on the export of cattle and meat from here.  The Minister, and others, have complained that we only get minimal funding from the EU in respect of our bovine TB eradication schemes.  In his contribution last evening he went into some detail on the reason this is so and how relatively little we got.  He said:</P>
    <P>We have received minimal EU funding for the TB programme over the years; because of IVU [Irish Veterinary Union] and farmer difficulties with aspects of the proposed programmes we failed to secure potential EU funding of about £10 million for three years which was agreed in 1991 and also to secure potential funding of £20 million a year over three years from 1993.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that had those programmes been implemented various benefits would have followed.  The loss of this money, which is bemoaned by many people as being a major aspect of <Col N="1437" /> the tragedy, is a less important aspect of it; the major aspect of it is that the EU is so fed up with our continued, persistent and deliberate failure over many years in regard to bovine TB that it will not contribute to it because it does not think any genuine effort is being made here.  Frankly, I think the EU is right. No genuine effort is being made.  It may be, I cannot say, that a new leaf was turned over yesterday on paper.  It is something new but whether it will work and be enforced, in spite of opposition from various vested interests, remains to be seen.  It is one thing for a Minister to make these announcements but I notice that this implementation of it is contingent on his getting agreement from all the various interests involved.  I do not know whether he will get agreement. What is needed is the enforcement of regulations, whether there is agreement or not.  We could look to Northern Ireland and other countries to see how and why things have worked so much better there than here.</P>
    <P>While it is unthinkable here that trained technicians could and should carry out this work the Minister should look at if he is serious about the clearance of this disease.  In spite of the many hundreds of millions of pounds spent in the past 20 years, the Minister admitted last night we are in exactly the same position we were in 20 years ago.  That will have to be changed.</P>
    <P>Placing responsibility on farmers for the first test is probably a good move. The levies will be reduced as a result and there will be a net saving to the farmer.  One of the weaknesses in what is now proposed is that the pre-movement test is being abolished.  Instead of cutting down on the excessive level of movement, it will exacerbate it and may encourage unnecessary movement of cattle simply because it has been traditional.</P>
    <P>We cannot afford our current level of diseases, particularly TB and it is disappointing that we continue to have some cases of brucellosis.  That disease has not been fully rooted out and it is frightening for us, as a beef producing nation, <Col N="1438" /> that BSE is continuing unabated in Britain.  I read an article recently which implied there was great improvement in the control of the disease in Britain because cases were down to a few hundred per week.  That is absolutely shocking.  The effect that has had on the consumption of European beef is serious and long-term.  Many people have given up consuming meat, particularly beef, due to the prevalence of BSE and if and when it is eliminated in Britain, many will not revert to the consumption of beef.  Obviously that is deeply regrettable.</P>
    <P>The rather lackadaisical way in which the British Government and Department of Agriculture approaches the problem of BSE has many similarities with the equally lackadaisical way in which Irish Governments and our Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry approaches the problem of bovine tuberculosis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnEllis" hpid="Mr. Ellis Mr. Ellis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on the proposed changes in the TB eradication scheme.  We all welcome certain aspects of the Bill but serious difficulties may arise from it as far as the future of disease eradication is concerned.  I accept that any savings will be welcomed by the farming community but a number of the proposals highlighted in the Minister's contribution last night need clarification.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the new proposals, the annual test will remain.  Farmers have adhered to that through the years and enjoyed the benefits of it in terms of their livelihood.  However, the annual test will now be the responsibility of the farmer.  That will lead to &ldquo;yellow pack&rdquo; veterinary practices in that veterinary surgeons will do TB testing only and will not be available to farmers for routine veterinary work.  As a result of this proposal, we may see the Monday to Friday veterinary surgeon emerging, a vet who will not be available after 5 p.m. or before 9 a.m. for routine veterinary work.  It would not be acceptable if veterinary surgeons specifically concentrated on testing to <Col N="1439" /> the detriment of ordinary animal welfare.</P>
    <P>We must also examine the costs involved in this proposal.  While costs may be saved in levies to farmers, small farmers will get the worst end of the stick.  They will be required to pay the standard call-out charge to a veterinary surgeon for doing the annual test, in addition to whatever the rate per head may be.  Farmers who have a couple of hundred cattle will pay the same call-out fee.  That is not appropriate.  The annual test should remain in the control of the Department because it would result in better co-ordination and control.</P>
    <P>Deputy Connor mentioned that the number of cases found on pre-movement tests was small.  When the Minister answers the question I have put down for written reply next week he will find that the number of reactors identified is quite alarming.</P>
    <P>The free movement of cattle which have been tested in the previous 12 months will mean that two years could pass before an animal has a tuberculin test.  For example, if I test my herd in January and sell the following December to somebody whose cattle had been tested the previous month, those animals would not be due their annual test until the end of the following year.  It could be two years before they are tested without any rule being broken.  In addition, the system could leave open the possibility of spreading disease, and that is serious.</P>
    <P>The Minister may have abolished the pre-movement test but farmers will not buy untested animals unless they are buying cull cows to graze which would be of no consequence.  Farmers will not take the risk of accepting untested cattle into their herd and then retesting them because of the danger of quarantine.</P>
    <P>Compassion has been mentioned in that regard but the onus is now being taken away with respect to proper control.</P>
    <P>A comprehensive research programme aimed at curtailing TB being <Col N="1440" /> spread by wildlife is to be welcomed.  I am glad the Minister has persuaded his colleague with responsibility for the Office of Public Works to agree with the views of farmers on the removal of badger setts because of the TB problems badgers cause.  That move will be welcomed by everybody.</P>
    <P>Funding must be made available for further research on ways to eliminate the scourge of TB.  In the past 40 years, approximately £1.5 billion has been spent on trying to eradicate TB and while some progress was made, we are now bogged down.  I do not believe that these proposals will result in the elimination of TB from the national herd.  Perhaps the total removal of the disease is but a pipe-dream though the implementation of proper controls for a specified period would alleviate much of the hardship caused.</P>
    <P>There is a sting in this proposal also &mdash; the Minister having referred to the right to choose practitioners &mdash; whereas a farmer always has had the right to change his vet if and when he wished and exercised that right on many occasions.</P>
    <P>With regard to the development of blood tests and vaccines, I am opposed to any anti-TB vaccine being imported because other vaccines, such as antifoot-and-mouth, will destroy our herd status on selling to other markets.  I am opposed to the implementation of any vaccine programme for the reason that one would end up in the same position with regard to animals imported to our dairy herd, many of which cannot be reexported when put through the meat chain.  We need to be very careful about even contemplating the importation of such vaccines.</P>
    <P>The Department will always have the help of 99.99 per cent of farmers in the eradication of disease, the very small minority who do not have respect for themselves or others are pushed to one side by those totally committed to the disease eradication programme <Col N="1441" /> implemented over many years.  Farmers have a responsibility to protect their herds and any that do not are fools.  As a farmer, I will not allow any animal on my farm that has not been tested and, if female, blood-tested for the obvious reason that I could not afford the loss of income consequent on any subsequent outbreak and/or my subsequent inability to trade normally.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to explain where farmers will stand if it is found that untested cattle come on their farm and disease is detected only after an &ldquo;on farm&rdquo; purchase.  Will the Minister immediately clarify the specified period within which a farmer must test such animals without having a penalty imposed with regard to any compensation entitlement?</P>
    <P>Any farmer attempting to sell cattle without a test will totally limit his customer base as the number of people prepared to purchase untested cattle is minimal, especially in the west where approximately 30 per cent of the cattle are exported to Northern Ireland or, at this time of year, weanlings are sent to Europe.  Those farmers who do not have animals tested will be penalised much more in cash terms than on actual sale price.</P>
    <P>The Minister said:</P>
    <P>As already mentioned, I am proposing that farmers would engage and pay practitioners directly for the first tests on their herds each year; as these costs were borne heretofore from central funds to which farmers contributed, the disease levies would be reduced to about £10 million a year for the first year.</P>
    <P>That carries no guarantee of any net saving to the farmer, the veterinary surgeon has to be paid anyway, which means the farmer must pay him directly rather than the Department paying the farmer when he submits the results of his testing; that is the bottom line.  This means the only saving will be effected at the last point of movement when the disease levies are cut.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>

    <Col N="1442" />
    <Speaker pid="JohnEllis" hpid="Mr. Ellis Mr. Ellis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but it also means that farmers who, heretofore, were not responsible for dealing with vets with regard to testing will now have to deal with them.  As I predicted earlier, this will lead to the &ldquo;yellow pack&rdquo; vet&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnEllis" hpid="Mr. Ellis Mr. Ellis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and farmers have been quite willing to pay for them, but they will have to continue to pay because they will be unable to make full use of the marketplace without having had their animals fully tested.</P>
      <P>Here we come to the big sting, as the Minister said: &ldquo;Thereafter, compensaton and the operational costs would be shared by the Exchequer and farmers on a 2:1 ratio.&rdquo;  Does that refer to compensation or to the cost of testing of herds that are locked up?  If it means that compensation will have to be shared on a ratio of 2:1, farmers will have to insure against any loss resulting from an outbreak of TB which will diminish any initial gain.  That needs to be clarified for farmers and everybody else in the run-up to Christmas.</P>
      <P>It is approximately 16 years this month since the pre-movement test was introduced, which has done a certain amount of good, but its continuation would have been more appropriate &mdash; although some people might say my constituents would not agree &mdash; you often have to be cruel to be kind.  No farmer wants disease on his farm unknown to him and nobody wants to buy diseased animals.  These proposals will prove to be a recipe for farmers buying disease into their herds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Farmers will and have always contributed directly or indirectly to the disease eradication programme but want circumstances to evolve in which they will be able to trade with the minimum of problems and participate in a scheme in which they have full confidence.  I cannot agree with Deputy O'Malley when he said this work should be taken from <Col N="1443" /> veterinary surgeons because if that happened ultimately there would be a veterinary surgeon in every county and the income they could earn from ordinary farm work would be minimal.  At present, the Minister appears to be endeavouring to apply the carrot and stick approach, sending in professionals &mdash; as he classes them &mdash; to inspect meat plants, thus putting pressure on vets with the inherent implication that that work could be undertaken by others. This proposal warrants serious consideration, bearing in mind our worldwide animal health status reputation it is up to us to protect it and the responsibility of farmers and Governments, of whatever hue, to protect.</P>
    <P>The proposed programme will need fine-tuning and examination before implementation, to detect its pitfalls, to see whether it will involve an overall saving for farmers, as from now on they will be responsible for paying for testing whereas they had already been paying directly through the disease levy.  The only possible benefit may be for those who wish to dispose of certain types of stock who will be able to sell them without having been tested, mainly cull cows or cattle ready for slaughter.</P>
    <P>From what the Minister said, the potential loopholes outweigh the benefits.  We all have a duty to try to eliminate the incidence of TB from our national herd but the rescinding of pre-movement testing, or on movement of animals into farms, could be extremely dangerous.  There is no guarantee that a reactor could not be moved almost continuously over a two year period without being detected by the system whereas, under the old pre-movement system, when moved after 60 days they had to be tested when almost certainly any element of disease would have been detected.</P>
    <P>Like Deputy Cowen, I would prefer to reserve judgement until we have had an opportunity to peruse the full text of what is proposed.  It appears good, the public relations exercise was good; the Minister's public relations machine probably is the best ministerial one we <Col N="1444" /> have witnessed for a very long time&mdash; for which he deserves admiration &mdash; but the need for a full assessment of the pros and cons, a total analysis of what will be most beneficial to our national herd and farmers in general will not be undertaken within the timescale outlined by the Minister last evening or within the additional documentation made available.  This is much more serious than people realise.  There will be free movement of cattle, uncontrolled up to a point, that could run to two years.  That could be very dangerous.  I have no case to make regarding testing; that has to be negotiated. However, I could suggest a number of ways of rationalising internal operations in the Department.  When 33.3 per cent of the funding for any scheme is spent on administration it is time for a reassessment.</P>
    <P>I will reserve judgment on the Minister's proposals, but he would be well advised to take a long hard look before implementing them to see how control can be exercised when there is open trading.  Although the Minister might say that pre-movement tests will not be required when sales take place, 75 per cent of cattle exposed for sale will still need to be tested either at the time of sale or on entering herds.  There is a need for clarification on how herds that break down as a result of purchases are to be dealt with.  Clarification is also necessary regarding the 2:1 ratio, what this will apply to and how farmers can safeguard their income when there is disease.  The present system allowed for the payment of compensation to farmers whose farms had to be closed.  I would be very worried if this were to be discontinued.  Savings on disease levies would be lost to the insurance companies and to farmers in compensation and other means of bridging the gap.</P>
    <P>There are elements of this scheme that should be closely examined before it is put into practice.  I hope common sense will prevail and that matters will be dealt with comprehensively and in such a way that the £1.5 billion that has already been spent will not have been wasted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>A very imaginative package for disease eradication was put before the farmers of Ireland yesterday by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry.  The first time I ever saw a vet test cattle was in 1955 on our farm in Mountbellew.  Since then as a Minister of State, mart manager and farmer, I have seen many Ministers for Agriculture grappling with the national problem of TB.  I have no way of knowing whether this package will be as successful as we would like, but there are some factors that induce me to believe we are on the right road.</P>
      <P>We are all agreed that the existing system has not worked.  However, other countries with climates not much different from Ireland's and similar cattle populations managed to get rid of TB while we did not.  I do not intend to apportion blame for that because there are many factors involved.  Under the ERAD system which we had in operation for a number of years, everybody in the industry had a say.  The problem was that everybody had too much say with the result that the job was not done.  Then there was an impasse with the vets regarding rotational testing. However, generally speaking, I support the Minister in what he is trying to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As is his right as a public representative, Deputy Ellis tried to anticipate some of the problems that might arise. That is something we will have to do.  In the time at my disposal I will mention what the objectives of a scheme should be and how farmers are affected.  The question of TB levies will have to be looked at.  As a practising farmer I have to say that TB levies on farmers selling cattle at marts are outrageously high.  A farmer has to part with £7.30 for every animal whether or not he makes money on it.  I understand that statistics show that almost 60 per cent of infection starts with one reactor in a herd.  Apart from sickness in the family, no greater disaster could befall a farmer than to have a single reactor, particularly when winter is approaching.  It means having to do two consecutive tests on all the cattle, and feed cattle that the farmer <Col N="1446" /> would not otherwise have carried through the winter.  In addition there are gale days on which various lending institutions have to be repaid loans. Most galling of all, even when it is found after veterinary inspection at the factories that the animal does not have lesions &mdash; which means to farmers that the animal does not have TB &mdash; this cumbersome performance has to be gone through, entailing great hardship.  It would be silly to suggest that we can all go around spreading TB.  It is bad enough to have to restrict a herd when there is TB in it, but it is going a bit far to have unnecessary restrictions when it can be proved that there is no TB.</P>
    <P>The Minister said yesterday that under certain circumstances where a reactor is found in an otherwise clean herd, and under certain veterinary clinical conditions and analyses, that farmer will only be required to have one extra test.  This will make a major difference to farmers.  It will be one of the most important selling points of the scheme and welcomed by farmers.</P>
    <P>Research on TB in animals shows that the pre-movement test has been a safety net in certain circumstances.  Every year this test identifies approximately 300-400 TB positive herds.  If an annual test is carried out under proper conditions all farmers will co-operate.  The proposal to tie in this test with the payment of headage and other premia will be in the best interests of everyone and ensure that all animals which should be presented for testing are tested.  There will still have to be a 30 day test for cattle to be exported and farmers will accept the necessity for this.</P>
    <P>Since the introduction of the scheme in 1955 there have been major changes in the way it is administered.  Previously vets tested the cattle, submitted the results and were paid by the taxpayer via the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry.  From 1 February next year the farmers will pay the vet on the day the test is carried out.  The people who do not like this change will say that all the Minister is doing is rebalancing the cost.  However, there is <Col N="1447" /> nothing wrong with this proposal. People have to pay doctors and accountants for their services and farmers have to pay vets for each visit they make to their farms to look after their sick animals.  This change will also lead to a huge reduction in the levies on cattle sent to factories.  I have not yet seen the fine print but assume the local district veterinary office will be given a caretaker role and send out the lists to farmers, thereby ensuring an orderly system of testing.  The test will be tied to the payment of premium in much the same way as the ewe premium was tied to the sheep dipping certificate.  Deputy Ellis said that some cattle might not be tested for two years and this is an issue which will need to be monitored.  The market will dictate that cattle are tested annually as no farmer will be interested in buying cattle which have not been tested for two years.</P>
    <P>There have been numerous debates in the House on the disease levy.  I can remember a time when the cost was £9 million.  Over the years the cost increased to £28 million and there was no reason to believe it would not increase further.  It is for that reason and the cost of the bureaucracy that changes had to be introduced.  The Department also needs to slim down.  As Deputy O'Malley said, given the advances in technology veterinary offices should know the location of all four legged animals at any given time.</P>
    <P>It is proposed to invest more money on research into the causes of TB.  I welcome the extension of the project in east Offaly to other areas.  I have nothing against badgers but if they bring TB into farms then they should be dealt with.  I accept that there must be a balance in wildlife but there is adequate evidence available to show that badgers are a contributing factor to TB and must be treated as such.</P>
    <P>The sooner we do away with the tuberculin test the better.  I have pointed out to vets that it would be much more progressive if the same system was used for the testing of blood and brucellosis. <Col N="1448" /> People at many veterinary levels are working on the feasibility of such a system which would ensure a more accurate test.  I understand the stage has now been reached where blood can be held for ten or 11 hours.  However, in order to get it to a laboratory it will have to be possible to hold it for several days.  I hope this can be achieved as quickly as possible in the interests of all concerned.</P>
    <P>Nothing the Minister said should lead anyone to believe the reactor payments or hardship grants will be tampered with.  I would not like anyone to run with a contrary statement.  There is no proposal to decrease that fund, which is sacrosanct.  A farmer who cannot sell his herd through no fault of his own and has no income has to receive some payment from the State.</P>
    <P>In spite of all the arguing I hope this package will receive a favourable response from everyone.  I know it will give rise to much discussion but this is as it should be.  Obviously everyone will consider its implications for them.  The farm organisations seem to be happy with it but this does not mean that every farmer or Deputy is happy with it. People should consider a number of questions.  First, is it reasonable to continue with what we have been doing for the past 40 years when the level of TB remains the same?  Second, can the farmers who are selling cattle to the factories continue to sustain the huge increases in the levy each year?  Third, is it possible to reduce the incidence of TB at less cost to the taxpayer and farmer while at the same time maintaining the farmer-veterinary surgeon link which seems to be sacrosanct to so many vets?</P>
    <P>The veterinary surgeons have their own union which will speak on their behalf.  This is an opportunity to strengthen the farmer-veterinary surgeon link.  We had problems with the veterinary profession on a number of occasions &mdash; it is nothing new &mdash; but on this occasion it was made clear to me in the debate on rotational testing that it <Col N="1449" /> was important to them that they should have the opportunity of testing, advising, prescribing and generally discussing farm matters as they related to livestock with their client farmers.  That is protected in the Bill.  Every farmer will be given the opportunity to decide what vet he or she wants to employ and everybody accepts that is very important.  As a farmer, I certainly want that latitude. There is no reason that I should not continue to go to my local veterinary surgeon who is very good but I want the right to change and most farmers also want that right.</P>
    <P>There is an onus on everybody to trawl through the Bill and raise any shortcomings in it with a view to finding solutions.  For the first time since I saw a veterinary surgeon testing cattle on my farm 40 years ago we have an opportunity to make great progress on TB eradication.  I sincerely hope it will work for all our sakes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Any change in the TB eradication scheme will be an improvement.  Farmers in my area suffered more than most from the incidence of TB.  In the early stages of testing, my area was relatively disease free but now the incidence of TB there is probably the highest in the country.  In recent years provision has been made to recruit additional staff and provide extra resources to tackle this problem but it remains serious.</P>
      <P>In his speech the Minister outlined the significant progress that has been made in reducing the incidence of TB to 1 per cent of the national herd but there are pockets where the incidence is much higher.  Testing will be carried out at specified times but the farmer has to pay for the annual test.  Farmers who are in store production &mdash; primarily in the western counties &mdash; will feel the pinch more than others.  They would not have paid bovine disease levies to date because the levies were deducted at the point of slaughter.  These farmers now face the additional expenditure of paying to have their animals tested annually.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1450" /> The abolition of the pre-movement test will be welcomed by people in the cattle trade because it will give them greater flexibility in moving cattle to sales.  I am glad that the herd owners who carry out voluntary pre-movement tests will qualify for higher payments for reactors in the event of a breakout of the disease.  That is very important.  If I were buying cattle at a mart I would be very slow to purchase animals that were last tested more than one year previously.  I would imagine that a pre-movement test will be a bonus for those selling in the future.</P>
    <P>Through the years I have questioned our system of identification cards.  I suggest that we adopt the stock register system which operates very effectively in Northern Ireland.  Every animal purchased has to be entered in the stock register immediately and that register is the bible of the cattle industry.  I cannot understand why we will not introduce a similar system here.  In the past, computerisation was the excuse but I cannot understand why we will not adopt a tried and tested system which puts the onus on stock owners to have a clear record entry of all purchases and sales.</P>
    <P>The Irish Veterinary Union claims that this legislation will result in higher veterinary fees.  I hope that will not be the case because veterinary surgeons did very nicely in the past and they should not be jumping their fences and putting down markers at this stage.</P>
    <P>Recently I spoke to the owner of a medium sized farm who had to dispose of 22 reactors.  We discussed possible ways the disease was transmitted, for example badgers, but he told me that as his land was very close to a demesne where there is a large herd of deer he was concerned that the deer might have been the carriers.  I asked the Minister if those deers had been tested for TB and was disappointed to hear they had not but that a system of testing would be put in place shortly.  They should have been tested for TB many years ago.  Farmers in the area continually complain about the deers damaging plastic on outdoor <Col N="1451" /> silage pits and electric fences and jumping on cars on the roadway.</P>
    <P>Members referred to the badger problem and the pilot research project in County Offaly.  Similar projects should have been put in place in the Border region where there are TB blackspots both north and south of the Border.  The Minister stated that he intends to clear out the badgers under supervision of the Wildlife authorities. We should reach a definite conclusion on whether badgers carry disease to cattle or <i>vice versa.</i> The serious problem of TB in County Monaghan has been raised at many county council meetings. The high incidence to the detriment of the livestock trade in that area as outside buyers travel from mart to mart.  At my suggestion some years ago a sub committee was set up to liaise with veterinary surgeons.  While this was successful we still have a high instance of TB in the area.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that the cost of the disease eradication scheme would be reduced from £28 million to £10 million per annum and that the levy would be reduced from £7.30 to £2.50 per animal.  The overall deduction from the farmer per animal slaughtered is approximately £17.50.  That is a high cost especially when margins in beef production are tight.  A survey carried out in the Meath area revealed that in 1993 there were approximately 10,000 cattle in 11 large fattening units but that figure reduced by two thirds in 1994.  I know of a case where a young animal failed a TB test and realised £37.50 when brought for slaughter.  That farmer had to pay a 50 per cent levy to the Department.  The levy on each gallon of milk delivered has been reduced to 1.3 pence per gallon.  The levy of £7.30 more than doubles when account is taken of veterinary inspections, insurance and so on.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated there would be a saving of £4 million.  Any Minister who suggests that is naïve.  We have often been told that new measures will result in cost savings but that is rarely so.  I will <Col N="1452" /> be delighted if this scheme realises a saving of £4 million but I will not be surprised if it does not.</P>
    <P>A total of £1 billion has been spent on testing to date.  The scheme costs approximately £67 million per annum to operate.  The spending of £20 million on administration costs is astronomical and should be examined.  Since disease levies were introduced farmers have contributed £285 million.  ERAD was established with the intention of reducing the incidence of TB by 50 per cent, but recent surveys reveal that it is practically impossible to eradicate the disease completely.</P>
    <P>Questions must be asked about hygiene and other aspects of test quality.  The poultry industry, approximately 70 per cent of which is located in the Monaghan area, has been vulnerable to disease in recent years and, apart from egg packing and white meat processing, it does not receive State assistance. There are only two poultry instructors, one covering the Monaghan to Dublin area and another in Cork, yet the standard of hygiene in the industry is excellent.  Similar hygiene standards should apply in the TB eradication scheme.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that he intends to increase the maximum fines in respect of certain offences under sections 48 and 49 of the Diseases of Animals Act, 1966 which were last increased in August 1979.  I am not opposed to increases in fines if they are imposed. Too much leniency has been given to those caught committing those offences and it is time for a stricter examination.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Nothing causes more frustration to herd owners and those involved in the <Col N="1453" /> milk industry than TB.  A farmer I met last night told me that nine of his cows failed their TB test yesterday.  This is a huge blow for farmers and entire herds have been wiped out in my area.  Many farmers are unable to get back into farming because of high cattle prices and they often have to lease their quota. TB is a death blow to farmers.  The Minister or the Minister of State should ensure the measures of this Bill are implemented to the fullest.  We must come to grips with the problem, reduce the incidence of TB and decrease the trauma for farmers who lose their herds.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister's decision to introduce the Bovine Diseases (Levies) (Amendment) Bill, 1995.  This legislation is long overdue and definitely a step in the right direction.  Successive Ministers were only pussyfooting in tackling the eradication of TB and this new legislation will have an outstanding effect in finally getting rid of it.</P>
      <P>Farmers have been in a bad predicament through the years.  While they bore the brunt of the exorbitant costs of this scheme through milk and cattle levies, they did not seem to get good value for money.  Red tape regulations constantly eroded the levy purse.</P>
      <P>If there is one person who can manage their business, it is the Irish farmer. Farming is a traditional occupation in Ireland and has been handed down to those born and bred on farms, the majority of whom are third, fourth or fifth generation farmers.  Farmers never co-operate to the fullest extent when they are coerced or if they cannot see a light at the end of the tunnel.  However, thanks to the wisdom of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Yates, that light is now shining brightly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remind the House of the importance <Col N="1454" /> of the agriculture industry to our economy.  When the last litre of gas has been extracted from the Celtic Sea and the last litre of oil from the Porcupine Basin, agriculture will still be playing its rightful role in our economy.</P>
    <P>Agriculture has paid its share to our economy <i>secula seculorum.</i> Farmers must be given the right to determine their own direction in abolishing TB.  It has been a dreadful scourge on the agricultural community through the years.  I welcome the Minister's approach.  The farmer can now organise his TB tests through the veterinary surgeon of his choice rather than the Department impose one on him.  This provision lets the farmer direct his own destiny as far as the health of his herd is concerned.</P>
    <P>Compulsory TB testing was introduced in 1954.  The cost of the schemes designed to eradicate brucellosis and TB has exceeded £1 billion and the current annual cost of the scheme is almost £67 million.  Since the disease levies were introduced in 1979, farmers have contributed £285 million to them.</P>
    <P>I spoke to farmers at the Bandon and Skibbereen marts.  They were critical of the £7.30 levy on each animal slaughtered or exported live and the levy of 1.3p on every gallon of milk delivered to the creamery.  We are told these exorbitant levies will be reduced from £28 million per year to £10 million.  There will be a net saving of £18 million for Irish farmers.</P>
    <P>Tests will be carried out by local veterinary surgeons and that is welcome. Why should taxpayers contribute to the eradication of bovine TB when it is an agricultural matter?  The procedure adopted by the Minister yesterday shows he is on the right track.  Responsibility for the matter now lies with the farming community and the Department which should co-operate with each other.</P>
    <P>There are seven million cattle in the country and we are told that over 99 per cent of them are now free from TB and 99.9 per cent from brucellosis.  It has been stated that the disease may be carried by wildlife but that is debatable. <Col N="1455" /> The budger has been singled out but perhaps the badger is infected by other animals.  We do not know.  I hope the pilot scheme in east Offaly will provide the Department with information on this aspect of the matter.  Farmers in my constituency are dubious about the claim that badgers are carriers and time will tell if this is so.</P>
    <P>The pre-movement or 60-day test will be abolished and rightly so.  If an animal which had a clear annual test reacts to a test carried out shortly after it has been purchased the farmer will receive a higher rate of compensation.  That is a step in the right direction.  If a farmer has a reactor in his herd he will be more wary of buying animals which do not have a clear test within a certain period. Farmers who violate the regulation will not benefit from the higher rate of subsidy for a reactor grant.  The net saving from the abolition of compulsory pre-movement testing will be £3.5 million combined with a saving of £4 million on annual round testing.  The net benefit to farmers from the new scheme will be of the order of £7.5 million.</P>
    <P>Earlier this year the Minister encountered difficulties with the veterinary union when he tried to introduce special animal testing regulations.  Members of the union rejected the Minister's request.  I was critical of the union at first but representing a rural constituency in Cork south-west which is predominantly agricultural, I realised that the majority of veterinary surgeons in my constituency are single operators. How can we expect those operating their own business to travel perhaps from Schull to Kanturk to test a herd and risk losing business at home?  A client might have a sick animal and telephone for the veterinary surgeon only to be told that he or she is testing animals on behalf of the Department 60 or 80 miles away.  That will not work in rural areas.  The relationship between a farmer and a veterinary surgeon is such that no other veterinary surgeon might suit the farmer.  I understand how veterinary surgeons who do not operate a <Col N="1456" /> group system could not accede to the Minister's request.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on his foresight and wisdom in introducing this Bill.  I have no doubt that it will be successful and accepted by farmers and their organisations.  This is the first time since the commencement of the scheme 41 years ago that that level of co-operation has been achieved.  I have no doubt, therefore, that the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Yates, will go down in history as the man who dealt the final blow to bovine TB.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanMcGahon" hpid="Mr. McGahon Mr. McGahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGahon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an honour for me to follow such a leading authority on agricultural matters as Deputy Sheehan. I am an urban cowboy and normally would not speak in a debate on agricultural matters, but I am intrigued by the question of bovine TB eradication.  During the time I was a member of the Committee of Public Accounts it dealt at length with this issue, which is of vital importance to the agriculture industry. It has already cost the State over £1 billion while the annual cost is between £68 million and £70 million.  That is an incredible sum for a small nation to have to foot on an annual basis.</P>
      <P>While I welcome the measures proposed in this Bill I am very cynical about the possibility of finally eradicating this awful scourge.  Some years ago I visited Copenhagen in Denmark and Amsterdam in Holland, two countries which, incredibly, have disease free status.  Denmark has been free of TB since 1929 and Holland since the 1930s, the reason being that a different system of farming is used.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Denmark cattle are kept indoors and never see the light of day from the day they are born until the day they are slaughtered.  One could argue whether that is a good or humane system, but the reality is that in Denmark this awful scourge has been eradicated.  The bottom line is that farmers in those two countries, the only two in the world which have disease free status, were prepared to accept responsibility. <Col N="1457" /> Unlike here, there are no fairs in Denmark.  As a consequence, cattle do not change hands.  They are born and die on a farm.  In Ireland a beast is sold on average seven times.  In this way disease is transmitted.</P>
    <P>I support Deputy Sheehan in his defence of the badger.  It is all too easy to blame the badger for transmitting this disease.  We were told by the Danish veterinary association not to accept this theory as it is untrue.  The findings of recent studies carried out in the North proved inconclusive as to whether the badger is a carrier of bovine TB.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister luck but, as Deputy Leonard said, we will still be talking about the lack of progress in this matter in four or five years time as the necessary degree of discipline and collective responsibility is missing in Irish farming circles to ensure that this awful disease is eradicated.</P>
    <P>This scheme has been a gravy train for the veterinary profession.  It has made millions of pounds from it.  It is the most lucrative profession in the country bar none.  I question its commitment to finding or recommending solutions to the Minister and the Department because it does not want the gravy train to stop.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv" hpid="Éamon Ó Cuív Éamon Ó Cuív">
      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have an opportunity to speak on this subject. Like Deputy McGahon, I believe Deputy Sheehan was slightly optimistic. I hope I am wrong, but I think we will see the drainage of the Shannon for which we have been waiting a long time before the eradication of bovine TB.</P>
      <P>It has to be accepted that, while throwing money at the problem has been good for some, it is not the answer. One of the key statements in the Minister's speech is that further research, better vaccines and different diagnostic techniques may prove more important in solving the problem.  I have long held the view that a more rigid approach should be adopted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the problem of TB in the human population was solved by science I would like to see more money allocated <Col N="1458" /> for research into the causes of the problem in the animal population to find a better way of dealing with it.  Constant testing and the imposition of restrictions have not produced results, despite the difficulties caused for farmers.  In this regard I am happy that the pre-movement test is to be done away with.</P>
    <P>On the question of savings, Deputy Sheehan was four times more optimistic than the Minister.  He mentioned a figure of £16 million, but omitted to subtract from this sum the direct cost of testing to farmers.  The Minister mentioned a figure of £4 million.  As my colleague, Deputy Leonard, said we will believe it when we see it.  I say that with no disrespect to the Minister or his advisers, but time and again we have been promised great savings which have not materialised.</P>
    <P>I recognise that a burden has been lifted particularly from milk producers and those who sell animals to factories, but it has to be acknowledged that an extra burden is to be imposed on store cattle producers in the west.  The 5,000 herd owners that I represent in Connemara do not produce milk or finished cattle in the main.  Therefore, the amount collected by way of the two levies was relatively small.  In the sense that the levy to be paid on the finished animal was taken into account in the price paid by the farmer buying in order to fatten cattle they paid their share, but in relative terms they were not over burdened.  In terms of the number of cattle involved, they do not account for a large proportion of total agricultural output, but if politics is about people we are talking about a large number.  I am concerned that the cost of testing will prove a major burden on those with herds of between three and eight cattle.  Until now there was an equalisation of costs and, if I am honest about it, the burden was disproportionately carried by large farmers and the milk and cattle producer.  However, we will now swing this the other way unless an arrangement is made.</P>
    <P>To date, I have not heard any firm commitment that the cost of testing will <Col N="1459" /> be the same nationwide.  To do that, we will need to agree a compensation package for vets operating in areas like Connemara.  In Connemara, Údarás na Gaeltachta had to provide special funding to maintain vets because the unit costs were so high.  If the vet charged economic costs for work already done, he would have to charge astronomical fees which would make it impossible.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed Deputy Sheehan, who has an offshore island in his constituency, did not raise this matter. What will we do about the economic cost of testing on offshore islands?  Will people have to pay the economic cost of testing or will a mechanism be designed to ensure that the cost burden of testing is made equal?</P>
    <P>I understand that if a farmer does not carry out the annual test within the required time, he may lose his headage and premium payments.  That seems a reasonable proposal but, in practice, what seems to be an innocent and reasonable proposal does not work that way.  In my constituency there is a preponderance of old people looking after farms.  They have a right to their land, but their ability to deal with the considerable amount of paperwork they receive, from CSO forms wanting to know the number of cattle, sheep, pigs, hens, duck, drakes, etc., and headage and area aid forms, has become a burden.</P>
    <P>The Minister will be aware of difficulties this year in relation to the non-return of area aid forms in time for that scheme.  I understand there is a particular problem in my area.  Although most farmers complete and return the form, there will always be those who forget, not for a malicious reason but because they get distracted.  This problem arises with older people in particular.  The Minister will be aware of people in his constituency who forget to renew their medical card despite reminders.  He will make representations each week for people who for one reason or another run into difficulties with these matters.</P>
    <P>A further problem which arises in <Col N="1460" /> such cases is the upset caused when a member of a household dies, particularly the herd owner, and there are problems relating to transfer, etc.  In some cases, those left behind deal expeditiously with the paperwork, while in others they cannot cope and it is five, six months or one year later when they do the necessary work.  It is important that in the regulations there is an out clause or discretion for the Minister to waive penalties in exceptional cases.</P>
    <P>In the event of a death if it could prove that there was no desire to evade testing and if subsequent tests found the herd to be TB free, those exceptional circumstances should be taken into account.  We must allow for exceptional circumstances in every scheme.  As politicians we do a considerable amount of constituency work and see the difficulties and unforeseen circumstances in which people find themselves and, therefore, we should always allow for reasonable discretion to be exercised in hard cases.  If genuine cases are provided for, I would have no difficulty with that proposal.</P>
    <P>Yesterday the Minister had his first meeting with the Irish Veterinary Union, which is extraordinary.  I do not hold a brief for any section in this but meeting people is fundamental if we are to deal with this problem.  No group, including vets, farmers, etc., should be able to dictate to Ministers.  I agree with the right of the Minister to make the final decision no matter what the social partners say because that is the nature of Government.  It is a reasonable rule of thumb to listen to all sides where possible and to try to get people to work together.  Whatever scheme is introduced, patience rather than a confrontational approach will be needed to arrive at a system which is based on a partnership of people working together to sort out this problem.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will be swift and strong in dealing with abuses of future schemes and that he will be willing to take up the cudgels against any group milking the scheme.  Explaining one's view and debating a matter at length <Col N="1461" /> does not mean giving in to any group.  It is important that there is ongoing dialogue in relation to this matter.  It will be important to have the goodwill of farmers for this scheme to work.  It is also important to examine the situation in relation to the veterinarians, particularly those operating in sparsely populated rural areas with small farms.</P>
    <P>We can look at farming in two ways. I agree with Deputy Sheehan as regards its importance to the economy.  On a global scale, we must look at areas and counties which produce the greatest amount for export.  However, an economy is about people and, therefore, when we look at farming interests with a view to making decisions, we must look at the farmer with cows to whom farming is a way of life and who has a right to be treated equitably even if their production in national terms is tiny.  While the farm bodies and representatives may represent 95 per cent of agricultural production, they probably do not represent 95 per cent of herd owners because a disproportionate number of small herd owners are not members of the farm organisations. They have their rights as citizens and taxpayers and their difficulties should not be forgotten in negotiations on this matter.</P>
    <P>Similarly, it is important to remember there is a small number of veterinarians, most of whom are highly dedicated, have a huge level of commitment and are willing to work in the most argiculturally deprived areas such as the islands off the coasts of Mayo, Donegal, Galway, Cork and Kerry.  They are willing to work in conditions in which they would not be expected to work in the bigger farming counties.  They are small in number but they should not be forgotten in negotiations.</P>
    <P>I wish to deal with an issue that has caused many problems for farmers, that is the so-called blue cards, which are actually green.  Those cards cause great confusion and difficulties for farmers in filling application forms.  On the forms farmers are requested to state the date <Col N="1462" /> a cow was born, the date it had its last calf or the date it is expected to calf and the number of the animal.  These cards are hand-written and the numbers are very often difficult to read because of the green colour of the card.  Even though the Department requests the date of birth of the animal, that is not written on the card.  It is reasonable to demand that cards specify all the relevant information to apply for a suckler cow premium or headage payment.  I am sure the civil servants dealing with these applications would welcome such a decision.</P>
    <P>In some cases the Department may write to a person stating that they gave a different date of birth for an animal from that given previously.  In that case, it already had the date and there is no reason for requesting it again.  In cases where a person is not sure of the date of birth of an animal the only recourse is to ask a friendly official in the hope that he will have the date from the previous year.  If that information was provided on the cards it would overcome these problems.  I hope the Minister will consider changing the system to provide the farmer with a user friendly card that outlines in a printed form all the relevant information requested annually by the Department.  Mar a dúirt mé ag an tús tá go leor rudaí le moladh sa scéim atá molta ach tá go leor ceisteanna le freagairt sul go mbeidh fhios againn an bhfuil an scéim seo comh maith agus atá an tAire a rá.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill which changes some of the regulations to bring them into line with requirements and increases fines to a more realistic level.  In the past it was very difficult to bring cases to court and the level of fines was irrelevant.  Because of blue cards, tags and so on, it is very difficult to take action against people who spread disease, causing serious difficulties not only for the Department but for their fellow farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's announcement last night about the proposed changes in the future operation of the <Col N="1463" /> scheme.  I appreciate that in the past Ministers tried to devise measures to eradicate the residual level of TB.  Successful action was taken in the early years but recently it has become much more difficult to eradicate the disease. Any step taken by the Minister is therefore welcome.</P>
    <P>Apart from a family bereavement, no issue causes as much frustration, anxiety and worry to farm families and their neighbours as a serious outbreak of disease in the family herd.  As Deputy Leonard said, County Monaghan is one of the worst affected areas in this regard.  In recent years the position has changed from reasonably good to very bad.  That is partly due to increased farm stocking rates.  With intensive poultry and mushroom industries, land is very fertile and as a result stocking levels are greater than in many other areas.  In the last 18 months or two years at least one-quarter of herd owners in Monaghan have experienced a serious breakdown in herds or had their herds closed.  That gives an indication of the seriousness of the problem.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that the previous Minister, Deputy Joe Walsh, made extra staff available in a very cramped office in Ballybay.  I pay tribute to the Minister of State, Deputy Deenihan, who on coming to office took immediate steps to remedy that structural problem.  I hope those measures will enable staff to work in better circumstances and thereby provide a better service.</P>
    <P>When a herd owner loses an entire herd, as sometimes happens, it takes years to rebuild it.  We must ensure people in those circumstances receive the best possible assistance.  Deputies Leonard, O'Hanlon and I have been involved in bringing groups together, but there is still insufficient co-operation in our county.  Farmers need a sympathetic shoulder at times of loss of herd.  They should be given all the necessary advice to overcome the problem.  Above all, they want to get whatever payment is due to them at the earliest possible date.  In this regard I <Col N="1464" /> welcome one of the recent changes.  Previously, payments were sent from a local office only on a monthly basis.  Now they are sent fortnightly which means that if there is a problem about tax certificates and so forth, farmers can be sure of a quicker payment as soon as these are rectified.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the need for co-operation between farm organisations, vets and the Department.  That cannot be over-emphasised.  We are moving into a new era in which the farmer will employ his vet to do the test. This will remove much of the aggravation that occurred in the last few years.</P>
    <P>Some Members of the Opposition have suggested that rotational testing was devised by the Minister, Deputy Yates.  This was an ongoing effort by Ministers in recent years to try to reach agreement with Brussels to draw down millions of pounds for the eradication of disease.  The Department and other Ministers discussed it and co-operated with the Brussels authorities to devise a package to improve disease eradication. Unfortunately, successive Ministers were not successful and the Minister, Deputy Yates, inherited a problem.  We hope to get some money from Brussels but the £10 million per year for three years promised five years ago is now just over £4 million per year for three years.  We have lost money as a result of wrangling and lack of co-operation.  I hope we will now move forward.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ó Cuív said the small store producer will suffer as a result of these new regulations because farm levies on beef bullocks or export animals will be reduced from £7.30 to £2.50 per beast. Milk levies will also be reduced, from 1.3p per gallon to 0.5p.  However, under this package there will be no need for the pre-movement test.  The £3.5 million being saved in that area was mainly being paid by the small store producer so he will make a saving.  He also has greater freedom to sell his stock as the pre-movement test will no longer be <Col N="1465" /> compulsory.  The picture, therefore, is not all black.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ó Cuív also referred to blue cards.  Nothing has caused me more frustration during my years in farming, politics and this House.  Bank managers, council officers and others can have all their business on computer yet we, after so many years, are still using blue cards. I led delegations to Northern Ireland years ago and had long discussions with the Department about this issue.  It is now more important than ever to introduce an appropriate permit system at the earliest possible date.  Blue cards are only bus permits.  Animals can move anywhere at any time within test restrictions and nobody might know exactly where they are.</P>
    <P>It is time we regulated business and knew exactly where every animal is so that if there is a breakdown in a herd, within 24 hours every herd owner who might have got cattle from that herd knows where the animals are or where they can be traced.  That has been the situation, to a large degree, north of the Border.  It has not solved the problems because there has been fiddling with regard to cards, tags and so forth in the Border areas and the people on the northern side of the Border have not been totally innocent.  However, if records of all the animals in Ireland were on a computer system and there was co-operation between the two ministries it would be a major step forward.</P>
    <P>Another major problem relates to wildlife.  The Minister commented on that.  There has been major involvement by the Department in Offaly and, to a lesser extent, in Monaghan.  However, if we are to come to grips with the serious TB outbreak in Monaghan we must deal with the wildlife including the deer about which Deputy Leonard spoke earlier.  At least we have received a commitment, as a result of my correspondence with the Minister, that the deer will be curtailed in the not too distant future.  This step must be welcomed and encouraged.  However, the Minister must look seriously at the wildlife problem in the Monaghan region in light of <Col N="1466" /> the fact that it is the county worst affected by TB.  Farmers have generally taken a responsible role but when they see that badgers and deer are not being tested and are being treated as the innocent parties they become very frustrated.  Nothing frustrates them as much as finding an enclosed herd, where cattle have not been bought in for years, and where neighbours have not bought in cattle, suddenly fall prey to an outbreak of TB that cannot be explained. More money must be spent on investigating this issue.  We are not saying that only the badger and deer are to blame but farmers deserve at least to be assured that the Department has some idea of where the disease is originating.</P>
    <P>In Dartry Wood, for example, near Rockcorry in County Monaghan trees were cut down and the deer population increased dramatically.  In the area from there to Scotshouse herds of livestock were wiped out.  That is totally unacceptable and the problem must be tackled.  All politics are local so one should discuss the area one knows best. There are 371 herds still closed in County Monaghan out of a total of 5,133.  About 1,200 herds in the past 18 months suffered closure.  The number of animals that came out last year was 2,631.  This year the number is 2,343 for the same period so there is only a slight reduction.  The number of reactor herds listed for the same period last year was 715 as against 583 this year.  However, there is not the same restriction period this year as there was last year and that had a role in lowering the figure. Another factor that influences the herd statistics for Monaghan is that if an animal has two inconclusive tests it is deemed a reactor.  There is a much tighter examination regime and that is a serious problem.</P>
    <P>The Minister's proposal is a major step forward.  Its main provision is that the payment for an annual herd test will be devolved from the taxpayer directly to the farmer.  There is a reduction of 65 per cent in farmers' levies from £28 <Col N="1467" /> million to £10 million.  The abolition of the compulsory pre-movement test is a step in the right direction.  While it may play a major part in increasing the effectiveness of the scheme, improving quality control and enhancing research programmes, I will have to see it operating in practice before I believe it.  As we have heard this line many times in the past, we need to see the benefits secured from the operation of this measure.</P>
    <P>Regarding the abolition of the pre-movement test, the Minister must be commended for allocating additional grants to herd owners involved in a post-movement and pre-movement test. I ask him to adopt a common sense approach to herd testing at departmental and farm level.  One test should be acceptable in the case of farmers who buy dairy stock direct from other farmers as happens frequently, irrespective of which farm it takes place on.  It does not make sense that I should demand of a neighbour or an acquaintance that he should test his herd on the Monday or Tuesday before I would be due to take delivery of them and that I must carry out a test on those animals in my herd a week later to prove that they have been tested at the time of the change-over. The same level of compensation must be provided in respect of herds that are not traded.  If farmers are committed to eradicating disease, they must be assured that they will not lose out as a result of the provisions of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ó Cuív referred to the requirement of completing forms for area aid and other grants.  The Minister and the Minister of State have played an active role in improving the position. Those forms must be further simplified. It would be easy for the Department to keep computer records of the animals' birth dates if permits were used instead of cards.  Guesswork is used in recording the birth date of many animals.  I have stood at the cattle chute while many tests have been carried out.  Veterinary surgeons usually advise their staff to <Col N="1468" /> record what they consider to be the animal's age.  The system of recording is not appropriate.  Veterinary surgeons also record the animal's breed, an increasingly important aspect.  If a new card were issued for an animal recorded as a Shorthorn or a Limousin in a previous test and a different vetinerary surgeon notices a white spot on the animal and records it as a Friesian, the farmer's credibility is immediately called into question and he may be accused of defrauding the State.  If it is noted in his returns on a new application for a beef or suckler cow premium that the record of the breed of the animal has been changed from a Limousin or a Shorthorn to a Friesian, not only will that farmer be curtailed in respect of that animal but he may also be asked to withdraw from the scheme for a period of two years.  This is unacceptable, particularly in the case of a farmer who would have no intention of defrauding the State or the European Union.</P>
    <P>I welcome the scheme.  The changes in it are long overdue.  The scheme will not work without the co-operation of the Minister, his Department, the veterinary surgeons operating the disease eradication scheme and farmers.  It has not operated with 100 per cent co-operation in the past and anyone who says otherwise is living in cloud cuckoo land. The increases in the level of fines are important, but the changes in the operation of the scheme are also important. If we are to retain the largest number of farmers possible in rural Ireland, we must tackle the eradication of bovine TB.</P>
    <P>As a medical doctor, Deputy O'Hanlon will agree that in the past tuberculosis was a major disease that affected humans.  We want to ensure that the days my mother lived and nursed through when that disease was prevalent in humans never return.  We want to eradicate the disease from the animal herd.  It is in that context, and not only an economic one, that we must ensure the scheme operates properly with the full co-operation of the parties involved.</P>

      <P>The Minister referred to a number of measures to control, reduce and eradicate animal disease.  He referred to the successes in that area during the past 40 years since these schemes were introduced.  He said that 99 per cent of animals are tuberculosis free.  That figure sounds good, but 1 per cent, 70,000 animals, still carry the disease, a problem about which we must be concerned.  The incidence of the disease is not restricted to 1 per cent per county. Unfortunately, some counties have a high incidence while others do not.  All Members must be concerned about the continued existence of the disease and the variation in the incidence of it from one county to another.  Deputies Leonard and Crawford referred to the position in County Monaghan.  We must recognise that £1 billion was spent during the past 40 years, nearly 30 per cent of which was paid directly by farmers. At present £67 million is being spent, approximately 40 per cent of that by farmers.</P>
      <P>I support the points made by my colleagues on this side of the House.  Many issues were addressed during the debate &mdash;identity cards, the role of veterinary surgeons, the provision of the service and the influence of wildlife on the spread of bovine tuberculosis.  I do not intend to go into detail on those issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister highlighted the main elements of the new regime.  He referred to the partnership between farmers and his Department, which I support.  It is time we adopted a serious approach to eradicating bovine tuberculosis.  I appeal to the Minister and the Minister of State, Deputy Deenihan, to consider the possibility of establishing a pilot scheme in a county with a higher than average incidence of the disease, such as Monaghan.  A small group should be established including representatives of the Department, ERAD <Col N="1470" /> and district veterinary officers and representatives of the Irish Farmers' Association.  They should be given teeth and responsibility for the operation of the scheme in Monaghan.</P>

      <P>The question of co-operation is broad based.  I am talking about establishing a small group in one county.  The east Offaly research scheme is working well but the time has come when we should address that issue.  The three State agencies, which to an extent work in parallel, should come together and we should have an intensive, integrated and co-ordinated approach in one area where the outbreak of the disease is high.</P>

      <P>I appreciate what the Minister is hoping to do but the approach must be intensive, integrated and co-ordinated.  I am in favour of the idea of a pilot scheme because much can be learned from it which will be of benefit to other counties.  I wish to make a point about diseases in general.  The World Health Organisation succeeded in eradicating smallpox including in countries such as Tibet.  I cannot understand why in Ireland we cannot do a better job on the eradication of bovine tuberculosis.  If we succeeded it would be in the interests of farmers, the people and the economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my colleague for the opportunity to make a short contribution to this important debate which <Col N="1471" /> concerns an element of our most important industry, the national cattle herd.  At regular intervals commentators refer to the TB eradication scheme and the huge cost to the taxpayer over the past 30 to 40 years.  I do not argue with the assertion that the scheme has been very costly.  It has been regarded as a TB eradication scheme but we could be tempted to ask whether it is a TB containment scheme.  On occasions we appeared to be making progress but, for some unexplained reason, a serious outbreak of TB will occur, as was the case in County Monaghan for a number of years where there have been serious problems.  There have been breakdowns in what have been classified as the self-contained herds.  That is the great dilemma so far as farmers are concerned.  Why should a farm where there is virtually no inward movement of stock have a serious outbreak of TB in their herd?  The question must be asked whether wildlife in the area is acting as a carrier, whether there is poor or inadequate fencing and whether there are problems with the testing techniques.  It may be a combination of all those factors.</P>
      <P>If we are to achieve the objective of eradicating TB from the national herd clearly there is a need for a co-ordinated, cohesive approach to the operation of the scheme.  I come from a farming background and believe we have to start by ensuring that the goodwill of farmers is kept uppermost in the minds of those who administer the scheme.  Those in administration and the veterinary profession are doing their best to eradicate the disease.  Unexplained problems will arise here and there from time to time due to a lack of co-ordination and co-operation.  If we can get the different elements involved &mdash;the farmers, the veterinary surgeons, the Department and ERAD&mdash;working together we will, in time, come to terms with this serious blight on the national herd.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where there is poor fencing between farms, stock can intermix.  This is part <Col N="1472" /> and parcel of the culture of rural Ireland and a contributory factor in the spread of the disease.  I am not sure how it can be eliminated.  Clearly, if farmers can ensure that their boundary fences are properly kept it would help enormously.</P>
    <P>A unique feature of the national cattle herd, which is not as obvious in the national herds of other countries, is the number of times stock move during their lifetimes.  It has been estimated that the average number of moves is seven.  Clearly if stock leave the original farm for cattle marts in the west or east and are then transferred to other farms that is a contributory factor in the spread and outbreak of the disease.  I do not pretend to have any ready-made answers to the problem having regard to our farm structures.  If it was possible to reduce the number of movements within the national herd this would help to control the spread of the disease to reasonable proportions.</P>
    <P>The poor working relationship between the Minister and veterinary surgeons recently is regretted.  The Minister may say he is putting a plan together and unless it is accepted he will not be in a position to draw down funds from the European Union.  The reality is that there has been a unique working relationship between the veterinary surgeons and individual farmers.  The question of breaking the vet-farmer link is fine in theory but in practice it is not easy.  It is all about goodwill, confidence, communication and ensuring that farmers are encouraged to co-operate with the scheme.</P>
    <P>Let us examine the impact there will be on a farm whether in County Louth, County Monaghan or County West-meath if there is a serious outbreak of disease in, say, a dairy herd.  A process of depopulation takes place within that herd and there is a serious economic loss to that farm.  I accept compensation is available to help the farmer to restock the farm in the meantime.  Let us consider the case of the farmer who took out a huge mortgage from his local friendly bank manager for the purpose of developing the dairy farmyard and to <Col N="1473" /> buy expensive stock.  After two months the stock is dying and he also has the hidden problem of tuberculosis in that herd.  Subsequent tests indicate that 10 per cent or 20 per cent of that herd has to be depopulated and this results in a huge economic loss.  Given the defence mechanisms of all human beings, the natural inclination is to ensure they are in a position to keep bread and butter on the table and to meet their commitments to the local bank manager.  That is a core problem with disease eradication in Ireland.  If farmers have their backs to the wall and it is a question of saving a pound here or there, the degree of co-operation is determined accordingly.  I am not suggesting that the Minister has enormous resources available to him to meet every individual circumstance but it is an aspect of the scheme which must be examined.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Hanlon referred to the need for an integrated approach.  While there is a degree of integration in the current approach, we must intensify our efforts in that regard.  We must examine all the geographic areas and the factors affecting them and ensure that individual farmers living in those areas are aware of any problems on adjoining farms.  They must be in a position to take the necessary steps to ensure their fences are in proper order.  If a farmer's herd is infected with tuberculosis he must ensure that his cattle do not wander on adjoining farms which would result in an automatic spread of the disease to other herds.  We may have to consider allocating a small amount of funding in those circumstances.</P>
    <P>It would be easy for me to say that the eradication of TB is a simple matter, if it was, the scheme would not be running for as long as it has and would not have cost the State as much as it has to date.  However, there is a process of change.  Ireland has some of the best dairy farmers compared with any other country in Europe.  Those farmers are anxious to protect their individual farm assets and they want to co-operate with the Department and ERAD to ensure this disease is eradicated.  There will <Col N="1474" /> always be individual cases, however, where the degree of co-operation is not adequate.</P>
    <P>I would have liked to make more comments on the scheme but I will conclude by saying I am happy to contribute to this debate.  I ask the Minister to adopt flexibility in his approach thereby ensuring that all the sectors involved operate at full momentum at all times. If he does that, progress on the scheme will be accelerated.</P>

      <P>This is one of the most important debates we have had.  When I first entered this House the debates on agriculture were lengthy and bitter. With Ireland's accession to the European Community it is obvious that most of the decisions affecting the farming community are no longer made in Agriculture House but in Brussels.  However, an issue that has remained constant over the years is the need to eradicate TB and brucellosis.  The fight against these diseases in ongoing with consequent enormous expenditure being allocated towards eliminating them from our herds.  From listening to the Minister's contribution one would think the battle had been won with 99.9 per cent of our herds being cleared of brucellosis and 99 per cent being cleared of TB.  The remaining 0.1 per cent and 1 per cent are proving to be extremely difficult to eliminate and in that respect the Minister is hoping the proposals in this Bill will be successful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I listened to the farming programme on my way home last night and it appears that the IFA and the ICMSA welcome the Bill but not the IVU, the veterinary union, is far from happy with the proposals contained in it.  One of the main features of the Bill, the payment for annual herd testing, is welcome. There will be a reduction of 65 per cent in farmers' levies from £28 million to <Col N="1475" /> £10 million in addition to the abolition of the compulsory 60 day pre-movement test.  There will also be a major offensive on the effectiveness of the scheme through improved quality control and an enhanced research programme and that is welcome.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister on what he is trying to achieve but the old argument about how it can be achieved raises its head.  The farmers' organisations seem to be happy with what the Minister is doing but the IVU is unhappy and that is the stumbling block in regard to the Bill.  As a former Minister for Labour, I hold the view that an independent body or a rights commissioner could intervene in a dispute such as this.  Perhaps that can be done because I am aware such efforts have been made in that regard in the past, apparently without success.</P>
    <P>As my colleague, Deputy Sheehan, said, agriculture is our most important industry.  When other areas which are currently proving beneficial to us such as natural gas, etc., have been exhausted, we will continue to have a vibrant agriculture industry.  The vibrancy of that industry was demonstrated to me and to you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, at the Tinahely show last August when huge numbers of farmers and the members of the trades dependent on farming showed their support.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, most of the major decisions affecting farmers are made in Brussels.  The other member states of the EU have an interest as consumers in their own countries.  While we receive a great deal of funding from the EU, its member states are interested in what Ireland is going in this area and what is proposed in the Bill.  When one considers the amount of funds invested in this disease eradication programme and the billions of pounds already expended, the fact that we could not draw down £10 million must mean that those within the European Union are not happy with our achievements to date.  We must maintain a watchful eye on European consumers to whom we <Col N="1476" /> sell our produce since many more of them are examining our treatment of animals, particularly those in Britain, where various organisations are being established to prevent the export of live animals.</P>
    <P>I received a letter from a Dr. Weber in Switzerland, which is not part of the European Union, who has established an organisation whose aim is the elimination of live cattle exports.  Apparently he is making representations to all public representatives within the European Union to protest at the export of live cattle from this country.  In that letter he posed some rather silly questions, such as whether I was for or against the export of live cattle.  I replied that I was also against the opening of numbered bank accounts in Switzerland where people can invest unknown amounts and asked whether he knew anything about what had happened to intervention beef in the past few years.  I maintained that, if we do not export animals, our economy will not be very sound.  Perhaps he should come here and talk to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry and realise just how important the agricultural industry is to our economy.  Nonetheless, it would be foolish of us not to pay attention to what is happening in Europe, such as the formation of organisations whose members may influence the thinking of those who sit around the table at meetings of Councils of Ministers.</P>
    <P>An article captioned &ldquo;Killer Antibiotics Breed Killer Food Bugs&rdquo; appeared in the <i>Sunday Times</i> on Sunday last which gave the impression that the administration of antibiotics to animals which end up in the food chain has had a detrimental effect on young children and others.  The Department should be aware of that impression and needs to inform editors of newspapers that print such material of our veterinary inspections and controls on the use of such antibiotics, which are certainly not in any way detrimental to the food chain.</P>
    <P>We have now reached the stage at which the numbers of diseased cattle are <Col N="1477" /> minimal.  The stumbling block is one sector who fear their livelihood from the industry being threatened.  It is incumbent on the Minister to involve himself in the dispute or delegate an intermediary to bring all sides together, thus ensuring the provisions of this Bill are implemented.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is the collection of levies on live exports.  Some Members have availed of the opportunity to broaden the debate into a more general discussion on the bovine TB eradication scheme.  This may not be a bad thing, affording us an opportunity to put our views on the record.</P>
      <P>Under this Bill the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry will be paid levies directly.  At present they are paid to Revenue and thereafter refunded to the Department.</P>
      <P>The amount of levies imposed on the export of cattle within the ambit of this Bill amounted to approximately £3 million in 1994.  This was deducted from farmers' payments and represents only a small proportion of the total amount paid directly by them to the cost of the overall bovine eradication scheme, which I understand to be approximately £67 million.  Of that amount, £28 million was comprised of direct deductions from farmers&mdash;£7.30 deducted per head of all cattle killed in factories or abattoirs and 1.3 pence per gallon deducted from all milk sales.  That £28 million collected from farmers annually goes some way to meeting the costs of reactor grants, veterinary fees, equipment and research, being comprised in equal proportions of milk and cattle levies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, there is an animal inspection levy of £3.78 deducted at meat factories and a Bord Bia levy of £1.50 per animal for slaughter or live export.  Is it not a great little animal capable of bearing those costs directly from the farmer's income?  Since the farmer pays the piper, he is entitled to call the tune in this respect.  There have been many cases of hardship among farmers in my <Col N="1478" /> county whose herds have been locked up, particularly last year in the flooded area of south Galway where some herds were locked up and perhaps some three quarters of a 30 or 40 acre farm was under water.  Those farmers had to keep their livestock on the five or six acres of higher ground not flooded, causing them considerable hardship.</P>
    <P>There is also the matter of inadequate compensation for store cattle and weanlings in locked up herds.  If we can comply with European Union regulations, we have the potential to draw down approximately £20 million annually in European Union funding for our bovine TB eradication programme, which would result in a huge reduction in levies farmers pay at present to perhaps a quarter of their present rates.  I compliment the Minister and his Minister of State on their efforts to secure these funds.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that the devolution of payment for annual round testing to farmers means that, for the first time, the responsibility for its cost will be removed from the taxpayer.  I note also that the new procedures will reduce farmers' levies from 1.3 pence per gallon to 0.5 pence for dairy farmers and from £7.50 to £2.50 per head in the case of beef cattle, representing a considerable reduction to the benefit of farmers who will receive their cheques with fewer deductions.  The Minister also said that in the first year the disease levies would be reduced to approximately £10 million from £28 million, thereafter compensation and operational costs being shared by the Exchequer and farmers on a 2:1 ratio.</P>
    <P>The discontinuance of the 60-day compulsory pre-movement test will be much welcomed and of great benefit to farmers and the industry generally. Nonetheless I am concerned about the proposal that herd owners should pay for their first herd testing each year. Although a good principle.  I predict it will militate against small western farmers who do not produce finished cattle and will be unable to avail of the <Col N="1479" /> reduction in the killing levies.  The Minister should re-examine this from the perspective of the western store cattle producer who will be disadvantaged by having to pay for the first annual test.</P>
    <P>Having made my living in the livestock industry prior to entering politics, I can confirm that as many as five or six transactions involving an animal may take place during its lifetime.  A calf may be sold first in the south to a dealer who sells it to a western farmer who rears it to weanling or store cattle stage, after which it is again sold at a mart and brought to the midlands or the east for further fattening before eventually being sold to a factory.  It is, therefore, difficult to control the spread of bovine TB.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister well in his negotiations with the farmers' organisations. According to reports so far, they welcome the Minister's initiative.  I wish him well also in his negotiations with the Irish Veterinary Union and hope that a satisfactory conclusion will be arrived at because it is essential, nationally and for farmers, to draw down the substantial EU funding available for this scheme.  We have the potential to draw down £20 million a year from the EU disease eradication funds.  This would benefit farmers and everybody else involved in the livestock trade because it would mean a direct reduction in the amount of levies now being paid by farmers.  I estimate that, apart from testing and mart fees, a farmer pays anything up to £15 or £16 in levies on the sale of an animal.  It would be to everybody's advantage if that could be reduced to £2 or £3 and eventually eliminated.  Bovine disease levies were introduced here in 1979 under the Bovine Diseases (Levies) Act, 1979 at first they seemed nominal, but they have become a major drain on farmers' incomes.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister every success with this scheme.  I hope the proposals discussed by the Minister with the veterinary union and the farmers' organisations <Col N="1480" /> will now be seriously looked at.  We have the basis for a good compromise settlement in the proposals put forward early this year which were not acceptable to the veterinary union with the result that we lost out on money we could have drawn down from the EU because we could not convince it that we were serious about this programme. The fact that the Minister is again in negotiations with the farmers' organisations and the veterinary union will show our EU partners that we are serious about disease eradication and give us a better chance of qualifying for a potential £20 million refund.  It is in the interests of our economy that the Minister should succeed and that we finally eradicate TB and brucellosis from our herds.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Wexford):</i> Although technical in nature, this Bill gives us an opportunity to discuss the bovine TB programme.  Having spent some time in the Department of Agriculture in the position that Deputy Deenihan now holds, I understand his problem.  In 1992 I had a number of meetings with the IFA, ICMSA, ICOS, Irish Veterinary Union and the Irish Veterinary Association at which it was decided to review progress under ERAD and to achieve a consensus on the bovine TB programme for the next four years.  More than three years down the road that consensus has not been achieved.  The ongoing battle between the Minister and the vets has ensured that the consensus we talked about in the Department at that time is further away than ever.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister spoke about changes he made and his very friendly meeting with the veterinary union.  I wish him well in any friendly meetings he may have with such a group.  However, what is most important is our image among EU consumers.  One of the selling points of Irish food products, particularly meat, is our clean green image, and an ongoing war between the Minister and the various organisations involved in its production certainly does not send the right signals <Col N="1481" /> to the consumers to whom we want to sell our products.</P>
    <P>The farmers' organisations seem only too willing to accept any statement by the Minister about the benefits that will accrue to them.  The national leaders of the IFA seem to be very much in the Minister's pocket.  The Minister has done a good job in managing to wrap up the leaders of the leading farmers' organisations and I hope they stay with him for the remainder of his term in office.  When I was in the Department of Agriculture they were not of the same frame of mind although they were doing as well if not better under the Fianna Fáil Minister, Deputy Joe Walsh.  Many of the leaders of the IFA at national level are political supporters of the Minister.  We accept that, but there are times when they must represent farmers' views in a more independent way than they do at present.</P>
    <P>Since the establishment of ERAD in 1988 its work has been reviewed a number of times.  The experience gained in the operation of ERAD's first full year's programme, 1989, was published in the report of the 1990 Henry Kennedy Memorial Lecture, &ldquo;Ireland's TB Problem &mdash; What Can And Must Be Achieved&rdquo;.  It outlined a number of areas of critical importance which needed to be addressed if progress was to be made in the ERAD programme. It stated there should be proper testing, an effective means of removing infected badgers, control of cattle movement through a computerised movement permit system, adequate manpower resources and a fuller farmer commitment.  It also stated that in order to have any hope of achieving the target set for ERAD, upwards of 50,000 reactors would have to be removed each year for a number of years.  It went on to state:</P>
    <P>Despite the introduction of a wide range of measures aimed at securing an improvement in testing, just over 40,000 reactors were removed in 1990. Moreover, there is no reason to believe that continuation of the traditional testing arrangements would <Col N="1482" /><i>per se</i> secure removal of the number of reactors necessary for progress (upwards of 50,000 per annum).</P>
    <P>Based on the additional information gained in the implementation of ERAD's second full year's programme (1990), a complete review of the scheme was undertaken during the early part of 1991.  The outcome of the review was published in 1991 in the report entitled: &ldquo;Bovine TB Programme &mdash; What Are The Expectations?&rdquo;.  The two main conclusions of the report are:</P>
    <P>largely because of a significant wildlife reservoir of bovine TB, which cannot be addressed effectively without a vaccine for TB in badgers and/or cattle, together with the absence of a laboratory based diagnostic test for bovine TB, and also a computerised movement permit system, bovine TB cannot be eradicated in Ireland in the short to medium term; largely because of a range of socio-economic limitations associated with the traditional testing arrangements, cattle movement, commitment and manpower resources, as well as control of badgers and under which the programmes have to be operated, Ireland's persistently high bovine TB levels cannot be significantly reduced in a reasonable time period.</P>
    <P>These reports clearly outlined the deficiencies in the programmes, the problems experienced in the elimination of TB and the need for a long-term strategy.  In this context, research and development is very important for the future.  The many reports published on ERAD's four year operational programme clearly outlined the problems and those which will arise. Has the Department studied these reports?  To what extent has the Minister taken them on board and what changes does he propose?</P>
    <P>Everyone must be concerned about the continuing high level of expenditure on TB eradication.  The Minister said <Col N="1483" /> the cost of the scheme since its establishment in 1954 is approximately £1 billion.  While farmers have made a valuable contribution, the major contribution has been made by the taxpayers. It is important to ask whether the taxpayers have received value for money in the past 40 years.  The majority of them feel they have not received value for money and that certain vested interest groups have creamed off vast amounts of money from the scheme.  The Minister said that the annual cost of the scheme is approximately £67 million, of which approximately £20 million is spent under each of the headings &mdash; testing, compensation and administration &mdash; with the balance spent on operational aspects.</P>
    <P>Despite the expenditure of £67 million per annum on the scheme and carrying out 44 million tests on approximately 7 million cattle there has been no conclusive evidence of any reduction in TB.  On the contrary, the author of the report on which I referred concluded there may have been a slight increase in TB.  I am not criticising the ERAD programme which was a major innovation when it was introduced and it should be continued.  I hope the war between the Minister and the vets will end soon so that the farming community will be adequately looked after.  It is important to ensure that taxpayers get value for the money spent on this scheme.</P>
    <P>I smiled when the Minister said that EU funding could be drawn down. When I was in the Department it was repeatedly stated that we had EU funding at our disposal.  Under Commission decision 91/171/EEC, Ireland secured, in principle, funding for bovine TB eradication amounting to £10 million per annum for 1991, 1992 and 1993. However, it was not possible to draw down any of his money.  The battles in regard to the scheme over the years has meant that Ireland has lost EU funding.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1484" /> I am not treating lightly the difficulties faced by the Minister in the negotiations.  I sat in on some of the negotiations in 1992 and I appreciate the problems he has had with the veterinary union and other interest groups in regard to the review of the ERAD scheme and the formulation of proposals for the future.  It was always going to be difficult to come up with a satisfactory solution as the vets had certain proposals, the IFA had other proposals and the ICMSA had totally different proposals.  However, it was unfair of the Minister to go off on a solo run and say the vets were the real problem.  There was a number of problems and all of these should have been taken into account rather than attacking the vets.  As Deputy Cowen said, there are far more farmers than vets and the easiest target was the vets.  The Minister went down the wrong road on his solo run and has had to backtrack.  It is important to put in place a scheme which will benefit farmers and ensure that herds will eventually be TB free so that consumers thoughout the EU will know they are receiving a top class product.  That is the aim of farmers who have been specialists in producing a top class quality product over the years. Consumers throughout the EU are looking for environmentally friendly products produced in a clean, green environment.</P>
    <P>Research points to the role of wildlife in the spread of bovine TB.  I am not sure we have faced up to this problem. The general public would not like to see badgers being eliminated and I would not be in favour of it either, but if infected badgers are spreading bovine TB, we must act in the national interest and eliminate them.  It is estimated there are 250,000 badgers of which a significant number is infected with bovine TB. If the disease is spread by wildlife obviously this will have major cost implications for the Department and the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>I would like to see arrangements in place to allow action to be taken in cases of individual outbreaks of bovine <Col N="1485" /> TB where badgers are shown to be infected.  The policy of selective culling of badgers by snaring under licence from the Office of Public Works should be continued.  Farmers sometimes tell me that it is very difficult to get agreement for this from the Office of Public Works.  This has to be sorted out.  The Minister has to ensure that the issuing of licences by the Office of Public Works to snare badgers runs smoothly. Deputy Cowen referred to the pilot project in Offaly which proved conclusively that wildlife was the problem in his area. It is important to have a proper system in place that would eliminate badgers or other wildlife causing the spread of bovine TB.  I do not believe the Minister will be attacked unduly for taking this action.</P>
    <P>We do not want to see badgers or any other wildlife wiped out &mdash; and I do not believe that will happen if we are selective and deal with the problem effectively in conjunction with the Office of Public Works.  The incidence of bovine TB is a problem and we must put in place a system that will ensure the national herd is clear.  As a country selling abroad, we are competing with countries that have a TB disease-free status.</P>
    <P>A great deal of money has been spent on the bovine TB eradication scheme in the past 40 years, but we seem to be no nearer a solution to rid the country of the disease and achieve 100 per cent disease free status from our present 97 per cent rate of bovine TB.  From the amount of money spent we should have a system that would ensure that, but having listened to the war of words between the Minister and the veterinary surgeons in the past number of weeks I do not know if we are any nearer to it than we were in 1954.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TheresaAhearn" hpid="Mrs. T. Ahearn Mrs. T. Ahearn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. T. Ahearn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is difficult to speak on this Bill without reflecting on the introduction of the compulsory TB eradication scheme in 1954.  If we read the Official Report of that time, no doubt we would see that the scheme was <Col N="1486" /> welcomed by farmers and everybody in the country.  I am sure it was felt that whatever money would be invested in the scheme would be well spent as we all realise the importance of monitoring animal health.  I guarantee that in 1954 no one would have predicted that 41 years later we would be debating a programme for TB eradication and that we would still have 400 restricted herds.  In the meantime, farmers have contributed £285 million to the eradication scheme and we are still debating the same issues the causes of the spread of TB and how best to eradicate it.  Every Minister for Agriculture since 1954 has tried to come to terms with the problem.  Irrespective of what we say about the attempts to eradicate bovine TB we can say with conviction that we did not get value for money.  It is scandalous that 41 years later, having spent £285 million of farmers' income.  TB has not been eradicated.  That is a searching question but I do not share the previous speaker's lack of optimism.  I believe we may at last have a solution.</P>
      <P>In any programme to eradicate TB there will be contending forces.  If all the interested bodies could agree, perhaps we would have made progress.  Farmers have shown immense patience with the scheme throughout the 41 years.  They have spent a fortune on it and, in many cases, have been the victims.  Nobody, unless one has experienced it, can appreciate the hardship that this scheme has imposed on many farm families.  In many cases, farmers have seen their entire herd being taken away from the family farm.  Not only did they lose their livelihood, they spent a great deal of money in financing the scheme that did not bring the desired results.  I am delighted we have not given up hope. Research is being carried out, surveys are being completed and to this day there is a great belief we can eradicate TB from our herds.</P>

      <askee>Minister for the Marine</askee>
      <Quest>the plans, if any, he has to improve the air/sea rescue services, particularly night-time operations.</Quest>
      <QRef>[17491/95]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Minister for the Marine (Mr. Barrett) Minister for the Marine (Mr. Barrett)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>The terms of the question imply that there are deficiencies in coverage, operation or the management of our search and rescue services.  It has been claimed in particular that access to night flying capability on the east coast is inadequate.</P>
      <P>I have to refute these criticisms and I hope the House will indulge me if I take a little time to do so.  I want to make a number of general statements first and then address the <i>Carrackatine</i> tragedy, the issue of the east coast and the unfortunate fatality at Howth Harbour on 16 November.</P>
      <P>Our search and rescue resources are as good as any in Europe and, in many cases, far better.  We have dedicated men and women whose job it is to be available on a 24 hour basis to man our helicopters, fixed wing aircraft and our lifeboats as well as to conduct searches of our coastlines in the event of marine emergencies.  The search and rescue effort they represent and the dedication and professionalism they bring to bear in carrying out their task has to be a matter of both pride and comfort to us all.  Their lives are often at risk and this has to be constantly a matter of concern in the deployment and management of search and rescue resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am re-examining the whole search and rescue plan.  Perhaps this will show that we need to deploy more resources in order to achieve some improvement <Col N="1488" /> in coverage.  However, I am satisfied that the current deployment of resources and particularly their state of readiness and their on-the-spot management by the Marine Emergency Service is well up to international standards in terms of coverage, equipment and response times.  The essential ingredients for the success of search and rescue operations are not only the volume of resources but also their management in terms of readiness and location.  On all these criteria, our search and rescue capability will stand up to the closest scrutiny.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the two recent tragic incidents in Donegal and Howth.  On the Donegal search, it is essential that we understand the huge scale of the search operation.  I understand it is the largest in terms of deployment of aircraft, vessels and people, as well in terms of the area covered, which the Marine Emergency Service has undertaken.  I can promise that it will go on until the tragic accident is fully accounted for, if that is technically feasible.  I again express my sympathy and concern to the families of those currently lost at sea.</P>
    <P>The tragic loss of life at Howth has given rise to the question as to whether this fatality could have been avoided. The question is put as to whether a search and rescue helicopter based in Baldonnel could have been on location in sufficient time.</P>
    <P>Perhaps this could have been the case; naturally, the closer an incident is to a helicopter base, and a helicopter is regarded as required, the better the chances of a rescue in certain circumstances.  This applies all over the country; for instance, an incident in Clew Bay will be as far away from Shannon or Finner as Howth is from Anglesey; equally, an incident near the Old Head of Kinsale will be the same 65 miles from the nearest helicopter at Shannon.</P>
    <P>Thus, I hope the House will appreciate that Howth on the night in question had as good a coverage from Wales as many locations, where significant fishing and other marine activities occur, have <Col N="1489" /> from Irish based craft.  Even if we had a helicopter in Rosslare, as some have suggested, we may well have tasked the Anglesey based craft for reasons of proximity.  Ultimately this will always be a decision for the mission of coordinator.</P>
    <P>There are no borders in search and rescue.  States provide assistance to each other.  We have regularly been asked to deploy our helicopters in UK search and rescue areas.  In recent times we have been so requested more often than we have sought assistance from the UK.  In fact, since June 1992 we have been asked to give helicopter assistance to the UK search and rescue areas on 54 occasions; the UK has been asked to assist us on only six occasions.</P>
    <P>The nature, deployment and management of the search and rescue resource has to be kept under constant review.  I have asked my Department to address the issue of east coast coverage in a review of availability and deployment of search and rescue resources generally.  I have also asked the Air Corps to evaluate the feasibility of a 24-hour dedicated search and rescue helicopter being based at Baldonnel.  I will keep the House fully informed of these two initiatives.</P>
    <P>Yesterday I ordered investigations to be carried out, under the Merchant Shipping Acts, into the two recent casualties involving sea fishing boats off Donegal and at Howth.  The Howth investigation will be conducted by Captain B. McGrath, Marine Surveyor at the Department of the Marine.  The Donegal investigation will be conducted by the Deputy Chief Surveyor at the Department of the Marine, Mr. Séamus McLoughlin, with assistance from other staff members.</P>
    <P>The purpose of these investigations is to establish the cause of the casualties with a view to preventing similar recurrences.  The findings will be published, subject to the normal legal considerations.</P>
    <P>I am also considering, as a separate matter, how best the general issue of the safety of the fishing fleet should be <Col N="1490" /> reviewed and I propose to have early discussions with representatives of the fishing industry and my marine safety advisers in this regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's comprehensive reply.  I do not propose to exploit the recent human tragedies.  The Minister indicated that he will review the search and rescue service to ascertain if additional resources are required.  Is it true that maintenance works on the five Dauphin helicopters must be carried out outside the country? Is it not possible to grow the expertise here where a faster turnaround and cheaper arrangements would result?  In such circumstances four rather than three of the five helicopters would be constantly available to provide coverage.  I pay tribute to the men and women in the Air Corps, the Navy, the rescue services and civilians for their efforts. They risked their lives to save others on many occasions, we are all proud of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Smith for his kind words about the marine emergency services.  We all have great respect for the voluntary efforts of all those involved, especially those involved in coastal rescue services.  It is my understanding that normal day-to-day maintenance work on the Dauphin helicopters is carried out locally but they are sent to France for major refits. I will check to make sure that is the case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed that an 11-month turnaround time was required for one of the Dauphin helicopters sent to France for repairs.  That is too long a period for such special equipment to be grounded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot confirm if that is correct but I will check the information.  I am sure we have the expertise to carry out maintenance work but the helicopters are usually sent to the manufacturers in France for major refits.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2, 3, 10, 13, 15, 18 and 71 together.</P>
      <P>In July of this year the Government announced its response to the report of the efficiency audit group on its review of the Defence Forces and published a document detailing the EAG report and setting out the Government's approach to the reorganisation.  This report followed a lengthy analysis and consultative process on all aspects of the organisation of the Defence Forces.  The report was prepared on the basis of the revised roles of the Defence Forces.</P>
      <P>The Government indicated it accepted the general thrust of the EAG report.  It was also stated that an implementation group would be established to draw up detailed and fully costed proposals to implement a first phase plan covering the next three years.  This plan would be based on the reorganisation of the Defence Forces on the basis of a three brigade structure with a manpower level of 11,500.  The strength of the permanent Defence Force was 12,799 on 31 October.  The Government's objective is a properly structured, well equipped Defence Force capable of meeting the role assigned to it by Government in the most efficient and effective way.</P>
      <P>On the question of accommodation, there are no plans to close any barracks. The Government has stated that separate studies on the issue of the rationalisation of the Defence Forces facilities will be undertaken as part of the overall EAG implementation process.  A review of military accommodation requirements will be carried out during phase one of the implementation period.  The economic and social implications of barrack closure will, of course, be taken into account in these studies.  Since 1988 there has been a policy of disposing of married quarters which are outside barracks to their occupants.  The terms of the scheme are similar to the terms of the local authority schemes.  The vast bulk of married quarters have now been disposed of.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the key areas identified for <Col N="1493" /> urgent action by the efficiency audit group was the development of a manpower policy with an emphasis on lowering the age profile.  The reduction in the manpower level to 11,500 will be achieved through the adoption of a voluntary early retirement scheme which will be balanced with a policy of recruitment of young personnel to achieve the desired lower age profile of the membership of the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Army School of Music, the Government has already stated that the recommendation by Price Waterhouse, the consultants engaged by the efficiency audit group to carry out a review on its behalf, to reduce the number of bands is unacceptable.  The Government is committed to ensuring that any necessary reforms will be implemented in a planned and sensitive manner and that due cognisance will be taken of the role of the Army School of Music and the bands.  I expect any recommendations put forward will reflect these views.</P>
    <P>The measures to be introduced are important and represent a positive step for the Defence Forces.  One of the most important aspects of the reorganisation of the structure of the Defence Forces is the development of a well resourced and cohesive training policy.  This is a matter on which I expect to receive recommendations from the implementation group and to which I will give careful consideration.  The majority of military training establishments are currently located in the Curragh and while I do not wish to anticipate anything contained in the recommendations of the implementation group, the likelihood is that the Curragh will be developed as the main training centre for the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>Consultation is a prerequisite for successful reform and in that context, as I have stressed on many occasions in the recent past, a consultative approach has been adopted.  The representative associations are involved in an ongoing process with a sub-committee of the Defence Forces conciliation and arbitration scheme.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1494" /> I expect to receive shortly, the implementation group's detailed proposals for the first phase of the plan.  I will be giving careful consideration to those proposals before submitting them to Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed with the Minister's response.  Earlier this year we were promised a restructuring of the Defence Forces, which we all accept is necessary, and central to that restructuring are the voluntary early retirement package and recruitment.  These promises were made by the Minister and his predecessor, the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Coveney.  It is almost the end of November and we are still no clearer as to when this scheme will be announced and when recruitment will begin.</P>
      <P>The uncertainty among members of our Defence Forces has created a serious morale problem, which is understandable considering how long the matter has dragged on.  I ask the Minister to come clean and tell us his plans.  Is he having difficulties in funding this early retirement package or is the Minister for Finance digging in his heels?</P>
      <P>Last July, the Minister gave the Government approach and set up the implementation group.  There is no reason it should take this long to report its findings.  I ask the Minister to fight at the Cabinet table to ensure moneys are provided to bring about this necessary restructuring.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to correct a statement made by Deputy Power.  I have had regular contact with members of the Defence Forces and I do not see any morale problems.  Statements about closures of barracks are being made to cause this type of fear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>I live among them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>First there were the proposed closures of both the Army bands and the Equitation School and we got over those problems.  The closure of barracks then came up.  A newspaper <Col N="1495" /> report after the conference last year &mdash; Fianna Fáil was in Government at the time &mdash; stated that 17 barracks would be closed.  That figure went down to nine barracks after the conference this year.</P>
      <P>I announced proposals in July &mdash; most people are on holiday during August &mdash; and the implementation group set up its structures.  This is the first time that a major reform of the Defence Forces has been carried out.  I have been asked to guarantee that there will be consultation.  I have given that guarantee and I am satisfied this consultation process is ongoing.</P>
      <P>I have received an assurance from the implementation group that it will be able to present its plan to me shortly. It has to consult, accept and receive the various proposals put forward by the different subgroups.  Changing a five brigade structure to a three brigade structure is not easy.  We must also produce a voluntary early retirement scheme and work on that matter is ongoing in consultation, naturally, with the Department of Finance.</P>
      <P>I announced the details of the scheme and said it would be done in consultation with the two representative associations, PDFORRA and RACO. The voluntary early retirement terms then have to be offered to their members.  This is not a compulsory scheme.  When these proposals are presented to the members of the Defence Forces, a certain number will retire while others will be recruited.  By doing this, the Army manpower level will be reduced to 11,500 while the age profile problem which Deputy Power referred to will also be addressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first major review of the Defence Forces has been conducted in the space of four months.  I intend to get this matter right.  If it takes another four weeks to do this, then so be it.  It is better to do it that way and have proper consultation to allow people to have their say and deal with their various queries.  We should not be deflected from the real job by listening to wild statements and allegations about barracks closing which <Col N="1496" /> generates fear in families, who may have mortgages to pay and children in school, when there is no basis for them.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that we are on track.  I thought we would have had the final report two or three weeks ago but what does that matter if I am satisfied we will get it right?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarClohessy" hpid="Mr. Clohessy Mr. Clohessy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clohessy</NameTxt>
      <P>I put down the question following newspaper reports and representations made to me.  The Minister must admit that families of army pesonnel in the barracks mentioned for closure are anxious about the matter.  I am disappointed that the report was not issued earlier but I welcome what the Minister said.  Will representatives of RACO and PDFORRA be involved in the discussions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  There have been ongoing discussions with PDFORRA and RACO.  I made it clear that if they have concerns or worries the implementation group or one of its sub-groups will discuss those with them.  There will not be any mention of barrack closures in the report as that is not on the agenda and would be contrary to the Government's decision not to close any barracks.  I cannot say if some future Government will review that.  All I can do is state the present Government's position.  Barracks will not be closed in Clonmel, Mullingar, Fermoy or anywhere else.  The implementation group cannot bring forward proposals to close barracks because it is not entitled to do so.  Its proposals will be on restructuring, that is a three brigade structure as distinct from a five brigade structure, a voluntary early retirement scheme and the age profile.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that Opposition spokespersons will question statements on reports and I am delighted to have the opportunity to refute those statements. As the Deputy rightly said, they cause a great deal of concern to many families. There is no proposal to close any barracks and I ask people making such statements, in the interests of the families involved, to refrain from doing so.  It <Col N="1497" /> will not be part and parcel of the implementation group's proposals.</P>

      <P>The Minister has more or less accused us of making wild statements.  As Minister for Defence, Deputy Coveney stated in an interview that barracks would be closed.  Following public outcry the Government changed tack and said there would not be any closures within three years.</P>

The procedure to be followed is that the implementation group will prepare its report and present it to me, and I will examine it and see that it conforms with the Government's decisions.  If I am satisfied with it I will present it to the Government for approval and then it will be implemented.  I hope to receive the report within the next week or two.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4, 23, 40 and 42 together.</P>
      <P>I will address the understandable concerns expressed by Deputies, first by outlining the terms of the Council Agreement of December 1994 on Iberian integration into the Common Fisheries Policy.  Second, I will outline the implementation arrangements which have been subsequently negotiated over the past 12 months and which lay down the ground rules for fishing in our waters from next year as well as giving concrete expression to EU support for Ireland's heavy surveillance costs in monitoring and enforcing the new regime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The terms of the Agreement reached in December 1994, and particularly in relation to the Irish Box, addressed most of our key concerns about access as well as our demands for effective control and reporting systems.  The main elements of the Agreement can be summarised as follows: the total number of Spanish vessels allowed to fish for certain species in Irish waters will continue to be limited to 93 and there must be no increase in total fishing effort; continued <Col N="1499" /> recognition of the Irish Box as a sensitive zone; of the 93 vessels, a maximum of 40 named Spanish vessels only will be permitted to fish inside the Irish Box from next year; prior notification by all large fishing vessels on entering and leaving Irish waters and the Irish Box with effect from 1 January 1996; catch reporting on entry and exit with effect from 1 January 1998 at the latest; additional financial support for surveillance costs, with particular recognition of Ireland's heavy surveillance commitments.</P>
    <P>There will, therefore, be no additional fishing by foreign boats in Irish waters and no increase in the total number of Spanish boats beyond their existing level.  The extent to which named Spanish boats will have access within the Irish Box is very strictly laid down.  The entry-exit reporting system will ensure furthermore that our air and sea fisheries protection services will be able to closely monitor activity and target movements in and out of Irish fishing zones.  It should provide a very full picture of which boats are operating where in Irish fishing grounds at any given time.  In other words, it will be considerably more difficult for boats of any nationality to engage in illegal fishing in our waters.  The reporting system will back up, in a major way, our aerial and sea going surveillance capability.  An additional deterrent is the tough regime of Irish penalties for fishery offences. These are the highest in Europe and reflect our determination to ensure that all vessels fishing in Irish waters comply with the rules.</P>
    <P>The detailed ground rules for the additional reporting, monitoring and control systems from next year were agreed at the Fisheries Council last month.  The Council also agreed the overall envelope and terms of a new five year financial aid package for fisheries surveillance to back up and enforce those systems.  In recognition of our very heavy surveillance costs, I secured the Council's agreement to a unique budgetline for Ireland of over <Col N="1500" /> £12 million over five years to meet the running costs of fisheries surveillance. We will also benefit, with a higher rate of EU aid than other member states, under the overall package for capital investment.  These costs have to be incurred in any event by virtue of our EU responsibilities and to protect Irish fish stocks.  It was all the more improtant, therefore, to ensure that maximum EU financial support for these additional resources is available and is availed of.</P>
    <P>Negotiations on the package of specific spending proposals for 1996 and future years will now get under way with the Commission and I will put proposals in this regard to Government shortly.  Essentially my objective is to secure, at minimum cost, the level of capital and operational resources identified as necessary to maximise our sea and landbased fisheries surveillance programmes and that these resources are applied efficiently and effectively to the considerable challenge ahead.  I would not minimise the challenge involved in ensuring the conservation and protection of the Irish fisheries resource.  The framework and the safeguards are there and I am committed to delivering on implementation of the new control and monitoring regime in the interests of our fisheries and of the fishing industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Mr. Browne (Wexford) Mr. Browne (Wexford)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Wexford):</i> As Spanish fishermen are a difficult breed to deal with, our fishermen are concerned about what will happen when the Spanish fishing fleet is allowed to fish in the Irish Box as and from 1 January next. Will the Minister outline the steps being taken to improve controls and surveillance in terms of the provision of new boats, additional personnel and extra patrols to deal with possible breaches of the regulations by Spanish fishermen?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Under EU regulations only 40 Spanish boats will be allowed to fish in the Irish Box at any given time. These will have to be named and will <Col N="1501" /> be confined to the south and north-west boxes.</P>
      <P>In preparation for these changes a number of steps have been taken, including the purchase of CASA aircraft which are now in operation.  These are a great asset in providing backup for the Naval Service.  If Opposition spokespersons would like to see these aircraft for themselves to assess their capability, I would be only too pleased to make the necessary arrangements.  The radar system used is very effective in pinpointing the location of fishing boats for the Naval Service.  I have also established a liaison committee comprising representatives of the Departments of the Marine and Defence at senior management level to ensure full use is made of available resources.</P>
      <P>The additional aid to be provided under the new EU package, the negotiation of which was only completed at the October Council meeting, will also be of considerable assistance to us.  A total of £12 million is to be made available over a five-year period towards operational costs.  This will be of help, perhaps, in making further improvements in the area of technology to track down boats fishing illegally.</P>
      <P>The capital moneys to be made available will enable us to build a new ship. The type of ship to be built will be the subject of discussions.  It is not the number of ships that is important, however, but the number of boardings to ensure that vessels are fishing in accordance with the rules and that there are no secret holds.</P>
      <P>All these measures are or will be in place shortly.  I can give assurance that the regulations will be strictly enforced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>While Ireland controls 16 per cent of EU waters it accounts for only 5 per cent of the total allowable catch.  The Minister mentioned that only 40 Spanish boats will be allowed to fish in the Irish Box.  Is it not the case, however, that as the majority of Irish boats, with the exception of those which fish for tuna, fish within 50 miles of the <Col N="1502" /> shoreline there will be greater competition within these waters and an increased demand for greater control and surveillance?  The Minister and his officials should not make light of the problems that will be faced when the Spanish fishing fleet is allowed to fish in the Irish Box next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the case that Ireland controls 16 per cent of EU waters and accounts for only 5 per cent of the total allowable catch, but this has been the position since 1972 when we joined the EU.  Basically, we sold our fishing rights and have not recovered since.  As this is a valuable asset, the Government has and will continue to battle to secure a greater share under the Common Fisheries Policy.  Our percentage should not be based on historical figures but on the resources available within our waters. We have to live with the decision negotiated at that time.</P>
      <P>There is a real danger that, if we continue to over-fish our waters by catching young and small fish, we will eventually drain the bucket dry.  For this reason we have tabled conservation proposals with the EU Commission&mdash;we were the first to do so &mdash; to secure agreement on mesh and fish sizes to protect available resources.  Spanish boats will not be allowed to fish in the Irish Sea, they will be confined to the western waters.  As and from 1 January next this will be part of the Common Fisheries Policy.  In the circumstances we did our utmost to secure the best possible deal.</P>
      <P>I would be much happier if our quota was higher and if the conservation proposals we put forward were accepted at European level.  The fishermen's organisations are fully behind us in our efforts to have these proposals implemented as they are realists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not strictly true that most Irish boats fish within 50 miles of the shoreline.  The boats which operate out of Killybegs in the north west, which in the main fish for mackerel and herring, go way beyond 50 miles.  Those who fish for white fish mainly fish within 50 miles of the shoreline.  The only way we can <Col N="1503" /> improve matters for the Irish fishing industry is by securing agreement on conservation proposals, implementing the measures on surveillance which have been agreed by making the necessary resources available and ensuring that every boat fishing in the Irish Box or within 200 miles of the west coast adheres to the rules.  We are determined to enforce the regulations rigorously because it is in our best interest.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Mr. Browne (Wexford) Mr. Browne (Wexford)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Wexford):</i> Will the Minister confirm that even after 1 January 1996 if Spanish boats are apprehended by the Navy, the skipper and fishermen on the boat will not have to declare what is on board because this declaration will not come in until after 1998? Irish fishermen are concerned that over the next two years they will be able to have what they like on board, including unspecified fish, etc., and that the Navy will have no powers to ascertain what they have?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a difference between catch reporting on entry and exit, which will come into place on 1 January, and exceeding quotas that have been allocated.  It is wrong to say that people can take what they like. They may only take what they are entitled to under the quotas allocated to them.  After 1 January 1998 there will be an obligation on vessels to report to the home country what they have taken coming in and going out.  That is what we are talking about.  I would not like it to be understood that there is no control as regards the quantities which may be taken from our seas.  They are subject to quotas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 5, 24, 30, 32 and 73 together.</P>
      <P>By way of background I should explain that EU fisheries management, under the Common Fisheries Policy rules established in 1983, is essentially based on the concept of a total allowable catch for each stock of species in a given area.</P>
      <P>Stock levels are assessed each year by EU and international fisheries biologists.  On the basis of this scientific advice, the Commission draws up annual proposals for TACs for the various stocks.  The final decision on the level of catches that can be made for the following year is taken by the Fisheries Council each December.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>TACs are divided into national quotas according to the allocation keys agreed in 1983 and which guarantees a constant share for each member state in <Col N="1505" /> proportion to its relative historic catches prior to introduction of the quota system.  This is the so-called principle of &ldquo;relative stability&rdquo; which is the hallmark of the Common Fisheries Policy. In addition, Ireland has special entitlements under the Hague Prefernce which can be invoked to increase Ireland's share in certain circumstances.</P>
    <P>I do not need to remind Deputies that it is the long-standing contention, one which I fully endorse, that the overall share of fish stocks allocated under quota to Ireland falls short of a fair and reasonable level and fails to recognise the unique circumstances of the Irish fishing sector and the socio-economic imperative to address its historic underdevelopment.  Successive Governments have pressed the case for increases in those allocations, most recently in the 1992 mid-term review of the Common Fisheries Policy.  The Irish case remains on the table, is reaffirmed in the programme for Government and I will be again reiterating it at the forthcoming Council meeting.  Deputies will also be aware, however, that any upward revision of the Irish quotas would mean reductions for other member states, especially the UK and France, which have major shares of the stocks in western waters.  Such a change would require the support of a qualified majority of member states.  At present, we have no support among other member states but we will continue to press the case strongly at all levels.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, we continue to work closely with the fishing industry and fishing organisations in seeking to increase Ireland's fishing opportunities in the context of the annual round of decisions on total allowable catches. That consultation process is now under way in the build-up to next month's Council meeting which will determine the TACs for 1996.  My overall objective in these difficult and tough negotiations will be to maximise the fishing possibilities for Ireland, while ensuring that conservation objectives are met through the setting of sustainable TACs geared <Col N="1506" /> to managing and protecting the long-term viability of stocks.  Balancing the socio-economic aspect with the biological and other aspects of fisheries management is the big challenge for Ireland no less than for any other country.</P>
    <P>The emerging assessment and advice from the scientists this year is that they are gravely concerned about the state of stocks.  Big cuts in the TACs of most stocks are recommended yet again this year to let stocks build back up or even to prevent collapse.  The scientific advice is currently being evaluated by the Commission as well as ourselves, the fishing industry and other member states.  The Commission will unveil its own proposals based on this advice within the next ten days and intensive negotiations will get under way at EU level in early December.  As I said, we will be working hand in glove with the industry in developing and negotiating Ireland's strategic position on every aspect of these proposals.  This close liaison with the industry will go on up to and during the Council on 21 December.</P>
    <P>The context within which we will work to maximise Irish fishing possibilities next year is enormously difficult. The reality is that there is an overall decline in the size of many fish stocks on which Irish fisheries depend.  Council will have to seek to strike the right balance between biological and economic imperatives.  Achieving that balance is anything but easy and there are tough decisions to be faced if exploitation rates are to be managed in a way which secures the future of stocks while allowing a viable level of fishing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister accept that we have the worst of both worlds?  We have already dealt with our waters and the relationship between them and the total allowable catch.  We have a low number of onshore jobs per fisherman and ageing and underfinanced fleet.  On the question of conservation, hundreds of thousands of tonnes of immature young fish are illegally netted.  I have information that there is a proposal to cut mackerel by <Col N="1507" /> up to 60 per cent to 80 per cent and to cut megrim by 29 per cent.  What effect would that suggested cut have on a place like Killybegs?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Our task is not easy.  We are torn between the need for conservation to ensure a long-term future for the fishing industry and the need to ensure a decent living for those involved in the industry.  The Deputy mentioned mackerel and herring.  I am conscious of the huge investment which has gone into large modern ships which are a great addition to the fishing fleet.  We must not underestimate the achievement of those who have invested heavily and who are creating a considerble number of jobs as a result.</P>
      <P>We are torn between conservation and total allowable catches.  At the same time, we are operating from a low base because of our position since the early 1970s.  This can be resolved in a reasonable way if all member states accept the need for conservation proposals and implement them.  We cannot allow people take out all the young stock because that would destroy the future of the industry.  It is in Ireland's interest in particular to ensure conservation proposals are accepted at European level and strictly implemented.  We will continue to seek increases in our quotas, to have conservation proposals agreed and invest in our fishing fleet.  I do not deny that some of our boats are old, but the fact that a boat is 25 years old does not necessarily mean it is not capable of fishing.  Norway and Denmark experience similar problems in this regard.  For many years we ignored the fishing industry, but we are doing something about it now.</P>
      <P>From visits around the country I am very heartened by the development in the fish processing sector and we should not ignore the achievements in that area.  One example is John West Kippers &mdash; a world-wide label &mdash; which are processed, canned and labelled in Donegal.  That is a tremendous achievement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Developments are taking place in <Col N="1508" /> processing and grants are available for such work.  We are seeking resources to develop our harbours.  Some resources are available and a plan has been devised, but we hope to receive further fundings.  I recognise the potential in this area, particularly for communities who find it very difficult to get employment.  Though we are starting very late, a great deal can be done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to make your task difficult but we are dealing with a key national issue.  It is scandalous that internationally hundreds of thousands of tonnes of immature fish are illegaly fished and then dumped back into the sea.  That result is enormous economic loss and renders conservation measures ineffective.  Is there a determination at EU level to deal with this problem?  There is a proposed cutback on mackerel catch and that will have an impact on communities around the Donegal coast and so on, but the problems I have outlined are experienced on internationally.  Is the EU determined to take action on that matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the Deputy's disgust at the level of illegal fishing and particularly the catching of under-sized fish.  Ireland is the first country to lodge with the Commission improved conservation measures relating to minimum net and landing sizes.  My officials and I will continue to press at EU level for implementation of those measures.  That is the only way to ensure rules are followed.  I will do everything in my power to ensure strict control of illegal fishing in our waters.</P>

Discussions within the conciliation and arbitration scheme are confidential and it would not be appropriate for me to comment further at this time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Traditionally our armed forces involvement in overseas missions, which began in 1958, has been limited to a peacekeeping or observer-monitoring role, under the auspices of the United Nations.  The only departure from our traditional role occured when we sent a transport company to Somalia to participate in UNOSOM II.  That mission had a peace-enforcement element. However, because our involvement took the form of providing essential supplies to the military components of UNOSOM II and assisting humanitarian agencies in the region, I believe that the departure from the traditional role was more apparent than real and that our involvement in Somalia was compatible with the traditional peacekeeping role.  Our transport company performed with great credit in Somalia and without sustaining or causing any casualties.</P>
      <P>Since UNOSOM II, there have been no further requests that Ireland participate in a peace-enforcement role.  If any such request were to be received it would have to be considered in the light of available resources and the requirements at home.  Furthermore, the question would arise as to the role envisaged for an Irish contingent in any proposed force with particular reference to whether and to what extent Irish troops might be expected to take part in operations of a belligerent nature.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Tánaiste, in a reply on 18 October to a question from the Deputy, made clear that Ireland has not been asked to join a European army in the EU or any other context.  The Government is not aware of any proposals for a European army, and even if such proposals were to be forthcoming, which is highly unlikely, they would not form the basis for the agreement in the 1996 Intergovermental Conference.  The intergovernmental Conference will include a review of the Common Foreign and Security Policy provisions of the Maastricht Treaty, including, as specified in article J4 of the treaty, the &ldquo;question of a common defence policy <Col N="1511" /> for the Union, which might lead in time to a common defence.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Discussions in the Intergovernmental Conference in this regard are likely to encompass the contribution that the EU might make to improving European capabilities in conflict prevention and crisis management, which would include such areas as peacekeeping and humanitarian operations, and co-operation on such matters as search and rescue tasks. The institutional relationship between the EU and the Western European Union will also be under review.  Incidentally the Deputy might note that the issues I have just mentioned and all related issues will be addressed fully in the context of the forthcoming White Paper on Foreign Policy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's answer begs the question: do we need an army? What purpose does it serve?  Did the Minister, the Government and other Deputies feel any sense of guilt during the massacres in Bosnia for not attempting to intervene with a peace enforcement unit like most other countries in the civilised world?  Did he offer at any time to help the innocents who were being massacred?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is aware that requests come from the UN and we do not offer.  The UN requests and we consider.  As far as I am aware no such request was made.</P>
      <P>I hope Ireland will continue to play an important role in peacekeeping and in other humanitarian missions.  An army is like an insurance policy &mdash; we need it when there are problems and when there are no problems people wonder why we have it.  I am proud of the fact that over the years the Defence Forces have carried out important tasks on behalf of the civil power &mdash; UN missions, Border duty and so forth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have been well served by people who have dedicated their lives to serving in our Defence Forces, whether it is the Army, the Naval Service or the Air Corps.  The Naval Service has an <Col N="1512" /> important role in fishery surveillance while the Air Corps has an equally important role in aiding the civil power in search and rescue and in many other tasks, including carrying patients to and from hospitals.  This important work is, perhaps, not noticeable on a day to day basis.</P>
    <P>It is easy to ask if we need an army.  I believe we do and I am proud that we have participated and will continue to participate in UN missions when requested.  I do not know how peacekeeping or the relationship between the European Union and the UN will develop in the future.  However, the Deputy is aware that our neutrality is built into our Constitution and it will not be for this House to decide, if we ever do, that we want to be part of European armies.  It will be up to the people to decide that issue.  That is not on the agenda at present and in the meantime we will continue to play an important role in peacekeeping and other humanitarian missions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>How was it that the Dutch, Danish, Ukranian, British, French and other armies were involved in peacekeeping and peace enforcement in Bosnia?  Were they asked by the United Nations or did they volunteer? Were we asked by the United Nations or did we attempt to volunteer?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a long debate in this House when the legislation was amended to allow our troops to go to Somalia.  Traditionally, we have been involved in peackeeping and there were misgivings about the issue of peace enforcement.</P>
      <P>Perhaps we are straying into foreign policy.  We supply troops when we are requested to do so.  Foreign policy decisions are taken by the Department of Foreign Affairs.  We have a limited number of officers in former Yugoslavia monitoring on behalf of the EU and we will continue to carry out such tasks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If troops go into another country they should know exactly what they are expected to do because the day we lose <Col N="1513" /> respect for the blue beret is the day the effectiveness of peacekeeping will be brought into question.  The people of that country must accept that UN troops are there to assist them rather than regard them as the enemy.  The UN cannot involve itself in other people's wars without knowing what result it is trying to achieve.  I am anxious that our troops continue to involve themselves in peacekeeping exercises that are clearly defined so that we know what we are trying to achieve.</P>
    <P>If there is a future request for Irish troops to be involved in UN missions in Bosnia Herzgovina we will consider it. We have not received such a request so the issue does not arise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry to labour the point but I asked a simple question.  Did all the countries which took part in peacekeeping and peace enforcement duties in Bosnia volunteer to send their armies or were they asked to do so?  Did we receive a similar request or did we volunteer?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been advised that no request was received by us.  I cannot answer the Deputy's question regarding what other countries did.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand Deputy Deasy's questions and statements. However, there is a big difference between peace enforcing and peacekeeping.  Our history of peacekeeping has made us acceptable throughout the world.  There was a lengthy discussion in the House when we changed that role &mdash; Deputy Andrews was Minister for Defence at the time.  It would be highly irresponsible for us to send our troops to Bosnia.  It is only when the body bags come home that the reality sinks in.  The Deputy's line of argument is ridiculous.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. E. Byrne Mr. E. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister believe there is a great deal of enthusiasm on the part of the officers and men and their wives and children for us to demand that we volunteer their services to play a peace enforcement role in Bosnia?  Perhaps if the Minister found a great groundswell of public opinion he might be able to answer Deputy Deasy's question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I can answer the question in a different way.  Anybody who visits Lebanon will soon find out that the Irish troops are not in a holiday camp.  They have risked their lives there in the interests of peace for 17 years.  They are still in dangerous situations.  I have no doubt that the Defence Forces if asked to serve on a peacekeeping mission will be pleased to do so.</P>
      <P>My earlier remarks were general. One cannot compare the Irish Defence Forces with the American or British armed forces.  We do not have the heavy equipment and military machinery that is necessary for peace enforcement. There is no real definition of peace enforcement.  We are not interested in acting as aggressors; we are interested in peacekeeping.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be wrong to let this occassion pass by leaving an impression that our Defence Forces are not required.  We have gained such a reputation in peacekeeping that even the US sends officers to our UN school to learn about it. People realise that if we want world peace we need to use the people who know how to bring it about to sustain it. The Irish Army has been exceptional in what it has achieved over the years.  Its members have risked their lives and we are proud of them.  I would not like to give the impression that we are not prepared to play our part in peacekeeping. We are prepared to play our part.  We sent a transport company into Somalia <Col N="1515" /> as part of the peace enforcement exercise but our troops were mainly involved in peacekeeping in that they provided food for other troops and agencies' personnel who were there on humanitarian grounds.  We could not have sent our troops into Mogadishu to free up the port because we did not have the fire power, but the Americans did.  We do a good job in peace keeping and I am anxious that we continue that role.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>I recognise and endorse the good work done by our Defence Forces.  The Minister omitted to mention that they also provide a private taxi for the Tánaiste's trips to Kerry.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not my responsibility.  The Deputy should table a question on that matter to the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  I am Minister for Defence, not Foreign Affairs.  If I was asked to serve as Minister for Foreign Affairs I would be delighted to take the post.</P>

      <P>In accordance with Government policy any military property outside of barracks which is surplus to requirements and which is not required for other State purposes is offered for sale.  Buildings within barracks which become surplus to requirements are converted for other military uses where appropriate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This matter is kept under continual review taking account of, <i>inter alia,</i> the spread of existing barracks and posts <Col N="1516" /> and the necessity to maintain security and operational efficiency.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely" hpid="Mr. Callely Mr. Callely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>They are.  I am advised that in certain circumstances where an alternative use, for example, tourism, local amenity, etc., has been identified for a specific property, these properties are offered to the relevant local authority for such development.  For example, the National Museum is developing Collins Barracks.  At present the only buildings identified as surplus to requirements are the old abattoir building and staff house in the Curragh. If the Deputy has a property in mind and gives me details of it, I will have the matter investigated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely" hpid="Mr. Callely Mr. Callely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister's attention being drawn to the public concern about the need for prison places?  Some former Defence buildings may be appropriate for use as open prisons similar to European or American models.  Given that many hardened criminals benefit from the revolving door system, does the Minister and the Minister for Justice see a role for under utilised or surplus Defence buildings in this area?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not have them.  I have been accused of trying to close barracks.  I hope the Deputy is not suggesting that we should convert some of our barracks into prisons.  I do not know what would be involved in terms of security requirements for a prison, whether closed or semi-open.  We have not received such requests nor have we properties suitable for use as prisons.  I think the Curragh was used for internment purposes in the 1950s but I do not know of other barracks that could be <Col N="1517" /> used as prisons.  There are none available for that purpose nor are any likely to be available in the foreseeable future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said he was not sure about that.  There are insufficient prison places and due to that convicted criminals are let out of prison on temporary or early release.  Under-utilised Defence buildings could be easily converted to provide prison places. As convenor of the Select Committee on Legislation and Security I had an opportunity to visit an open prison in Virgina.  Perhaps we should consider establishing one here.</P>
      <P>I understand St. Bricin's Hospital is under-utilised and the heating system heats the whole building.  I am surprised the Minister is not aware of this.  Will he investigate it and report back to me?</P>

      <P>I answered the question tabled by the Deputy and his supplementaries related to the need for more prison places and facilities available to the Department of Defence that could be converted into prison spaces.

      <P>If the Deputy would like to table a question about St. Bricin's Hospital, I will give him a comprehensive answer about the number of patients, the level of use and its capacity and I will consider the matter.  We cannot jump from the issue of prison places to long stay beds for patients in an Eastern Health Board hospital.  The Deputy should not make wild statements he cannot stand over.  I answered his questions.  The Department is not aware of any available space that would be suitable for conversion to a prison.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his response and I am pleased he will carry out an inquiry in respect of St. Bricin's Hospital.  My question related to under-utilised and surplus buildings. The question has been posed that there are a number of buildings which, from an optical point of view, seem to be under-utilised and would they be available for a prison.  My question clearly asks the likely uses of such buildings. <Col N="1519" /> My understanding is that St. Bricin's Hospital is under-utilised at a time when there is a huge demand not only by the Department of Justice but by the Department of Defence for long stay accommodation.  I am surprised there has not been some liaison between the Department of Defence and other Departments where there is a huge need.  I have mentioned only two; I could mention others but I will not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will have to understand that no politician, Minister or otherwise, can stand up without prior notice and say how St. Bricin's Hospital is utilised and the number of patients there.  I could say it has 50 patients while the Deputy could say it has 100.  I do not know the number of patients but we can find out.  Presumably if the Eastern Health Board wanted assistance from the Department of Defence it would seek it.  The Eastern Health Board is responsible for the provision of beds for long stay patients.  Surely the Deputy does not expect the Department of Defence to approach the Eastern Health Board and ask how matters are progressing and what it can do to help it.  Surely the Eastern Health Board would approach the Department.  In reply to the Deputy's question I said:</P>
      <P>In accordance with Government policy any military property outside of barracks which is surplus to requirements and which is not required for other State purposes is offered for sale.</P>

      <P>I have vivid and sad memories when I was five years old of seeing our entire dairy herd being loaded up in trucks and taken to the factory.  I recall the sadness of my father whose life's work was taken away on the trucks.  The people on a number of farms in our community suffered that trauma.  This is not an experience that happens once only; it can happen two and three times.  Blame must rest at the door of the Department which allowed the scheme to rattle on without putting sufficient money into research or into investigations or taking brave decisions in an effort to change the scheme in such a way that it would bring about the eradication of TB.</P>
      <P>My heart goes out to any farmer and their families when they tell me their entire herd is gone because of TB.  Very often they know the cause.  Sometimes they say it was due to wildlife acting as a carrier or an outbreak of the disease in a neighbouring farm.  We are dealing with a disease that can spread very quickly over a parish and, indeed, the entire countryside.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This brings me to an important point, that is the compensation paid to farmers in such cases.  It must be accepted by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry and by Brussels that farmers suffer, irrespective of the compensation, a severe loss of income where there is an outbreak of TB.  The Department pays compensation by way of reactor grant but that grant does not take into consideration the loss suffered by the farmer.  The losses to which I refer included the loss of the sale value of the animal, cows sold after calving are worth very little; loss due to a lower milk supply when an animal has been removed from the herd and, most important, the extra fodder expense when farmers cannot sell their animals. If they cannot sell during a period when extra fodder is needed those circumstances should be taken into account.  In <Col N="1559" /> some years fodder is much more expensive than in others.  Regardless of the fodder expense, the farmer cannot afford to allow his animals to die.  He has to take on the burden of cost, irrespective of the circumstances.  Those factors are not taken into account in determining the level of compensation. This is a serious matter that needs further investigation by the Department.</P>
    <P>Those of us who represent rural constituents know farmers who never fully recover from the financial loss; in some cases it takes up to four or five years for a farmer to recover from the financial losss incurred as a result of an outbreak of TB.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to undertake a study in co-operation with the banks and the ACC Bank to establish the true nature of the loss incurred following TB outbreaks.  Such a study would require the consent of farmers and would involve taking into account private and confidential financial matters.  Nevertheless such a study should be undertaken by the Department.  I can say without fear of contradiction that farmers are not adequately compensated in cases of TB outbreaks.  In some cases they have to sell land to meet their borrowing requirements or their interest payments and they have to bear the enormous cost of providing fodder for stock which should have been sold.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will take up my proposal.  Such a study, if undertaken, should be comprehensive and should examine the entire financial position prior to the problem occurring and the financial deterioration following the outbreak of the disease, the loss of income, the cost of replacing stock and, more importantly, the mental hardship endured by those on family farms.  I hope progress will be made in this area. Where farmers cannot sell their stock due to an outbreak of TB we must ensure they are adequately compensated and that the family farm remains viable.</P>
    <P>The issue of ear tags is an ongoing <Col N="1560" /> problem.  Everyone is aware there is an ongoing problem with correct reading of ear tags with consequential delays in payments of beef premiums and suckler grants to farmers.  Farmers are not at fault in this regard but in adhering rigidly to departmental regulations they can find themselves suffering loss of income because they cannot read the ear tags.</P>
    <P>It is easy for a farmer to make an error reading an ear tag when it is worn. In this age of technology development I do not understand why we cannot manufacture ear tags which cannot be removed and which could be read electronically.  I speak on this issue at an opportune time because the Department is currently deciding whether the new ear tags will be plastic or metal. That decision will have a major impact on farmers and I hope the Department makes the correct decision.  I favour plastic ear tags but further research should be carried out on how to make the ear tags easier to be read.  That would eliminate the possibility of error when completing grant applications. That has the effect not only of wasting money and delaying payments to farmers but it costs a great deal in terms of administration.</P>
    <P>Farmers have long singled out the badger as the cause of the spread of TB. In a former constituency of mine, Hollyford, County Tipperary, farmers held a public meeting to highlight the fact that their herds had been frequently locked up as a result of TB outbreaks.  Hollyford is located in a wooded area in which there is a large number of badgers.  Despite all the efforts of farmers to get their message across, the Department did not accept it.  I am delighted that the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Yates, has promised further research into this area.</P>
    <P>When speaking about the farming community it is important to say that the majority of farmers are honest and conscientious.  Their prime objective is to comply with scheme regulations but they suffer because of a few careless individuals who break the law.  It is soul <Col N="1561" /> destroying to see honest farmers being subjected to unnecessary, rigorous testing because of some individuals who are not making any effort to comply with the regulations.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's decision announced yesterday on the new approach to disease eradication.  This was described earlier in the debate as a war but I do not look upon it in that light.  It is an issue on which many differing views are held by the IVU, the farming organisations and the Minister. Nevertheless the Minister has come up with a worthwhile solution which I hope will ultimately solve the TB eradication problem.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the IFA on its responsible approach to the new regulations on testing.  It gave priority to the implementation of a more successful TB eradication scheme because it realised the expenditure being put into TB eradication was not achieving the required results.  Under the new arrangements, taxpayers will not be saddled with the expense of paying for the herd test; the initial test will be paid for by the farmer.  This arrangement is welcome because it will bring about a reduction of 65 per cent in farm levies. The annual contribution, therefore, will reduce from £28 to £10 million.</P>
    <P>I welcome the abolition of the compulsory pre-movement test which cost the Exchequer £3.5 million.  Farmers must now decide whether they wish to continue with pre-movement tests.  If they are determined to eliminate TB from their herds, they should continue pre-movement or post-buying testing which restricts the spread of TB.</P>
    <P>We have a poor record in eradicating bovine TB.  Everyone welcomed the establishment of the ERAD programme which we hoped would provide the answer to this problem.  Unfortunately, it was not successful.  In addition to looking to the future for our solutions we should consider what has been lost in our approach to TB eradication.  We failed to collect new funding of £10 million over three years agreed in 1991 in addition to funding of £20 million per <Col N="1562" /> year since 1993.  That is an enormous financial loss to this country and to the scheme.</P>
    <P>We have nothing to be proud of when we consider the signals we sent to the EU in not complying with its regulations.  In failing to do that we not only lost a great deal of funding but we sent a signal to Europe that we were unwilling to implement an agreed programme aimed at combating TB.  We failed also to relieve the burden on farmers and taxpayers who would not have been obliged to contribute the same amount if we had provided a satisfactory scheme under the regulations laid down by the EU.  We should be ashamed of ourselves for allowing that to happen.</P>
    <P>The new scheme proposed by the Minister will not be successful unless we have the agreement of farmers and veterinary surgeons.  I am glad the IVU did not rush the issue by making a statement on the proposal and, hopefully, it will delay making any comment until such time as it has a meeting on the issue.  The fact that the farming organisations welcome the Minister's proposal is a step forward because, up to now, the cost of eradicating TB was not borne equitably by all farmers.  In fact, it was borne mainly by milk suppliers, those who produce finished cattle and producers of cattle for the live export trade. I am happy that under the new regime all farmers will pay a more equitable share of the cost.</P>
    <P>Irrespective of our lack of success with this scheme it must be pursued to a satisfactory outcome.  Not only does the livelihood of farmers depend on its success but the importance of the export of livestock and livestock products to our economy and employment prospects overall cannot be under-estimated.  We shall be unable to maintain our present levels of livestock exports unless we can guarantee good animal health.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister well in his new scheme and urge everybody to support him, ensuring that it is successful for the overall benefit of our agricultural industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>All Members representing agricultural constituencies and communities understand the enormous problems experienced by farmers and others in the agricultural industry occasioned by the incidence of TB in herds over many years.  Since the 1950s when the first TB eradication scheme was initiated, there have been numerous attemps to bring the disease under control but, as many others have said, they were unsuccessful.</P>
      <P>The reasons for its lack of success are many and varied and one must be careful in attempting to apportion blame. First, there is the threat from other animals, from wildlife.  Others tend to blame cattle dealers who have been shifting cattle around the country as though they were engaging in a game of tiddleywinks.  Another factor has been insufficient controls on the movement of diseased cattle.  There have been suggestions that the veterinary profession has been abusing its position for financial gain, yet nobody has been able to pinpoint which factor has been most responsible for its lack of success.</P>
      <P>The Government and Department must ensure that a system is devised to eradicate TB once and for all.  We know that at one stage the incidence of the disease in Northern Ireland had been considerably reduced whereas in the South it remained higher, despite farmers being divided by an imaginary line only.  I have had experience in my family and farming friends of the trauma and financial loss wrought on families consequent on an outbreak of TB in their herds, sometimes having to cope with the emotional problem of having their whole herd wiped out in addition to not receiving compensation for that loss, whereas those same farmers would be fully compensated for an animal with mad cow disease.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reading reports of mad cow disease in different parts of the country I often wonder whether some farmers are not introducing animals with mad cow disease into their herds as a guarantee of compensation in the event of their herds <Col N="1564" /> being wiped out as a result of an outbreak of TB or brucellosis.  If that is a fact it would need to be thoroughly investigated, always remembering that ultimately it is the taxpayer who must foot the bill.  We should not tolerate any such sleight of hand or covert practice.</P>
    <P>Since the Minister assumed office there has been a continuous battle between him and the veterinary profession, with an implication of collusion between vets and farmers, to the effect that vets had not been complying with the requisite standards of professional conduct, not certifying individual doubtful animals but giving them a clean bill of health.  While I have had many contacts with farmers and vets over many years.  I have never seen any evidence of such malpractice.</P>
    <P>I notice the Minister has had to roll back somewhat from his former strong stance, which is to be welcomed, because confrontation is not the best approach to solving that problem. Rather it must be approached in a cooperative manner on the part of all concerned, the farmer organisations, the Irish Veterinary Union, the Department, politicians and others all working together.  We have had examples of many other recent problems in this country having been resolved through a partnership approach, initiated in 1987, which should be applied in this area also.</P>
    <P>The funds expended on the eradication of TB have been raised continuously in reports of the Committee of Public Accounts which, compared with that expended by other countries, appear outrageous, to the extent that in future my hope would be we shall have less need to allocate such amounts to this scheme.  It is crucial that TB be controlled, reduced and, if possible, eliminated to which purpose it is incumbent on the Government, Department and Minister to approach the problem in a more conciliatory manner in order to reach a successful conclusion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> I welcome the changes in the programme <Col N="1565" /> of TB eradication.  Although the Bill does not deal specifically with this plan, we all want to discuss it.  Over £1 billion has been spent on TB eradication in the past 40 years but many people believe we have made no progress.  The question is how we are to measure progress. Should we have got rid of TB by now and is that possible?  Some people say we are not trying to eliminate TB but to contain it.  I wonder what degree of success we have achieved.  The waste of taxpayers' money while making no headway is talked about at all levels.</P>
      <P>A quotation from a history book I had in primary school runs &ldquo;The farmers of Ireland began to feel courage and hope when Michael Davitt founded the Land League&rdquo;.  I am sure the farmers of Ireland will feel courage and hope now that the Minister, Deputy Yates, has reduced the fees by 65 per cent.  It will be a major break for farmers to get that kind of reduction in the amount they have to pay; it will also encourage them to pay.</P>
      <P>I am not a farmer but I grew up on a farm and meet farmers regularly, so I have a fair idea of what they worry about.  Locked up herds have become a problem for farmers.  It is a major disaster if cattle are locked up in the autumn when they are due to be sold and there is not much feeding stock left for the winter.  The cost of providing feed when they have to buy it is clearly a problem with which most farmers cannot deal. One farmer got abuse from his bank manager because the latter felt he could not afford the repayments to pay for the extra feed, although he would be able to sell the cattle after the winter when they were cleared.  Locking up herds causes untold hardship.  It deprives farmers of their money and results in extra hardship depending on the time of year.  If the herd is locked up in spring the farmer does not have to worry about extra feed, but with winter approaching it is a heavy burden.  I am glad that under this scheme the restrictions will be eased in cases where no lesions are found in a single reactor that is killed at the factory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1566" /> The benefit of locking up herds is doubtful if, having been held over for a number of months for two tests, the cattle are cleared.  What is gained?  One farmer told me it was crazy that his cattle had to be locked up and he had to suffer all the trauma and expense of looking after the herd even when, on testing, it was discovered to be free of TB.  Herds cannot be sold if they are carrying TB but is the overall advantage in locking up herds worth the cost, and what does it prevent in the long run?</P>
    <P>The question of compensation arose in the context of the Minister's plans. Farmers who will benefit from the elimination of the 60-day pre-movement test will be encouraged to have their own tests carried out because there will be extra compensation.  Nothing would be of greater help in getting rid of TB than the elimination of animals with TB, and farmers should get full compensation &mdash; by that I mean the market rate &mdash; for an animal that goes down with TB except, perhaps, in the case of a cow where milk production would be lost.  We should not expect farmers to send animals away at a loss to themselves.  If they did not incur loss they would be less worried about an animal failing the test.  I can never understand why the farmers' organisations did not make more of a fuss about the lack of full compensation. It would have eased the burden on farmers and encouraged vets not to give the benefit of the doubt.</P>
    <P>There are to be further studies on the influence of wildlife.  In this context this means an extension of the study being done in east Offaly.  It is time we had some scientific information on the role of the badger.  Some studies point to the fact that the badger carries the TB germ.  Others argue vehemently that this does not happen.  We have made sufficient advances in science and have enough qualified people to do research and find out once and for all if badgers are as serious a threat to livestock as we think.  If it is found that badgers are guilty in one part of the country but innocent in another, the innocent must be allowed to survive.  However, if we <Col N="1567" /> are spending a fortune trying to get rid of TB in cattle and the badger can be shown to be one of the main causes, we must take action.  That will lead to objections, but we cannot put down cattle and at the same time not put down another animal that may have caused the disease and, in fairness to the badger, we should put him to bed or put him to sleep.</P>
    <P>A farmer I spoke to today told me that the elimination of the 60-day pre-movement test would be of great benefit to farmers, even if nothing else were done.  Farmers who want to sell cattle are now free to do so without the restriction of the 60-day test.  This will have to be monitored, however.  It would never do if cattle were moving so fast that they were never tested.  The farmer to whom I spoke today was overjoyed at being a free agent once more; it is not easy for a farmer who knows his business, who know his grass production, his fodder, to be told by somebody else that he cannot sell his cattle at a particular time.  It is important for the farmer to sell when he wants to sell, and encouragement is more important than penalties.  The promise of increased compensation will encourage farmers to have pre and post-movement tests carried out.  This is very important as the vast majority of farmers want to co-operate and ensure that TB is eradicated; it is in their own interests to ensure that their herds are TB free.  I believe farmers will welcome the elimination of the 60 day pre-movement test. However, it is important to ensure that cattle are tested annually.</P>
    <P>It is stated in one of the documents that the scheme will be more focused and targeted with a higher level of testing by departmental and contract vets in problem areas.  In addition, a more scientific approach will be adopted in trying to identify infection and greater efforts will be made to identify its sources.  It is important in the era of advanced technology that every effort is made to pinpoint the source of the infection and to ascertain why TB is still <Col N="1568" /> a problem in spite of all the measures taken.</P>
    <P>It is proposed to establish a quality control unit to oversee the effectiveness of the scheme.  As in any production line, it is important to establish a co-ordinating body which will assure people that the scheme is working and study the reasons for the high level of TB in certain areas and a low level in others. The improvement in the feedback given to farmers is important.  It is difficult for farmers to watch testing being carried out and then have to wait for the results. This pressure cannot be eliminated regardless of what scheme is introduced but farmers would have a greater guarantee that the test will be negative if more research is carried out on the causes.  It is obvious that not enough research has been carried out in this area.  Spending money is one way of dealing with the problem but spending it wisely is another.  I have attended meetings at which experts give advice to people who are worried that the wrong injection may be given, etc.  It should be possible at this stage to ensure that only the right type of injection is given.</P>
    <P>When I met vets in the past few months they were not happy with the scheme.  However, they were serious about the eradication of TB and I am glad they have decided to await a further study on the issue.  Under the previous scheme they were offered an increase of 23 per cent but turned it down because of the problems about rotation.  I hope they will agree to the new scheme.  If the Department, the Minister, the vets and farmers are happy with the scheme then it will work.  Given our membership of the EU, it is important to eradicate TB.  This is particularly important from the point of view of farmers as the more difficulties they have the more expense they incur.</P>
    <P>I hope the scheme will prove successful.  I congratulate the Minister on trying to deal with this problem, it is time there was an effort to break the ongoing cycle of TB and I hope the new scheme will enable us to achieve this.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  I listened with great interest to the Minister's contribution and I compliment my colleagues who spoke so eloquently about the problem. As a lay person, I am baffled at how it was possible to eradicate TB in humans during the 1950s when times were difficult but it has not been possible to eradicate it in animals after 41 years. This shows there is something wrong somewhere, that there is a lack of co-ordination and co-operation.  As Deputy Michael Ahern said, there must be full co-operation if the programme is to be successful and if we are to be in a position to assure the international markets, which are so vital to the export industry, that we have a disease free national livestock herd.</P>
      <P>I do not accept that the real cost of the scheme is in excess of £1 billion.  I know from my 13 years in public life and my 13 years as a livestock auctioneer &mdash; I worked for ten marts in counties Galway, Mayo and Clare during that time &mdash; that the Department not only includes the costs of the scheme to the Exchequer but also the salaries of the officials who work on a permanent and part-time basis in its administration. Given that these full time civil servants who have permanent and pensionable posts can be promoted or transferred to other divisions or Departments, their salaries should not be included in the total cost of this scheme to the Exchequer.  There are problems with the scheme.  I welcome the reduction in levies announced by the Minister but there has been a serious reduction in export refunds at the same time.  The Minister's timing is shrewd, he was fully aware of the decisions by the European Commission to reduce the export refunds and now he has reduced the levies.  It is a balancing act of the political connotations of these decisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1570" /> The Minister proposes in his new programme the continuation of orderly annual testing of the national herds and other testing designed to meet our obligations under European Union rules to maintain our trading status.  To eliminate bovine TB a single annual test with a uniform tuberculin is needed for every herd, carried out townland by townland, so that we can have the same responses to the same standard serum which is being injected into the livestock animals.  Until there is standardisation I do not think we will have a resolution of the problem.  Different tuberculins are used and a great deal of money has been spent in the past but animals will react in different ways to different tuberculins and we cannot be sure what the reaction, is until such time as there is standardisation.</P>
    <P>The veterinary pharmaceutical industry has potential for massive job creation.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry has not made a major input in ensuring that jobs in that industry come on stream.  We have been importing millions of pounds worth of veterinary pharmaceuticals every year and it has taken the ingenuity of brilliant vets to research and produce veterinary pharmaceuticals that are successfully sold in 60 countries.  If they were part of a consultation team it would help to ensure we have a standardised tuberculin suitable for the atmospheric conditions and livestock in this country.  With proper co-ordinated research there would be conclusive evidence of the reasons for the residue of bovine TB and we could then find out whether it would be possible to eliminate it.  If 99.9 per cent of the national herd is disease free there is only 0.1 per cent residue.  When account is taken of the huge increase in livestock numbers <i>vis-à-vis</i> the value of the livestock industry to this country and the money the Exchequer has spent on the eradication of bovine TB, people would have to agree we have got reasonably good value for money.  It is worthwhile, it is vital for the protection of both human <Col N="1571" /> and animal life and to maintain our position in vital markets.</P>
    <P>There is no reason that we as an island nation cannot isolate the factors of bovine TB that baffle the Department, confuse the farmers and curtail the mobility of livestock in the country. I welcome the Minister's decision to abolish the pre-movement test.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Doyle, for coming in to take the Adjournment debate but I am disappointed the Taoiseach is not present in view of the fact that I am raising his reported comments at a meeting in the Mount Errigal Hotel in Donegal on 27 October 1995.  I am very concerned about his comments as reported and recorded at the meeting of the North West Regional Cross-Border Group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach made the following three points: first, that the National Roads Authority on both sides of the Border would co-operate &mdash; and nobody has any difficulty with that &mdash; but it was disappointing that he did not refer to the county and regional roads which are causing the problem in Border areas.  Second, he said that the drawing down of maximum European funding was not a priority as against keeping spending under control.  Nobody more than I would be calling on the Government to keep spending under control but for the Taoiseach to suggest that to do so we cannot draw down the maximum amount of European funding is a false sense of economy.  I never heard a Government Minister say that before and I was surprised at him. Third, he said to increase funding to Border areas it would have to be redirected from elsewhere and that this <Col N="1572" /> could not be done in view of the commitment to contain spending within a 2 per cent increase.  That raises serious and fundamental questions, the most important being this Government's commitment to the Border region.  I never had much faith in this Government because for the first time there is no Minister or Minister of State from a Border constituency.</P>
    <P>No payments were made under the INTERREG programme in 1994 but payments will be made in 1995.  If you take out the INTERREG, which is additional funding provided by the European Union specifically for Border regions, the allocation for county and regional roads is reduced which is indicative of the lack of commitment to Border areas.  Out of the 5,000 jobs created by overseas industry in this country, 14 were created in one county of my constituency and nine in the other and we have not yet seen the benefits from the ceasefire.</P>
    <P>The European Union, the United States and the people who subscribe to the international fund for Ireland all recognise the problems in the Border area.  It is recognised that all frontier areas have problems but things are even more difficult in the Border area because of the 25 years of violence although the Government obviously does not recognise the problems.  I appeal to the Government not to offer pious platitudes but to give us our entitlement, the allocation of money that has been provided by the taxpayers of the European Union as well as the additional funding to which we are entitled.  We will then get on with the job in the Border region.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach's reported comments show a complete lack of regard for the Border region.  To date we have not seen anything from this Government.  I would like Deputy Doyle to convey to the Taoiseach the disappointment, not just of myself but of all other Deputies and Senators in the Border area, at the <Col N="1573" /> lack of interest shown by the Government and the depression caused by the comments attributed to him.</P>

      <P>As other regions, the Border region is benefiting from expenditure under Structural Funds operational programmes as outlined in the Community Support Framework 1994-1999.  The Border region is also benefiting from the INTERREG II Community Initiative and from the EU Initiative under the programme for peace and reconciliation.</P>
      <P>For the CSF and these two Community Initiatives additionality is a requirement to which the Government is comfortably adhering.  The Government is committed to remaining within the expenditure parameters set out in our policy document, <i>A Government of Renewal.</i> However, our commitment to meet the additionality requirements under the CSF and the Community Initiative is consistent with these expenditure parameters.</P>
      <P>As regards EU funded programmes which specifically target the Border region and areas adjacent to it, it is worth mentioning that under INTERREG II there is an EU aid allocation of 89.5 ECU, approximately IR£72 million.  This programme covers infrastructure &mdash; including roads, energy, transport, telecommunications &mdash; environmental protection &mdash; including management of water resources and removal of pollutants &mdash; natural resources, human resources and economic development &mdash; including tourism, community development and special economic development measures such as linkages.</P>
      <P>To ensure that the INTERREG programme is more effectively delivered an INTERREG development officer has been appointed and has set up offices in both Monaghan and Armagh.  This officer will be mainly responsible for coordinating activity on the ground.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1574" /> In addition, EU funding has been provided to support the Northern Ireland peace process.  This programme covers the broad areas of urban and rural regeneration; employment; cross-Border development; social inclusion; and productive investment and industrial development.</P>
    <P>The total EU funding available to the initiative is 300 million ECU over three years.  At least 20 per cent of this funding will be available for the six Border counties.  Funding over a further two-year period will be subject to a review of the progress by the Commission.  The EU grant rate is up to a maximum of 75 per cent.</P>
    <P>Every effort has been made to ensure that, wherever possible, actions under the programme will be bottom-up and that local groups have the maximum input into the delivery of the programme.  The bulk of the programme will be delivered by intermediary bodies funded by way of global grants.  The programme will therefore be distinctively different from any of the other programmes, including INTERREG.  Its main objective is to support peace and reconciliation and, therefore, measures involving social inclusion will be particularly emphasised.  It will not be a top-up for existing programmes.  Furthermore, Departments have been asked to examine existing CSF operational programmes to see how they can be refocused to ensure maximum synergies with the peace programme.</P>
    <P>Considerable cross-Border co-operation is developing at local authority level.  Donegal County Council has joined forces with the Derry, Strabane and Limavady District Councils to form the North-West Cross-Border Group.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11 and 19 together.</P>
      <P>The Government has accepted the broad conclusions of the Efficiency Audit Group (EAG) arising from its review of the Defence Forces.  As many of the reforms proposed by the EAG can only be attained over a longer time-frame, the Government has asked me to bring forward, in the first instance, proposals which are attainable within the next three years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An implementation group has been established to prepare a fully costed development plan aimed at producing an organisation with an overall target strength of 11,500 personnel.  In that context the implementation group is addressing the formulation of a voluntary early retirement scheme which will <Col N="1522" /> be the subject of consultations with the Defence Forces representative associations.  I intend putting my proposals on these issues to Government shortly.  At this stage, however, I wish to emphasise that there will be no compulsory redundancies and that any retirements which may take place will be on a voluntary basis.  The Defence Forces representative associations are being consulted on all matters arising from the EAG review which come within their scope of representation.  Proposals on a voluntary early retirement scheme will be discussed with both RACO and PDFORRA when the details have been agreed by Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12, 20 and 70 together.</P>
      <P>The main day to day role of the Naval Service is to provide a fishery protection service in accordance with the State's obligations as a member of the European Union.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With the new arrangements on fishery control measures arising in 1996 the <Col N="1523" /> workload of the Naval Service will increase.  These new measures will include the requirement for all fishing vessels to report to the Irish authorities before they enter or exit the Irish zone. In this regard, I am committed to ensuring that sufficient resources are in place to enable the Naval Service deal with these additional demands and that a more sophisticated and comprehensive fisheries control and surveillance system is established in Ireland.</P>
    <P>As the Deputies may be aware, agreement was reached at the Fisheries Council on 26 October 1995 on a new regulation which will provide aid of up to 205 million ECU for fisheries protection in the Community over the period 1996 to 2000.  In accordance with the provisions of the new regulation, proposals for a five year programme of expenditure were submitted by Ireland to the Commission on 15 November 1995.  This programme is subject to the approval of the Government.</P>
    <P>I should also point out that these proposals are subject to the agreement of the Commission and I will be in a position to tell the House the full extent of the planned expenditure when the proposals have been agreed.  I can confirm, however, that under the new programme we are proposing the provision of an additional ship for the Naval Service which, it is expected, will enter service in 1998.  Additionally, under the new regulation, Ireland receives special recognition of its considerable protection requirements and is guaranteed to receive 15 million ECU, about IR£12.3 million at current rates, in aid, specifically to fund the operational needs of the protection service.</P>
    <P>On the question of manpower, I can say that recruitment to the Naval Service is kept under continuous review within the Department.  The Department is currently in the process of enlisting 50 recruits for the Naval Service, 44 have already taken up duty and the remainder are expected to be enlisted shortly at which stage the strength of the Naval Service will be at <Col N="1524" /> its highest ever level.  If a commitment from the EU for funding towards an additional ship for the Naval Service is secured then the question of additional recruitment to the Naval Service will be reviewed.</P>
    <P>As regards anti-drug surveillance the position is that responsibility for prevention of the illegal importation of drugs rests primarily with the Revenue Commissioners and the Garda Síochána.  The Defence Forces, including the Naval Service, respond to requests from the civil authorities for assistance, including assistance in combating the illegal importation of drugs, and they will continue to do so.</P>
    <P>Existing resources have enabled the Naval Service to respond effectively to such requests.  The recent Government decision on proposals to improve law enforcement in relation to drugs including the establishment of a joint task force involving the Garda, the Customs Service and the Naval Service will help to maximise the effective use of Naval Service resources in combating the illegal importation of drugs.  The designation of some Naval Service personnel as enforcement officers under the Criminal Justice Act, 1994 will also increase the role and effectiveness of the Naval Service in this area.  The question of whether additional resources are required will be kept under review as these proposals are implemented.</P>
    <P>I am sure that Deputies would like to join me in congratulating the Naval Service and the other agencies involved in the successful operation which culminated in the recent seizure of drugs.</P>

      <P>Civil <Col N="1525" /> Defence hosted its annual national exercise entitled &ldquo;Community Endeavour `95&rdquo; at Clonmel, Blarney, Castlebar and Westport on 21 October 1995.  This exercise is part of a Civil Defence development programme &ldquo;Towards 2000&rdquo; which was launched in 1992.</P>
      <P>I had the pleasant task of visiting each location on the day.  Upwards of 1,000 volunteers with more than 100 mini buses, ambulances, jeeps and fire engines, including a wide range of rescue equipment, participated in varying tasks in emergency response exercises</P>
      <P>Each team on site employed their own particular skills in solving the many complex problems presented.  I have no doubt that the new skills and expertise acquired will be passed on to the organisation at large.  These exercises also provided a forum to foster a closer spirit of co-operation with the other emergency services, such as the fire service, health boards, Garda and the other voluntary agencies.</P>
      <P>The local authorities who sent the volunteers deserve our congratulations for their ongoing commitment and dedication to Civil Defence.</P>
      <P>I wish also to congratulate all the volunteers and their Civil Defence officers for the efforts displayed during the day. They were most impressive and gave me a greater appreciation of the tremendous resource which Civil Defence is in supporting local communities.</P>
      <P>This national exercise allowed the organisation to further appraise its development programme which is committed to enabling Civil Defence to provide a more effective community support to the primary emergency services.</P>
      <P>I am currently having a mid term review carried out of the &ldquo;Towards 2000&rdquo; programme.  In consultation with all concerned this review will reflect on the work to date and plan for the remainder of the decade.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Minister for Defence (Mr. Barrett) Minister for Defence (Mr. Barrett)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>Normal day to day patrolling by the Naval Service on fishery protection takes place within Ireland's 200 miles exclusive fishery limit.  Occasionally, the Naval Service carry out patrols outside the 200 miles limit.</P>
      <P>In August and September 1990, a Naval Service vessel conveyed EU fishery inspectors on fishery surveillance patrols on behalf of the EU in international waters bordering on the Canadian 200 miles zone.  This operation arose from the requirements of the North-West Atlantic Fisheries Organisation Convention (NAFO) in accordance with Council Regulation 1956/88. During the patrols, a total of 27 fishing vessels of various nationalities were boarded by the EU inspectors who passed on the results of the boardings to the EU Commission.  Community financial assistance was made available to Ireland to offset the additional costs incurred by the Naval Service in undertaking this operation.</P>
      <P>In 1994 and 1995, the Naval Service undertook patrols of the tuna fishery. The patrols took place in ICES (International Council for the Exploitation of the Sea) zone 8 E which commences 270 nautical miles south of Ireland and extends for a further 300 nautical miles.  The purpose of the patrols was to monitor tuna fishing by Irish registered fishing vessels in the area and to ensure that the Commission Regulation which prohibits the use or retention on board any fishing vessel fishing for tuna of one or more driftnets whose individual or total length is more than 2.5 kilometres was enforced.  Each member state is responsible for monitoring the activities of its own vessels engaged in fishing in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Naval Service patrol of the tuna fishery in 1994 ran from 18 July to 6 August.  Ten Irish fishing vessels were boarded during the patrol, one of which <Col N="1528" /> was detained for having a driftnet in excess of 2.5 km on board and was subsequently found guilty in court.  The patrols in 1995 involved 16 days patrolling by the Naval Service outside the 200 miles limit.  Five Irish fishing vessels were boarded outside the 200 miles limit, one of which was detained for allegedly having a driftnet in excess of 2.5 km on board.  The prosecution is still pending in this case.</P>
    <P>I would also like to add that in 1995 a significant portion of the international tuna fleet arrived inside Ireland's 200 miles limit in search of tuna.  As the vessels were operating inside the Irish limit the Naval Service had the powers to board and inspect these vessels.  In all, 62 tuna fishing vessels were boarded by the Naval Service, 41 Spanish, seven UK and 14 French.  All these vessels were found to be in order.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy is aware, Ireland has and continues to benefit from substantial community aid for fishery surveillance resources and equipment.  There is little doubt that the EU's attitude in examining applications for such aid takes into account Ireland's contribution to fishery enforcement in areas such as the North &mdash; West Atlantic Fisheries Organisation Regulatory Area and the tuna fishing zone.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have indicated in a reply to an earlier question, this country considers that its allocated share of fish stocks under the Common Fisheries Policy falls far short of a fair and equitable level.  This is restated in the policy agreement.  <i>A Government of Renewal,</i> which commits the Government to continue pursue an <Col N="1529" /> equitable share of the EU fish quota reflecting our geographical position.</P>
      <P>We will support any changes to the Common Fisheries Policy which will improve Ireland's position.</P>
      <P>The CFP last fell for major review in 1992.  The basic principles of the CFP were re-affirmed unanimously on that occasion.  Ireland was the only member state of the Union to challenge the allocation principles.  Ireland's case in that regard remains firmly on the table and any and every reasonable opportunity to advocate and advance that case to Ireland's advantage will be pursued.  If there is to be any such change, it will require the support of a qualified majority of member states and transfers of fish stocks to Ireland from other key member states with major fishing rights in western waters.</P>
      <P>In seeking the reform of the Common Fisheries Policy in our favour, one must exercise considerable caution.  Apart from the key matter of allocations, the basic principles of the Common Fisheries Policy are well balanced.  A delicate compromise has been struck between the protection of coastal zones through the 12 mile limit and the national quotas system on the one hand and the free movement/access of labour, capital and enterprise on the other hand.  If the Common Fisheries Policy as we know it should be scrapped simpliciter and, given that the key protective aspects of the Policy represent derogations from the Treaties, the starting point from which to negotiate a new policy could be much less favourable than the present CFP framework.  Proposals to in effect re-nationalise fisheries would run totally counter to the basic principles underlying the Union and its further integration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our policy, in line with that of previous Governments, is, therefore, to seek improvement within the existing CFP framework.  While the policy does not fall for review again until the year 2002, we will as I have said act at all times in the meantime first of all to protect Ireland's position and second to <Col N="1530" /> improve it whenever and wherever possible.</P>

      <P>I am forwarding to the Deputy the landing statistics for the year ending December 1994.  These statistics list, by species, volume and value, landings at 123 ports and landing points around the coast.  In 1994 the volume of sea fish landed was 275,025 tonnes, valued at over £101 million.  The landings comprised 32,356 tonnes of demersal species, 212,108 tonnes of pelagic species and 30,561 tonnes of shellfish.</P>
      <P>There has been a very significant upward growth curve in the level of Irish fish landings in recent years.  The objective under the Fisheries Operational Programme is to increase both the volume and value of landings to over 300,000 tonnes worth £118 million by the year 2000.  This is of course critically dependent on current stock levels being maintained and improved and effective conservation policies being pursued.</P>
      <P>The major impact of this expansion of landings has been the increase in onshore value added through development of the fish processing sector and related employment.  Continued expansion of the processing sector is dependent on consistency, quality and availability of supply from both the catching and aquaculture sectors.  There are significant opportunities for greater added value through the conversion of a larger volume of current landings into processed products.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The investment plans now under way under the Operational Programme for fleet modernisation, aquaculture, ports facilities and the fish processing sector <Col N="1531" /> are geared to realising those opportunities.  In my visits to fishery harbours and facilities around the coast I have been particularly impressed at progress being made by fisheries co-operatives to achieve closer integration between the catching side and onshore processing.  I will be supporting and encouraging that positive trend.</P>

      <P>I agree that carefully targeted modest investment in small harbours and landing places around the coast can produce demonstrable benefits for the local fishing and aquaculture industries. Improved facilities can also enhance the opportunities for developing marine leisure at these locations.  In so far as funding is available and where local authorities have such plans I will continue to do my best to facilitate and support prioritised proposals to underpin economic activity at local level.</P>
      <P>Funding under the Fisheries Operational Programme is limited however and is currently oversubscribed in terms of existing and proposed investment projects at the five fishery harbour centres and other strategically important fishery harbours around the coast.  I am pursuing the case for additional EU Structural Funding for fishery harbour development which is so urgently needed to address infrastructural needs to key fishery harbours around the coast.  I have no doubt that I have the full support of all concerned Deputies in this endeavour.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to advise the Deputy that <Col N="1533" /> I have recently approved grant aid of £45,000 to Waterford County Council to support an overall investment of £75,000 in improvement works at Ardmore.  The project involves extension of the existing slipway, extra storage for boats and restoration works on the breakwater.  The work is already under way and should be completed before the end of the year.  The immediate investment will considerably enhance the facilities for fishermen at Ardmore from an operational and safety perspective.</P>
      <P>I understand that a feasibility study into a number of development options for Ardmore Harbour has been undertaken and that this has recently been presented to the Department.  These proposals envisage major development works at a cost of about £1 million. Given the funding available and the existing and emerging priorities for essential works at the five fishery harbour centres and other major fishery harbours, it is, difficult to justify investment on the large scale envisaged at Ardmore.  That being said, the structural improvements which I have agreed to fund will be completed quickly and will be of immediate benefit to local fishermen.</P>

      <P>The ice supply development programme is a major component of the drive to assist the fishing industry to achieve significant improvements in quality and hygiene standards.  BIM's current ice plant programme is supported by EU funding under the fisheries operational programme 1994-1999.  The immediate priority under the programme for next year is to complete work in progress on <Col N="1534" /> new ice plants at Greencastle and Rossaveal.</P>
      <P>Over and above these ongoing commitments and in light of available EU funding which is limited, the Department is currently receiving, in consultation with BIM, the priorities and options for further investment in ice plants at key fishery harbours.</P>
      <P>The Department and BIM agree that a new ice plant of sufficient capacity to meet the needs of all users at Union Hall should be provided as soon as possible.  A major investment programme in the port itself has recently been completed and operations there are set to expand with a commensurate increase in fish landings and in the demand for ice.  The existing ice capacity can, I understand, cater for a substantial proportion of the expected growth in demand but only in the short-term.  The Department and BIM are therefore assessing the overall funding options with a view to progressing the Union Hall project as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>In that context I am aware that the Union Hall fishermen's company has proposed undertaking the investment itself if EU funding can be made available.  This proposal is being examined on its merits although such a strategy would mark a significant departure from existing policies on ice plant supply and management.  The main constraint on the project at the moment is that available EU funding for the ice plant programme is committed up to end 1997.</P>

      <P>I announced the establishment of the salmon management working group in October this year.  The brief of the <Col N="1535" /> working group is to develop practical proposals for the management of wild salmon stocks, in line with stated policy objectives and with full regard for the interests of those with legitimate rights in salmon exploitation be they commercial or angling.</P>
      <P>The working group is chaired by Professor Noel Wilkins of UCG.  The other members of the group are Mr. Patrick Byrne, angling representative; Mr. T.P. Ó Conchúir of Ballydavid Fishermen's Association; Mr. Harry Lloyd, Northern Regional Fisheries Board; Mr. John Browne, inspector, Fisheries Research Centre; Mr. Niall McCutcheon, principal officer, Inland Fisheries Division and Ms Mary Kinsella, Inland Fisheries Division, (secretary to the group).</P>
      <P>I have asked the group to take account of a number of policy guidelines on salmon management.  These include:</P>
      <P>&mdash;The primary goal is the conservation of wild salmon stocks.</P>
      <P>&mdash;Account must be taken of the international pressure on salmon stocks.</P>
      <P>&mdash;Fishing effort for wild salmon needs to be managed on a catchment basis.</P>
      <P>&mdash;The sustainable development of the salmon resource must be grounded in the support of local communities and fishermen.</P>
      <P>&mdash;The salmon regulations must make sense and be respected by the majority of the industry to be effective.</P>
      <P>&mdash;A new spirit of partnership is needed with coastal communities to manage the wild salmon resources effectively.</P>
      <P>The group has begun its work and will continue intensive sessions over the coming weeks.  It will consult widely with all relevant interests and to that end has invited written submissions in addition to planning a series of regional consultations shortly.  I expect the group to report to me early in 1996.</P>

      <P>The Government is strongly committed to the sustainable development of the aquaculture industry which offers important economic opportunities for coastal regions.  This commitment has been given concrete expression by the inclusion of aquaculture as a distinct investment measure in the EU fisheries operational programme 1994-1999.</P>
      <P>Investment in aquaculture under the programme will help to protect existing employment and production, facilitate continued expansion and generate new jobs and economic activity both on farm sites and onshore operations.</P>
      <P>Fanad Fisheries is a major player within the sector and makes a very significant contribution to jobs and economic activity in County Donegal.  The company has a worldwide quality reputation and I am supportive of its plans to underpin its present operations and achieve incremental expansion.  I understand that Fanad has drawn up a comprehensive environmental impact statement in relation to the company's application for additional fallowing and production sites which will be the subject of consultation with all relevant interests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that context I would note that considerable resources are being devoted to an urgent overhaul of the legal framework for aquaculture and the intention is to introduce a revised and enhanced licensing system which will balance all interests.  The current legislative base is deficient in many critical respects and pre-dated the impact of new thinking on planning, licensing and environmental issues and the significant technical advances in fish farming.  Preparation of the legislation which is complex is at an <Col N="1539" /> advanced stage and I hope to bring proposals to Government shortly.</P>

      <P>On the occasion of the publication of the task force report on 11 October last I announced that the report's findings and recommendations would be implemented in full.  This process is now well under way.  The report contains 13 recommendations which can broadly be categorised under three main headings: Emergency relief measures; new marine biotoxin action plan; consumer confidence.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Emergency relief measures</i>
      </P>
      <P>The main thrust of the task force report is aimed at putting in place measures to deal with naturally occurring biotoxin problems in the medium to long-term.  The task force recognised, however, that the unprecedented toxicity problems which affected rope mussel producers, particularly in the south west in 1994, had a serious economic impact on growers and markets and that there was an urgent need in the short-term for emergency relief measures.  As recommended by the task force a £100,000 emergency aid scheme has been approved to help restore industry confidence and protect employment. An Bord Iascaigh Mhara, which is administering the scheme has invited applications from affected producers, through advertisements in the specialist and regional press.  The aid package is subject to EU approval which has been sought.</P>
      <P>
        <i>New Marine Biotoxin Action Plan</i>
      </P>
      <P>Key components of the plan include:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1540" /> The establishment of a national marine biotoxin group to oversee implementation of the report's recommendations, to provide an ongoing forum for industry inputs and discussion with the Department's technical services and to review the results of the national monitoring programme periodically and recommend modifications as necessary.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that the chairman of the task force, Mr. Pat Keogh, deputy chief executive, BIM, has agreed to chair the successor monitoring body.  The composition of the group will be as recommended by the task force and will include full industry representation.  Nominees have been invited from the relevant industry representative body &mdash; the Irish Aquaculture Association.</P>
    <P>An enhanced national monitoring programme for biotoxins covering all the main shellfish growing areas in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Pending EU harmonised testing standards, which the Department of the Marine is actively pursuing at EU level, the biological testing methods accepted by national EU authorities for end destinations will apply in future.</P>
    <P>In particular, the biological testing method of toxin detection applicable in France, our main export market for Irish produced mussels, will become the norm in future for mussel exports to that member state.  The Department's fisheries research centre has initiated the necessary preparatory work for the new recommended testing methodology.</P>
    <P>Early warning systems anticipating closures will be strengthened to minimise disruption caused by harvesting restrictions and closures.</P>
    <P>Targeting of future biotoxin research priorities.</P>
    <P>Preparatory work on these recommendations has commenced.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Consumer confidence</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Department and State agencies are working to strengthen the ongoing effort to create greater public awareness <Col N="1541" /> and positive publicity as to the natural phenomena of biotoxicity and to reassure importers, wholesalers, caterers and consumers through implementation of the BIM quality assurance scheme.  I am committed to the full implementation of the report as expeditiously as possible.  The key objectives are to maintain industry, consumer and market confidence in the high health status of Irish mussels and to maximise the production and employment potential of this important industry.</P>

      <P>The United Kingdom, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Denmark and Germany have fishing rights in Ireland's fishery zone for certain species and subject to quota entitlements.  Under the EU-Norway fisheries agreement for 1995 Norwegian vessels have some limited access for certain species in Irish waters.</P>
      <P>Spain and Portugal have had restricted access to waters in the Irish fishery zone under the 1985 Iberian Act of Accession.  Under the agreement at the December 1994 Fisheries Council on the full integration of Spain and Portugal into the common fisheries policy, 40 named Spanish vessels out of the 93 vessels which currently can be present at any one time in Irish waters will be allowed access into certain areas of the Irish Box.  There will be no increase in the overal numbers of Spanish vessels in the Irish fishery zone, nor will they have increased fishing opportunities or quota entitlements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Access in the 200 mile zone is qualified in all cases by the availability of <Col N="1542" /> quotas in specific fishery areas.  The absence of quotas in respect of certain member states debars them from fishing within the 200 mile zone for the species concerned.</P>

      <P>My main concern in regard to this matter stems from the fact that there is no requirement in the existing International Maritime Organisation code on the Safe Carriage of Irradiated Nuclear Fuels known as the INF Code or other international instruments under which organisations-agencies such as the UK Marine Safety Agency are obliged to involve adjoining states such as ourselves in the monitoring of shipments of irradiated nuclear fuels close to our shores.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the Minister of State, Deputy Gilmore, dealt comprehensively with a closely related issue in replying to questions in the House on 17 October 1995.  In his reply he referred specifically to deficiencies which Ireland has identified in the INF Code and to the objective which is being pursued through the mechanisms of the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) in seeking to have some if not all of those deficiencies remedied at as early a date as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the meantime, the Minister of State has discussed the matter with the secretary-general of the IMO in London on 24 October and on 14 November addressed the plenary session of the 19th Assembly of that body.  He presented on behalf of Ireland a resolution concerning the shipments of nuclear materials and in his address to <Col N="1543" /> the assembly stressed the special concerns of the Government and people of Ireland on being a coastal state near which such shipments are occuring and increasing.</P>
    <P>Ireland presented the resolution to the assembly in order to formally set in motion the procedures for strengthening the INF Code.  Through the resolution we are asking the appropriate committees of the IMO to consider in detail the issues which we have set out and to report to the next assembly.</P>

      <P>Under the EU Operational Programme for Fisheries, over £6 million is being invested in enhanced training programme for the fisheries sector over the period 1994 to 1999.  About £1 million will be spent on training programmes in 1996 which is similar to expenditure undertaken this year.  I am generally satisfied that the programmes are paying dividends in terms of improved skills, efficiency and safety standards within the sector.

    <P>The present bands have largely obtained since 1975, except for the introduction of the 5 per cent band in 1988 and a readjustment of the lower bands in 1990.</P>
    <P>I should point out that there are a number of significant reliefs and exemptions within the stamp duty code which are primarily aimed at assisting first-time house buyers to purchase their own homes.  There is a full exemption from stamp duty for transfers of new houses with a floor area below 125 square metres.  Transfers of new houses with a larger floor area attract stamp duty based only on the site value, subject to a minimum site value of one-quarter of the full house value.  The targeting of these stamp duty reliefs in favour of new houses takes account, <i>inter alia,</i> of the fact that most new house sales are subject to VAT at 12.5 per cent, <Col N="1545" /> whereas sales of second-hand houses generally are not.</P>
    <P>I should add that there is also 100 per cent mortgage-interest tax relief for first-time buyers of both new and second-hand houses and a reduced rate of relief for other mortgage holders.  A generous £3,000 new house grant is also available for first-time buyers.</P>
    <P>These reliefs help to moderate the cost of housing generally and also play an important role in promoting employment within the construction sector.</P>
    <P>In framing taxation policy, the Government must have regard to both the budgetary implications of changes to the tax code, and the possible effects of such changes on other aspects of Government policy.  The yield from stamp duty on all property, including second-hand houses, is estimated at £160 million this year and makes a very significant contribution towards the cost of implementing the Government's important social and economic programme.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, I have no plans to alter the current scheme.</P>

      <P>My Department allocated approximately £20,000 to Catherine McAuley Special School in 1994.</P>
      <P>The school in question, together with one other school which also caters for children with specific learning disability, is funded directly by my Department. All other schools are funded by means of capitation grants.</P>
      <P>The direct funding arrangement in place in the case of these two schools is in recognition of the fact that both schools attract pupils from wide catchment areas which are not parish-based.</P>
      <P>The funding needs of Catherine McAuley School are currently being considered in my Department in the context of submissions received from the school on this issue.</P>

      <P>At present there are two Employment Regulation Orders (EROs), made by the Labour Court on the basis of proposals from Joint Labour Committees, which set out statutory minimum rates of pay and regulate statutory conditions of employment of workers employed in hairdressing establishments in Dublin City and County, the Borough of Dún Laoghaire and the Urban District of Bray, and the Cork County Borough.  The EROs set out the minimum rates of pay for both qualified staff and apprentices irrespective of their sex.</P>
      <P>Pay and other conditions of employment of workers employed in hairdressing establishments located outside these areas are a matter for negotiation between employers and workers or trade unions acting on their behalf. However, it is open to any trade union or organisation claiming to be representative of any class, type or group of workers to apply to the Labour Court for the establishment of a new Joint Labour Committee.</P>
      <P>Enforcement of EROs is carried out by the Labour Inspectorate Section of my Department.  Inspectors carry out inspections on a routine and complaint basis.  Where inspections show that the statutory minimum rate of pay has not been observed, arrears of wages are collected by the Labour Inspectorate for the employee concerned.  In cases where the employer fails to pay the arrears due, legal proceedings are instituted for recovery of these arrears.</P>

      <P>In 1994 there was an intake of 500 recruits including 80 for the Naval Service.  The press advertisements advised those who had previously applied, i.e. those on waiting lists, to re-apply if they still wished to be considered for enlistment.  There was a further intake of 50 recruits for the Naval Service this year. These personnel were selected from among a panel of suitable candidates drawn up following the 1994 competition.  Further recruitment will be advertised in the national press.  Persons wishing to enlist should apply at that time.</P>
