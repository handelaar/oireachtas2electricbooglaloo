      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Maastricht Treaty provides that a conference of representatives of the member states of the European Union will be convened in 1996 to examine those provisions of the Treaty for which revision is provided. These provisions include the Common Foreign and Security Policy, the decision making powers of the European Parliament, the Union's legislative procedures and the structure of the Treaty.  The 1993 December Brussels European Council and the informal Foreign Minister's meeting in March 1994 agenda added the issues of the relative voting strengths of the member states in the Council and the number of members of the Commission to the agenda of the Intergovernmental Conference. Member states and the commission are free to seek to include other <Col N="198" /> items on the agenda of the Intergovernmental Conference.  The agenda will undoubtedly be influenced by the fact that the Intergovernmental Conference will be expected to set down institutional arrangements for a Union considerably enlarged beyond its current complement of 15.</P>
      <P>The Treaty provides that the Intergovernmental Conference should convene in 1996 but the precise date has not yet been decided.  Preparatory work is underway.  At Union level this work currently involves the preparation of separate reports, by the Council, the Commission and the European Parliament, on the operation to date of the Maastricht Treaty.  These reports will form an input into the work of the Reflection Group the establishment of which was agreed at the June 1994 Corfu European Council.  This group has a mandate to examine and elaborate on ideas for change to the Treaty which could be considered at the Intergovernmental Conference.  The Reflection Group will be composed of representatives of Ministers for Foreign Affairs, a representative of the President of the Commission and two representatives of the European Parliament.  Ireland will be represented by Deputy Gay Mitchell, the Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs.  The group will officially commence its work in June next under Spanish chairmanship.</P>
      <P>The preparation of Irish policy positions on the 1996 Intergovernmental Conference is being co-ordinated by the interdepartmental European co-ordination committee.  This committee is chaired by Deputy Michell in his capacity as Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs in my Department.  A sub-group of the committee has been established to deal specifically with preparations for the Intergovernmental Conference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government will make the final decision in regard to Ireland's position on the items arising at the Intergovernmental Conference.  Our general approach to the Intergovernmental Conference negotiations will be to <Col N="199" /> equip the Union institutionally and otherwise to meet the challenges of the 21st century, including further enlargement, and in the process to ensure that Ireland's vital national interests are fully protected.  Specific Irish policy positions on which work is already under way will be developed by the Government as the agenda emerges.  I would, however, like to make the following points at this stage: the balance between the large and small member states and between the institutions of the Union in the Community under the present Treaty provisions has served both Ireland and the Union well; in line with our commitment in the policy agreement, <i>A Government of Renewal,</i> we will put any outcome that would involve Ireland's participation in a common defence policy to the people in a referendum; Ireland will oppose proposals which suggest that the smaller member states should forego their commissioner or should share commissioner posts on a rotating basis; a single speed approach to further European integration should be maintained as far as possible; there may however continue to be instances, such as with economic and monetary union, which would permit a differential approach, in terms of timing, to a common objective; the question of the democratic legitimacy of the Union will have to be addressed at the Intergovernmental Conference but not in a way that would adversely affect the positions of small states or dilute the power of the Commission.</P>
    <P>Ireland will hold the Presidency of the EU in the second half of 1996.  The Intergovernmental Conference is due to be in session during this period and Ireland will therefore be chairing the conference at that time.  The Government will ensure that the ongoing planning for the smooth operation of our Presidency will encompass our responsibility for participating in and chairing the Intergovernmental Conference.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Taoiseach back and I am delighted he has <Col N="200" /> recovered from his recent illness.  While I accept what he said about Ireland joining a common defence pact &mdash; that it would be put to a vote of the people &mdash; does he believe that we need a common European defence arrangement and that Ireland should be part of it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The more rapidly one moves towards political union it is implicit that one must consider the question of defending whatever political achievement has been gained.  The Government is committed to ensuring that any decision on that matter, in the final analysis, will be for the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>How will the Government arrive at this view in relation to the issue?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter will require much careful thought by all the members of the Government.  Each of the parties composing the Government will have their own insights to contribute to the discussion but it is clearly the case it is in the interests of the European Union that it should function in a consensual way and that Ireland should contribute towards consensus building within the Union.  That will be the approach of our endeavours in this regard.  There are a huge number of issues liable to be considered at the Intergovernmental Conference and the question of defence is only one of those.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Taoiseach is aware that the Swedish Government has reaffirmed its commitment to military neutrality and that the British Government has submitted a paper to NATO envisaging continuing neutrality by certain European Union countries. In this regard, will the Taoiseach take into account the long term interests for this country and will he agree we should not forego our neutrality, particularly if <Col N="201" /> options are being considered that would be useful for Ireland even at this stage?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It really all depends on what way the European Union will develop.  Will it become a political Union or will it be a loose confederation of states?  Clearly, in the latter case there is no need to consider defensive arrangements but, as I indicated in my reply to Deputy Harney, the more closely federalised the European Union becomes, the greater the obligation to consider issues that might not have to be considered in another context.  The policy of neutrality has served this country well in many respects and it is not something to be lightly cast aside.  The fact that the Government specifically committed itself to making no change in this policy without the agreement of the people in a referendum is testament to the Government's recognition of that.  I thank the two Deputies for their good wishes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome the Taoiseach back to the House.  I wish to ask him three questions on the common defence policy.  First, are there any proposals before the Government to join the NATO partnership for peace?  The Tánaiste made a number of statements recently in which he appears to be nudging us towards a formal alliance with NATO.  Second, I accept we have had a number of elitist type seminars for specialists in the field of European affairs recently but are there any proposals to inform the general public on what the Government has in mind on the question of a common defence for Europe?  Will the Taoiseach agree that there should be a proper debate in this House?  Third&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;on the Intergovernmental Conference in 1996, will the Taoiseach agree that one of our key Presidency priorities should be with regard to the developing world, the need to bridge the gap between richer and poorer states and the role that the EU can play in regard to that issue?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that our commitment to developing countries is very important in this context and I am pleased that one of the major revisions made by the incoming Government to the Estimates we inherited from the previous Government was the provision of a substantial increase in our bilateral commitment to Third World aid, a clear indication of our commitment in that regard.  In regard to the seminars on foreign policy, I gather the composition of these was set at the time the Deputy's party was in Government.  The series of seminars was already underway when we came into office so I have no doubt any élitism involved would have been contributed to by the Deputy's own discussions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I am referring to the follow-up stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>However, he has made a valid point and I understand from his successor, the Minister of State, Deputy Mitchell, that there has been a substantial input by members of the general public to these seminars.  I agree with the Deputy that we should try to involve more members of the public in these seminars.  One of the lessons of the difficulties in other countries in regard to the Maastricht Treaty was the perception that the public had not been involved in the process.  I agree with the Deputy also that there should be debates on the matter here in the <Col N="203" /> House.  One of the ways in which the public can be informed is through political controversy on the subject.  I hope, for example, that when I return from the next summit we will have a fairly full discussion on the issues at that stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a separate question that should be addressed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  We are talking here about the Intergovernmental Conference and the matter the Deputy refers to has nothing to do with that.  I suggest he puts down a separate question on that subject.</P>

      <P>While I accept that this is only one of the issues that will be raised at the Intergovernmental Conference, given that Ireland is chairing the conference and the difficulties that exist within the Government and the country on this issue, does the Government intend putting forward a view in advance of that conference?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach accept that, given the existence of the National Economic and Social Forum the roles of these two bodies overlap? Will he give any consideration to examining the terms of reference of the National Economic and Social Council before reappointing it?  Also, has the Taoiseach held discussions with the National Organisation for the Unemployed and the Council for the Status of Women in relation to their participation in this body?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer is &ldquo;yes&rdquo; to the first part of the question.  In regard to the second part, that is one of the matters we have been considering in the past few months in looking at this issue and we will be making an announcement on the matter of rendering consistent and avoiding overlap between the terms of reference of the various bodies.  In regard to meetings with the INOU and the Council for the Status of Women, to the best of my knowledge I have had no request for any meeting from these bodies but I am examining the question of ensuring that their viewpoints are represented in the NESC.  It is one of the matters on which I expect to be making an announcement shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach accept that over the years NESC has done a tremendous job and has been of great assistance to successive Governments? Will he ensure that any broadening of the representation of NESC will not diminish its objectivity?  I believe NESC will not be able to carry out the role of bringing the social partners together, considering the future and coming to conclusions if it is amalgamated with the other body.  That body deals with current problems and analysis of those problems whereas NESC <Col N="205" /> brings together the partners to consider the future, which is a separate exercise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not proposing amalgamation at this stage but simply a tidying up of the respective terms of reference of the two bodies.  There may be a case in the long run for amalgamation but that is not an immediate proposal. Of course I acknowledge the value of the work of NESC.  It has been extremely helpful in providing a foundation document for negotiation for the successive Programmes for Government and so on.  No change I would make in the composition of NESC would in any way interfere with its objectivity.  The changes relate mainly to concerns such as those expressed by Deputy Harney about the need to ensure that groups not directly represented at present have their viewpoints heard at NESC.</P>
      <P>NESC has done very valuable work but it is important that its report be phrased in very accessible language. From my reading of NESC reports, there is a tendency for them to be phrased in very difficult academic prose which is not accessible to members of the general public.  I hope the new NESC will take account of the fact that if its reports are to have impact they must be read by a broad mass of the public which requires a degree of simplicity and brevity in presentation.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 and 4 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="206" /> The report of the Review Group on the Office of the Attorney General was published on 21 February, following approval in principle by the Government to implement its recommendations and to make the necessary additional resources available to the office.  Copies of the report and Government press release thereon were placed in the Oireachtas Library and made available to Members of both Houses.</P>
    <P>Provision has been made in this year's Estimate for the Attorney General's Office for additional expenditure in the region of £800,000 in connection with the reorganisation of that office.  The bulk of this expenditure will be used towards the information technology programme mentioned in the report and extra staffing for the office on both the professional and technical-administrative side.</P>
    <P>The Department of Finance has already provided expert assistance in preparing an information technology plan for the office.  Sanction has also been given to fill the posts of legal librarian, systems manager, systems analyst and the appointment of an additional senior draftsman in the parliamentary draftsman's office.  A competition for the post of legal librarian is already underway.</P>
    <P>As regards the time frame for change, it is not at this stage feasible to give an accurate indication.  The Attorney General will, however, give progress reports to the Government after six months and again after 12 months.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach accept the report makes clear that extra staff are needed in the parliamentary draftsman's office?  Is it intended by the Government to recruit those extra staff and, if so, how many and over approximately what time period?  Will the Taoiseach agree it would be a good idea to contract out some of the parliamentary draftsman's work to the private sector in view of the fact that the report implicitly recognises that this would be cost effective and efficient?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>One senior draftsman is being appointed and a number of other posts will be filled in the office generally.  It is a matter for the Attorney General on a pragmatic basis to examine the contracting out of work to the private sector.  We are also examining the possibility of the development of specialised drafting capacity within individual Departments which have a heavy legislative workload.  It is the intention of the Attorney General to consider the best practice in regard to private sector law office management techniques and the operation of equivalent public offices overseas, and to conduct a strategic management initiative study within the office of the Attorney General in order that the resources available can be deployed to maximum effect.</P>

      <P>At the sub-committee's deliberations it was stated that in the region of 3,000 cases currently before the courts were being dealt with by the Attorney General's office, not to mention all the other responsibilities, including draftsmanship.  Will the Taoiseach accept it would be better to have an office dealing with defence of legal cases through the courts on behalf of the State and a separate office for the parliamentary draftsman?  One conclusion of the committee was that the Attorney General's office is overworked and understaffed.</P>

      <P>As the House is aware we are taking steps to improve staffing levels in the office and also to improve the systems of operation of the office so as to get better output from the staff employed there.  The Attorney General, who from his previous private practice is extremely experienced in the management of a sophisticated legal office, will bring his expertise to bear on how best to organise the office.

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will, but there are risks involved in having a multiplicity of separate drafting facilities.  There is a need to ensure uniformity of drafting of legislation from the point of view of practitioners and the public.  There is much to be said for concentrating resources as it gives greater flexibility to move people from one area of work to another, depending on where the pressure is, a factor that needs to be taken into account by the Attorney General when he is considering Deputy Dermot Ahern's suggestion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Following from Deputy Dermot Ahern's comment on the duality of the Attorney General's role, does the Taoiseach agree there will always be a risk of a conflict of interest between the Attorney General's role as guardian of the national interest and constitutional rights and the separate role of political adviser to the Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the essence of involvement in public life is the management of conflicts of interest.  You cannot create a situation where all potential conflicts of interest or judgement are eliminated for office holders.  It is inherent in holding office that there are tensions involved in one's respective responsibilities.  At the end of the day one has to rely on the integrity of the people concerned.  I have the utmost confidence in the Attorney General and in his ability to recognise the respective importance of the different roles he has to play at different times.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach referred to various studies and research into making the Attorney General's office more efficient, but while this is happening the volume of legislation is growing. Does the Taoiseach agree that the appointment of one extra person in the <Col N="210" /> parliamentary draftsman's office is pitifully inadequate to deal with the continuous growth in the volume of legislation being processed?  The matter could be resolved, to some extent at least, if some of the work could be farmed out.  Will he give me a straight answer on whether the Government will decide to farm out some work?  Will solicitors be eligible for positions in the advisory section of the office of Attorney General and the parliamentary draftsman, which at present are confined to barristers?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already answered the question on additional resources for the parliamentary draftsman's office.  If the Attorney General needs additional draftspersons, he can so recommend.  As I have said the Government has provided an additional £800,000 this year for the Attorney General's office.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor) Mervyn Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 30 and 32 together.</P>
      <P>I can confirm that it is the Government's intention to hold a referendum on divorce in 1995 as promised in its policy document, <i>A Government of</i><i>Renewal.</i></P>
      <P>I have made clear to the House on several occasions that the timing of the referendum would have to take account of the High Court's decision that is under appeal to the Supreme Court concerning the constitutionality of the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act, 1989.  We now know that the Supreme Court has scheduled the hearing of the case before it to begin on 25 April next.  The House will appreciate that, since the 1989 Act provisions will influence any divorce legislation, the Government's decision on the form of that legislation may have to take into account what the Supreme Court has to say about those provisions.  The provisions in question concern the important area of the grounds for a separation and the type of property orders that can be made in support of dependent spouses and children following the granting of a decree of separation by the courts.</P>
      <P>The Government accepts that a decision on the date of the referendum must await the outcome of the Supreme Court's deliberations on the 1989 Act case.  A date in the autumn is now likely to be most feasible for a referendum, assuming that the Supreme Court has given its ruling well in advance of that time.  The timescale for a referendum must allow for about eight weeks or so between publication of a Bill, its passage through both Houses and the date of the referendum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In reply to questions on 31 January 1995 I gave details of the legislative and administrative measures which have been, and are being, put in place for the protection and support of spouses and children following marriage breakdown. <Col N="214" /> Many of those measures are important in their own right and demonstrate the importance which this Government and previous Governments have attached to this area.  The current measures are the Family Law Bill, 1994, now at Committee Stage in the Seanad, having been passed by this House, the Civil Legal Aid Bill, 1995, also at Committee Stage in the Seanad and a domestic violence Bill which I propose to publish in the near future.  In addition, substantial funding has been provided in the 1995 Estimates for mediation, marriage guidance and counselling services and legal aid.  Provisions dealing with the tax aspects of marital breakdown have also been initiated by way of amendments to the Family Law Bill and important legislative proposals to ensure that the social welfare aspects of divorce are addressed are being prepared in the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>The main measure required to be brought forward before the referendum is the Bill to amend the Constitution. Various draft amendments were published in the 1992 White Paper on Marital Breakdown and I have on a number of occasions indicated in the House that they are good examples of the different forms that the amendment might take. They should not, however, be regarded as a comprehensive list.  The Cabinet sub-committee on divorce has been considering the possible avenues of approach and when the committee and the Government is in a position to decide on the final proposals, taking into account the Supreme Court's decision, the details will be announced in the normal way by publication of a Bill.</P>
    <P>I propose to publish, in conjunction with publication of the Amendment of the Constitution Bill, the draft of a divorce Bill which would be enacted in the event of a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote in the referendum. That draft Bill will set out the powers which the court would have to make orders in support of spouses and children following the granting of a decree of divorce.  The provisions will, in substance, be the same as provisions <Col N="215" /> which I initiated in the Family Law Bill, 1994 for situations where a foreign decree of divorce is entitled to recognition in the State and they would include provision for orders in relation to maintenance and in relation to all property, be it the family home, a business, a farm or company shares, as well as pensions. The intention is to fully inform the voters about the details of the Government's divorce proposals in the run-up to the referendum.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his comprehensive reply.  What timescale does he envisage for holding the divorce referendum?  The hearing will be held on 25 April and the judgment will probably not be delivered for a month after that.  It will take some time to consider it before a Bill is put before the House.  Does that mean the Bill will not be before us until the autumn session? If so, does the Minister propose to publish any of the measures in connection with the Bill in the summer period?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not in a position to be more specific about the date beyond saying that the referendum will be held in 1995.  There is the imponderable of the Supreme Court's deliberations &mdash; the hearing is listed for 25 April and may take a few days.  It is difficult to say when the judgement will be given.  It could be shortly afterwards or it may take some time.  It is the wish and intention of the Government to hold the referendum as soon as practicable in 1995. The other legislation is on course.  The tax provisions are dealt with in the Family Law Bill.  The Minister for Social Welfare will publish a Bill soon dealing with the social welfare aspects of divorce which will provide that no person will be at the loss of any entitlement as a result of the introduction of divorce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has given a different timescale from heretofore. How soon can we expect a draft of the proposed legislation?  We can see from what happened recently the difficulties <Col N="216" /> that can arise if people do not have the proposed legislation to discuss.  How often has the Cabinet sub-committee met to discuss this?  Is there a greater degree of co-operation among the members of the sub-committee than previously?  The Minister should say if he expects to be able to give a final date when the appeal has been heard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot give a commitment on any specific date within any time frame.  The Supreme Court's judgement on the appeal in the F case, depending on its substance, will be examined and considered.  I assure the Deputy that co-operation among the Government partners on this issue is firm, equally as firm as when, with my former colleagues in Government, Fianna Fáil, we were making preparations for the divorce referendum under that programme for Government. I am pleased to note the ongoing messages of support from the Leader of Fianna Fáil in connection with the divorce issue.  I look forward to working with Deputy Ahern and Fianna Fáil, with the Progressive Democrats and other parties in the House in maintaining all party support for the necessary provision of divorce in this country. I request Deputies to be patient about the details.  We must ensure the best possible parameters are provided for. Work on those measures is at an advance stage in the Department and will be announced at the appropriate time, in accordance with the usual practice of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>We were told that the Social Welfare Bill, published yesterday, would contain these measures. Most of the measures were ready and only needed final decisions to be taken on them.  It is disappointing that these were not included in the Bill because we are anxious to get on with that job. What will the Minister do if the case is lost?  Has he considered alternative possibilities?  Would he be ready to move without delay in such areas as exclusion orders which is one of the <Col N="217" /> main areas of difficulty regarding property rights?  Since the issues are fairly clear, it should be possible to have an alternative strategy ready.  That might be helpful in progressing towards a referendum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>It is inappropriate to speculate on the outcome of the Supreme Court case.  We must await the judgment.  The judgment and its implications will be examined by me, my Department and the Government and the matter will progress after that.  As regards the Social Welfare Bill no one knows better than the Deputy the position on the preparation of that legislation when he left Government.  No commitment was given that the social welfare necessities for divorce would be included in the main Social Welfare Bill. The Minister for Social Welfare is preparing a separate Bill to make provision for the social welfare needs.  That Bill will be introduced and passed in good time before the referendum.</P>

      <P>The Minister referred to increased funding for counselling, mediation and so on.

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of expenditure by another Minister is a matter for that Minister.  Perhaps Deputy Keogh might table a question to whoever it is she has in mind, when I have no doubt she will receive a very forceful and adequate answer.  As far as marriage counselling is concerned, I might point <Col N="218" /> out that the funding made available to my Department for that purpose during 1995 has never been surpassed in the history of the State &mdash; £750,000, which sum has been warmly welcomed by all marriage counselling organisations who have been able to substantially expand the marriage counselling and mediation services they have been providing.  It represents a very substantial increase in that funding &mdash; a similar sum was provided last year.  More people have been taken on and training schemes have been put in place, all of which is an indication that the Government strongly supports the institution of marriage and, by reason of the provision of these funds, is doing everything within its power to support all marriages that can be maintained or saved.  The Government is very much putting its money where its mouth is by making such funds available.  I want to pay tribute to the various counselling agencies, for the most part voluntary, who carry out that work to very great effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>Bearing in mind that a sum of £750,000 is rightly being directed toward these services, would the Minister agree that another £200,000 would be appreciated?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The creation of a Department of Equality and Law Reform has enabled the Government to profile equality policy in a priority format which might otherwise not be achieved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Prior to the setting up of my Department the Minister for Labour had responsibility for gender equality issues <Col N="219" /> relating to employment.  This entailed not only formulation and implementation of anti-discrimination employment equality law but, in addition, promotion of equal opportunities policy.</P>
    <P>My Department has taken over these responsibilities and, in line with Government policy, the role of the Department goes beyond gender equality to address a whole range of non-gender groups based on age, religion, sexual orientation, people with disability, race/nationality/ethnic origin and membership of the travelling community.</P>
    <P>My intention is not only to improve employment equality legislation as regards gender but also to introduce statutory and non-statutory measures to expedite equal opportunity progress.</P>
    <P>The equal status Bill, which I also intend to introduce, will deal with discrimination in non-employment areas on a number of grounds including gender, marital or parental status, sexual orientation, religion, age, disability, race, colour, nationality and national or ethnic origin and membership of the travelling community.  The areas in question include education, the provision of goods, services and facilities, and the disposal of accommodation or other premises.  The legislation will help to promote equality and combat the exclusion of some groups of people from certain areas of Irish life.</P>
    <P>A committee chaired by my Department monitors the implementation of the recommendations of the Second Commission on the Status of Women and a second annual progress report on this will be published in the first half of the year.</P>
    <P>My Department also services a range of international activity on equality matters. In 1993, I established the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities.  The commission's task is to advise the Government on practical measures necessary to ensure that people with a disability can participate, to the fullest extent of their potential, in economic, social and cultural life.  The <Col N="220" /> commission is also examining the current situation of people with a disability and the organisation and adequacy of existing services, both public and voluntary, to meet their needs.  It will make recommendations setting out necessary changes to ensure that the needs of people with disabilities are met in a cohesive, comprehensive and cost-effective way.</P>
    <P>Last year, the commission engaged in the most comprehensive consultative exercise with people with disabilities in the history of the State.  It organised well-attended public meetings throughout the country at which people with disabilities, parents, carers, service-providers and other interested parties told the commission directly what changes they believed were needed to address what they saw as inequalities in relation to their situation.  The commission has also received over 500 submission from the public.</P>
    <P>The commission is due to present its report by the end of the year.  I will give it very careful consideration with a view to bringing proposals to Government, based on its recommendations.</P>
    <P>In July 1993, I established a Task Force on the Travelling Community.  It is examining a large number of important and complex issues which impact on travellers in policy areas such as accommodation, health, housing and employment and training opportunities.</P>
    <P>The task force is expected to finish its work within a matter of months.  I look forward to receiving its final report and to considering, in consultation with ministerial colleagues, the views and recommendations contained therein with a view to removing some of the inequalities in treatment which travellers experience at present.</P>
    <P>I am determined to improve access to the courts and to other means of resolving disputes, particularly in the family law area.  In the 1995 Estimate for my Department I have secured significant funding for legal aid, marriage counselling and guidance services, and for mediation, all with a view to expansion and development in these areas.  I have <Col N="221" /> also recently initiated the Civil Legal Aid Bill which puts the scheme of civil legal aid and advice on a statutory footing and, in effect, guarantees the future of that scheme.</P>
    <P>In addition, I am providing for other developments designed to improve access to justice.  The Family Law Bill, 1994, for example, contains important new provisions in relation to jurisdiction of the courts.  The Bill provides a comprehensive framework within which extensive remedies can be secured through the courts by spouses and children who face the consequences of marriage breakdown.  The District and Circuit Courts will have new jurisdiction to order maintenance, by way of lump sums and secured payments and the District Court, for the first time, will have jurisdiction to make orders to protect a spouse from having the family home sold over his or her head.  At present, that jurisdiction is confined to the higher courts.</P>
    <P>While all Government Ministers share responsibilities for promoting employment equality policy in their respective Departments agencies, and areas of competence, I will continue to monitor and support any initiatives and developments that can achieve progress.</P>
    <P>I am reluctant to attempt identifying priorities, since each area is a priority in its own right.  There is also the consideration that any order of priorities requires constant review and adjustment, in the light of changing circumstances, particularly where legislation is involved.</P>
    <P>I prefer to adopt a pragmatic approach by maintaining pressure on all fronts, with a view to making whatever progress is feasible at any given time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the Minister said he was prepared to adopt a pragmatic approach but is slow to identify priorities, would he agree that the latter objective, that of identifying priorities, is particularly important, which was why I asked whether he would list even his top five priorities, for instance, for achievement within this year?  Following <Col N="222" /> on the allocation of resources in the budget, the question of priority arises, which is why it is important that some priorities be clearly specified; otherwise, the Minister's work will be very high in aspiration, as it is, but low in achievement since he has said he is dependent on other Ministers, who have their respective responsibilities, to carry out this work.  Would he agree that is where the great danger obtains?  Will he reexamine the overall position, formulate a mission statement, present it to the House, specifying a number of priorities which he failed to do in his reply?  I ask him not to await reports before insisting on action of a practical kind.  For instance, the Minister said he will await recommendations on people with disabilities, travellers and other groups. Will he set out the priorities for achievement by the Government as a whole, otherwise many of his excellent aspirations will not be achieved?</P>

      <P>The Deputy is suggesting that I should in some way organise the affairs and responsibilities of my Department on the lines of some type of PR election with a No. 1, 2, 3 and 4 priority, but that is not how I see my responsibility.  I regard the range of policy objectives allocated to my Department by the Government as matters of major importance and I do not see it as part or parcel of my role to prioritise people with disabilities over women or discrimination on the grounds of race, religion, colour or membership of the travelling community over another area. Those are important key priorities and they are being actively worked on and progressed in my Department.  I assure the Deputy that it is not my intention to await reports before taking action in important fields and I have given good indication that I am doing that in a number of areas.  I informed the House, for example, that employment equality legislation is at an advanced stage of preparation without waiting for the production of the report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities and so on.  That legislation will protect <Col N="223" /> and advance the interests of people with disabilities as well as the other disadvantaged groups I mentioned in my reply. Likewise, the equal status Bill is not awaiting the outcome of any report, it is progressing with all possible speed. Those very important priority areas have the support of the Government and it is my intention to advance them on a broad front as quickly as possible. Much has been achieved, but much remains to be done and I look forward to the co-operation of my colleagues in Opposition in securing those ends.</P>

      <P>The danger is that we will have a great deal of law and a dearth of practical progress and that is why I suggest setting priorities.  As I deal with people on a regular basis in the Eastern Health Board, I am aware there is a dearth of resources for basic facilities and equipment, such as wheelchairs, commodes and other services and facilities. I accept there may be an increased demand for them, but unless we deal with some of those matters as a priority and ensure that people with disabilities get practical assistance, the excellent work being undertaken by the Minister in the area of law reform will be of no immediate value to people on the ground and that is why I ask the Minister to ensure that he and his fellow Ministers give priority to those areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of resources in the Eastern Health Board or any other health board area is a matter for the health board concerned and the Minister for Health.  I do not wish to comment on any individual case that may have come to Deputy Woods's notice in connection with the provision of certain equipment.  I am involved in a much broader, stronger operation than that, to provide on a broad front for all cases of discrimination covering the wide range of areas that involve people with disabilities, women and other disadvantaged groups and to secure their position by way of legislation that will give them rights in connection with <Col N="224" /> employment, promotional prospects, supply of goods and services and so on. That is a key responsibility of my Department.  The question of resources for individual health boards is another matter, but I intend to give rights to people in those categories by way of guaranteed legislation written into the Statute Book.</P>

      <Quest>in view of the Keegan report on the appointment of a solicitor in charge in the Monaghan office of the Legal Aid Board, if he has satisfied himself that the appointment was properly made; if he will publish the report; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor) Mervyn Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor)</NameTxt>
      <P>The terms of reference of the Keegan report referred to by the Deputy were &ldquo;to review all matters pertaining to the appointment of the Solicitor-in-Charge in Monaghan Law Centre in order to establish whether the appointment was carried out in accordance with public service standards.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The background to the review was set out by me in the House in the course of debate on the Adjournment on 25 January 1995 and I also dealt with the matter <Col N="225" /> in the course of supplementary questions on 31 January 1995.  I undertook on both occasions to give information about the outcome of the review.  I honoured that commitment, immediately after consultations with the Legal Aid Board, by arranging to have a copy of the report placed in the Oireachtas Library on 28 February, 1995.</P>
    <P>I am delighted to be able to inform the House that the Keegan report dated 6 February 1995, has found the appointment in question to be based entirely on merit.  Another main finding in the report is that while Mr. Keegan was satisfied that, in all essentials, the actual recruitment process of preliminary interview and final interview for solicitor-in-charge posts, as a result of which the Monaghan post was filled, was carried out in accordance with normal public service standards, the filing and surrounding paperwork was haphazard and unsatisfactory.  He reports it would be an understatement to say that the filing and paperwork lacked transparency. There was, he states, no coherent competition file and that it should have been a straightforward operation to establish the process which led to the Monaghan appointment.  That was not the case and, if it was, he says, no great problem would have arisen in the first place when my Department sought basic information about the appointment.</P>
    <P>A series of recommendations have been made by him regarding the way in which the recruitment process could be improved by the board and how relations, which he detected as being poor between management, the law centre solicitors and the unions representing them, could be improved.</P>
    <P>While I welcome the finding that the Monaghan appointment was in order, I am concerned at the criticism levelled at the personnel management system operated by the board and the extent to which the recruitment process which they have operated to fill senior solicitor posts does not appear to have the confidence of solicitor staff and the unions. <Col N="226" /> These are matters which must now be addressed by the board and its management staff.  Guidelines have been established in the report on how to go about matters in the future to improve the situation. I have asked the board to arrange for early implementation of the recommendations in the report and I look forward, as I am sure the House will, to progress in the matter.  The board has informed me that it has no difficulties in principle with the various conclusions and recommendations contrained in the report.</P>
    <P>There are two further matters which I should like to mention.  First, I wish to say in respect of the person who was appointed to the Monaghan post that I can understand, and I regret, any distress or inconvenience which recent events, including media coverage, may have caused to that person.  The media coverage, to which I referred in earlier debates in the House, was of a kind which distorted the facts.  Those who sought the publicity clearly had no regard for the effect it might have on the appointee.  The aim, it appears, was to get across a version of events to question the need for a review, to question my authority to order the review and to question even the standing of the person carrying out the review.  The appointee should not, in any event have been expected to carry the burden of the publicity involved and I hope that those responsible now accept and realise the damage that was done by their actions.</P>
    <P>Second, I want to place on the record of the House my appreciation of Mr. Keegan for a job thoroughly well done. I have no doubt that the board and its management staff and the unions will benefit from the very clear-sighted views and recommendations he has set out in his report.</P>
    <P>Copies of the report have been furnished to the unions representing the law centre solicitors.  It was, of course, their concern about the Monaghan appointment which initially led me to make inquiries about the appointment and to eventually decide on an independent review of the case by Mr. Keegan. <Col N="227" /> A copy has also been furnished to the solicitor-in-charge in Monaghan and, as indicated earlier, a copy has been placed in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that if he and his Department had taken the trouble to establish the facts when the complaint was made none of this need have happened?  The report vindicates the person appointed and the procedures used in the appointment and it raises a side issue, that of the filing and paperwork.  It also explains how that filing and paperwork was complex.  A posts and B posts were considered at the same time and this is what led to the complications.  Also, the Minister had requested the board to appoint a substantial number of people in a relatively short time and at the same time build up a great deal of extra activity.  Why did it all happen in the first instance?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Why did this incident occur?  A query from a trade union usually comes through the board or the Department in question who will then respond.  In this case two faxes were sent on 20 December 1994 from two separate unions to the principal officer in the Minister's Department.  At the same time letters were sent to the Legal Aid Board by post on the eve of Christmas. The first letter, however it happened, arrived on 23 December; the second letter did not arrive until after 29 December.  There seems to be somethings suspicious about the way in which this part of the inquiry was conducted. Will the Minister indicate whether there was any communication between the unions and his Department, or any official in his Department, or if they were invited to communicate with the Department?  Clearly they communicated with the Department before putting the query to the board.  Even natural justice would require that the query or the complaint be put to a person and <Col N="228" /> that the person be given an opportunity to reply and to take it from there.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">

      <P>Who advised the Minister to act so precipitously and why?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>There was no prior communication on the matter of the Monaghan appointment between my Department and the unions.  The first information we in the Department had on the issue was when the two communications were received from the two unions concerned.  The communications from the unions were not, as Deputy Woods suggests, queries; they were not seeking information.  They were correspondence items sent to us by fax alleging that the appointment of the Monaghan solicitor was not made in accordance with the proper procedures. Having considered that matter very quickly with my officials, we rapidly came to the conclusion that there were allegations from the two unions representing solicitors' staff in all the law centres and that they could not be ignored.  The allegations had to be taken seriously and the proper way to deal with them was to appoint an independent person to investigate whether they were properly based.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department had no information as to the nature of the appointment or the circumstances surrounding it.  That required the securing of the papers in connection with it.  Mr. Keegan was duly appointed as a suitably qualified person to carry out the investigation.  The papers in connection with the appointment were secured for him.  He examined them and I am happy to report he found the procedures in order and that the solicitor in question was properly appointed.  He went on to say that he found relations were poor between the management of the Legal Aid Board and the solicitors in the various law centres throught the country and with their unions.  He also found that their paperwork, which is important for <Col N="229" /> record purposes and the purposes of transparency, to put it mildly, left much to be desired.  Since then I have communicated with the board and they have agreed to examine all those matters and to tighten up those procedures.</P>
    <P>Deputy Woods is right in one matter. During the past couple of years I asked the Legal Aid Board to take on a substantial number of solicitors, support staff, clerks, clerical assistants and solicitor's apprentices and to rent new premises for the new centres which have been set up.  As the House is aware there has been a major expansion of the entire legal aid service; the number working in the law centres has doubled since I took office.  I accept that that placed a great burden on the Legal Aid Board, to whom I pay tribute for carrying out their functions in an extremely competent and efficient manner.  I hope the issue has been clarified and that the important and necessary paperwork in connection with these appointments will be tightened up.  I hope the Legal Aid Board, and its centres, will continue from here on to work in an ever better manner.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it true, as we read in our newspapers over the weekend, that the solicitor in the Monaghan office has offered her resignation?  If so, will the Minister ask her to reconsider her position? Does he accept that a gross injustice has been done to her in these circumstances and that she has, in effect, been badly treated?  Consequently, will he try to make amends to the person in question?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I have expressed regret that such distress and inconvenience was caused to that person.  As I said earlier the distress, which was totally unnecessary, was caused by those people who brought the matter to the attention of the media and highlighted it.  I do not know who they were.  I am pleased that that person's position has been totally vindicated by the findings <Col N="230" /> of the Keegan investigation.  My Department has not yet received formal notification of her resignation although I understand a letter to that effect has been sent to the Legal Aid Board.  I have no problem about approaching her to ask her to reconsider her position.  No person would be more pleased than I if she decided to do that.  I understand, however, that she has received an offer and is taking up employment in the legal department of one of the Departments of State.  She may well be committed in that regard.</P>
      <P>The action taken in my Department was prompt as it had to be, following on the allegations made by the two trade unions involved.  It was in the interest of the solicitor concerned that an independent inquiry was conducted which thoroughly vindicated her position.  An inquiry was required to vindicate her position and it could not have been done in any other way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know if the Minister realises that he may be writing history on this issue.  My recollection is that this matter came to public notice because of the rather heavy-handed way in which this whole affair was dealt with initially by the Minister in that files were seized from the office &mdash; whether or not they were pertinent is a different issue.  Subsequently the House was informed that a separate inquiry was to be set up.  The Minister diverted attention from the difficulties on the seizure of files by informing the House of a separate inquiry.  Will the Minister agree that it is disingenuous to blame the media for causing this young woman's distress when it was initially caused by his Department?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I most certainly do not accept that assertion.  With respect, if anybody is rewriting history it is Deputy Keogh.  There was no heavy-handed action by my Department in connection with this matter.  My Department received allegations from two trade unions representing the staff of the law centres which called into question the <Col N="231" /> propriety of an appointment in Monaghan and I immediately arranged for an independent inquiry into them.  I do not see anything high-handed in that action.</P>
      <P>Deputy Keogh should be careful about the emotive language she uses. For example, she said that files were seized in the office of the Legal Aid Board.  That is the kind of emotive language used in some of the press reports which led to the distress of the solicitor in the Monaghan law centre.  What happened was quite different.  Having set up an inquiry into this matter, an official from my Department went to the Legal Aid Board and was given the files, by arrangement with the Chief Executive Office.  References to the seizure of documents gave rise to paranoia in the press about the investigation, which was carried out in an entirely proper manner. This is evident from the fact that it totally vindicated and exonerated the way in which the appointment was made.  That is precisely what happened and my good friend, Deputy Keogh, should have the good grace to accept that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenneally</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that this case arose because basic information which was sought from the office in Monaghan was not forthcoming and that the report found that the problem related to filing and paper work which was done in a haphazard manner. Despite the increase in the number of staff in Legal Aid Board offices, this problem could arise in any office.  The Minister said that there were problems with the Civil Legal Aid Board and the management of the various offices.  Why was the person in Monaghan singled out?  We are not being told why it was decided to single out this person who has been vindicated in the report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="232" />
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Kenneally completely misunderstands the position. Allegations were submitted to my Department by the two trade unions who represent the solicitors and staff that there was an impropriety in the manner in which this person was appointed as the solicitor to head the Monaghan law office; in other words, that the normal transparent and open Civil Service appointment and promotion procedures had not been adhered to in this case.  I had to check these allegations.  I could have decided to ignore them and tell the unions I was not interested, that even though they represent all the people who work in the board they know nothing about it.  If I had done that the Deputies would be on much firmer ground in questioning my action.  I could not treat lightly allegations of that nature.  I did not know whether they were ill founded or well founded and the only way I could ascertain the truth in the fair and objective manner was to send in an independent referee who had experience in these matters.  This was duly done by arrangement with the Legal Aid Board and the papers in connection with the appointment were secured and examined. While, happily the appointment was found not to be in breach of Civil Service regulations, the report went on to say that relations between the board, the unions and the solicitors who work there were not good and it made certain suggestions on how these could be improved.  It also indicated that the paper work on these procedures which are normal in all Departments were not being kept in a proper manner and it made suggestions on how these could be tightened up.  Those recommendations have been brought to the attention of the board which has agreed to examine them.</P>

I very much regret that the Monaghan solicitor has resigned from her position.  I will communicate with her and ask her to reconsider her decision.  There is no reason for her to resign unless she wishes to do so.  I am pleased that she has been vindicated.  I do not know the motivation behind the letters sent to me by the trade unions concerned, SIPTU and MFS, but when the allegations were made I had an obligation to check them.  The Legal Aid Board is funded by taxpayers' money and I am answerable in the House for the operation of the board.  I have a responsibility to the House and its Members to ensure that that expenditure of public money is carried out in accordance with recognised, proper and fair procedures and I discharge that responsibility in a proper and normal manner.  My decision to appoint Mr. Keegan to make the necessary inquiries was the correct one and I accept full responsibility for it.</P>

      <P>I have had consultation with a number of concerned groups on this issue.  This is a complex matter, a good deal of work has been carried out and some exclusions will be necessary. For example, in limited circumstances employers must be allowed some flexibility in regard to recruitment and retirement ages.  The details of the legislation will be published in the House in the usual manner and I will be happy to discuss them with Members on Committee Stage of the Bill.</P>

      <P>The Minister will be aware that I introduced amendments to the Unfair Dismissals Act which precluded an employer from using the pretext of an age as an excuse for dismissal. Notwithstanding this legislation &mdash; which I hope will be a powerful instrument &mdash; there are ways and means by which employers can get around the question of age.  Has the Minister considered any other means of prohibiting discrimination on the grounds of age in recruitment to the public service?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 35 and 45 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The situation in relation to women's representation on State boards is that currently 23.6 per cent of the total serving membership are women and 28.9 per cent of direct Government nominees are women compared to 15 per cent and 17 per cent respectively in 1992.  I monitor the progress being made in appointing women to State boards <Col N="237" /> and I am aware of the need to make further progress in this area.  I am examining ways of making the policy even more effective.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>We appear to be on a sliding timescale in this regard.  When does the Minister propose to have this matter made more effective?  Will he cast his mind back to the time of the appointment of the county enterprise boards when, despite the fact that a directive stated 40 per cent of their membership should be women, many of them did not fill that quota?  The Minister then responsible, Deputy Quinn, dealt with the matter by appointing, say, two women to some of those boards to increase the percentage of female membership. What he should have done was send back the names of the nominees to the nominating bodies and request them to resubmit a list with the correct representation. Does the Minister agree that would be a better way of dealing with the matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of appointments by nominating bodies is always a matter of concern and all possible pressure is brought to bear on such bodies to ensure that the Government's objective of 40 per cent female representation on State bodies is maintained.  Of course the primary responsibility rests on Governments to do that.  I thank Deputy Keogh for asking me to cast my mind back to the establishment of the county enterprise boards.  Will she cast her mind back to the appointment and composition of the Legal Aid Board established by a Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government?  Members will recall that 13 appointments were made to that board and the 13 were men.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's party was party to that decision.  As will be noted from my reply, progress has been made in this area.  For example, in the case of <Col N="238" /> direct Government nominees, the numbers have increased from 17 per cent in 1992 to 28.9 per cent.  When these boards are replaced gender balance representation will improve.  When I replace the Legal Aid Board in a month or two the appointment of 13 males to it will not be repeated.  A minimum of 40 per cent of the new Legal Aid Board, which I will appoint, will be women.</P>

      <P>Many of us do not believe in a forced gender equity balance which the Minister and the Government espouse.  I do not wish to denigrate the Minister, but this is nonsense, social engineering at its worst and old fashioned.  The prime example is the Cabinet.  Two of its 15 members are women, yet the Government forces other bodies and organisations to adhere to the 40 per cent gender balance representation.  The Minister, Deputy Bhreathnach, forced the boards of the regional technical colleges to maintain a 40 per cent female representation on their boards, yet she basks in the glory of there being two women in Cabinet.  What is the Minister's view on the Government's effort to appoint two females to a Cabinet of 15?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government takes the view that to level the playing pitch it is necessary to advance the role of women at all levels of society.  That will <Col N="239" /> lead eventually to more women Members of the Oireachtas and more women Cabinet members.  That would be a desirable development because women have much to offer and, through this kind of legislation, that can and will be achieved.  I hope the Government will have the support of the House in obtaining gender equality at all the power points throughout our society such as State boards, local authorities, the Houses of Parliament and so on.  We fall far behind many other countries in the numbers of women at the power points in our society, and we are the losers for that.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter of balance in the Cabinet is a constitutional one.  A policy of gender equality such as the Government is implementing will create opportunities for women to participate to the fullest possible extent in senior employment positions from which they are often, in practice, debarred at present.  There will also be opportunities for them to participate on State boards where great influence is brought to bear and acquire the experience of participation on an equal basis.  All that will lead in turn to greater participation of women in local authorities, in the Dáil, the Seanad and, ultimately, in the Cabinet.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not have to bludgeon anyone.  The Minister said there may be constitutional difficulties in <Col N="240" /> relation to the Cabinet, but in the appointment of programme managers, the Government had a free hand.  The number of women programme managers is small &mdash; I understand the Minister has employed a programme manager who is a woman.  From among all the women in business, in the public service and throughout society, was it not possible for the Government to find more women to fill the programme manager posts to bring their level to 40 per cent? Was there a shortage? Why was there no attempt to reach that percentage at programme manager level?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Each Minister appoints one programme manager.  The Government's policy on gender balance is that 40 per cent of appointments to State boards etc. should be women.  Each programme manager appointment is a single appointment so the question of gender balance does not arise as it would if each Minister had two programme managers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>The recommendation on quotas on State bodies comes from the Commission on the Status of Women and it was agreed in Government that those recommendations should be accepted, so it is disingenous of the Minister to cite the Civil Legal Aid Board as his only line of defence from time to time.  Can the Minister give a guarantee that eventually, with the reappointment of State boards, 40 per cent of the members will be women? The Minister does not have to stop at 40 per cent &mdash; there could be 50 per cent, 60 per cent, 80 per cent if he wished.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The policy of the Government is that on the appointment of new State boards a minimum of 40 per cent of the members must be women and a minimum of 40 per cent of the members must be men.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Equality and Law Reform</askee>
      <Quest>if he intends to implement any legislation to provide child-care facilities for working parents in order to give these parents opportunities for employment in all sections of the community, particularly women; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of legislating for child care facilities is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Health. This Government is committed to the full implementation of all provisions of the Child Care Act by 1996 including those relating to the regulation of child care facilities.</P>
      <P>I am conscious of the need for child care facilities for working parents to enable them participate in the employment market and my Department is devoting increasing attention to measures which facilitate parents', particularly womens' access to employment.</P>
      <P>Last year I set up a scheme of local child care projects to develop child care facilities in disadvantaged areas administered by local partnership structures. Funding of £1 million for this scheme has been provided by my Department.</P>
      <P>I have been concerned, too, to ensure that programmes run under EU Structural Funds from which Ireland receives significant assistance should also be directed towards the development of child care facilities, in line with the National Development Plan.  The human resources operational programme which was launched last month acknowledges the need to develop child care facilities to support women's access to training and employment schemes, and outlines the child care initiatives which will be undertaken by FÁS and the Department of Education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am pleased to say that FÁS has also indicated its intention to co-operate in my Department's child care schemes, and to assist in developing child care enterprises and community-based child care facilities by using what I hope will be an imaginative approach to targeting child care actions under the Community <Col N="242" /> Employment and Community Training schemes.</P>
    <P>The local urban and rural development programme, launched last month, also provides scope for developing child care facilities.  My Department is actively involved in working with local development structures and partnerships to encourage them to include the development of child care infrastructure in their operations and action plans.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanKenneally" hpid="Mr. Kenneally Mr. Kenneally">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenneally</NameTxt>
      <P>What initiatives will the Minister take in respect of parents who want to work? I have in mind single parents, unmarried mothers, deserted wives or deserted husbands which have become a bigger category in the last few years.  They normally cannot afford child-minding facilities and must be supported and helped to improve their own selfesteem and give their children the same opportunities enjoyed by children in other families.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>That is being tackled at two levels.  One is the important child care initiative developed by my Department for which the sum of £1 million has been provided.  Some 73 child care projects last year &mdash; perhaps there may be more this year &mdash; were approved and are receiving grant assistance from my Department.  It is open to any community organisation on its own or in common with employers to set up a child care project and receive grant assistance from my Department.  In addition, some £8 million has been provided under the human resources operational programme over the period to 1999.  The need to develop child care facilities as part of those programmes is written in under the equality section of that programme for the purpose of supporting women's access to training and employment schemes.  Both initiatives will involve the participation of FÁS and the Department of Education.  FÁS is also involved in the pilot projects organised within the ambit of my Department.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="332" /> Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanKenneally" hpid="Mr. Kenneally Mr. Kenneally">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenneally</NameTxt>
      <P>This measure has all the hallmarks of rushed legislation, a hastily cobbled together Bill which the Minister hopes to pass into law before the electorate can be fully apprised of its contents.  He hopes to take advantage of what he believes is a consensus on this measure, but he is sadly mistaken. He is trying to push out the parameters of abortion information much wider than what the electorate gave approval for and he wants to get it over with quickly as is evidenced by the late sittings of the House this week.  The Minister does not have the stomach to deal with this matter and has probably been advised, as in the words of Macbeth: &ldquo;if it were done when it is done, then it is well it were done quickly.&rdquo;  In Macbeth's case he was about to commit murder most foul, and what the Minister proposes today will result in the deaths of many innocent children unless the legislation is altered radically.</P>
      <P>The absence of Government speakers on this Bill confirms it is being rammed through the House without proper regard for the importance of its contents. The Minister has ample precedent for wanting to rush through legislation on the nod.  Am I not correct in that when he was Minister for Justice some years ago he appeared on national television one Thursday to assure the nation that urgently needed legislation would be put through the Oireachtas the following week, the subject of which legislation was the legalising of slot machines and one armed bandits, after an unfavourable court decision had limited their use?  That is the type of legislation which this Minister considered a priority.  If I hear him talk of Fianna Fáil being influenced by pressure groups, I will excuse him because I know he is speaking from experience.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="333" /> I am not a spokesperson for the pro-life lobby or other pressure groups.  I accept their right to campaign on a particular issue but the methods of some groups are extreme.  I do not see this as a Catholic Church &mdash; or indeed any other church &mdash; issue, it is a question of right or wrong, what is acceptable in our society and what has been approved and accepted by the people in the democratic privacy of the polling booth.  That and only that is at stake.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to be a little more democratic.  The country has waited for two and a half years already and would wait some weeks or months to get it right.  I think the people would prefer to get it right than to rush through this badly prepared, ill timed and radically flawed Bill.  This Bill is too important not to have it examined in depth.  It is being introduced on foot of a constitutional amendment, and few believe that if it is ever passed into law it will not find its way to the Supreme Court.  If we are to consider this flawed Bill the Minister will have to give a great deal more detail and accept many substantial amendments on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I am glad he dropped what were reported to be some very extreme proposals in what has become known as the &ldquo;Howlin Bill&rdquo;, and, contrary to what has been rumoured, no Bill was ever brought to the Fianna Fáil Party during the term of the previous Government.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanKenneally" hpid="Mr. Kenneally Mr. Kenneally">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenneally</NameTxt>
      <P>I am assured by the Fianna Fáil Ministers in that administration that it was never brought to Cabinet.  For reports about that measure we can rely only on what has been leaked to the media &mdash; a practice that seems to have been brought to a fine art by this Government.  It is sad that in changing that previous proposal, if it ever existed, the Minister did not avail of the opportunity to bring it into line with what was approved in the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="334" /> I am totally opposed to abortion, whether carried out in Britain or any other jurisdiction, and I am equally opposed to having such a service available in this country.  This is the only jurisdiction for which Members have a responsibility and we can ensure only that what happens here is in accordance with the wishes of the people and the law of the land.  I accept that as part of the democratic process we must reflect in legislation what the people have instructed us to do but we must confine ourselves strictly to what we were authorised to do.  Our party spokesperson on Health, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, has already indicated that she will table substantial amendments on Committee Stage.  We must ask ourselves whether it is correct to oppose the Bill on Second Stage.  The overwhelming opinion in the Fianna Fáil Party at parliamentary level and in the broader membership is that this measure is seriously &mdash; and in my view terminally &mdash; flawed and needs to be completely redrafted.</P>
    <P>We have been charged with political cowardice and hypocrisy, I resent that and deny it in the strongest possible terms.  It would be easy for me to bury my reservations and objections to this measure as so many Deputies on the Government side have done during the past week and thus avoid the criticism that I will inevitably attract.  The criticism and cynicism very often emanates from those who do not have to test their policies and theories in the forum that counts, the ballot box.  Their vague and gratuitous barbs and criticisms can serve only to undermine public confidence in the democratic process.  Fianna Fáil still allows room for dissent and individual conscience.  If such a luxury were available in the Government parties today, this measure would never have seen the light of day.  This Bill is months before its time because what we will enact if this Bill survives may be radically affected by the outcome of the Well Woman case, yet to be heard in the High Court.  Without the court rulings on that case, which will probably define &ldquo;information&rdquo; in the context of the <Col N="335" /> abortion debate, it is foolhardy, at least, a little mischievous at best and a flagrant waste of the time of this House to proceed further but we must if the Minister insists on going ahead.</P>
    <P>What did the people vote for in the 1992 referenda when they passed the following amendment?</P>
    <P>This subsection shall not limit freedom to obtain or make available in the State, subject to such conditions as may be laid down by law, information relating to services lawfully available in another State.</P>
    <P>The people in their traditional generosity would not deprive the population of what were described by a very wide cross section of informed opinion at the time as civil rights, that is the right to information and the right to travel.  That is as they were represented and what the people accepted but they called a halt to the substantive amendment and for the second time in not much more than ten years decided that Ireland should be an abortion free zone.  Commentators choose to call this hypocrisy but once more, as in so many cases in the past, they have not given the plain people of this country credit for understanding issues that can be made unnecessarily complex by their political leaders and media gurus.  How many times must the people say that they do not want abortion in this country before the legislators accept that?  What the Minister has laid before us is the first chink in the armour of the defence against abortion.  His electorate will not thank him for they know instinctively what he is about and that in this measure he is not reflecting either their wishes or the terms of the amendment.</P>
    <P>One important aspect in the interpretation of legislation is to establish the intent, the goal of those who frame the law, in other words what was in the mind of the Oireachtas when it asked the people to vote for freedom of information. I think the clearest definition of that intent and the Government's public commitment to the people is that part <Col N="336" /> of the text which the then Government, the sponsors of the legislation, circulated in its booklet at the time:</P>
    <P>The amendment would permit non-directive counselling but not abortion referral... The legislation will not be permitted to promote abortion.</P>
    <P>Quite clearly the proposals before us would frustrate those commitments, yet the Minister brazenly states that the Bill which he is now proposing is precisely in line with the understanding given to the electorate at that time.  Can he really be serious?  In addition, the then Minister specifically refused to allow the words &ldquo;counselling&rdquo; and &ldquo;assistance&rdquo; as suggested by the Labour Deputies to be inserted into the amendment as that would clearly provide for directive counselling and referral.  How much clearer does it have to be?  If that is splitting hairs, I make no apology because that is our precise function at the time of framing legislation.  At the other end of the process the courts are required to do likewise.  If we discharged our functions better, perhaps the courts would have fewer loose ends to tidy up on our behalf.</P>
    <P>What constitutes information in the context of this proposal?  There is no doubt in my mind and in that of the overwhelming majority of our people that the latitude to be granted by the 1992 amendment meant that people could freely give and receive factual information about the nature of abortion and its physical and psychological effects on women.  I believe it is still contrary to the provisions of the Constitution and the law to give information on the identity and location of clinics which facilitate abortion in another jurisdiction.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of information, Sir, will the Deputy not accept that the then Minister for Health at that time stated clearly on RTE that the proposed amendment included access to names and addresses?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="337" />
    <Speaker pid="BrendanKenneally" hpid="Mr. Kenneally Mr. Kenneally">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenneally</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe that in the view of the Supreme Court this would constitute assistance in bringing about the destruction of the unborn, as was held in the Open Door and Grogan judgments.  What constitutes abortion referral?  Does giving names and addresses of clinics and doctors fulfil this role?  Does that imply promotion of abortion?  In my mind there is no doubt that the answer is &ldquo;yes&rdquo; on both counts. For generations doctors were not allowed to attach their names to any publicity, even to the extent that they were broadcast anonymously on the sound media.</P>
      <P>Those of us who can cast our minds back will remember that on Radio Éireann on a Thursday at 6.20 p.m. the continuity announcer would tell the nation: &ldquo;There will now be a health talk given by a doctor&rdquo;.  No name was mentioned because it was deemed that to do so would have been to advertise and promote the individual doctor.</P>
      <P>If a constituent of mine is going to another part of the country and has a problem which needs to be dealt with in that area, the person may look for my advice.  If I mention an individual or individuals who can help but do not specifically recommend that she consult them, am I still not promoting those named colleagues above those whom I choose not to mention?  There is an advertising industry based on mentioning particular product names in places where normal advertising is not allowed.  In the advertisement free BBC, a mention can be worth a fortune.  In some cases this is called sponsorship. Will not a passing mention of a product or person by the audience on the &ldquo;Late Late Show&rdquo; be as good as a series of 30 second advertisements on radio or television? It is called promotion.  There is no need to beat a person about the head to get a message across about a particular promotion.  A mention in a receptive ear is considered to be quite sufficient and no one has a more receptive ear than a person with a problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If a motorist is passing through a <Col N="338" /> town with which he is unfamiliar and his car gets a puncture, a kindly passerby may help to change the flat tyre.  He may also mention where the tube can be mended and give the names, addresses and hours of opening of garages which carry out repairs.  Is this not referral?  A service is required and an outlet mentioned. Housewives recommend supermarkets and refer their friends to them for particular purchases.  Business representatives get cards in the expectation that they will see a percentage of them in their showrooms eventually.  Where would the illicit drugs trade be without the referral system?  Giving a name, address and telephone number is either an invitation or a referral, depending on where the information originates.  The list is endless because the only reason you can give such names or addresses is to enable those to whom they are given to use the service recommended.</P>
    <P>In any dismal situation there is a bright spot and one redeeming feature of this Bill is the statutory provision regarding funding for pregnancy counselling. I commend the Minister for that. One argument put forward for supporting the Bill, not by the Minister, is that the funding envisaged will be withdrawn if the Bill fails.  The Minister must be aware of the vital necessity for such extra funding and I ask him to commit himself to providing that money regardless of the fate of the Bill.  That would be a true test of the Minister's commitment to cherish the pregnant women of this nation equally with their less needy counterparts.  The support provided by the Department for the various voluntary agencies which provide counselling, such as CURA, LIFE and Cherish, is a paltry £70,000.  I welcome the commitment to increase this to £200,000 but I urge the Minister to provide that funding regardless of whether the Bill is passed or defeated.</P>
    <P>I accept that Irish women will still go abroad for abortion irrespective of what happens to the Bill.  However, that does not mean that we as a nation or those women individually reject the underlying principle that abortion is wrong. <Col N="339" /> There is no guarantee that those who, for whatever reason, find themselves in a British abortion clinic would support the provision of abortion in Ireland.  For many of them, it is a once off solution to a perceived problem and they may be opposed to abortion in principle.  I query the Minister's figures on the number of Irish women having abortions in Britain.  There is no guarantee that a woman who gives an Irish name and address is Irish.  An Irish name and address can be merely a convenience.  I have it on the best authority that on a visit to such a clinic an investigator found recently that 23 out of 25 women who gave an Irish address were not from this island.</P>
    <P>We must ask what kind of society we want for our children and what kind of society we have already provided for them.  While I do not support the theory that Ireland is down the tubes it must be apparent to even the most casual observer that we have settled for lower standards in recent years.  How else can we account for the spate of bizarre murders which have been reported on the front page of newspapers, the state of siege in which our elderly live in the large centres of population, the rise in drug addiction, alcoholism and solvent abuse, the rise in the rate of crime, daylight raids and attacks and the spiralling suicide rate which claims younger and younger victims each year?  We have abandoned all pretence of discipline. We have deprived our children of the strength which the old fashioned sanctions on unacceptable behaviour provided for us.  We have eliminated even the most minimal corporal punishment in schools but have not given any effective alternative to teachers and school administrators.  We frown on correction in the home with questionable billboard campaigns about it being wrong to slap a child &mdash; a dangerous whispering campaign. We have ridiculed churches which gave a lead in the past and have availed of every opportunity to reduce <Col N="340" /> their influence on the population, all in the name of liberalism and pluralism. We have tied the hands of the Garda and left it open to ridicule from cheeky pre-teenagers and still expect to have trouble free neighbourhoods.  We scoff at the notion of censorship, yet we decry the copycat violence portrayed in undesirable films and publications.  We cannot have it both ways.  Either we have acceptable standards and the means to encourage and enforce them or we have chaos.</P>

      <P>I had been talking about the type of society we want. Either we have acceptable standards and the means to encourage and enforce them or the resultant chaos that comes from the &ldquo;anything goes, free for all&rdquo; society.  We have introduced legislation which would have been unthinkable 20 years ago.  If a small but vociferous minority had their way we would have abortion on demand here too.  We have gone down the road of liberalism too far for our own good; it is time to call a halt.  If we do as the Minister suggests, for the first time, we shall be stating that abortion is right.  We cannot, should not and will not do that.</P>
      <P>At a time when we are endeavouring to get away from the killings and torture of the past 25 years, let us not prepare the ground for killing innocent children and the torture of women at their most vulnerable time, all for a seedy profit.  I am convinced that is not the type of society the vast majority of our people want, deserve or have voted for.  I urge the Minister to take back this Bill and return with it only when it has been reframed in accordance with the fourteenth amendment and after the courts have made their decision in the Well Woman case.  Only then can we deal with it in a rational, expeditious and thorough manner.</P>

      <P>One in 11 Irish pregnancies now ends in abortion.  For most people they are extremely sad figures.  The so-called pro-life movement is much more concerned with the theology of reproduction or referral than with the human pain lying behind the statistics.  If the pro-life movement was genuinely and seriously concerned about abortion, if it seriously wished to reduce the numbers of women who feel abortion is the only way out of a crisis pregnancy, they would not be wasting our time, as legislators, by lobbying on the semantics of information <i>versus</i> referral.  Does anyone seriously believe that one can persuade one pregnant girl in crisis to go through with her pregnancy by suppressing the names and addresses of clinics in the United Kingdom, tearing up the United Kingdom telephone directory or pulling the plug on directory inquiries?  The very climate of ignorances it seeks to foster is the kind of climate in which women are more likely to make decisions they may later regret.</P>
      <P>This is part of the same movement which sought to block the Stay Safe programme in schools to educate children in responsible sexuality, rendering them less vulnerable to child abusers and that sought to block funding to rape crisis centres.  These are the people whose 1983 amendment to the Constitution brought about the X case.  As the family's tragedy unfolded on our television screens Irish people began to face our ambivalence about the choices any of us would make in such difficult and tragic circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe most Irish people genuinely celebrate life.  Giving birth is one of the most profound experiences anyone can have but what woman can honestly and genuinely say how she would react in a crisis pregnancy, what she would do if she were raped or carrying a handicapped child?  What woman has not at some stage, even during the most <Col N="342" /> wanted pregnancy, had ambivalent feelings towards the child she was carrying and the fact of the pregnancy itself?</P>
    <P>Unless we begin to understand the pressures facing women in crisis pregnancies we cannot hope to persuade more of them to have a positive outcome to their pregnancy, to give birth to their baby.  Women in a crisis need understanding, sympathy and practical help, not a rushed judgment.  Four thousand Irish women had abortions in the United Kingdom last year; as we debate this Bill, another 80 will go.  Did we persuade any of them to stay by failing to legislate for the provision of names and addresses of clinics?  How do these women feel now as the righteous get on their soapboxes, as the workings of these women's bodies are dissected by the television moralists invading our livingrooms?</P>
    <P>I spent two years as secretary of the national campaign for the homeless at a time when housing cutbacks were creating a homelessness crisis among single parents.  The mullahs of the pro-life movement never came near us in the campaign for the homeless, they never addressed those real, practical issues which can turn an unplanned pregnancy into a crisis pregnancy.</P>
    <P>When I was a teenager there were fewer unplanned pregnancies but those pregnancies usually ended up in one of two ways &mdash; marriage to the father before the birth or giving the baby up for adoption.  I am glad the days of shotgun weddings are over, that women now wait before taking the momentous step of marriage and make their decisions independent of the fact of pregnancy; that is good.  The choice to give one's baby up for adoption was never an easy one; to go through the physical and emotional experience of giving birth and handing over the baby to another family to rear is a huge wrench.  Nowadays, when most women keep their babies, it is a choice which is also likely to carry a high degree of stigma for the woman who surrenders her baby. Addressing the stigma and pain of giving one's baby up for adoption is an <Col N="343" /> important topic for our society to address.</P>
    <P>I should also like to see further progress made in implementing the recommendations of the Robbins report on adoption.  As a society I should like to see us take a mature, adult attitude to sexuality, relationships and parenthood. It is frightening that at least one in 11 pregnancies is a crisis one, to such an extent that the woman goes for an abortion. As well as offering support in a crisis, counselling and practical help, our society should be educating boys and girls, men and women, into responsible attitudes to relationships, contraception and the enormous and momentous responsibilities of parenthood.  Education, information and openness are central if we want people to make adult choices and the attempted repression of information is a dangerous and misguided tool.</P>
    <P>In 1992 the people were offered adult choices &mdash; to enshrine in our Constitution the right to travel, the right to information and to add to the 1983 Amendment a rider on the right to life, as distinct from the right to health, of the mother.  The people made their choices in 1992; those choices are now part of our Constitution.  The electorate voted by a margin of 60:40 per cent to give a constitutional right to travel and by the same margin to give a constitutional right to information and to reject any distinction being drawn between a mother's right to life and her right to health.  The right to information is now a constitutional right, a constitutional imperative.  Our duty, as legislators, is to legislate, to regulate that right.  The Well Woman case is a red herring, the domestic judgments on that case predate the passing of the 1992 constitutional amendment on the right to information.</P>
    <P>I am happy that this Bill provides an obligation for comprehensive counselling, that it regulates the provision of unsolicited information, whether by leaflets or on billboards.  Many will be less happy that the Bill purports to <Col N="344" /> criminalise doctors who make an appointment for their patients.  I hope that nothing in those provisions will prevent any woman's full medical history being supplied to any clinic or prevent a doctor from providing appropriate aftercare for a patient who has had an abortion.</P>
    <P>I am genuinely sad that members of Fianna Fáil and Deputy Harte have allowed themselves to be hijacked by an organised lobby whose remoteness from the reality of helping women with crisis pregnancies becomes more apparent every day.  Having tasted blood that lobby is unlikely to go away quietly.  We were all elected to do a job, of legislating for the realities of modern life, not to pander to cruelly disguised pressure tactics.  We should all have learned the lesson of 1983 when the Pandora's Box of the Eighth Amendment was opened. While there are undoubtedly those who sincerely believe that these tactics promote the sanctity of human life, I remain appalled by the sheer hypocrisy of a movement which cares so passionately about the semantics and theology of referral and does so little for the thousands of pregnant women who regard their pregnancy as a crisis.</P>

      <P>This Bill can probably be described as one of the most difficult Bills presented in this House for many years.  I understand the strong views held by Members on both sides, I respect them and the right of individual Members to hold strong opinions in the circumstances in which we find ourselves. Therefore, it is regrettable that we should witness tactics outside the House, such as picketing Members' homes, or intimidation by the way of aggressive or abusive telephone calls, which are to be condemned and certainly do not do anything to enhance the status of those who engage in that type of practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not belong to any organisation that has been lobbying outside this House, nor have I been influenced in my views by them.  I hold this position in accordance with my conscience and <Col N="345" /> beliefs.  I am a practising Roman Catholic. I have a duty to respect and acknowledge the teaching of that Church and I do not make any apologies for that.  I would hope that my contribution would be seen in that context and that I would not be in any way considered as expressing a view that has come about as a result of pressure, influence or lobbying during the last number of weeks or indeed, over many years.</P>
    <P>I disagree with the timing of the Bill. It comes at a time when both the High Court and Supreme Court may very well have to interpret what is at its core &mdash; the question of information and what constitutes information.  There would never be an acceptable time for me to support a Bill like this.  I could never support such a Bill at any time. However, while having regard to that, it should not be read by anybody that I am anti-woman or am ignoring what I consider was the intention of the voters in the 1992 referendum.</P>
    <P>I am well aware of the crises that have affected, and continue to affect, thousands of women throughout our country. It makes for a sad story that in 1995, one has to witness women undergoing abuse, finding themselves in situations of great pressure, worry and isolation, having a sense of not knowing where to go, not being able to trust and being alone, desperate, fearful and suspicious. Many Irish women have to endure these feelings.  It is not so much a reflection on them as on the society that has allowed this to continue to the present day.  This so called modern society still allows women to be treated in such a way that they are almost abandoned.</P>
    <P>Many of the difficulties women have to endure have come about as a result of their experiences throughout the decades. On many occasions, they found no apparent friendship or understanding either from the Church or the State.  The caring society that we often refer to has not always been there for them.  In such difficult situations, women have been compelled, for one reason or another, to feel that the only option open to them was that of abortion, even though they <Col N="346" /> knew at the time that it was not the right one.</P>
    <P>One must acknowledge the human difficulties that can exist when a woman unexpectedly finds herself pregnant. This situation can arise in all types of relationships, including those that are common in today's society.  In the minds of many women, there are social and other justifications, as a result of having certain kinds of relationships, for feeling it necessary to describe their pregnancy as unplanned or unwanted.  These women may decide they want to have an abortion because of the fear of losing their job, of being discovered or the fact that they do not want to tell their families or husbands.  These situations are real.</P>
    <P>One welcome measure announced by the Minister, although not contained in the Bill, is the provision of funding towards counselling.  However, counselling must include education.  It must not start when the crisis occurs but must be ongoing throughout our lives.  Since we are talking about the crisis of pregnancy for certain women, counselling, education, care, protection and support and the correct information should be made available, encouraged and promoted from the start so that women will not feel obliged to live in a state of absolute fear, isolation and abandonment and, consequently, find that their only resort is to have an abortion.</P>
    <P>Regardless of what the Bill contains, abortion is never an option; it is intrinsically wrong.  If we are to deal with the difficulties of our society by the use of the crude and blunt instrument of abortion, we have not progressed or matured.  I am a father of four young women who would share these views unashamedly.</P>
    <P>The ever continuing drift towards abortion by women in difficulty has increased over the years.  This has been encouraged by a number of recent events.  A continuous campaign by a small minority with great authority and power has in many ways been able to manage and manipulate the media in favour of an abortion culture.  Most of <Col N="347" /> the campaigning in the past week or so has been pro-abortion.  To be anti-abortion is perceived as being in some way abnormal or wrong.  It is as if one is a backwoodsman or backwoods woman from Hicksville.  That is insulting and degrading and says much about those who hold such ugly and denigratory views.  The X case was a major development in recent years, it was a breakthrough for the pro-abortion lobby.  It opened a door which had not previously been opened by this House or the courts.  It achieved something new in that abortion was permissible in certain circumstances.  It would be logical to conclude from that ruling that information relating to those circumstances might also be deemed to be an entitlement and lawful.  The substantive issue, for which I did not vote, would have opened the door further but it was rejected by the people.  Had it been passed it would have eliminated the consequences of the X case but it would have increased the opportunity for abortion in terms of the interpretation which would recognise the risks to the life of the mother.</P>
    <P>The argument has been made that those of us who are anti-abortion are ignoring what was stated in the amendment to the Constitution.  I do not believe people voted in the way it has been argued.  In 1983 the Eighth Amendment, now Article 40.3.3º of the Constitution, gave expression to the right of the unborn child and its mother. In 1992 the rejection of the substantive issue clearly indicated a rejection of abortion.  It was a logical sequence to the Eighth Amendment.  To say the people voted for a type of information which is a contraction of all that has gone before suggests that they are not as politically aware as one would believe.  It is an insult to suggest that the people voted for information that would assist abortion, which they had rejected. The rejection of abortion by the people is a rejection of it elsewhere.  What the people want in this country they would expect to find elsewhere in the world.  I <Col N="348" /> do not believe the information the people voted for was intended to be anything other than what have I outlined.</P>
    <P>The Title of the Bill, Regulation of Information (Services outside State for Termination of Pregnancies) Bill, 1995, is an extraordinary description of something which has been recognised as legally acceptable.  The termination of a pregnancy is a recognised and acceptable obstetric practice to protect a mother and child and it is used before full term in that regard.  It is extraordinary that the Bill is titled in this way. Termination of pregnancies is defined in the Bill as the &ldquo;intentional procurement of miscarriages of women who are pregnant&rdquo;. In my opinion that is the intentional destruction of life.</P>
    <P>Some so-called family planning associations hide behind certain euphemisms.  Abortion referral, for example, is referred to as pregnancy counselling.  Sex education has been described as life skills and population control is regarded as assessment for population assistance.  These are acceptable euphemisms today.  Section 2 assists a woman going to a clinic outside the State for an abortion.  The provision in the Bill which allows other legitimate forms of counselling to be equal to abortion is extraordinary.  Section 5 (b) (ii) provides for abortion information to be given along with information on keeping a child, adoption or fostering.  It is extraordinary that abortion is given equal status to that of adoption and counselling.  It is also extraordinary that a relative or friend is exempted from the strictures of section 5 in that a relative or friend can give such information. Does a relative or friend include a doctor?  How does one define a relative or friend?</P>
    <P>We have had abortion referral for many years.  The argument has been made that abortion referral is not contained in this Bill and that the information to be given is intended to reduce the number of women seeking abortions. The Irish Family Planning Association has been engaged in abortion <Col N="349" /> referral, as stated in its 1994 annual report which was launched by the former Minister for Health, Deputy Howlin. Given the type of information it provides, the pro-choice policy it exercises, the referral arrangement with the British Pregnancy Advisory Service whereby addresses and locations of that service are provided and its circumvention of the law, why have the referral activities of the Irish Family Planning Association not been investigated? Many questions have to be asked. Unless section 2, which provides for assistance, is removed there are no circumstances in which this Bill can be successfully amended.  It is inherently wrong because of section 2.</P>

      <P>Some 13 years after this debate began I am disappointed, to put it mildly, to find the same air of unreality about the debate today.  We do not seem to have learned anything.  Many people want to keep the blindfold over their eyes, ignore what is going on and pretend in legislation that things are not happening which we know perfectly well are happening.</P>
      <P>I am unhappy about this Bill, particularly as I, and others, have concluded that this Bill represents the best that can be achieved politically in the present atmosphere in what passes for analysis of a social evil that we would all like to see reduced.  If this represents the best that our political establishment can produce &mdash; I do not criticise the Minister, far from it &mdash; that 166 elected Deputies can give as a response to this problem, I feel downright discouraged by the closed-mindedness, obduracy and determination to look the other way of a substantial proportion of those 166 Deputies.  Doublethink is still alive and well and living in Dáil Éireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are letting down badly those who elect us and, in doing so, we are pandering to this nonsense that SPUC and PLAC peddled in 1982.  They told us then that they did not like abortion being regulated by an 1861 Act of Parliament. They wanted an amendment to the Constitution so that politicians <Col N="350" /> could not mess about with it.  They got what they set out to get; they got the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution, without which the verdict in the X case could not have been possible.</P>
    <P>These self-appointed arbiters of what is and is not acceptable in constitutional terms, are nothing more than bungling political amateurs.  They have created the problem they thought they would solve and in doing so, have handed back the problem, curiously enough, to politicians. We now have to deal with the results of yet another referendum held in 1992 and those same people who gave us the constitutional amendment that made possible the verdict in the X case will not now accept those results.</P>
    <P>I listened carefully to the debate and participated in it &mdash; but I listen a lot more than I participate &mdash; and I am convinced that at heart the people who still oppose this Bill, those who are ringing up Deputies all over the country, do not accept the results of the 1992 referendum. They are making spurious allegations that information is the same as referral, for example.  If one listens to them carefully for long enough &mdash; I listened to one of their prime exponents and apologists last night &mdash; it is easy to conclude that they do not accept the result of the travel referendum of 1992.</P>
    <P>They would happily go back to a situation where they would put people at the ports and airports to ask women why they were going abroad and if they thought there was the slightest chance they were going to have an abortion they would stop them.  One does not have to listen to them for very long. Groups outside this House, Youth Defence and others, are actually saying they do not accept the result of that referendum. We hear them every day; they are now trying to tell us that when they voted in 1992 they were under some misapprehension.  When they voted in 1992 they knew exactly what they were voting for but it does not suit them to accept it today.</P>
    <P>I am damned if I will contemplate without protesting a situation where we will have this pressure coming again and <Col N="351" /> again; where every few years we have another campaign to have another change in our Constitution so that these people can bungle it again and keep the same problem returning.  They do not want to accept the democratic process. If that is their game let them say it; if they do not want to accept the democratic result of a democratically held referendum let them say they do not want to accept the democratic process. However, let them not send out their emissaries to try to accuse people who think like me of being in some way a recreation of Hitler's holocaust or Nazis simply because we accept the results of a democratic referendum, and we process legislation through this House as required by the results of that democratic referendum.</P>
    <P>They do not know where they are starting from and Deputy Doherty has given us a particularly good example of that.  If this Bill is not passed it would be possible to give information to women about abortion services available in other countries with no other qualification. That is possible today; it is what the 1992 information referendum gave us.  It is now constitutionally sound to give such information.  This Bill regulates the conditions in which that information can be given, regulates the type of information that can be given and specifically provides that the information cannot be given without counselling being given at the same time.</P>
    <P>If I were to accept Deputy Doherty's starting point I would have to say, if I shared his view, that this Bill represents a net improvement in the position; that the passage of this Bill would do more to meet his concerns than it will to meet the concerns of many who take a different view from him.  I find that provision excessively intrusive; I do not like and would rather stay away from a situation where the State gets so involved in regulating what people do, say, think and discuss with each other.  However, it is a matter of objective fact that this Bill makes new requirements and puts new <Col N="352" /> restrictions on the provision of information that are not in place at present and will not be there unless and until this Bill is passed.  At present the information can be given without any counselling.</P>
    <P>I note the Minister is giving a substantial amount of money to counselling services. In case I am accused of exaggerating let me say that the provision for those counselling services up to this year was £70,000 per annum; the provision the Minister is now making is £200,000 per annum &mdash; he is trebling the amount and that is a substantial increase.  The total amount may not be huge but it is worth noting that not only is this Bill regulating and shaping the information that can be given, but it is making more resources available to give the information.</P>
    <P>Most of the women who go to England for abortions &mdash; let us not use circumlocutions &mdash; do so without getting any counselling whatsoever.  This Bill, to the extent that it will have an effect on those situations, will at least make sure that more women than is the case today will receive some kind of counselling before they go.</P>
    <P>We are told the evidence suggests that where counselling is given, particularly counselling of the kind contemplated in this Bill, the result is that some of the women counselled decide not to have an abortion.  There is agreement all around that counselling seems to have that effect, so that the effect of this Bill would be to help reduce the number of women having abortions in England. That is an objective that all of us in this House and on both sides of this argument can share.  I cannot see why people who share that view are spending time opposing this Bill.  It is very difficult to explain why people who hold the views that Deputy Doherty does, for example, are opposed to it.  If there was any logic in their thinking they would want this Bill passed as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>The position of the main Opposition party is a very curious one.  They do not want to make a decision on this Bill until there is a final decision given in <Col N="353" /> some court case.  They seem to have some difficulty in understanding what is meant by the information provisions in this Bill. I do not know what their motivation is, but whatever the reason, they are trying to suggest that information is in some way the same as referral.  I wonder why they are taking that view.  They did not take that view in 1992.  I will cite, as the Minister did the other day, a pamphlet issued in 1992 by the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrat Government which seemed to put the whole thing fairly clearly.  In referring to the conditions under which information could be given, it asked the question, &ldquo;What conditions will be laid down by law?&rdquo;  The answer was as follows:</P>
    <P>The Government has said that the legislation will permit a doctor or advice agency to give a pregnant woman information on abortion services available elsewhere, provided that counselling is also given on all of the alternative options open to her.  It will not be permitted to promote abortion, or to encourage the woman to select it in preference to the other options or to provide an abortion referral service.</P>
    <P>Anybody reading that will come immediately to the conclusion that the people who wrote it understood that there was a distinction between information and referral, otherwise that paragraph would make no sense whatever.</P>
    <P>Deputy Doherty's party, or at least those of them who were in Government and in communication with Government in 1992, knew that there was a very clear difference between information and referral.  They also assured the public &mdash; a copy of this pamphlet was delivered to every household &mdash; that information would be given on abortion services available elsewhere, provided that counselling was also given on all the alternative options open to the woman who sought the information. In other words, they said to the public in 1992 that they would make the kind <Col N="354" /> of provision in law that is contained in this Bill, and that they would make those provisions in regard to information which they regarded at the time as being separate and distinct from referral, as we do today.</P>
    <P>I do not know what can have happened in the meantime to make members of the Fianna Fáil Party change their minds or to blur that distinction between information and referral.  I cannot think of anything that would have happened to do so, except that they are now in Opposition.  I did not like to say that, but I am forced to say it today because the Leader of that party is reported to have said last night he does not believe that on any given issue, a party in Opposition should take the same position as it would if it were in Government.  For people who are arguing against the propriety of giving information about abortion &mdash; because they think abortion is wrong, and I agree with them &mdash; to make that kind of statement and put politics and the exercise of politics on any important issue into the domain of that kind of situation ethics lacks any kind of credibility.</P>
    <P>The facts are that in 1992 Fianna Fáil in Government saw a very clear distinction between information and referral. Fianna Fáil in Government said it would legislate so that information could be provided under the same kind of conditions as provided for in this Bill.  In 1995 they seem to have changed their minds because they have changed sides in the House.  I am not making that point to be politically nasty but because the issue we are discussing needs clarity. The last thing it needs is that kind of political foot shuffling.</P>
    <P>We forget sometimes just what we are talking about.  For many years, Irish women have chosen to have abortions elsewhere.  There was a time when some of them chose to have abortions here. That day is gone; apparently it is no longer possible.  There are women alive today because of that who might not otherwise be alive.  They have chosen to have abortions elsewhere.  We have to accept the fact that in the future some <Col N="355" /> Irish women will come to the same conclusion for reasons which I cannot go into, nor can other Members of this House.  As long as that is the case, we have a duty to make sure that if they have to choose that road, they at least do it in circumstances which minimise the damage to them, both physical and psychological, and which minimise the anguish they will suffer.  I do not know about that on a personal basis &mdash; few Members in this House do.  We can only imagine that anguish from the stories we hear.</P>
    <P>Maybe not all women who have an abortion suffer this kind of anguish, although SPUC and PLAC tell us that it scars every women permanently.  If that is the case and if we know, as we do, that it will continue to happen, surely we should be trying to ease the blow on those women, rather than criminalising and vilifying them in the way that we now seem to do and in the way that opponents of this Bill want to do.</P>
    <P>I might not agree with the choice that a woman can make &mdash; it is not up to me. I cannot take the responsibility or even imagine what it is like to be inside somebody else's conscience, but at least I can decide not to say to any woman who has had an abortion that she is part of something like Hitler's holocaust or that she is a Nazi.  The people in SPUC and PLAC and other groups should not say that to them either, nor should they countenance anybody who supports them saying that.  I ask where our charity has gone.</P>
    <P>So far in this debate the judgmental aspects of the issue have been in the background.  I hope they stay there until this Bill is concluded.  I read a report of one priest saying that he would refuse holy communion to people who had been involved in encouraging this.  I read that one bishop talked about excommunication and I have taken ecclesiastical legal advice on this.  I would not claim this advice is the highest available because I do not have a <Col N="356" /> direct line to God as other people claim to have but according to the best advice I can find, neither the priest nor the bishop is entitled under canon law to say either of those things.  If people want to discuss that issue with me by telephone, outside the gate or anywhere else, they can forget it because I am not bothered to discuss such issues with them.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that the provisions of this Bill realistically constitute the best response we can make to the 1992 information referendum result.  I emphasise that I am not in any way criticising the Minister.  He made a very shrewd, hard-headed political judgment and I commend him for it but this Bill shows once again that the Irish, and their legislators in particular, are sadly lacking in the human charity which should be shown to people who find themselves in the situations contemplated by it.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the opportunity afforded me by the main Opposition party to air my views.  I will be brief because I realise many Members wish to contribute.  During the last 20 years I have listened with amusement, amazement and some dismay to debates regarding abortion in Ireland.  In the past week I have listened with similar amusement to some of the descriptive words used by people to describe this Bill.  Words like &ldquo;confusion&rdquo;, &ldquo;service&rdquo;&ldquo;crisis&rdquo; and &ldquo;hypocrisy&rdquo; were used. They are probably relevant but more relevant to the opposing side of the story in many cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last week the Minister, in response to a parliamentary question, gave the startling figure that 13,500 Irish people had procured abortions legally in Britain over the last three years.  We were aware that some people were going to Britain for this purpose but nobody had <Col N="357" /> the figures.  We have them officially from the Minister now.  Leaving aside the narrow argument relating to the life and health of the mother and the argument about the very small number of horrendous cases of pregnancies resulting from the crime of rape, in excess of 13,000 Irish lives have been terminated in Britain.  That is crude, colourful and emotional but a fact.</P>
    <P>We must ask what the Bill does to tackle this situation.  I do not think it does anything to tackle it in a positive fashion, it is about whether Irish people should have access to abortion and the venue, Birmingham, London, Dublin or Cork, is totally irrelevant.  This Bill expedites and facilitates abortion and is, therefore, the antithesis of the thinking of the Irish people.  The referendum which was passed dealt with information but if it had asked the simple question whether the Irish people agreed that there should be abortion, essentially on demand, I believe the answer would have been a resounding no.  This Bill is totally contradictory to the wishes of the nation.</P>
    <P>I am not about to engage in the same type of bashing as the two Government speakers did in relation to the pro-life movement or any other movements, regardless of whether they agree with my viewpoint.  They are entitled to their views and do not deserve to be knocked as an excuse for our actions here.  I am not a member of any group and any one group does not have a monopoly on this situation.  No one church &mdash; or party &mdash; has a remit over another.  This issue is far too serious and must be put right by right thinking Christian people.  It is time all the fudge and the amendments which have confused people are removed and we ask the Irish people if they feel it is right that we should have abortion essentially on demand.</P>
    <P>Crisis pregnancies have been mentioned. Some 20 per cent of the children of this nation are born out of wedlock. It is probably fair to say that maybe half of them could have been considered at some stage to have been crisis pregnancies. Yet I believe if one were to ask the <Col N="358" /> single parents, women in particular, who gave birth to and reared these children, how they felt about the crisis pregnancies and if they favoured abortion, I am sure one would offend them very deeply.</P>
    <P>It is not the right of anybody, politicians or doctors, to take human life, which is a gift from God.  I am not a member of the majority Church or a political party.  I represent a constituency where women form 52 per cent of the electorate.  Many women expressed difficulties and concerns to me over the past fortnight as they are very concerned about the implications of this Bill on their lives and the lives of the nation.</P>
    <P>This day is a crossroads as far as the social agenda of the Irish nation is concerned. This Bill will lead to more Irish people being terminated in foreign hospitals than heretofore.  In the name of God I oppose it and ask every Member not to engage in politics but to study their consciences and ask whether, when their time is gone, they will have left this country a better place in which to live.  I do not think we will do so by passing this Bill and I urge people who have qualms of conscience about it to reject it and seek a solution in accordance with the Christian values of this island.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  It is generally agreed that this is a particularly difficult issue for everyone concerned and has the capacity, as in the past, to divide people on a fundamental basis and polarise them.  We should not unduly concentrate on our situations and make the type of comments Deputy Dukes made about legislators being sadly lacking in their response to this issue.  It has divided people all over the world and has created far more emotion in different parts of the world.  As we have seen on our television screens, it has been responsible in the United States for some of the most violent types of campaigning, leading to deaths.  God forbid <Col N="359" /> that we will ever get near that stage here.</P>
      <P>It is not unusual that we are having such an intense debate on this Bill and the wider issue of abortion.  There is nothing unique about this country.  Certain people are overemphasising the uniqueness of our position and legislative capacity to deal with a fundamental issue.</P>
      <P>Given that it is an issue that is prone to creating division and polarisation the manner in which this Bill was published and is being railroaded through the Dáil leaves much to be desired.  It was published on the morning after the publication of the Framework Document. The decision was taken this morning to guillotine the debate.  Last Thursday during the Second Stage debate there seemed to be an attempt by the Government to withdraw speakers in the vain hope that the debate would collapse thereby preventing the exposure of their Deputies to campaigning over the weekend. That does not represent a particularly mature way of dealing with legislation of this type.</P>
      <P>The Minister and the Government have some questions to answer about their commitment to this House and its capacity to debate legislation of this type in a proper, organised and normal way.  What is happening this week is by no means normal.  We have not experienced the late hours we are due to sit this week for a long time.  We are sitting late tonight, tomorrow night, Thursday night and Friday to rush through this legislation.  There seems to be a particular desire to have it passed before another weekend.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We live in a democracy and people have the right to approach their Deputies on any issue.  We have all had telephone calls and people contacting us about this issue.  I have not experienced any undue intimidation from anybody.  I received a number of telephone calls &mdash; not too many &mdash; and none have been too argumentative.  People have been <Col N="360" /> courteous and firm and put their positions but I have experienced very little overt intimidation.</P>
    <P>Certain people in the media have, to a degree, exaggerated the influence and impact of such campaigning on Fianna Fáil Deputies and, indeed, on Deputies throughout the House.  I was struck by certain articles on the efficacy of particular campaigns, the brilliance and ingenuity of the campaigning and so on.</P>
    <P>Having witnessed the debate in my parliamentary party and having spoken to many of my colleagues, I make the fundamental point that many of the views articulated and many of the positions adopted by my colleagues are sincere. They do not amount to political opportunism and do not merit terminology such as &ldquo;cute hoorism&rdquo; which was used by Members of the Government side in relation to my parliamentary colleagues. These views are genuinely and sincerely held whether one likes them or not.  It is wrong for Deputies on the other side of the House to question the sincerity of beliefs held by Members of my party on both sides of the debate.</P>
    <P>Our parliamentary party has dealt with this issue in an open and honest way.  When we were in Government the parliamentary party discussed this issue. A motion was passed demanding that, prior to the publication of any Bill, the Government would refer to the parliamentary party for approval the proposals and draft heads of such a Bill.  At one stage, there was even a suggestion that the then Minister, Deputy Howlin, would meet members of the Fianna Fáil parliamentary party to discuss the contents of whatever Bill would eventually be introduced.</P>

      <P>I am glad the Minister for Defence, Deputy Coveney, is here to take the motion because it gives this House an opportunity to discuss, in a non-confrontational way, progress in the Defence Forces over the next number of years.</P>
      <P>We must take account of the history, tradition, culture and distinctive nature of the Defence Forces in any review and we must have the Army at heart. When outside consultants consider the resources and potential for change, the Army and its activities are often neglected. We must ensure that does not happen and we must try to gauge the leadership, structures, equipment, training and resources necessary to implement the role of the Defence Forces and satisfy the needs of society and our dependence on them.  We must also understand the strain involved in many of these tasks.  It is said that no soldier glories in war.  They must carry out many tasks on our behalf at a risk to their lives and safety.  Everyone in this House wants to pay tribute to their generosity, commitment and service both here and abroad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the end of the Civil War and the establishment of the State, the Defence Forces have eschewed any involvement in politics; there has never been a suggestion of partiality on their part. <Col N="362" /> They are, therefore, entitled to full consideration of their views about changing times and needs and the prospects for enhancement in any new review.  I was disappointed to learn of unease in many ranks of the Defence Forces as a result of announcements made by the Minister, although these may not have been intended in the way they were interpreted. It is helpful, therefore, to thrash this matter out in the Dáil and make the Government aware of potential difficulties if consultation about proposed changes does not take place between the representatives of the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>In every democratic country people are proud of the activities of their Defence Forces, the men and women who take many risks for society, and nowhere is that more evident than here. Today it is taken for granted that Irish soldiers should serve alongside soldiers of other nationalities as part of the UN peacekeeping forces.  Since Ireland's admission to the UN in 1955, 35,000 troops have contributed to peacekeeping missions throughout the world.  A large number of Irish officers have also participated in the UN observer mission since 1958.  In this way peacekeeping duties are a significant element in Irish military life and a concrete manifestation of Ireland's commitment to the UN and the maintenance of peace.  The involvement of the Defence Forces in peacekeeping activities over the years is now an established tradition which affords many advantages.</P>
    <P>The success of the participation of the Defence Forces in peace-keeping to date is evidence that it has a sufficiently high level of discipline and expertise. Further evidence is provided by the manner in which the Defence Forces carry out the many varied roles they are asked to fulfil, whether aiding the civil power or keeping vital State services going during industrial disputes and other emergencies.  These soldiers are drawn from all sections of society.  The majority live in homes alongside their civilian counterparts and not in barracks or military bases.  This has further <Col N="363" /> assisted the integration of the Defence Forces in society as well as helping to foster its democratic ethos.</P>
    <P>The involvement of the Defence Forces in UN operations has been considerable. When one considers its small size, the contribution has been enormous. This involvement has been a great incentive for young people to join the Defence Forces.  It has boosted morale and created a better public image of the Army.  The publicity surrounding the operations of the UN and the involvement of the Defence Forces has been of enormous benefit to the country.  Some 34 lives have been lost since 1958 in these activities, which shows how dangerous they are.</P>
    <P>Irish troops are accustomed to working without heavy support weapons and it is ironic that this has worked in their favour during peacekeeping operations. Participation in peacekeeping operations has been the most significant development in the Defence Forces since their establishment and is now a substantial part of military life in Ireland and the personnel have made significant contributions to the cause of peace.  They have also enhanced the image of the Defence Forces as a disciplined and well integrated military force at home and abroad.</P>
    <P>While we must take cognisance of the tasks performed by the Defence Forces and their contribution to political stability and the institutions of State, the review currently being undertaken must ensure the substantial contribution being made to UN operations is not diminished in any way.</P>
    <P>Many of us do not take due account of the varied roles thrust upon the Army.  It must be capable of meeting immediate and short term requirements, provide a deterrent to would-be aggressors and provide for planned augmentation of the standing force.  Few if any countries can afford to maintain adequate forces to meet a worst case scenario and this leads to the requirement to prioritise the roles or tasks in relation to threat assessment.  Needless <Col N="364" /> to say this is one of the primary functions the Government faces in setting these priorities.</P>
    <P>Ireland has approximately 10 per cent of its Defence Forces officer strength abroad on UN or other peace missions at any one time.  Approximately half of these rotate on a six-monthly basis; others on a 12-month or even an 18-month basis.  In effect this means approximately 15 per cent of its officer strength is on overseas posting in any one year.</P>
    <P>Fishery protection requires a capability to patrol an area of 132,000 square miles, which is 22 per cent of the entire sea fishery of western Europe.  Concurrent with the fishery protection operations is the implementation of the basic principle of the law of the sea, which requires that a State must have the means properly to monitor activity by sea and air and assert jurisdiction over the territorial seas and economic zone of the State.  The role requires the capability to deal on an ongoing basis with search and rescue; air ambulance services; ministerial air transport service; major disasters, including aircraft, shipping, train, oil or chemical spillage; natural disasters &mdash; forest fires, floods, storms and snow; disruption of essential services; and engineering and other technical services.  The Defence Forces also deal with drug interdiction.</P>
    <P>Experience has shown the Defence Forces have been involved in many disaster relief and maintenance of essential services operations such as fire services, water and sewerage works, refuse, ambulance service, fuel supplies and public transport.  While specific training for such operations is not practicable, the capacity to provide a wide range of technical skills, allied with an organised and disciplined approach, has proved of immense value.</P>
    <P>Many people &mdash; the same may be true of the review &mdash; underestimate the wide range of these activities and the public expectation that the Defence Forces should make provision for all these contingencies. Clearly the State does not have the resources to provide specific <Col N="365" /> courses earmarked for the various operations so a highly trained, multi-skilled, versatile force is required, organised, equipped and trained along conventional lines, which can easily adapt to the requirements of different situations. I strongly support that and Fianna Fáil, in the context of the ongoing debate, will support measures leading towards such developments which will have to be achieved on a consultative basis.</P>
    <P>In the Dublin area there are 850 troops from infantry, artillery and cavalry. In McKee Barracks and Clancy Barracks there are personnel in signals, engineering, ordnance, military police, supply and transport.  Forces must be provided within the city for tasks associated with Dublin Airport and Casement Aerodrome, Dublin port, the Dáil, Government Buildings, Mountjoy Jail, the television station, the Central Bank, embassies, the Special Criminal Court, vital installations, and ceremonial duties.  Tasks associated with the above frequently involve the deployment of groups larger than one battalion under the control of the headquarters of the 2nd Infantry Brigade.  Permanent guards and patrols must also be provided to vital installations in accordance with the current threat assessment.</P>
    <P>Having provided for the Border and Dublin city, the other areas are still left with a variety of tasks &mdash; security at Portlaoise and Limerick prisons; the explosives factory at Enfield and the explosives storage magazine at Cork; a military presence at civilian quarries, etc. for explosive blasting operations; Cork, Shannon and Knock international airports; seaports; Mount Gabriel radar station; cash centres; vital installations; and ceremonial duties.  There are barracks in Athlone, Galway, Limerick, Cork and Kilkenny.  Given the spread of deployment and range of tasks, it is imperative these units are controlled by a brigade headquarters and supported by brigade service support units.</P>
    <P>The Defence Forces engage in joint operations with the Garda on searches, checkpoints, roadblocks, patrols, escorts of prisoners, explosives and cash, bomb <Col N="366" /> disposal, crowd and riot control, and other areas.  The Garda Síochána and the military are different forces with different philosophies and <i>modus operandi.</i>  The requirement for co-operative procedures, including training, cannot be over-emphasised and these can only be achieved by deployment which takes account of the Garda deployment also.</P>
    <P>Despite the many and varied tasks outlined, since 1979 defence spending has declined significantly as a percentage of Government spending and gross national product.  The growth in defence spending has not kept pace with inflation.  For instance, the expenditure on war-like stores over the past decade is as follows: in 1984, £10 million; 1985, £11 million; in 1986, £9.5 million; 1987, £11.8 million; 1988, £8.8 million; 1989, £7.5 million; 1990, £7.6 million; 1991, £5.1 million; 1992, £5 million; 1993, £4.5 million.</P>
    <P>We have had no radical reorganisation of structure in the past 25 years. The tasks have increased, the resources have not kept pace with inflation, and the strength of the forces has declined. All parties agree, therefore, that it is time for change and modernisation and to ensure the resources necessary are provided.</P>
    <P>Since 1988 the Defence Forces have been under scrutiny from a number of reviews, including those by Brady, and Gleeson and two by the EAG.  This process has already had considerable impact on the organisation; it has also identified many of the weaknesses and deficiencies of the Defence Forces and the areas which need immediate attention.</P>
    <P>It must however be clear that the pattern of Irish defence spending in the last decade has been such that there are no potential savings to fund the once-off costs of redundancies which will be necessary and the other reorganisation measures.  The capacity has been eroded by the reduction in personnel numbers and the decline in expenditure on capital and operational items, as already outlined.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="367" /> Any solution proposed would have to be broadly accepted by the military authorities if it were to be implemented. If we have a difference with the Minister it is here, at the kernel of the problem. The Minister should not say he has had adequate consultations because he has met representative organisations on one or two occasions to discuss one or two items.  The success of the changes &mdash; which we all would like to see take place in a modern Ireland &mdash; is dependent on the Defence Forces having a belief in and a commitment to ensuring that success.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister say whether the Price Waterhouse report was driven more by cost considerations rather than the primary requirement, which is to ensure we have a balanced approach and the proper resources necessary in a successful defence force?  Was there too much emphasis on systems bought in from elsewhere, particularly Canada?</P>
    <P>The absence of ongoing recruitment to redress in a balanced fashion the decline in personnel has also contributed to the problems being experienced. The problem areas are: the inability to carry out worthwhile collective training; insufficient number of troops on the ground in peak units; the unacceptably high age profile of the Defence Forces and the necessity to rationalise the numbers and strength of units; the need for a comprehensive personnel policy for the recruitment of young soldiers and a system of retirement to correct the age profile; structures to deal with the excessive number of personnel medically unfit for duties; the engagement by the military in activity not required by their assigned roles; the reform of the top structure of the Department of Defence, both military and civil, so that authority is aligned with responsibilities; the wide geographic deployment of the forces; soldiers employed on duties which could more appropriately be carried out by civilian employees; and the multiple layering of command structures.</P>
    <P>In implementing proposals to remedy <Col N="368" /> those problems it is vital that the military authorities are comfortable with and have confidence in the approach taken.  The consultants' approach &mdash; to decide the strength and numbers for the Defence Forces based on a predetermined savings target &mdash; is scarcely the way to tackle this fundamental problem. It will and should be necessary to consider the requirements and strength in numbers of the Defence Forces on the basis of the roles assigned to them and on the Government's and national requirements of the day.  It is clear when we look at the Price Waterhouse proposals that a reduction of the Permanent Defence Force by 3,000, following the reduction of 2,500 in the past decade, can scarcely be acceptable.</P>
    <P>With regard to the closure of 17 barracks, the costs of relocation far outweigh the cost benefits in the short term.  The cost of relocating from Collins Barracks to other Dublin barracks is estimated to be £22 million.  I have referred previously to Kickham Barracks in Clonmel where over 300 personnel are based.  While I do not wish to speak in strictly economic terms, the total salary value of the barracks to that part of Tipperary is £4.5 million per year.  It is an important and institutional part of the economic fabric of the area. I could speak about other areas and Deputy O'Rourke will discuss these matters in relation to the midlands.</P>
    <P>It is clear that the Price Waterhouse proposals, while containing eminently sensible and practical recommendations which can be implemented after full consultation, also incorporate serious weaknesses which, if implemented, could present a high security risk to the State.  The proposals were cost driven and do not take account of the threats, policy and roles.  Despite the reduction in numbers of 2,500 since 1981, it is not practical to contemplate a further reduction of 3,000 if one considers the variety of roles which I already outlined and the essential nature of many of those tasks.  While we need highly trained and highly motivated people who are always available, we hope it will <Col N="369" /> not be necessary to carry out many of the tasks I have outlined.  However, the State has an obligation to provide such security to the public and the public has never been found wanting in making resources available for these important areas.  Regardless of deployment and security requirements, the Price Waterhouse proposed closure of 17 barracks is excessive.</P>
    <P>The report proposes to reduce FCA numbers by more than 10,000.  It proposes two brigade structures which would be inadequate for current commitments at home and overseas and could have major implications for the future operational capacity of the Defence Forces.  Everybody accepts that the ratios of personnel to non-personnel spending are out of order.  We look forward to proposals to move that ratio nearer to 70:30.  However, this will require an injection of funds at the initial stages of implementation.  This is necessary to solve the age profile problems and achieve a fully effective defence force.  The funding injection should be considered in the context of the sharp decline in defence spending over the last decade.</P>
    <P>Price Waterhouse is seriously short of technical specialists in its proposals and that would place restrictions on the numbers available for UN service.  The provision of forces for commitments in the Dublin area is inadequate.  The proposal for training does not solve the problem of the lack of collective training and adequate resources have not been provided for that.  Manpower must be addressed as a matter of urgency.  We do not have a manpower policy.  Some of the problems that have developed are a result of that.  A personnel policy document should be produced to address employee resourcing, employee relations and employee development. Previous studies in this area, including the Gleeson commission report, might be useful.  A key area of overall personnel policy will be the proper staffing of personnel support services already instituted on foot of the Gleeson commission recommendation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="370" /> The Permanent Defence Force has an establishment of 17,966.  The actual strength, however, is 28 per cent below that figure.  The establishment of 12,326 which is proposed by the military authorities may not in any sense be interpreted as a notional figure &mdash; it is the minimum figure at which the Defence Forces must be maintained.  Operational efficiency within this lower establishment is contingent on the satisfactory resolution of personnel issues.  Since 1981 the age profile of other ranks has deteriorated to a current average of 34 years with a devastating decrease in the 16 to 25 year age brackets.  This arises from low recruitment and low wastage.</P>
    <P>Recruits enlisted after January 1994 are offered five years service with limited numbers extended beyond this period. This, together with reduced maximum entry ages, continuous recruitment and other measures would help to counter the imbalance.  The new manpower policy must cater for planned intake of recruits, cadets and other apprentices into the Army, Navy and Air Corps to match a controlled wastage pattern.  This scheme will require additional funding at the initial stages. The Minister might be in a position to say when this year's recruitment will start and how many will be recruited. We hope the number achieved last year will be achieved later this year.  The introduction of a comprehensive manpower policy with implementable discharge schemes will eliminate the problem of excessive medically unfit personnel.  The personnel establishment proposed is dependent on all personnel being medically fit.</P>
    <P>Price Waterhouse highlighted the serious deficiencies in training, particularly in respect of collective training in the Defence Forces.  The cost benefit analysis validated this assessment. However, having identified the problem so clearly, Price Waterhouse failed to address it.  The proposal outlined by Price Waterhouse removes the command training cells, closes the command training depots, and the junior command staff school of the military <Col N="371" /> college, creates a national training centre with little or no infrastructure for administration, transport, military police etc., closes the corps school and the Army apprentice school without proposing an effective solution to provide for specialist training.  It does not address the collective training requirements at sub-unit and brigade level.  To successfully prepare soldiers for combat, a training system must meet all the functional and command needs of the entire fighting entity.  Since 1991, the number of personnel in the Defence Forces has fallen by almost 2,652.  This decline in numbers, combined with the increase in operational taskings, has undermined the ability of the Defence Forces to provide for any meaningful collective training.</P>
    <P>In the context of phasing in part or some of the proposals in the short to medium term all the necessary consultation should take place on the full package and there should be a broad canvas and consensus as to the necessary measures to be introduced.  If we do not have a phased in, single measure approach, it will continue to undermine not only the strength of the Defence Forces but all the attitudes which have been carefully built up over a considerable period of time.</P>

      <P>I thank my colleague, Deputy Smith, for sharing his time with me.  He gave a very comprehensive overall view of this motion tabled by Fianna Fáil and I do not intend to encroach upon those areas.

    </Speaker>
    <P>Like the Minister I come from an Army town.  The headquarters of the Western Command is in Athlone and there are barracks in Mullingar and in my previous constituency &mdash; and perhaps, if the review has its way, my future constituency &mdash; of Longford so I speak with the interests of those three at heart. In general terms, Fianna Fáil has always been strongly committed to the role of <Col N="372" /> the Defence Forces on land and sea and wishes to see them fulfil their rightful role in a modern way.</P>
    <P>I do not say this in an antagonistic sense but this debate has been conducted in confusion.  One day we read that the Minister means no harm and will not implement the Price Waterhouse report; the next day he told us in an Adjournment Debate that he &mdash; with the emphasis on &ldquo;he&rdquo;&mdash; will not preside over any closures of Army barracks. That is disingenuous because while he may not physically preside over the closures, they do not happen overnight but have a lead-in time.</P>
    <P>We wish to ask the Minister his firm intentions on what he plans to do in the Department of Defence.  We will not wake up one morning to find that 17 barracks have been closed; that is not how bureaucracy, armies or Government Departments operate.  However, the moves to so do may have already been put in train, for all we know, because we are in the dark about the Government's plans.  The Minister is the spokesperson but it is a collective Government decision.  While he may be correct and straightforward in saying to us that he will not preside personally over any closure, that is not good enough.  I am strongly convinced that the Government will do irreparable damage to the Defence Forces by wholesale acceptance of the Price Waterhouse report.  Price Waterhouse is a firm of accountants which works to a business agenda, in the main, and its report is based on business practices and techniques.  We do not think that is how matters of the Defence Forces have been or should be handled.  They should be modern, streamlined and in keeping with this century.  However, at the same time, they play a very strong, pivotal, economic, custodial and social role in the towns in which they are situated. The ramifications of the activities of the Defence Forces as a whole are hugely important to small communities.</P>
    <P>The Government is implementing a policy of persistent and insidious undermining of the Defence Forces.  I <Col N="373" /> may be accused of being melodramatic for saying that it seems like death by one thousand cuts but that is exactly what is happening.  Not enough is given for stores for central buying for a particular Army barracks or to allow for essential or emergency maintenance and the barracks become run down. Many of these barracks are beautiful buildings from the last century, earlier in some cases, which require maintenance and preservation which costs money.  Lack of recruitment means that the forces become run down and lack of progressive promotion destroys morale. Those cuts can be insidiously implemented and collectively, over a period of time, would lead to the situation which I have described.</P>
    <P>Previous Fianna Fáil Ministers for Defence &mdash; with whom I have had constant contact in my political life as I come from a constituency with strong Army links &mdash; in very difficult economic circumstances managed to maintain optimism, hope and activity within the Defence Forces.  However, I fear that the present Government has clearly decided to systematically scale down the Army.</P>
    <P>Where is the promised Army recruitment and the anticipated early retirement package?  Why is uncertainty allowed to grow over the future of certain Army barracks?  If there is no intention to close them in the foreseeable future why not say so openly and directly?  How will the Defence Forces play a modern role in a modern Ireland, a modern Europe and a modern world? These are genuine questions which I know that the Minister will wish to address.  He was a success in his chosen career outside politics and I hope that he will be a success in this Department. He will by our lights, if he keeps morale, activity and hope high within the Army.</P>
    <P>There is a clear need for a proper career path for Defence Forces recruits. Of course, there is one in place for officers, as is always the case.  They know when they enter the Defence Forces when they will get to the next rung <Col N="374" /> of the ladder, what their title and privileges will be, what their final rank will be and with what glory they will finally leave.  That is fine and I understand that an Army must have a proper hierarchical structure if there are to be those who give orders and those who obey.  However, in modern management terms all entrants to a workforce should know that there is a path of progression open to them to which they can aspire.</P>
    <P>At present, there is a sense of stagnation, futility and low motivation within the ranks.  I know about this as I have spoken to young, and not so young, men and some women in the Army who have been waiting for years and years for promotion from private to the next rank because of the bottleneck in promotions. There is not a bottleneck in the officers' ranks but there is one within the enlisted ranks which is leading to a great sense of futility and stagnation.</P>
    <P>As the Minister knows, young women and men are entering the Army with good leaving certificates, they will not be content with the situation which existed for previous entrants to the Defence Forces.  They will not be willing to be shunted off as a private forever and why should they?  They have hopes and aspirations and want to go forward in their career.  There should be proper, certifiable training.  At present, there are only limited army apprenticeships which provide very limited skills.  Army recruits should know they can progress, after a stated period, if they prove acceptable.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the Minister's reply and I wish him luck in his mission.  The Army and the Defence Forces generally are not safe in the Government's hands.</P>

      <Col N="375" />&mdash; commends the Government for maintaining the impetus for the reform of the Defence Forces,</P>
    <P>&mdash; notes that the Minister for Defence is consulting widely with all interested parties, and</P>
    <P>&mdash; supports the co-ordinated approach outlined recently by the Minister for Defence, including the formulation of a phased implementation programme to be drawn up when the Government has considered the report of the Efficiency Audit Group.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I thank the House for providing me with an opportunity to deal with some misapprehensions about the review of the Defence Forces conducted by the Efficiency Audit Group for the Department of the Taoiseach.  The motion tabled by Deputies Smith and Power in effect calls on the Government to undertake a course of action which has already been initiated.  When I answered Dáil questions on 22 February, I said I would meet the military representative associations to listen to their concerns. I met representatives of RACO and PDFORRA on the same date.  A follow up meeting took place between the associations and officials of my Department yesterday morning and I will meet the associations again next Thursday.  I will also meet the Reserve Defence Forces Representative Association this week.  I hope it is clear that there has never been any question of this Government failing to consult Defence Forces' representative associations. The right of the associations to represent the legitimate interests of their members is protected by legislation and Defence Force Regulations.  I assure the House this Government will operate the agreed system of representation in a spirit of goodwill.  During our initial meetings, both associations adopted a constructive approach and I am fully committed to this process of consultation.</P>
    <P>The Government wishes to consider <Col N="376" /> fully the consequences of any proposed programme of reform before reaching its decisions.  As Minister for Defence, I am anxious to consult and to obtain the widest range of advice.  Since taking office a few months ago, in addition to meeting the representative associations, I met members of Price Waterhouse who conducted the review and the chairman of the Efficiency Audit Group.  As well as having detailed discussions with the military authorities on more than one occasion.  I met a group of retired senior military officers on the reform process and tommorrow I will meet a group of retired commissioned officers as well as UN army veterans. Nobody can assert that this Minister has not consulted and has not listened.</P>
    <P>There is widespread agreement on the need to modernise the structure and organisation of the Defence Forces.  The basic underlying structure of the Defence Forces has remained virtually unchanged for decades.  The review of the Defence Forces initiated by the previous Government, which has been undertaken by the Efficiency Audit Group, provides a welcome opportunity to address many issues in the Army, Naval Service and Air Corps crying out for attention.  A number of these issues have been the subject of public debate for a considerable time.  A factor which led the previous Government to commission the EAG review of the Defence Forces was the report of the Commission on Remuneration and Conditions of Service in the Defence Forces, the Gleeson report which highlighted a number of major shortcomings in the organisation and structure of the Defence Forces, with excessive numbers employed in non-operational tasks. Similar structural problems were again highlighted by a subsequent review of military administration by the Efficiency Audit Group.  Arising from the changed international environment, the Fianna Fáil-led Government, in September 1993, adopted a revised statement of roles for the Defence Forces which placed greater emphasis on current operational roles as opposed to <Col N="377" /> defence of the State against external aggression, which was formerly stated to be the primary role of the Defence Forces. It has been apparent for some years that the rising age profile of the Defence Forces will cause problems if not addressed in a co-ordinated manner. A general acceptance that reform of the military was necessary, combined with the change in the overall role of the Defence Forces, led to the decision by the previous Government to ask the Efficiency Audit Group to conduct a review of the structure and organisation of the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>Regrettably, since the leaking of a confidential report prepared by management consultants Price Waterhouse for the EAG, there has been widespread speculation about what the future holds for the Defence Forces.  It is unfortunate that a change of Government occurred in the middle of this process. Of all the issues which have featured publicly, the issue of barrack closures has assumed an importance quite out of proportion to its place in the range of measures under consideration. A process of review, undertaken to prepare the Defence Forces to enter the next century properly organised, structured, staffed and equipped to meet the important roles assigned to it by Government has been distorted into some type of cost cutting exercise. Nothing could be further from the truth. The terms of reference given to the Efficiency Audit Group when the review was initiated by the previous Government are as follows:</P>
    <P>To develop feasible options for the overhaul of the Defence Forces structures and systems having regard to the statement of roles as approved [by the Government] on 21 September 1993 with the aim of achieving:</P>
    <P> 1.  the most efficient and effective procurement, deployment and use of resources, recognising resource constraints and with particular reference to geographical location;</P>
    <P>2. the optimum command, grading <Col N="378" /> and management structures and systems (including arrangements in respect of the interaction between the Defence Forces and the civil side of the Department of Defence); and,</P>
    <P>3.  the appropriate level and composition of administrative and operational strength and equipment. </P>
    <P>External consultants were engaged by the Efficiency Audit Group to conduct the detailed work of the review.  To ensure that the consultants had the necessary expertise, senior officers of our Defence Forces were involved at every stage of the selection process.  The selected firm.  Price Waterhouse &mdash; whom Deputy O'Rourke referred to merely as accountants, which is not an accurate description of management consultants &mdash; provided a team which included Major-General Lewis Makenzie, the ex-UN commander in the former Yugoslavia, and other Canadian military experts.  The Canadian military team was accepted by the Irish military authorities as having the necessary and appropriate military competence to conduct the review.  Furthermore, the Efficiency Audit Group appointed its separate military adviser, a recently retired New Zealand Air Vice-Marshal of international repute.</P>
    <P>Attempts to characterise the review as a mere cost-cutting exercise are very wide of the mark.  The Efficiency Audit Group was not asked to review the Defence Forces in order to produce a programme of cut-backs and closures. Key words which appear in the terms of reference are &ldquo;feasible&rdquo;, &ldquo;efficient&rdquo;, &ldquo;effective&rdquo;, &ldquo;optimum&rdquo; and &ldquo;appropriate&rdquo;. Optimum implies best for the achievement of the desired result.  This is precisely what the Government wants for the Defence Forces; an organisation that is best suited for the discharge of its assigned roles.  A key objective is to release more personnel for operational duties.  I know that this is also what military personnel want.  It is an objective that all parties can support and there is <Col N="379" /> no need for a divisive debate over the major issues related to this review.</P>
    <P>In that context, I would like to draw the attention of the House to the following extract from an address to the Representative Association of Commissioned Officers by Deputy David Andrews, the then Minister for Defence, and my predecessor, on 14 November 1994:</P>
    <P>While an open debate on the role of the Defence Forces is something which is long overdue, I believe that such a debate should be concerned with Government proposals based on the final recommendations of the EAG and not based on speculation.</P>
    <P>I agree broadly with those words.</P>
    <P>In deciding the future of the Defence Forces, the Government is fully conscious that any decisions reached will have far-reaching consequences.  The Defence Forces are called upon to discharge a variety of important roles. Every hour of the day Army, Naval Service and Air Corps personnel are engaged in important tasks.  At home these include Border patrolling, explosive ordnance disposal, the guarding of vital installations and other tasks in aid of the civil power.  Both the Naval Service and the Air Corps are engaged in the surveillance of our maritime resources and the protection of our sea fisheries, and also with the saving of life in the role of search and rescue.  Overseas, Irish personnel have a long and distinguished record as international peacekeepers.</P>
    <P>In order to ensure that these roles continue to be carried out effectively it is necessary to examine critically from time to time the structure and organisation of the Defence Forces.  The review carried out by the Efficiency Audit Group is part of a process aimed at doing just that.  The objective of such an examination must be to enhance efficiency and effectiveness and ensure that in the years ahead the public continue to be served by professional, disciplined, well trained and appropriately <Col N="380" /> organised personnel who have a high level of morale.</P>
    <P>A case worth dwelling on is the role of peacekeeping because it is in this that the professionalism of members of the Defence Forces comes to the fore and can be compared so favourably on an international stage, Irish soldiers have built up an enviable reputation as peace-keepers.  Service with the United National demands a wide range of skills and personal qualities.  Frequently, patience and diplomacy may be as necessary as the conventional military skills of the soldier.  Decades of experience has shown that Irish soldiers have these qualities in abundance and the number of requests the Government receives from the United Nations confirms the high regard in which Irish soldiers are held.  The contribution made to peacekeeping operations has enhanced the prestige of this country and has been a source of pride to all Irish people.</P>
    <P>Since Ireland first contributed troops to the UN in 1958, Irish soldiers have participated in more than 35 individual missions.  More than 9,000 of the 13,000 personnel who currently serve in the Defence Forces have completed a tour of duty in an overseas mission.  This proud record is built on voluntary service. It says something about the character of our Defence Forces that, whenever new and sometimes dangerous missions arise, the number of volunteers invariably exceeds the number of available places.</P>
    <P>Our single biggest contribution to the United Nations in terms of personnel continues to be the UNIFIL mission in Lebanon.  I am looking forward to paying my first visit for St. Patrick's Day as Minister for Defence to our troops serving there.  For many years it seemed that there was no hope of an end to that awful conflict which engulfed Lebanon. However, peace is now beginning to take a fragile hold.  In Beirut life is beginning to return to normal after years of strife and although the city still bears the scars of war, reconstruction has commenced.  With the return of confidence the foundations are being laid <Col N="381" /> for a lasting peace and a return to economic prosperity.  UNIFIL has played no small part in all of that and our troops have been in the forefront of that important and sometimes dangerous work.</P>
    <P>Over the past 20 years a growing appreciation of the value of our marine resources has coincided with a period of growth and development for the Naval Service and Air Corps.  In particular, the extension of our exclusive fishery limit to 200 miles offshore marked a turning point in our appreciation of the importance of the sea as an economic asset.  As a result the Naval Service, and more recently the Air Corps, has seen considerable growth and development.</P>
    <P>The Naval Service fulfils a vital role in the protection of Ireland's fishing industry.  Naval vessels from our fleet of seven modern ships constantly patrol our economic exclusion zone and personnel are trained to work in a very challenging environment.  Their work goes on 24 hours a day, all year round and in all weather conditions.  From my experience of the Marine portfolio, I am well aware of the task that is faced daily in enforcing the fisheries laws, a task which is, and will continue to be, more important in the protection of our resources.  The role played is at times difficult and dangerous.  Because the duties of the Naval Service are performed at sea &mdash; out of sight of the general public &mdash; they may not, in the past, have always received the public recognition which they deserve.  However, their continuing success in fishery protection, in search and rescue, and their important role in dealing with potential pollution threats and the illegal importation of drugs have resulted in a much more widespread appreciation of the outstanding dedication of our Naval Service.</P>
    <P>While the Air Corps is heavily involved in the fishery protection role by virtue of its operation of the Dauphin Naval variant helicopter and the new CASA CN 235, it also carries out many other diverse tasks.  The Air <Col N="382" /> Corps performs vitally important functions in search and rescue, air ambulance, security operations and, from time to time, assist in non-military operations such as the relief of distress in emergency situations arising from natural disasters.  A current example is the ongoing operation in the flooded area near Gort, in South Galway, to provide essential food and supplies for marooned families and fodder for the livestock and in support of the local farming community.</P>
    <P>Both the Naval Service and Air Corps have in recent times been effective in aiding the civil power in combating illegal importation of drugs and I anticipate that their role in this vital national work will expand and grow in the future.  I would like to compliment the various components of the Defence Forces &mdash; Army, Naval Service and the Air Corps &mdash; and to express my own appreciation and that of the Government for the important contribution which they make to the well-being and security of our country.</P>
    <P>Any vibrant organisation which has to adapt to changing roles and circumstances has to be amenable to change and to reform.  The Defence Forces organisation and structure are no exception. There are many positive features of the Army, Navy and Air Corps, some of which I have already referred to, which provide an excellent platform on which to build for a changing future. Wherever military personnel serve, they apply themselves to the task in hand with commitment and professionalism. The introduction of a balanced programme of reform will prove a positive experience for the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>Since the leaking of the Price Waterhouse report last July, the positive nature of the reform process in the Defence Forces has become obscured.  For that reason, it is necessary to state some basic facts.  There are problems in the organisation and structure of the Defence Forces.  These problems have grown up over time.  Solving them will equally take a significant period of time. What is envisaged by this Government <Col N="383" /> is an integrated programme of change, introduced at a realistic pace and as a first step, there will be a three year plan detailing the initial reforms to be undertaken. I anticipate that after the Government makes a decision on the EAG it will take about three months to prepare a three year plan for the first phase.</P>
    <P>There is wide agreement about the need for change.  However, if anyone feels that change is undesirable, I would invite them to contemplate the consequences of doing nothing.  The one conclusion which everyone can share is that there is not a &ldquo;do nothing&rdquo; option. I think it is fair to say that the contributions of Opposition Deputies have reflected this.  There is a consensus about the need to take action.  In the long term, the present arrangements are not sustainable.  The excessive numbers in administration, the excessive number of layers in the military command structure, the rising age profile and the imbalance between expenditure on pay and expenditure on equipment are all sapping operational capability and will continue to do so if not reversed.  The purpose of the review is to reverse this process in a positive and progressive manner.  While there is ample scope for debate about the detail of the solutions to be adopted, the need for real change is beyond dispute.</P>
    <P>It is facile to pretend that worth-while change can be introduced without facing up to difficult issues and decisions. However, the implementation of any decisions arising from the EAG review will be a process which will extend over a number of years.  While it will be necessary to ensure that momentum is maintained, there is an equal need to introduce change at a realistic pace which the organisation can accommodate. Ill-informed speculation may have created an impression that decisions would be introduced overnight.  That is not the case and I would like to dispose of this mistaken impression.  The Government has yet to reach any <Col N="384" /> decisions concerning the EAG recommendations. As I have already said, the process of consultation preceding the Government's decisions has been thorough and wide ranging.  I would also like to emphasise that the Defence Forces were themselves intimately involved in the review process.  When a decision in principle was taken to engage management consultants, senior military officers were involved directly in the selection process.  Much of the detailed research in the actual review was carried out by officers assigned to assist the consultants. The Army themselves participated in this work.  The representative associations representing officers, enlisted personnel and the members of the Reserve Defence Forces were informed of the review and provided with its terms of reference at the outset. They were subsequently provided with the opportunity to make written and oral presentations to the consultants, an opportunity which they availed of.  I am also consulting with them on a regular basis.</P>
    <P>One of the more disappointing features of the welter of speculation surrounding the Efficiency Audit Group review is that the modernisation of the Defence Forces is being discussed as if it is were a code word for the closure of barracks and nothing else.  I have already made it clear that this is a serious distortion of the facts.  The Efficiency Audit Group dealt with accommodation requirements only in the most general way.  Not one single barracks was named for closure and a future study of this issue was recommended and will be undertaken.  That study will take into account the wider social and economic considerations as well as military operational requirements. The process of reform will include many positive features.  The Government's objective is to have Defence Forces which are well trained, well equipped and accommodated and well motivated to fulfil the roles assigned to them.  The programme of change which lies ahead will be more effective if people take a positive view. <Col N="385" /> People who are concerned for the future of the Defence Forces, including many Opposition Deputies and members of the Defence Forces themselves, accept that change is essential and that it will be beneficial for the Defence Forces and for the country.</P>
    <P>In all organisations, whether public or private, when reforms are proposed there will always be someone who feels threatened.  That is only natural, but there is no need to view the present review process with fear and apprehension. The focus is not on making short term economies.  On the contrary it is clearly aimed at enhancing the long term effectiveness of our Defence Forces. Surely that is what everyone needs and wants.</P>

      <P>The Minister has spoken about the Defence Forces being well trained, well equipped, with resources being made available and has stated that within those parameters realistic change can be brought about. How can the Minister say that and at the same time claim that the report did not mention closure of barracks?  The only thing I gleaned from the Minister's speech was that the Defence Forces were top-heavy in administration and that, perhaps, finances and available resources were not being used properly.  Many would agree to the extent that there are problems within the organisation and some re-organisation is necessary.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the resources available to the army are not being used as effectively and efficiently as possible.  However, the Minister must consider where he is coming from and what has been said to date. Up to recently we were reading in the newspapers, as a result of leaks, that 17 of the 34 barracks would be closed and that the Army would be stripped of in excess of 1,300 personnel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="386" /> Army personnel are embarrassed and annoyed that they do not know exactly what is happening because there is no clear cut agenda.  It does not help their morale when the Minister tells the House that no decisions have been made and will be only be made after a thorough review and investigation.  They are quite worried about their position. For example, people are asking where they should send their children to school in the next three years.  They want to know if they should continue to send them to school in Ballincollig.  Fermoy and other places.  People all over the country are asking if their barracks will be retained.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister agree that the procrastination with regard to the long term prospects of many people running those barracks lowers morale among Army personnel?  Does the Minister agree that officers involved in the barracks in question are also asking whether their barracks will be closed in three years? What about strategic planning for the future?  Army personnel want to know if they have a future.  It is fair to point out that there is a dilemma facing them because effectively they do not know whether they are coming or going.  They do not know whether they will be in Ballincollig, Fermoy or Clonmel and the Minister is not telling them.</P>
    <P>This matter is theoretical.  It is under investigation and the only guarantee Army personnel have is that they will not be affected and that barracks will not be closed in the next three years. However, the scenario is that they will be starved of resources over the three years.  They will have to consider moving, whether they have a future in the Army and whether they should try to get out now before it is too late.  The Minister probably added to the hype surrounding this matter by making a statement one day and rowing back on it the next, while leaving the issue up in the air.  I have spoken to many personnel, particularly those in Ballincollig barracks in my constituency.  I hope the Minister does not think it unfair of me <Col N="387" /> to ask &mdash; because we share a constituency and the hope that this barracks will ultimately survive &mdash; if they will be starved of personnel over the next number of years.  They fear that new personnel will not be introduced and that the writing will be on the wall for the future of the barracks.  There is no doubt that this is even more emphasised in Fermoy. Given that there is a Minister from Cork in office, people in the county are beginning to wonder why two of the three barracks in Cork would be singled out for closure?</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughCoveney" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is singling them out.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not.  The Minister added to this in his statement on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; when he indicated this would happen.  He heightened tension and then rowed back the following day.</P>
      <P>I wish to make a case for Ballincollig and the Minister will share my interest. Fifty per cent of Ireland's power supply comes from the Kinsale gasfield, where we have the national grid, and the Aghady, Marina and Iniscarra power-stations. The Telecom Éireann satellite communications centre is based in Midleton and we have the Whitegate oil refinery, the fertiliser plant in Cobh, the industrial complex in Little Island, the deep water port and a complex of health care companies in the Ringaskiddy area and the airport.  If the barracks in Ballincollig is closed, all of these operations would have to be covered by one barracks in the city centre.  Military personnel tell me that this barracks could easily be cut off by a limited number of people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is worth remembering that barracks were established in strategic positions for a reason.  The Ballincollig barracks was strategically placed.  The Minister will agree that the south-west coast is an increasingly important feature for us. The barracks obviously plays an important role.  Given Ireland's membership of the European Union, it is <Col N="388" /> also important that military personnel be based in Ballincollig, or will we give up on our duty and responsibility to Europe?  In terms of the defence of the EU and our relationship with the US, the strategic positioning of barracks and the protection of the south-west coast is of paramount importance.</P>
    <P>We must also take into account that much of the illegal importation of drugs is centred on the south-west coast.  We should examine the strategic role the Army could play in such areas if there was proper co-ordination between the activities of customs officials, the Garda and the Army.  Will the Minister consider if there is a meaningful role for the Army because in approximately 200 inlets on the Cork and Kerry coast drugs are being landed.  We cannot establish how many tonnes of drugs are coming in but there is a view that this is the main point of importation for drugs for distribution to the UK and Europe.</P>
    <P>The 1st Field Artillery Regiment is based in Ballincollig.  It is important to point out that there is a difference between a Government and a rebel force.  This regiment is accepted as being a crack force.  From the point of view of the people in Ballincollig in terms of integration, the barracks is part of what we are; the town grew up around that focal point which is a centre of community activity and integration.  The various clubs, societies and teams provide a good example of how Army personnel in Ballincollig integrate.  Last year, for instance, we won the intermediate county football championship and one of the Army personnel was the trainer of that team.  Army personnel who head up the rugby club as well as the basketball and pitch and putt clubs are part and parcel of the life of Ballincollig. They add enormously to the culture of the area, quite apart from the economic input involved, and we should not underplay their role.</P>
    <P>At the moment we are exporting one and a half million tons of stone per year from Adrigole and the control of industrial explosives for the quarry is based in Ballincollig.  The Minister knows the <Col N="389" /> importance attached by the Garda to the proper regulation and control of the specialist industrial explosives which are stored in Ballincollig.  This munitions dump is important to the total infrastructure of the county in helping to generate economic activity.  In terms of road infrastructure, the stone exports play a major role in the economy of Cork and Kerry.</P>
    <P>The Minister and I know the importance of the military barracks in Ballincollig. On behalf of the Army personnel there I am asking the Minister, who shares the same constituency as myself, to keep the barracks open.  It would not be remiss of him as Minister for Defence to say to the people in Ballincollig that, whatever about any other barracks, he is going to keep this one open.</P>

      <P>I hope that he will be as happy and fulfilled in his task in Defence as I was as Minister of State.  I enjoyed the three years I spent in the Department of Defence dealing with both Defence Forces personnel and officials of the Department, and I am sure the Minister will also.

      <P>I am sure the Minister will be very impressed, as I was, by the standards of professionalism and dedication of the Irish Defence Forces in the Lebanon and other parts in the Middle East.  I am not sure whether he is also going to Cyprus, Israel and Damascus but visiting our troops abroad on their various United Nations missions made me proud of being an Irishman.  I made such trips on a number of occasions but the most memorable one &mdash; for the wrong reasons in some respects &mdash; was shortly after Operation Accountability in August 1993 when the Irish area in the Lebanon had been bombarded constantly for a week.  Any Irish person would have been proud to see the morale of the Irish Defence Forces personnel, the way they responded and the regard in which they were held by local people.</P>
      <P>The professionalism and dedication of the Defence Forces also came home to me when I visited Cyprus and met people from both the Turkish and Greek Cyriot sides who were lavish in their praise of the Irish troops.  It is a huge tribute to any nation that both sides felt they got fair play.</P>
      <P>I welcome this and hope that we will have a few more between now and 1996. For too long the issue of defence and our Defence Forces was low down on the agenda, and therefore anything that raises these matters is useful.  We have to make some very serious decisions between now and 1996.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said everybody is agreed that there is a need for change, and I made the same comment in the past when I sat on the Government side of the House.  Over a long time, I spoke on both an official and casual basis with military personnel and officials of the Department in the lead up to the EAG report.  There was general agreement that changes had to come about and the Minister is right about that.  However, <Col N="391" /> I am slightly disturbed by the fact that, having brought things this far, we are now once again putting them on the back burner.</P>
    <P>Knowing the operations of other Departments, my fear is that if the initial reforms, which the Minister said would be implemented over the next three years &mdash; though I realise that some of them must take place over a more prolonged period &mdash; are delayed for too long then the Defence Forces and the Department of Defence are going to be strangled for resources.  I fear that every time the Minister seeks resources, whether it is for badly needed communications equipment or APCs, he is going to be met with a blank &ldquo;no&rdquo; from the Department of Finance which will say that this will all have to be looked at in the context of the EAG proposals.  Because of this the Minister should consult, as we ask in the proposal, but should implement the agreed proposals as quickly as possible, otherwise Defence will revert to being the Cinderella of all Government Departments. I do not want to see that happening. If the Minister undertakes the process of reform as he has outlined, we will be so far back in three years time that we will have to go through the whole process once again.  I would ask the Minister to consider that very carefully.</P>
    <P>The motion mentions consultation, and the Minister says he is already speaking to PDFORRA, RACO and other organisations.  What is the Minister consulting them about?  I understand from the Minister's speech that the Government has not made any decisions on the EAG proposals.  Some decisions need to be made in principle&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>Prior to Christmas and the fall of the previous Government the Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party gave a clear message to the then Government that it wanted to be consulted on any Bill dealing with information, particularly abortion information.  At one stage it was suggested that the then Minister with responsibility for this area, Deputy Howlin, would address the Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party if such a Bill were published and go through it Stage by Stage.  Our Parliamentary party sought that consultation process by way of motion.  I make that point to illustrate that the views of the Members of our parliamentary party are sincerely held. A number of attempts have been made to undermine the sincerity of the views held by many people.  I acknowledged at the outset of the debate and in my contribution tonight that this is a difficult subject that has the capacity to polarise opinions and create extraordinary emotions and divisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In our press statement last week we called on the Minister to defer the Bill given the manner in which he introduced it, the fact that it was not included on the Order Paper, its timing and so on.  Principally we asked the Minister to defer the Bill pending a decision by the courts on the issue at the core of this Bill and having regard to the concerns of many people as to whether this is a referral Bill or merely an information Bill.  In the case before the High Court at present the plaintiff's claim is a declaration that the plaintiff, its servants or agents may make available within the State information relating to abortion services lawfully available in another member state of the European Union and may inform pregnant women of the identity and location of, and the method of communication with, a specified <Col N="393" /> clinic or clinics or otherwise.  Essentially the issue as to whether this Bill amounts to simply information or referral is being determined in the courts.  We felt it was reasonable to ask the Minister to defer the Bill until this issue is determined. The decision of a Supreme Court judge in the Grogan case in 1988 was that the provision of information in effect would offer assistance to procure abortion services.  Subsequent events and the constitutional amendment may have influenced that view, but that case is still before the Supreme Court.  The core issue has still not been resolved and many Deputies, including myself, are concerned about it.  We considered that it should have been resolved prior to the introduction of legislation which has been introduced with undue rapidity and rushed through the House.  It is not normal practice for Committee Stage of a Bill to be taken the day after Second Stage.  A week is normally allowed for proper consideration of a Bill before Committee Stage.  I cannot understand why that is not being done in this case. We are led to believe that perhaps the Government did not want to delay the matter until next week.  I do not agree with the manner in which this Bill was brought before the House and is being railroaded through it.  During the past week there were undue attempts to undermine the Fianna Fáil Party's approach to the issue.  It is unacceptable that a party Leader should tell the democratically elected members of a parliamentary party that he is not particularly worried &mdash; or does not care &mdash; what they think, that they will have to abide by his decision.  That type of dictatorial approach is untenable.</P>

      <P>The political correspondents who last week railed against the indecision of our party Leader and the Fianna Fáil Party were the same political correspondents who in the 1980s, with my colleague, Deputy O'Malley, <Col N="394" /> railed against the alleged dictatorial attitude and behaviour of a party Leader at that time, with which I did not agree. The same people said then that there was a dictatorship.  Last week the Leader of our parliamentary party said that he wanted to hear its members' views on the issue and he did not pretend that there were not different views within the party on it.  Our party Leader acknowledged that there are different views on the subject, he is not prepared to hide that or prevent Members from contributing as happened last Thursday when Government backbenchers were told not to contribute to the debate because the Government wanted it to collapse and the Bill to be dealt with before the weekend.  We entertained all shades of opinion at the Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party meeting and allowed Members express their views here.  It is natural that there are different strands of opinion and it mirrors the views held by members of the community. It would be a phoney democracy and consensus if the 166 Deputies pretended that the nation is at one on this issue and that there should be unanimity on it.</P>

      <P>We note the Government's rowing back from a position of accountability, transparency and so on. I am constrained by time from raising other points I wish to cover.  We will table amendments to the Bill.  If the Minister is genuinely interested in dealing with this issue properly he should have consulted our party earlier and <Col N="395" /> adopted a more hands-on approach. Instead, for whatever reason, he chose the occasion of publishing the Framework Document on Northern Ireland to publish this Bill.  It was not necessary to publish the Bill that day, but the Minister wanted to rush it through the House to have the least political hassle possible in dealing with it.  That is unworthy of the Minister and did not give due regard to the issue at the core of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill arises directly as a consequence of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution Act, 1992.  The Government is obliged to bring forward, and the Oireachtas is obliged to consider, legislative provisions controlling the dissemination of information relating to abortion services lawfully available in another State.  To object to the principle of such a Bill is indefensible but to object or to criticise the detail of such a Bill is perfectly valid. The House has been remiss in its duty to bring forward laws to deal with the substantive issue as set out in an earlier part of Article 40.3.3º.  That provision was passed by the people on 7 October, 1983 but, nearly 12 years later, no Government has brought forward legislation seeking to balance the equal rights mentioned therein.  The late Mr. Justice McCarthy was critical of that in 1992.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government of which I was a member decided in 1992 against my advice not to introduce that legislation but to introduce a further proposed amendment to the Constitution.  That was contained in the Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution Bill which, rightly in my view, the people turned down.  This House should now be considering legislation arising out of the Eighth Amendment in priority to the relatively simple legislation arising from the Fourteenth Amendment.  The Minister for Health described me as having approved this Bill in 1992.  That is not correct.  I approved of draft heads in a general scheme which did not include sections 6, 7, 8 and 13 of this Bill.  I had <Col N="396" /> no part in the preparation of the explanatory leaflet which was published by the Government on or about 12 November 1992.  My party had resigned from that Government, for valid and well known reasons, on 4 November 1992.  This Bill is a great deal more restrictive than what was agreed to by the then Government on 7 October 1992 but which was never published and, as far as I know, was not drafted at that time.</P>
    <P>I share the concerns of my colleague, Deputy Liz O'Donnell, about several of the provisions of the Bill.  A number of amendments should be made but they are secondary to the principle that this House should legislate for the delineation of constitutional rights.  To deny the principle of legislation in these circumstances is not just undemocratic but anti-democratic because it seeks to thwart the constitutionally expressed wish of the people which is supreme. That constitutionally expressed wish is also contained in the Seventh Amendment of the Constitution passed by the people on 3 August, 1979 relating to elections to the Seanad.</P>
    <P>No law has ever been introduced to implement that constitutional provision. That is entirely wrong.  That is not a matter of great importance.  It is a commentary on the Seanad that almost 16 years later the people are not terribly agitated about it.  The fact that that duty has been ignored for 16 years does not lessen the duty on the Government to introduce legislation.  By introducing legislation to implement the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution, it cannot abrogate its duty to introduce legislation which will delineate the constitutional amendment made in 1983 in the ill-fated Eighth Amendment.  I was opposed to it at the time and voted against it.  I felt it would inevitably bring a great deal of trouble in its wake.  It has brought a long series of litigation and has spawned further constitutional amendments.</P>
    <P>Article 40 of the Constitution has an unhappy and overcrowded appearance because it deals in detail with a whole <Col N="397" /> lot of matters which are far too detailed to appear in any Constitution but which should appear in legislation.  One of the several drawbacks in our Constitution is that it contains so many unnecessary provisions that give rise to huge difficulties whenever the most obvious changes need to be made.</P>
    <P>The Bill, particularly the sections which are new since 1992 and which are a great deal more restrictive than what was proposed then, needs a thorough debate on Committee Stage.  I hope the Minister will have an open mind on amendments which will be put forward from various parts of the House.  The principle of introducing the Bill is right and as a matter of principle it should not be opposed.  Members should support it on Second Stage even if they do not agree with all its provisions.  Some Members may disagree with its provisions because they regard it as too liberal. I disagree with some of its provisions because I regard it as too restrictive.  That is a matter of detail which ideally should be thrashed out on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>In general terms the Bill is drafted virtually entirely as a criminal law Bill. It prohibits all kinds of things.  It creates criminal offences if one goes beyond a certain point.  One is hemmed in by the criminal law.  We are dealing here with people who are not criminals by any stretch of the imagination but people who are suffering a personal tragedy and trauma &mdash; for them at any rate, in their own mind &mdash; and with people who are seeking to give assistance to such people.  The people who are suffering that trauma or tragedy are often very young, vulnerable and lonely.  To treat them almost exclusively in the context of the criminal law is quite wrong.</P>
    <P>When my colleague, Deputy O'Donnell, made her contribution last week she quoted two interesting observations on that very point.  One was from Deputy Proinsias De Rossa, now Minister for Social Welfare, speaking here in 1992 when he said that the proper way to approach the information issue was through the information one could give <Col N="398" /> to people for their assistance rather than the information which one might deprive them of under sanction of the criminal law.  That is a perfectly valid statement of social and legal policy.  It is disappointing that it is not followed in this Bill and that we are back to the old concept of criminality in our legislation on a very delicate social and personal issue such as this.</P>
    <P>The other person Deputy O'Donnell quoted was the late Mr. Justice McCarthy, who gave, if I may say so, by far the best judgment on a number of these cases, particularly on the X case, though in each instance he was in the minority.  He said that the State's way of framing laws and delineating these rights in detail did not consist just in terms of drafting criminal statues but also consisted of positive help to people who need it in encouraging, counselling, assisting and making things easier for them rather than harder.  How many of the 4,000 or, perhaps, 5,000 women per year who travel from Ireland to England for abortions might be dissuaded from following that course if there was a caring society here rather than the kind of society we have?</P>
    <P>If one wants an example of what I suppose many young frightened women would regard as the response of the State to their predictment one has only to look at the response Miss X got to her predicament.  She was treated by the State in the 1990s in a way which to her was not unlike the way in which the so-called witches of Salem were treated in their day or the way Joan of Arc was treated in hers.  It is an appalling reflection on our society that that was the answer of the State to the predicament of that 14 year-old girl who was the victim of a criminal assault which led to her pregnancy.  Instead of being helped she was persecuted by the State.  We know what has happened to some of the dramatist personae since then but I will not dwell on that aspect.  It is appalling to think that that happened, and it must colour the views of young women who find themselves in a very difficult situation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="399" /> The Minister has an opportunity to try to adopt a different approach to this issue.  Instead of delineating rights purely in terms of criminal sanctions whether against doctors, patients, social workers or health workers of one kind or another, he has an opportunity to create, through the health boards, hospitals and general medical services, a system which will encourage young, frightened and lonely women to confide in people who can help them and who, perhaps, can avoid the ultimate tragedy of an abortion which would otherwise happen.  We will not be able to achieve much in that direction during a one day Committee Stage debate but at least this is legislation and not a constitutional amendment.</P>
    <P>If in one, two or three years it appears there are better ways of dealing with this issue then, perhaps, the Minister can introduce the necessary measures.  I strongly believe there are better ways of dealing with the issue instead of simply thinking in these terms only.  It is sad that an issue such as this should cause the type of friction and factionalism we experienced before.  The only good thing I can say about this is that it seems to be a great deal less intense than it was previously.  This is probably due to the fact that people have become somewhat more mature in their judgment and are now less likely to jump when certain people crack the whip or make particular statements.</P>
    <P>While I disagree with aspects of the Bill, I fully agree with the principle of it and will vote in favour of it.  I urge other Members to do the same and exhort the Minister for Health to consider the points made by me and Deputy O'Donnell and those which my party leader, Deputy Harney, will make tomorrow.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate and hope my views will be respected for what they are, a positive contribution on what is for many people a difficult issue. I respect the right of people to make known their views and I hope I will be <Col N="400" /> afforded the same right by those who would seek to put me in a corner or stick a label on me.</P>
      <P>The Bill is required under the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution. It is important to remind people of the precise wording of the relevant Article in the Constitution which is as follows:</P>
      <P>The provisions of Article 40.3.3º shall not limit freedom to obtain or to make available in the State, subject to such conditions as may be laid down by law, information relating to services lawfully available in other States.</P>
      <P>Clearly this Bill deals with the provision of information.  Under the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution we, as legislators, are obligated to introduce legislation which will regulate the provision of information on services outside the State for the termination of pregnancies.</P>
      <P>I very much regret the polarisation of views on this issue and our inability to deal logically with the legislation.  Like I am sure other Deputies, I have received numerous telephone calls and letters about this issue.  While I respect people's right to express their views, I wish they would deal with the legislation before the House instead of the substantive issue of abortion which is not dealt with under it.  The electorate has already given its view on the provision of information and we are obliged to introduce this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important to say that like the overwhelming majority of people I am opposed to abortion.  I have no choice but to put that on the record lest somebody takes another interpretation from what I will say.  However, I do not believe that the provision of information on a service legally available in another country will in any way promote, support or encourage its use. Many services legally available in other countries are not available in this country and as a mature society we should not be afraid to provide information on <Col N="401" /> them.  This is not to say that one supports, condones or urges people to use those services.</P>
    <P>We live in a world which has seen an enormous explosion in the provision of information through the use of modern technology. At a time when people are demanding a freedom of information Bill in its broadest terms, it is contradictory of some people to seek to limit information on a service which is legally available in another country.  One cannot adopt an <i>á la carte</i> approach to the provision of information.  By its nature information is non-judgmental and its utilisation is subjective.  What is regarded by some as relevant and important is regarded by others as a threat to society.  The fact that some information is regarded as a threat to society makes it all the more necessary for us to deal with the issue in a professional and mature way.  Surely such information should be dealt openly and honestly rater than filtered through by back door methods or by oblique, subtle and sometimes misleading advertising. Those who take an extreme view against the provision of abortion information should consider the case of a young pregnant woman who in a panic considers no options except abortion and seeks out information on the location of an abortion clinic in the UK.  Having done that, she is more likely to go ahead and have an abortion because she will believe the only way to solve her terrible problem is to terminate the pregnancy. In contrast, a young woman in similar circumstances who knows she can go to her GP or a family planning organisation for professional advice and have the horrors of the physical and mental consequences of an abortion and the alternatives &mdash; on which emphasis should be placed &mdash; explained to her is more likely to opt not to have an abortion. There are many positive elements, to this legislation.</P>
    <P>Surely it is the aim of our society to eliminate the need for women to have abortions in the first place and this can <Col N="402" /> be done only by providing proper information and making it available in a fully inclusive service.  This would not promote abortion but rather curb and reduce substantially the need for women to have abortions.  It is nonsense to suggest we can sweep this information underneath the carpet in the hope that it will be contained in some twilight zone.  Such reaction is that of an immature society lacking confidence in its sense of self worth.</P>
    <P>The extremists who have hijacked this debate should be ashamed.  They lack maturity, understanding, compassion, generosity and above all they seek to defy democracy.  They are wrong to distort this debate.  In the aftermath of the X case the people reacted with genuine compassion and generosity and firmly believed the State should not be in a position to exercise such control over one of its citizens.  The general feeling was that we live in a compassionate society and should seek to be honest, helpful and caring in our approach to such matters.  That led to the constitutional referendum in which the people clearly stated how we should approach abortion.  Fundamentalism in whatever form, or from wherever it comes, must be defeated in the best interests of all who aspire to a modern Ireland.</P>
    <P>We should accept that no matter how well thought out or sensitive, no legislation can hope to satisfy everybody. However, this Bill fairly reflects the thrust of the constitutional amendment made by the people in 1992.  It seeks to put a regulative framework around a very sensitive and difficult issue.  If people concentrate on the contents of this Bill and what it is trying to do, the extreme views on either side can be curbed and we can get down to dealing with the real issues.  I hope the Minister notes the views of Members from all sides.  There is room for improvement, and detailed attention should be given to this on Committee Stage.  The Minister should not seek to shorten the debate on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I fail to understand why the Minister believed it necessary to introduce this <Col N="403" /> legislation now.  He could and should have waited until later in the year when the outstanding judgments before the courts will be made known and when no excuse to seek refuge in awaiting such judgments could be made.  I understand these judgments may not clarify the position and that the Legislature will have to face up to its responsibility to introduce legislation.  This House is the Legislature, not the courts.  I reject suggestions that the primacy of legislative direction rests with the Judiciary.  It does not, and the day we allow the courts to gain primacy over this Legislature we will be heading in the wrong direction.  We should not shirk our responsibilities, rather we should be honest and honourable in what we do. However, the fact that court procedings are awaiting judgments adds to the uncertainty in this case and allows doors to be prized open by people both inside and outside this House.  This would not be the case if the Minister had waited for the court decisions before introducing the legislation.</P>
    <P>The Minister's rush to introduce this legislation has me and others offside. The legislation is sensitive and should not divide the House.  We must strive for consensus on issues such as this.  The Minister should listen to the views of all Members and if necessary delay the passing of the Bill to achieve the necessary consensus.  He isolated potential supporters by its sudden introduction without the ground work being prepared and with court decisions pending. The Minister, Deputy Noonan, has an experienced track record in Government. He is a shrewd operator and understands the difficulties that can arise.  Having regard to that, it is baffling that he took this approach.</P>
    <P>I attended my party's four and a half hour parliamentary party meeting on this issue and at no stage was a concerted political approach taken to the Bill.  The views expressed were deeply held and many and wide ranging concerns were expressed about the legislation. To suggest that this is Fianna Fáil <Col N="404" /> up to its old tricks in Opposition is wrong.  That is not the case and it is most unhelpful to the passage of this Bill and to those of us seeking to bring about a consensus on this issue to suggest that such is the basis of Fianna Fáil's opposition.</P>
    <P>The leadership of Fianna Fáil supports the decision in the 1992 constitutional referendum and the need to legislate on the basis of that positive decision taken by the Irish people, but we want to do more.  We want to ensure that the thrust of this legislation can make a significant contribution to reducing substantially the numbers of young women who, for whatever reason, believe their pregnancies must end in abortion.  This can only be done by laying the greatest emphasis possible on counselling and family planning services. We need to substantially improve resourcing both in terms of people and financial support in this area.  The Bill does not go far enough in that regard and we will seek to improve that aspect of it.  Nobody in Fianna Fáil supports abortion or the referral by a doctor or organisation of women to a clinic outside this country to have an abortion.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that a proper inclusive and professionally managed counselling policy on all the issues can positively reduce the number of women seeking abortions.  I can only speak in the abstract.  Only a woman who has gone through it can really understand.  When women realise the trauma and the terrible physical pain and mental anguish involved in such a course of action, and when they fully understand all the alternatives available, coupled with tangible support, then the numbers seeking abortion can be significantly reduced.  Surely that is the real objective of every Member and of the people.</P>
    <P>Those who are misquoting and misrepresenting this legislation are doing a disservice as much to themselves as to anybody else by not encouraging those who want a fully inclusive mature service of the highest professional standards maintained here.  When all the detail is faced up to, the net effect will <Col N="405" /> be that the number of people seeking an abortion abroad will be substantially reduced.</P>
    <P>There was a time when we thought that to have sex education in our schools would promote promiscuity, and look how far we have travelled on that issue, to the betterment of everyone concerned.  We are dealing with another such issue which must be dealt with in an honest and compassionate way.  We cannot shirk our responsibility no matter how painful and difficult it may be. We should not fear information because if we do we lose a little of our dignity. Developing self worth and confidence in our society is not easy.  Extreme views seek to threaten, not bring about a consensus, and we have had enough experience of this on the island of Ireland in the past two decades.</P>
    <P>This House has the mechanisms and should have the capacity to build consensus on this issue.  This is the challenge that the Minister faces in steering this Bill successfully through the House, and I hope he will consider some of the comments I made.  A valid point that should be made is that we should not shirk our responsibility to deal with the difficult issues irrespective of from where the pressure comes.  We could gain much merit if the Minister and the Government stood back and listened to those who seek to support him, and help those women who find themselves in the difficult and tragic circumstances of having to take the boat or the plane across the water.  We should be doing much more if we are the caring society we like to tell ourselves we are.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  Like other Members I find it difficult to speak about the trauma many people are faced with.  I compliment the Minister on his courage in bringing this legislation before the House.  He could easily have backed down and left it aside.  However, since I came into this House in 1987 I have come to recognise Deputy Noonan as a man of integrity, a decent man and a good family man.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="406" /> To the people who say that this Bill is being rushed and that more time should be given to debate it, I say we have waited too long.  We have ignored this problem and have often pretended it did not exist.  It has been swept under the carpet and many can tell tragic tales of young girls in difficult situations leaving this country to seek a service which is wrong and which I condemn out of hand.  Abortion is wrong but it is sheer hypocrisy to say that banning information will deal with the problem.  That is side-tracking the issue.  This country is awash with information about where abortions are available outside the State.  What we need are back-up services for the young women who find themselves in this difficult situation.</P>
    <P>Perhaps we should ask why this is happening to such an extent.  It is not new.  There have been many sad cases. One sticks is my mind, that of a back street abortionist more than 40 years ago.  Why is this happening to such an extent at this time?  Is it a breakdown of society?  Is it that our young people cannot comprehend that life is not as it is portrayed in films and glossy magazines? Is it lack of education?  Is it lack of parental guidance?  I cannot say. Nobody can point the finger because this unfortunate situation can affect any family.</P>
    <P>What is needed is support and I congratulate the Minister on providing £200,000 for organisations to help and advise women.  It will not be enough, and it is not good enough that services to advise women will only be available in our larger cities.  This is a nation-wide problem, it is as prevalent in rural Ireland as it is in our larger cities.  There are many good organisations trying to deal with it.  I know of the work of CURA, a Catholic Church agency, and of the work of Life Ireland, an interdenominational organisation.  However, these organisations are under-staffed and under-funded.  If women can be directed towards good counselling we can help encourage them not to leave this country for abortions.  However, if, having received good medical and social <Col N="407" /> advice, a woman decides that she cannot continue with the pregnancy, I will not condemn her, nor could I.  Who am I to judge?  That unfortunate person will be in greater need of help and counselling when she returns.  If we can provide that counselling then Deputy Noonan's courage in bringing this problem into the open will have done much good for the women of Ireland.</P>
    <P>Information is available in magazines, at third level education centres and in English newspapers circulating here.  It is not good enough that information is channelled in this way.  If a woman has a problem she should be able to turn to someone.  That is not the case at present. It is not uncommon for a young woman to attend a clinic and say she does not want her parents and family to know she is pregnant and to ask what she should do.  The best any public representative can do is advise her to go to her local social welfare office or health centre. They however, do not have the expertise or the time to deal with the problem.</P>
    <P>There should be a free telephone help line, as many young women are unable to confide in their families and friends and may run away from the problem, which is quite natural.  If young women living in Cavan could travel to Galway or young women living in Galway could travel to Limerick, Cork or Dublin where they know they would be safe and receive good advice, I have no doubt the number who decide to leave this country to have abortions could be greatly reduced.  I do not accept that the figure stands at between 2,000 and 3,000 but certainly hundreds of young women leave these shores.  If we can prevent one person only from leaving we will have done something good.  With good advice and counselling we can prevent many from leaving.</P>
    <P>People are prepared to give such advice to young women whose minds are in turmoil and who do not know where to turn &mdash; I am not referring to institutions of which we had enough in the past.  While they tried to help and <Col N="408" /> felt they were doing good work some of the treatment meted out to unfortunate young women could not be described as Christian.  I am aware of a couple in the west who are extremely well off &mdash; the husband has a good accountancy practice and the wife a legal practice &mdash; and who are so thankful that they have been able to rear their children without any great difficulty that they are prepared to open their door to a complete stranger. That is Christian charity and there are many others who are prepared to do likewise provided they receive support and back-up services so that they can provide proper information and guide the young women on the courses of action open to them other than abortion. With the help of such people we can deal with this problem.</P>
    <P>It would be wrong to point the finger at any one strand of society as this problem transcends all strands.  There is a need for education and awareness programmes targeted at young people who are living in good times and have great opportunities which they should not throw away by engaging in casual sexual activities which should not happen outside marriage.  Perhaps I am old fashioned but that is my view.  The consequences of this is often that the life of a lonely young woman whose mind is in turmoil has been destroyed because her so-called boyfriend has left her in the lurch.  For many, the lonely trip across the sea by boat to a strange city must be traumatic.  They return home eventually and hide from their friends and neighbours. That is not Christian charity and no one can condone it; we must do our utmost to prevent it and we can prevent it by helping these young women.  This help will not come from those who lift a telephone and abuse me telling me that I am breaking the commandments and am a murderer.  I resent such a campaign. God help any young woman who feels it necessary to call upon any one of them.</P>
    <P>I thank the many people who telephoned and wrote to me at home to express their points of view.  I accept and appreciate their points of view and <Col N="409" /> have made my view clear.  When this legislation is enacted there should be an adequately financed nation-wide service so that young women can be cared for. If this is done we will have done a good day's work and for once faced up to an issue which has been ignored for far too long and done ourselves credit as legislators. I am not worried about those who say we are opening the door to abortion.  I resent this: they should be the last to pass judgment on anyone.</P>

Sin mí-bhuntáiste atá ag na fir anseo.</P>
      <P>So far this has been a balanced, reasonably fair and unemotive debate, conducted, unfortunately, in the main among members of the Opposition.  This is a great pity as I have no doubt members of the Government parties have much to contribute.  While I hold strong views which could be described as old fashioned I am surprised at the extent to which I find myself in agreement with most of what has been said, including what has been said by those who hold widely divergent views.  These are reflected in the contributions of members of all parties.</P>
      <P>The Minister may have erred on two fronts.  First, in his own contribution he allowed his deep antipathy towards the Fianna Fáil Party to colour his approach in a most unhelpful manner.  Second, it was a fundamental error to introduce this legislation virtually under cover of the Framework Document because the effect was to demean both.  I do not believe that was the Minister's intention, nevertheless, it has tended to colour the whole proceedings in an unhelpful manner.</P>
      <P>While I hold strong views on this issue, I respect those who hold the opposite view and who come into this Chamber, or any forum, and enunciate those views clearly and logically.  The more I listen to these proceedings, the more I come to the view that those &mdash; on both sides &mdash; who choose to sit on the fence contribute the least and do the most damage to the debate.</P>
      <P>The timing of the Bill is inexplicable in view of the outstanding issues before the courts.  The 1983 amendment was adjudicated upon by the Supreme Court in the X case.  Many people expressed the view that the decision of the Supreme Court went against what they voted for at the time of the referendum and that colours my view in relation to legislation and amendments.  It is very useful to have the court's view and, in this instance, it would have been particularly advantageous to have the outcome of the cases still pending.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="411" /> In this regard I strongly disagree with Deputy Dukes who appears to have drawn the opposite conclusions in relation to the eighth amendment and the constitutional findings on it by the Supreme Court.  I agree with him that people who do not know anything about constitutional matters &mdash; and I confess to being one of them &mdash; do not make any contribution when they seek to have an input to preparing wordings for such amendments.  However, I disagree strongly with him in his other apparent conclusion that legislation should proceed in this case without the benefit of relevant court judgments because history teaches us the opposite.  Having listened to Deputy Dukes's contribution today and on numerous other occasions. I am constantly amazed that a position in Government could not have been found for him.</P>
    <P>I also disagree with Deputy Dukes that this issue can and should be &ldquo;put to bed&rdquo;.  In the United States and Britain the whole abortion debate continues to rage despite virtually all legal constraints having been removed on both jurisdictions.  I was in the United States over Christmas and the early part of the year and I was astounded at the level of debate that surrounded the whole abortion issue.  It related to particular attacks at abortion clinics but it was a most heated debate and reflected as close to what we have seen here as one would possibly expect.</P>
    <P>This whole area evokes strong emotions and reactions and will never be far removed from the political agenda.  Therefore, it is best to face the issue honestly and honourably and to seek a logical baseline for this country. The Minister's approach is most disturbing as his personal confidence in his own Bill is clearly at issue.  It is obvious that he was relieved to be able to give vent to his anti-Fianna Fáil feelings in his opening address.  It is to his great discredit that his contribution is the only one so far which is blatantly divisive along party political lines in a debate on a matter which merits careful and <Col N="412" /> measured contributions.  The two speakers immediately following the Minister, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn and Deputy O'Donnell, were the direct opposite in that they sought to give genuinely and strongly held views &mdash; although I disagree strongly with one of them &mdash; and did not introduce this singularly unhelpful element of divisiveness.</P>
    <P>Members contributing to this debate should consider their positions carefully and speak from a genuine commitment that is clearly thought out but that also leaves room for listening to the views of other people.  In that way I hope a consensus will be reached which will reflect the needs of the people at this time and uphold the traditions which are held by people both inside and outside this Chamber.</P>
    <P>In this regard I empathise with Deputy Harte who I understand is in a position, not dissimilar to my own two years ago, in relation to his party.  I suppose some people would find some poetic justice in the turnaround of events.  On the Shannon issue, Deputy Noonan was praised for having worded a motion which allowed all in his own party &mdash; even those who would happily close the gates at Shannon Airport and throw away the key &mdash; to close ranks, support the motion and force some of us into a difficult position which we had to deal with at the time.  Deputy Noonan was always a promising Minister in Opposition.  He is a Minister now but apparently he is unable to devise a Bill which is acceptable to all in his own party.  Having gone through the same difficult time which Deputy Harte, and perhaps some others, appear to be going through now, I empathise with him and wish him well in whatever he decides to do.  I am tempted to conclude that perhaps the Taoiseach has a sense of humour after all in appointing Deputy Noonan to his position.  If he was not owed favours, he might not have got it.</P>
    <P>My difficulty with the Bill is that I am unable to separate the issue which the Minister is trying to address from the basic issue of abortion.  I believe in the fundamental right to life.  The most <Col N="413" /> common statement that has been made is that we are all anti-abortion and pro-life but we all mean different things when we say that even though we make that statement with great honesty and integrity.  I cannot and do not differentiate between the quality of life of a baby five months after birth and its quality of life five months before birth. If anybody can tell me that there is a difference, let them do so.</P>
    <P>The bottom line is whether the occupant of a womb is a person, in other words, a human life.  If not, is an abortion logically indistinguishable from the procedure involved in removing a wart, tonsils, etc.?  My view &mdash; and this is shared by many people who oppose abortion &mdash; is that it is a human life and that colours my approach to all the issues which arise from that.  I realise it is an unfashionable view and one that leaves me open to attack from all sides. In political terms it seems that the anti-abortion position is the most difficult to sustain in the present climate but it must be done by people who perhaps have no other choice in this regard.</P>
    <P>Of course, there are cases when the taking of a life may be justified.  We would all defend our right to do whatever was required in self-defence.  There is a lively ongoing debate on capital punishment and, while I am opposed to it, I have heard strongly expressed views in its favour.  Also, it is frequently argued that a women who has been raped should have the right to an abortion and the X case, involving a 14 year old girl, went along those lines.  If I genuinely believed that having an abortion would help a woman in the long term, I would find it hard as a parent to deny her that right and I would be very much inclined to go along with whatever would make her life, and that of her family, easier and I believe that would be the view of everybody in the Chamber.  I would much more comfortably question the right to life of the rapist or the person who committed the crime.  Perhaps it is a fundamental flaw in society that we tend to ignore the difficulties that beset the victims of crime.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="414" /> It appears we are saying that children of rapists are in some way less worthy of life than others.  While that is understandable in terms of the personal difficulties of the girl involved, if logically followed it may lead to a very awkward and difficult situation.  If on the other hand &mdash; this is the nub of the problem &mdash; we decide there are circumstances in which abortion ought to be made available, surely the means we are adopting not just in this Bill but in the way we approach the entire matter as a people and a Legislature is grossly demeaning. That is particularly reflected in this Bill. What we seem to be saying to the woman is that we consider the choice of abortion wrong but if she slips away to Britain or elsewhere to have her pregnancy terminated we will turn a blind eye and perhaps even provide a few signposts along the way.</P>
    <P>The subliminal message from the people is a negative one which has the effect of heaping guilt on an already crisis torn and vulnerable person.  That is not helped by the current approach. Fundamental errors were made particularly in the 1992 referendum because the question was not put as clearly as it ought to have been, and that is no wonder in view of the misunderstandings, contradictions and diverging views expressed in the debate of the last few days.  Ultimately we must decide whether we support abortion.  If we do, we must provide a service in whatever circumstances we consider appropriate. If we oppose abortion we should take a proactive approach in terms of counselling and support systems for women with crisis pregnancies.  I strongly support and advocate a more honest and effective approach to counselling.  I very much regret that because I hold such views and try to express them as clearly and honestly as I can, I leave myself open to personal attack.  I do not mind being old-fashioned because my children have made me feel so old-fashioned that I think nothing that is said in the media, here or elsewhere would make a difference.  I believe that <Col N="415" /> the fundamental right to hold that view is under threat.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister for providing extra resources for counselling, but the ultimate effect of this Bill if passed in its present form will be to increase the number of abortions performed on Irish women.  How can the position be otherwise when the clear signal is towards acceptance of termination as a valid form of contraception?  That is not helpful. A different approach is required.  I have grave reservations about section 2.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies have indicated that they have been inundated with phone calls, letters and so on about this matter.  I am somewhat disappointed I received only two such phone calls, one of which was pro-choice and had the effect of convincing me of the opposite view; the other was pro-life and had the effect of weakening my convictions in that regard.  I have not found the lobbying from either side very convincing. Personal attacks on Deputies and Ministers and their families should be condemned. They should not influence legislators.</P>
    <P>This is a difficult subject.  I accept a substantial number of Irish women travel aborad to terminate pregnancies.  I would like to influence a reduction in that number.  I genuinely wish to see the State taking a proactive approach in supporting, counselling and helping women before they make the decision, and after the abortion if that is what they decide.  We have not done that in the proper manner but it is not too late to change that approach.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the effects of the Bill, particularly sections 2 and 5 about which I have grave reservations and which, I hope, will be amended.  On occasion the Minister has indicated to the media that he is more open to amendments than he indicated in the House.  I welcome that.  Ultimately there is a responsibility on this House and the Oireachtas generally to address the difficult problems arising from the multiple amendments of the Constitution and the <Col N="416" /> decisions on them by the courts.  A difficulty arises in that there is not a clearly laid out path for the Oireachtas to follow. It is likely that whatever legislation is ultimately passed will be open to challenge in the courts and may be overturned despite the best attempts to get it right, balanced and as fair as possible. Despite the fact that there are widely diverging views on this subject, consensus may emerge and we may take a more honest approach to a matter that creates grave difficulty for individuals and reflects very poorly on us as a State.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch" hpid="Kathleen Lynch Kathleen Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Kathleen Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure the last speaker his ideas are exceptionally old-fashioned, but being old-fashioned does not necessarily mean one is wrong.  For time immemorial women have held the view that they are the best judges of how to protect the children they carry and deliver.  I find it grossly insulting as a woman to be told I am not to be trusted to make the right decision for myself and my family.  I find it equally insulting that someone would equate abortion with the removal of a wart.  A woman would never make such an equation. It is frightening to hear people speak in such a cool and dispassionate manner.  This is not a debate that can be dealt with in that way.  It is a debate which will stir the emotions of most people involved.</P>
      <P>I am not a person who believes that only women have a view on this subject. There are as many compassionate men in the world as there are compassionate women, and that has been proved here tonight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies have made speeches with which I could not disagree, but I cannot agree with their conclusions that they will have to vote against the Bill because of its presentation, the guillotine and so on.  This has nothing to do with the Bill and how we intend to deal with it.  The previous speaker objected to it strongly on moral grounds, and he is entitled to do that.  In the main, the telephone calls I have received on this issue were polite but one was abusive which is to be expected when an issue <Col N="417" /> evokes particular emotions.  I believe in the right to free speech and the day I stop believing in that I will contribute no longer to public life.  Equally, I believe the person best suited to make a decision about how she lives her life should have the wherewithal to make that decision.</P>
    <P>It is very easy to talk about the 4,500-6,000 women who cross the Irish Sea to terminate crisis pregnancies but each and every one is an individual, not all young women, whose circumstances are individual to her.  We need to put to bed the idea that a woman always makes the decision on her own.  Many of these decisions are reached with a husband or partner for health reasons although others may be reached because of rape or incest.  It is difficult to arrive at this decision and it is the last possible option.  Yet, we insist that on her return she may never again speak about the trauma she has gone through to her friends or family if they do not know about it already.</P>
    <P>We are only beginning to recognise what childbirth means to women.  We have not yet grown up sufficiently to recognise that the number of Irish women having abortions has not altered over the years in spite of the fact that births outside marriage have become socially acceptable and young girls can keep their babies with the support of the State. Births outside marriage are no longer a stigma but the number of Irish women having abortions in England has not decreased.  Has it ever occurred to people that these women simply cannot complete a pregnancy for whatever reason and that no matter what we do this service will be necessary?</P>
    <P>When the three amendments were put to the people in a referendum, they voted very clearly and gave a decisive &ldquo;yes&rdquo; answer to two and &ldquo;no&rdquo; to the other.  I was amazed it was so clear-cut and that tells me that the Irish people knew exactly what they were doing. When it comes to compassion, sometimes the people put us to shame.  They react instinctively as a compassionate <Col N="418" /> people, a trait we have shown in other areas.  I do not know of anyone who will say he or she believes in abortion.  It is a last possible resort and we all know that.  When the people were presented with the plight of the 14 year old rape victim they thought of her in terms of their own daughters.  That is how we should look at this issue.  We should look at the plight of the individual and deal with her as if she were our own.</P>
    <P>We do not have the ideal solution but if we do not deal with the issue now the circumstances will arise again and again and eventually we will have to deal with it.  People are entitled to hold different opinions but this matter requires compassion, trust and a belief that people are entitled to make a decision having all the available information.  Surveys have shown that a percentage of Irish women change their minds when counselled by English doctors.  I am convinced the same will happen as soon as we start to provide the counselling service which the English have provided for us.  I welcome the funding for support agencies who have been doing for years a job that the State should have done, but again we refused to face up to that.  We must now face up to the situation.</P>
    <P>We do not want to be in the position we are in now.  We would prefer all to be right with the world and not to need this measure, but that is not the case. We need it for very definite reasons.  In the past week we have heard statements designed to confuse people.  A very eminent High Court judge reminded us on the 50th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz of those who remained silent during the Holocaust.</P>
    <P>I find it deeply offensive that anyone, particularly a respected judge, should choose to compare women in crisis pregnancies with those who perpetrated the wholesale slaughter of six million people.  Mr. Justice O'Hanlon is entitled to his opinion on this legislation but he is not entitled to refer to women in this fashion.  In a lengthy statement the Archbishop of Dublin criticised the Bill in terms specifically designed to mislead <Col N="419" /> the public further.  Fortunately the laws of the land are made by the Legislature, not by judges or by any church.</P>

      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Wallace.  Exactly three weeks ago on February 21, I first raised the issue of the impending crisis at Sunbeam Industries in an effort to alert the Minister and Government to the serious developments there.  On almost every sitting day in the meantime, I have attempted to raise the issue either on the Order of Business or by way of Private Notice Question in an attempt to shake the Government out of its complacency and get it to intervene in time to save the jobs in Sunbeam.  Today, three weeks later, the grim position has worsened.  Unless a successful buyout package can be negotiated immediately the plant will close on Friday, March 10 and 108 workers stand to lose their jobs. This must not be allowed to happen.  It would be a mortal blow to the workers, their families and the local economy in north Cork city.  This area has suffered severely over the last 12 years as a result of the collapse of a range of traditional industries.  One more closure could not be sustained in this area of chronically high unemployment.  The position at Sunbeam must be confronted with all the resources we can command.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to bring two factors to the Minister's notice.  First, the production capability of the plant is very strong. There is a highly motivated workforce, <Col N="420" /> many of whom are so dedicated that they have not taken annual holidays for three years.  Such a workforce cannot lightly be thrown on the scrap heap. Second, market opportunities for the product are very good.  There is a strong, solid customer base and there are orders to the value of £2.5 million on the order books as we speak.  This is not an ailing industry but one worth intervening in and throwing a lifeline to at this juncture.</P>
    <P>Speed is of the essence.  Orders for summer stock are now coming in and if Sunbeam cannot meet them immediately the business will go elsewhere and the long term viability of the plant will be in serious jeopardy.  I appeal to the Minister to leave no stone unturned, to use all the resources as his command to ensure a successful buyout takes place without delay and that the jobs in Sunbeam get the same level of attention as was given to the jobs in Packard and Irish Steel.  An equivalent amount must be invested in this plant to save those jobs.</P>

      <P>I thank the Deputy for affording me an opportunity to join with her in expressing my serious concern at the position in Sunbeam which I outlined on the Adjournment two weeks ago.  The Minister gave certain assurances that his Department and Forbairt would be available immediately to assist Sunbeam in every possible way.  Unfortunately the position has deteriorated rapidly.  Far from finding a solution, on Friday next the company will go into liquidation.  I said we could not afford to lose 110 jobs in the region.  Not only those with jobs would suffer but their families and others in the community.  I am sorry to say that I have not seen any evidence of the commitment given by the Minister regarding the situation I outlined two weeks ago.  Deputy Quill mentioned the commitments given elsewhere in the country but such a commitment has not been evident in the case <Col N="421" /> of Sunbeam.  I appeal to the Minister to ensure within the next 24 hours that the factory will not close.  If it does the implications for north Cork, which cannot sustain such a closure, will be horrific.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>The commitment given that my Department and its agencies would make every effort to deal with this problem has been honoured. An enormous amount of work has been put into trying to find a solution to the problem and we are continuing to do so at a difficult time and in difficult circumstances.</P>
      <P>There is no question of complacency on my part or on the part of the agencies who work on my behalf.  As Minister I must work within the law.  I do not have the capacity to put money into any company.  As Deputy Wallace knows, Forbairt must recommend the proposals. It is important that the House be aware of the capacities and limitations of Ministers.  I assure Deputies that I have worked diligently on this issue. Since 16 February, when we last discussed the matter, I have been conscious of the concerns of the workforce about the future.</P>
      <P>Robert Andrews Textiles, the knitwear company, is run as a separate operation and has incurred serious losses since its start-up.  These became particularly acute over the course of the last year.  The accumulated losses have caused serious cashflow problems and led to the decision to put Robert Andrews Textiles into voluntary liquidation.</P>
      <P>Since its establishment, Sunbeam has achieved big sales growth in all its operations. Regrettably, growth in sales has not been matched by growth in profits, mainly due to difficult trading conditions in the domestic market, high overhead costs and lack of finance to invest in more up to date machinery and equipment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since Sunbeam Industries was formed in 1990 the IDA, and now Forbairt, have made sustained and substantive <Col N="422" /> efforts to aid the company in its endeavours to achieve its target sales growth and commercial viability in a particularly difficult and challenging sector. This included substantial State funds for investment and working capital purposes which I outlined previously to Deputy Dan Wallace.</P>
    <P>When I became aware of the recent problems at Sunbeam Industries I asked the competitiveness and employment protection unit of my Department to work closely with Forbairt and the company in their effort to secure the future of the Sunbeam operation in Cork.  Forbairt engaged a range of external consultants to assess the financial position at Sunbeam and to advise on its future viability, including the question of a management buy-out of Robert Andrews Textiles.  Forbairt has given detailed consideration to all the data at its disposal arising from these reports and is continuing its discussions with all interested parties regarding the various options to secure the future of the Sunbeam facilities at Cork.  The question of attracting an outside investor who would be interested in becoming involved in the Sunbeam operation is also being addressed.</P>
    <P>As the Deputies will know, I had a very informative and constructive meeting earlier this evening with Ministers and a number of Members of the Oireachtas, including the two present from the Cork area, about the Sunbeam position and have also had discussions with the promoters of the management buy-out proposal for the knitwear company. The management buy-out group submitted a revised proposal which I have asked Forbairt, which was also represented at this evening's meeting, to consider overnight.  A short while ago I had discussions with the chief executive and the chairperson of Forbairt about the need to address this issue as a matter of extreme urgency.  I have been assured by Forbairt that they are exploring every avenue possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I should be glad to share my time with my constituency colleague, Deputy Paul Bradford.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Deenihan, on his appointment and wish him every success in his endeavours to bring about a more successful and profitable agricultural industry.  I have no doubt that he will be successful in that aim.</P>
      <P>It gives me no joy to raise such an important matter on the Adjournment as three weeks only remain of the quota year 1994-95.  This country to date has 12 million gallons of milk above quota at a cost of £16 million to our farmers and the State.  A huge amount of money must be found.  This is the highest recorded increase since the quota was introduced many years ago.</P>
      <P>I am firmly convinced that, were the quota based on the calendar year, it would not be as difficult for farmers to control the problem but they have no choice at present.  I would urge the Minister of State to renegotiate the terms of the superlevy in Brussels, ensuring that it is based on the calendar year.  Up to 1 January last 4,000 farmers had been affected and had not received any milk cheques for four months.  Since then an additional 2,000 farmers have been penalised, representing a total of 6,000 farmers.</P>
      <P>This island is entitled to some concession from the European Union.  In this respect I shall outline a number of options to the Minister which I have no doubt he will take on board.  Since he fully understands the position, I am convinced he will do his level best.  There should be agreement on both sides of the House on this very important matter. The quota year 1994-95 should be rolled over into 1995-96 because of the bad weather and high costs of production and the consequent hardships. That would be a good option and allow all farmers to be paid for milk supplied in 1994-95.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other option I propose is that the <Col N="424" /> Minister seek a meeting with his agricultural counterparts in the Commission, requesting that the rules be relaxed on the transfer of milk from one member state to another.  I understand that the Netherlands is 0.03 per cent under quota and Germany 2 per cent under quota.  These two countries have a huge milk pool.  The Commission should divide the flexi-milk available from those countries between all the countries over quota.  Since we have one of the smallest quotas and gallonages within the European Union, if that proposal were accepted we would overcome our difficulty, thus allowing farmers to be paid. This represents a very constructive option which should be pursued.</P>
    <P>The Minister should also seek a concession from the European Union that excess quota milk be processed at dairies, allowing farmers to recoup that milk for domestic usage and animal feedstuffs. That should have been an option long before now in other years when we had excess quota.</P>
    <P>Many farmers are almost facing bankruptcy and will be unable to maintain themselves, their families or their livestock or to buy feedstuffs.  I am convinced that some farmers will have to dispose of assets to overcome this crisis. I urge the Minister to seek some help from the financial institutions in making soft loans available to farmers, at low interest rates, to allow them overcome these difficulties.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy O'Keeffe for sharing his time, even if he is doing it in the same unequal fashion in which he shares votes in the Cork East constituency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is an extremely serious issue, not just for farmers in the Cork East constituency but nationwide.  I welcome the fact that Deputy O'Keeffe has put forward some constructive proposals on the manner in which this problem can be tackled.  It is always easy to highlight difficulties but much more difficult to resolve them.  I wish to place on record my previous support for the concept of a January to December milk quota year, <Col N="425" /> a matter I raised on a number of occasions in recent years with the former Minister, Deputy Joe Walsh.  The calendar year would make a lot of sense, giving farmers control over their milk production at a crucial time in the year. While it will not solve the problem for the current milk marketing year I hope the Minister will examine if for 1995-96.</P>
    <P>Like Deputy Ned O'Keeffe, I appeal to the Minister and his Minister of State to do everything possible to alleviate the great distress the present milk quota surplus is causing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Deenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Ned O'Keeffe for raising this matter this evening and for allowing Deputy Bradford to share his time.  Obviously the relationship between the two Members is very good and long may it continue.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Bradford said, it is always easy to be critical and apportion blame but Deputy O'Keeffe put forward some constructive proposals worthy of examination, something on which we can speak at greater length later.  The Minister and I are concerned about the milk quota.  It is our hope that measures can be taken by farmers themselves to reduce their burden somewhat, although they will have to exercise much discipline over the coming three to four weeks to safeguard against further losses.</P>
      <P>The milk quota system is, as the term implies a method of restricting the level of milk production.  Like all other member states in the European Union, Ireland has a national milk quota and can therefore, produce up to that level without penalty.  Milk production in excess of the national quota is however, subject to a superlevy.  Superlevy liability is calculated in accordance with EU legislation on the basis of actual milk deliveries to registered milk purchasers in the milk quota year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Producers are advised by these co-operatives/dairies on a regular basis of their milk quota position.  My Department also issues regular statements on <Col N="426" /> the milk quota position nationally.  Producers who exceed their quota are advised to keep in contact with their own co-operative/dairy or with their Teagasc advisor who will advise on practical measures which will help to reduce their milk deliveries.  A reduction in the milk yield may be possible by reducing feed to some extent in certain circumstances.  Surplus milk can also be fed to calves.  The milk quota system has been in place for over a decade. In overall terms we have managed to fill our national quota to full advantage. Significant superlevy bills have only arisen in two years out of ten.</P>
    <P>In the context of the quota situation this year.  I suggest that any proposals for reducing or even averting superlevy liability which are not legally practicable are unhelpful at this stage of the quota year in that false hopes of avoiding a levy liability may be raised.  We also need to be careful that we do not pursue short term solutions which could work to our disadvantage in either the medium or long term.</P>
    <P>Certain measures are in place within the various milk quota arrangements which help to minimise, in so far as possible, the levy liability of priority category producers.  Small-scale producers with quotas of less than 30,000 gallons, for whom a levy liability is particularly severe are, for example, given first priority access to any unused reference quantities available at the end of the milk quota year.  Apart from this entitlement to flexi-milk, these producers are also given first priority under other milk quota schemes such as temporary leasing and restructuring.  Therefore the system has been biased in favour of the small to medium producer.</P>
    <P>From a practical viewpoint, therefore, I can only urge producers to consider their circumstances carefully, bearing in mind the financial consequences of a levy liability.  Much can be done between now and the end of the quota year to further reduce the potential liability if individual producers and purchasers continue to monitor their situation carefully.  I, too, favour following <Col N="427" /> the calendar year in this regard and that is something this nation must consider seriously.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The announcement by the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, Deputy Lowry, of a competition to select a single competitor for Telecom Éireann's mobile phone service is a correct decision in principle, but completely wrong in the proposed method of selecting a winner from the various bidders.  Ireland is one of only two EU countries not to have a second cellular operator and EU competition policy now dictates that Ireland makes speedy progress on the issue.</P>
      <P>Ireland has some 80,000 mobile phones which are becoming less and less the preserve of the &ldquo;yuppy&rdquo; and increasingly more important for business and personal life.  For doctors, drivers, salespeople, tradespeople and professionals across the spectrum the mobile phone is a very valuable business tool.  I understand the number of users could grow to 250,000 in the next five years.</P>
      <P>It is in Ireland's interest, therefore, to increase its access.  At present only 2.3 per cent of Irish people have such phones compared to 11 per cent of Norwegians, 5 per cent of Britons and 3 per cent of Germans and Italians.  This is not, therefore, a decision about some latest technological fad but rather a very critical one about improving Ireland's competitive edge in trade and commerce.</P>
      <P>It follows then that what is required is a second licence in Ireland which will provide fair but real competition to the present Telecom Éireann system.  In the absence of this real competition the market will not fully develop and tariffs will remain among the highest in the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister stated that his invitation to tender is not based on an auction but his documentation clearly states that <Col N="428" /> applicants must decide, &ldquo;the amount the applicant is prepared to pay for the right to the licence&rdquo;.  That is the wording of the Minister's invitation.  The only reference to tariffs or prices charged to the consumer is that the applicant must indicate his or her &ldquo;Approach to Tariffing&rdquo;. This is just a crude auction to the highest bidder and is engaging in a law of the jungle type destructive selling off of a valuable state asset without thinking through the consequences.  This auction approach places a heavy burden on the new operator who is forced to recoup his or her very high cash bid from the unsuspecting telephone user, thus keeping charges to the consumer artificially high.</P>
    <P>The report of the European Union Commission, DG13, suggests that auctions are not the best way and European experience, generally, bears this out. The apparent attraction of a large initial cash fee &mdash; some say up to £30 million &mdash; dissipates as the new operator passes on this fee to the unsuspecting consumer. High prices will of course reduce market growth and lead to reduced usage and penetration.</P>
    <P>The Government must realise that it will be very difficult for any Irish consortium to afford such a huge up-front cash sum while, perhaps, overseas bidders with access to cheap capital determined to make a good financial purchase will be attracted to the deal.</P>
    <P>A decision on an auction basis will focus bidders on the resale value of the licence rather than on the opportunities to develop the system.  The Minister must now change his approach in the interests of competition and in the interest of ensuring a fair bidding system. He should be fair to multinationals but also to Irish bidders.</P>
    <P>An alternative course of action is to have a low up-front fee of a few million pounds combined with a yearly royalty to the State from the winning consortium. Part of that alternative is to make the bidders compete on what they will charge to the public, in other words, on their tariff cards.  Whichever group can offer the best deal to Irish business and <Col N="429" /> consumers should be awarded the licence and not just the consortium that can produce the fattest up-front cash payment.</P>
    <P>I notice also that while the Minister proposes to seek a huge up-front fee from the new operator, he does not propose to seek a similar fee from Telecom Eircell.  If it is his intention to ensure a level playing field and to have Eircell established as an arms length company, how does he account for that decision?</P>
    <P>It is important also, that full transparency be observed in this important decision.  For that reason the Minister should establish an independent assessment system and publish the weightings to be given to the various criteria so that the relative importance of the lump sum <i>vis-á-vis</i> other criteria can be publicly established.</P>
    <P>The role of the independent regulator needs clear and urgent legislation and I look forward to the Minister's proposals in this area soon.</P>
    <P>The Government indicated the interconnect charges that will be charged by Telecom Éireann to its new competitor for use of Telecom's interconnection facilities.  To ensure fairness, it is important that these charges are independently verified and enforced by the new regulator.  For this reason also legislation to establish the regulator is urgent and should be brought before the Dáil in advance of any licence being awarded.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Lowry) Michael Lowry">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Lowry)</NameTxt>
      <P>I announced on 2 March 1995 a competition leading to the award of a GSM mobile telephony licence for a single competitor for Telecom Éireann's mobile phone service run by Eircell.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is considerable interest among players in the market in this competition and I emphasised in announcing the competition that I want to license a new operator who will be a key player in increasing the mobile market and reducing mobile tariffs in Ireland.  This is not an auction where the cheque for the largest amount will win the licence <Col N="430" /> regardless.  My aim is to see real competition in the market and a good deal for consumers.</P>
    <P>The size of the fee is for applicants to propose and neither I nor my Department have at any stage indicated publicly the level of fee that might be expected or acceptable.  The fee proposed must leave room, having regard to normal commercial requirements for a return on investment, for a credible business plan to develop the market and provide effective competition for Eircell, choice of service and a good deal for consumers.</P>
    <P>The objective of the licensing process is to promote the development of the mobile telephony market in Ireland through the introduction of competition and consumer choice.  It is anticipated that this initiative will lead to a quantum increase in the number of people using mobile phones, cheaper equipment, reduced rental charges and lower call tariffs.  Greater maturity in the mobile sector in Ireland, particularly because of the benefits to business will be a factor in stimulating economic activity and enhancing the international competitiveness of the economy.</P>
    <P>Mobile telephony is a highly profitable business which is expanding rapidly all over Europe, the time is right for Ireland to introduce choice into the mobile market.  Competition in this area will be good for Ireland in that it will lead to more mobile phones which are cheaper to own and operate.  The penetration of mobile telephony in Ireland is low at 2.3 per cent particularly by comparison with countries such as Norway, Sweden and Finland which have penetration rates in excess of 11 per cent.  Within the European Union penetration rates are lower at almost 5 per cent in the UK and about 3 per cent in Germany and Italy, but growth rates are rapid.  A substantial increase in the number of mobile customers in Ireland from the present level of 80,000 is anticipated.</P>
    <P>The introduction of competition will also be good for Telecom Éireann in that it will increase its market focus.  The <Col N="431" /> business of the new operator, when mature, will generate substantial additional call income as a result of call traffic made from, and destined for, Telecom's public network.  In order to ensure a level playing field between Telecom Éireann and the new operator, Eircell will be separated into an arm's length subsidiary and except in relation to the licence fee will be subject to similar conditions to those applicable to its competitor.  The investment required to get the new service fully under way could exceed £30 million.</P>
    <P>An independent regulator with the task of ensuring fair competition in the telecommunications sector will be established as soon as the necessary arrangements can be made.  The licence will be awarded under section 111 (1) of the Postal and Telecommunications Services Act, 1983, for a period of 15 years.  Because of the small size of the Irish market, competition in GSM will be limited to a duopoly for a period of seven years subject to compliance with any new EU legislation in the matter and to the licensee fulfilling their obligations. The competition will involve: the submission of business and technical plans; applicants indicating a competitive approach to the market and to tariff setting; competition participants indicating the fee they are prepared to pay for the right to the licence, though this will not be the most important selection criterion; an investment which initially is likely to exceed £30 million to get the new competitive service fully under way; the separation of Eircell, the existing mobile business of Telecom <Col N="432" /> Éireann, into an &ldquo;arm's length&rdquo; subsidiary to ensure a &ldquo;level playing field&rdquo; between Telecom Éireann and the winner of the licence.</P>
    <P>It is normal practice in major tender competitions to require a payment for access to the relevant documentation as an earnest of good faith.  In that context we are charging £5,000 to interested parties.  I have already outlined the essential elements of the competition and have responded to the main concerns of Deputy Brennan.  In fact much of the rest of the documentation is of a detailed technical nature.  Only those who purchase the documentation will be permitted to apply for the licence.  The documentation includes the main invitation and a memorandum for the information of applicants.  During the competition period, an &ldquo;information round&rdquo; will take place in which questions submitted by those who have purchased the documents will be answered in a composite memorandum from the Department. A parallel arrangement is being made in respect of necessary arrangements between bidders and Telecom Éireann.</P>
    <P>Applications are to be returned to my Department by the end of 23 June 1995, and a decision will be made on the new licensee by the end of October.  Expert consultancy advice will be engaged to assist in the evaluation of applications and the process of recruitment of these consultants is already under way.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.35 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 8 March 1995.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 37, 38 and 44 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the high level of unemployment among people with disabilities and I am concerned that further measures are needed which are geared towards improving their employment prospects and job-opportunities.</P>
      <P>As I have previously announced in the House, I am bringing forward legislation to extend legal redress against discrimination in relation to employment, which will apply to people with disabilities, along with other disadvantaged groups.</P>
      <P>In November 1993, I established the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities which is charged with making recommendations to Government with a view to ensuring greater participation by people with disabilities in all aspects of life, including employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that the Commission has been considering the whole question of employment and training, as they relate to people with disabilities, and has appointed a work and training group to draw up proposals in that respect.  The Commission is expected to report by the end of the year.  When I have examined its recommendations, I expect to be in a position to put proposals to the Government to determine what other measures, <Col N="245" /> in addition to the proposed anti-discrimination legislation, may be required by me or by other Ministers.  Pending receipt of the Commission's report, I do not propose to provide incentives to private sector employers in respect of people with disabilities apart from the schemes already administered by the National Rehabilitation Board and the Department of Health.</P>
    <P>The Government is committed to the achievement of the 3 per cent quota for the employment of people with disabilities throughout the public sector. The latest information available to me indicates that at October, 1994, the proportion of people with disabilities employed in the Civil Service was 3 per cent.  In the case of the health boards and local authorities, the corresponding percentages, as at end 1993, were 1.02 per cent and 1.25 per cent.</P>
    <P>My Department is in regular contact with the Departments of Finance, Health and the Environment to ensure that human resource managers in bodies under their control are aware of the Government's commitment to reaching the 3 per cent quota and that every effort is made to reach it as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>My Department is represented on the monitoring committee for the Employment of People with Disabilities which operates under the aegis of the Central Review Committee which oversees implementation of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i>  The monitoring committee is responsible for promoting and reviewing progress in the employment of people with disabilities in the public and private sectors.  I understand that it is actively seeking to ensure that the quota is met in the wider public sector.  Pending receipt of the Commission's recommendations, I feel it would be premature to speculate about altering the quota.</P>
    <P>In 1994, the Government provided £2 million for a pilot programme for supported employment of people with disabilities in viable business projects.  The pilot programme was established in response to proposals put to the then <Col N="246" /> Taoiseach by the Rehabilitation Institute.  This programme is being administered by the Department of Health with the assistance of the Department of Enterprise and Employment. An inter-departmental monitoring committee chaired by the Department of Health oversees the pilot programme and an evaluation committee, chaired by the Department of Enterprise and Employment, advises on the viability of business proposals and makes recommendations for funding. My Department is represented on the inter-departmental monitoring committee. This pilot programme is being continued in 1995.  My Department is actively involved in planning the expenditure in relation to the continuation of the programme.</P>

      <P>The code of practice on measures to protect the dignity of women and men at work also known as the code of practice on sexual harassment in employment was published and issued by me last September.</P>
      <P>A code of practice, while it is an authoritative document it is not legislation and rather than impose requirements or confer rights it sets out guidelines which may be departed from in appropriate circumstances.  While not directly enforceable by legal proceedings it may nevertheless have significant evidential effects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In asking the Employment Equality Agency to prepare a draft code of practice on sexual harassment I was aware of the inadequacy of existing legal provision in conferring effective legal impact of any such code.  Nevertheless I <Col N="247" /> considered that the problem of sexual harassment is such a serious issue that a code of practice drawn up by the Agency in close consultation with employer and worker interests would hold our prospects of giving practical authoritative guidance.</P>
    <P>Within the revised employment equality legislation which is being drafted at present I would hope to give appropriate legal standing to the code of practice.  In the meantime the code of practice is available to employers and workers and will be promoted by the Employment Equality Agency who will also monitor and review its effectiveness.</P>
    <P>By its nature a code of practice is not mandatory but its guidelines may be taken as an authoritative source without precluding employers and workers exercising discretion to adopt other appropriate and equivalent practices if the circumstances of their employments so warrant.  Mandatory requirements on employers will be set out in legislation rather than in a code of practice and will apply to both men and women in line with the equal treatment principles which arise in tackling sexual harassment in employment.  As regards the question of violence against women in employment that is a distinct matter and would be subject to normal criminal law proceedings.</P>
    <P>The Deputy may have in mind, however, the question of guidelines along the lines of those published recently by the Health and Safety Authority in respect of health sector employment where risks of exposure to violence has been identified as a particular hazard warranting the application of appropriate safeguards.  I have no hesitation in welcoming such guidelines and I recognise the appropriateness of having such violence against employees, whether women or men, tackled under the relevant Health and Safety Statutes which are the responsibility of my colleague the Minister for Enterprise and Employment.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 40, 41, 42 and 51 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since its establishment in 1979, the scheme of civil legal aid and advice, in so far as defamation is concerned, applies to defamation proceedings where such proceedings arise by way of counterclaim to a legally aided case. However, the matter has been under review.  As Deputies may be aware the Civil Legal Aid Bill, 1995, which I initiated, was recently presented in the Seanad and is now at Committee Stage in that House.  The Bill provides a statutory framework for the scheme of civil <Col N="249" /> legal aid and advice.  I have made provision in it to enable me, as Minister, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, to make an order to extend legal aid and advice to defamation proceedings in general.  It would be my intention to consider the question of the operation of that provision and certain other provisions in due course taking into account progress on the current development and expansion of the Legal Aid Board's services and the Exchequer position.</P>
    <P>Until recently, the scheme provided only for the use of the board's own salaried solicitors in law centres.  The board had no authority under any circumstances to avail of solicitors in private practice.  I formed the view when I took over responsibility in relation to the Legal Aid Board two years ago, that the time was right to embark on an initiative in this regard and, in September 1993, I amended the scheme accordingly.  This amendment facilitated the introduction of a pilot project for the use of private solicitors to supplement the services provided by solicitors in the board's law centres.  I have made a similar provision in the Civil Legal Aid Bill which will enable the board to avail, where necessary, of private solicitors.  However, the main work of the board's legal services will continue to be the responsibility of the law centre solicitors.  The pilot project is at present under review by a committee established by the Legal Aid Board.</P>
    <P>The total number of cases dealt with under the private solicitors' project since October 1993 is 1,133. A breakdown of the cases, by reference to the law centres which initially received the applications in respect of those cases, is set out in a tabular statement which I propose to have circulated with the Official Report.  I am advised by the Legal Aid Board that it does not maintain information in a manner which would enable it to give a breakdown of expenditure on different types of cases dealt with by law centre solicitors.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, broad ranging proposals for new legislation for employment equality and equal status are being developed in my Department.  The role and powers of the Employment Equality Agency are being reviewed as part of the process of developing the proposals.  One option under serious consideration is replacement of the Employment Equality Agency, as it exists at present, with an agency that would discharge a statutory role as regards both employment equality and equal status matters.  The new agency would be assigned the powers necessary <Col N="251" /> for the adequate discharge of its statutory role.  I will be seeking to secure appropriate levels of financial and other resources to enable the full implementation of the new employment equality and equal status legislation.</P>

      <P>The ESRI in a paper entitled &ldquo;Male-Female Wage Differentials: Analysis and Policy Issues&rdquo; which was jointly commissioned by my Department and the Employment Equality Agency and was published last year, indicated that women's hourly earnings are approximately 80 per cent of men's, when all sectors of industry are taken into account.  The report sought to identify the factors which contribute to the persistent sizeable earnings differential between men and women and to isolate residual factors which may be the result of discrimination.</P>
      <P>Half the 20 per cent wage gap was explained by the ERSI as reflecting productivity-related factors, such as experience and a sustainable rise in length of women's employment during their lifecycle was seen as the most effective way of reducing this portion of the wage gap. The remaining 10 per cent gap could not be explained in detail.  This reflects a lack of knowledge on the impact of wage determination process and very possibly the existence of discrimination. Measures to address both the length of service of women in the labour market and discrimination are being pursued on a number of factors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have targeted increased child care provision as one measure and a pilot child care project under the aegis of my Department has been introduced.  This will be supported by an increased focus by EU Structural Fund programmes on <Col N="253" /> child care provision.  In addition, the availability of flexible and atypical employment arrangements is also helping to meet the need to reconcile family and work commitments and thereby facilitate women remaining in employment. Statutory measures on maternity and adoptive leave also contribute and consideration is being given to the introduction of parental leave as an additional facility in this regard.</P>
    <P>On the question of discrimination, I intend to bring forward amending employment equality legislation this year.  In addition, the Employment Equality Agency is currently working on its response to EU developments so that it can better support voluntary initiatives at enterprise level on equal pay, equal treatment and equal opportunities to which the social partners are committed through the Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</P>

      <P>While primary responsibility for developing enterprise lies with the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, my Department is well aware of the growing role of women in enterprise and keeps a watching brief on this area.  When the Deputy refers to women involved in enterprise, I assume he is referring to both women who are self-employed and women entrepreneurs.</P>
      <P>As far as the self-employed are concerned, 12.5 per cent of the self-employed are women according to the 1992 Labour Force Survey. This represents an increase from 9.4 per cent in 1985 and 9.01 per cent in 1979.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="254" /> Regarding entrepreneurial activity by women, official gender breakdowns of figures on enterprise creation have not been kept up to now.  According to the Small Firms Association, 25 per cent of all new companies being set up today are owned by women.  Women entrepreneurs also represent 25 per cent of small manufacturing businesses assisted by the IDA.</P>
    <P>My Department is monitoring the work of entrepreneurial agencies and has taken steps to improve the quality of information regarding women in business and to ensure that their situation is specifically addressed.</P>
    <P>In the case of FÁS, information on all assistance granted to enterprise under its integrated enterprise programme will in future be available by gender. FÁS has also adopted the objective that 50 per cent of participants on its enterprise training programmes will be women.</P>
    <P>Assistance to business start-ups is also provided by area-based partnership and county enterprise boards.  These bodies will also in future provide information on the participation of women in business start-ups which are grant-aided by them.</P>
    <P>My Department is working with area-based partnerships to assist them in developing strategies to support and train women entrepreneurs and increase their number.  It envisages extending this assistance also to county enterprise boards.</P>
    <P>My Department will keep this area under review through its monitoring of the implementation of the recommendations of the Second Commission on the Status of Women, and through the monitoring procedures established to review the operation of EU Structural Fund programmes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>The programme A Government of Renewal commits the Government to enact freedom of information legislation in 1995, modelled on best practice in other countries.  The Minister of State, Deputy Eithne Fitzgerald, has specific responsibility for the enactment of freedom of information legislation and in this connection travelled recently to Australia and New Zealand to examine the operation of such legislation in those countries.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the visit was to discuss in depth the practical issues of freedom of information legislation for both potential providers and users of official information; to assess the strengths and weaknesses of existing freedom of information models in their implementation; to discuss how practical issues raised by Government Departments here had been addressed by similar Government Departments in these jurisdictions and arising from this process to identify those legislative provisions which make for the most effective legislation.</P>
      <P>In coming late in the day to freedom of information legislation, Ireland is in a unique position to draw on best international practice.  I am determined to ensure that our freedom of information legislation should be fully informed by legislative provisions which have an established track record in delivering greater openness and accountability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Australia and New Zealand were chosen as the most suitable models to study in an in-depth manner for a number of reasons.  First, the legislation adopted by these countries has achieved considerable success in achieving its goals of greater accountability and transperancy.  Second, these are common law jurisdictions with a system of Government similar to our own, based on the Westminister model.  Third, as Australia comprises a commonwealth of states, it offered an exceptional opportunity to examine up to seven models of <Col N="259" /> freedom of information legislation, enacted in different states, some as recently as 1992, and at Commonwealth level.  The freedom of information legislation in the Australian Commonwealth, its states and New Zealand offers therefore a unique variety of approaches.</P>
    <P>Finally, both Australia and New Zealand are conducting reviews of their freedom of information legislation and practice, 12 years after first enactment, offering a special opportunity to access the results of in-depth evalution.</P>
    <P>In addition, in her role as Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Fitzgerald availed of the opportunity to promote Ireland as an investment location through meeting leading business people in Australia who are investing in jobs in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State arrived in Sydney on Saturday, 11 February, and left Wellington for home on Monday, 20 February.  The officials accompanying the Minister attended a further series of meeting in New Zealand and left on Saturday, 25 February.  The Minister of State was accompanied by four officials from the Office of the Tánaiste.  These were Ms Julie O'Neill, assistant secretary, Mr. Finbarr O'Malley, legal advisor, Mr. Gerry Kearney, principal and Ms Aine Stapleton, assistant principal. Because of the recent nature of the visit, final costs are not yet to hand. Every effort was made to keep the cost at a reasonable level.  Based on the information currently available, the estimated cost of the visit for the Minister of State and four officials is £25,000.</P>
    <P>In all the Minister of Stateand her officials attended 30 meetings, details of which follow.  The delegation divided into subgroups on occasion to cover this heavy schedule of meetings in the time available.</P>
    <P>The visit was very successful in terms of the quality and range of information and experience to which the delegation had access.  I am confident we will get <Col N="260" /> excellent freedom of information legislation as a result of the comprehensive and careful preparation which is preceding it.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the difficulties which have arisen in this case, and had previously instructed that problems regarding visiting arrangements for the prisoner concerned should be raised by the Embassy in London with the British authorities.  I was informed that the delay in permitting the visit to go ahead was due to the fact that construction work at the prison had not been concluded.  I understand that this work has now been completed, and that the visit took place on 3 March.</P>
      <P>I have consistently stressed to the British authorities the importance of facilitating contact between prisoners and their families, and have urged that arrangements, particularly for those who are required to travel long distances, should be as flexible as possible.

      <P>I was aware that on 9 February 14 year old Salamat Masih, who was 11 years of age at the time of the alleged offence, and his uncle, Rahmat Masih, were sentenced to death under Pakistan's blasphemy law.  I am glad to say that on 23 February the Lahore High Court overturned both their convictions and sentences and ordered their release.</P>
      <P>The Irish Government urged action by the European Union in the Masih case from the time the news of the death sentences became available.  The European Union made representations in Islamabad to the Government of Pakistan, expressing its grave concern at the sentences and appealing for them not to be carried out.  I know that, once Salamat and Rahmat Masih were released, their lives may have been in danger.  I am informed that they have already travelled to Germany.</P>
      <P>The current Pakistani Government is committed to reforming the blasphemy law, which was introduced during the military dictatorship of General Zia. The Irish Government and its EU partners remain concerned at the situation created by the existing blasphemy law and are continuing to make representations to the Pakistani authorities.</P>

      <P>The increase in recent years in the number of suspected cases of child sexual abuse being reported to the health boards is a matter of grave concern to us all.  This continuing rise is an inevitable consequence of the greater public awareness and understanding of the horrendous problem of child sexual abuse.  Major new initiatives have been undertaken by the health boards to improve and expand supports for the unfortunate victims of abuse.</P>
      <P>In relation to the specific unit referred to by the Deputy, I understand that the normal waiting list for assessment is about four to six weeks and emergency and acute assault cases are given priority.</P>
      <P>In an effort to bring this waiting period down, approval was recently given to the appointment of two additional social workers and a child psychologist to the hospital in question.  This additional resource will go a long way towards reducing delays in assessing cases of abuse at the unit.</P>
      <P>The majority of referrals to the unit are from the local health board and it is important to note that, while on the waiting list for assessment, all families can avail of the social work service provided by the health board.  However, immediately upon referral, parents are offered an appointment for a meeting with staff of the unit within two days, and during this period a member of staff is always available to answer any queries they might have.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): The Western Health Board has indicated that the patient in question was placed on the in-patient waiting list on 19 January 1995 and is due to be called for admission within the next four months approximately.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that the admission of a patient to hospital is a matter for the consultant concerned and each patient is assessed to determine his or her medical priority.  Should the patient feel concerned that his condition has deteriorated, he should return to his medical practitioner who is in the best position to emphasise the urgency of his case directly to the consultant.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may be aware that, under the 1994 waiting list initiative, a total of £850,000 was allocated to the Western Health Board for the provision of 1,222 additional procedures, including 109 orthopaedic procedures.  This should reduce the overall waiting time for patients in the specialties targeted.  In addition, development funds of £400,000 were provided to the board in 1994 for the expansion of orthopaedic services at Merlin Park Regional Hospital.  As a result, approval has issued to the Western Health Board to recruit a consultant orthopaedic surgeon and a consultant anaesthetist together with the necessary support staff.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): I will take Questions Nos. 73 and 74 together.  Myalgic encephalomyelitis, also known as chronic fatigue syndrome and &ldquo;yuppie 'flu&rdquo; is a chronic debilitating disease that is marked in the majority of cases by sudden onset of fatigue and `flu-like symptoms. The symptoms associated with microwave and radiofrequency electromagnetic radiation, in addition to `flu-like symptoms, include burning of the skin and eye problems.</P>
      <P>Because the recognition of ME as a type of syndrome is relatively recent, it is not possible to ascertain the prevalence of the condition and whether it is increasing.  There is significant research being carried out in relation to this condition involving a wide range of disciplines which reflects the multi-factorial nature of the problem and the difficulty in finding a cause.</P>
      <P>Treatment is non-specific and is aimed at alleviating symptoms and helping patients to adjust to the chronic nature of the condition.  People with ME can avail of services provided in the normal course of health service provision through the health boards.  A general practitioner provides personal, primary and continuing care to individual patients and families.  In relation to medical conditions generally, including ME, a general practitioner will be concerned with prevention and anticipatory care as well as an effective response to illness and patient rehabilitation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht (Mr. M. Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been aware for some time that there is concern in certain quarters regarding the designation of natural heritage areas NHAs, and I am considering taking steps at present to direct the National Parks and Wildlife Service, NPWS, to withdraw the NHA designations which it had previously made in regard to Counties Carlow, Cavan, Clare, Kildare, Kilkenny, Laois, Offaly, Louth, Longford, Meath, Wexford and Wicklow, and to initiate the process of considering whether certain areas of Counties Cork, Donegal, Kerry and Monaghan should be designated as NHAs.</P>
      <P>Proposals have also been made by the NWPS in regard to the possible designation of NHAs in the remaining ten counties, including Sligo, Mayo and Leitrim.</P>
      <P>I am determined to ensure that adequate prior consultation will take place with land owners and occupiers and other interested parties.  All such parties will have an opportunity to make their views known regarding any proposed designations and indeed to object to such designations.  All views expressed will be taken into account prior to final decisions being taken in regard to designation.</P>
      <P>Formal designation of sites as NHAs will only take place after this consultation procedure has been completed, the Wildlife Act, 1976, is amended and a formal system for hearing objections is established.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The NHAs are areas of the country that contain the best remaining examples of our native wildlife species and habitats and scientific criteria were used in the identification of these areas. As the areas proposed for designation as NHAs have been identified solely on scientific grounds, it is unlikely that there will be major changes in these areas prior to designation, although it is <Col N="275" /> possible that there will be some revisions to boundaries.</P>
    <P>As part of the process, attempts are being made to identify all land owners and occupiers of land included within the proposed NHAs and it is proposed to write to all owners and occupiers identified to advise them of the proposals.</P>
    <P>The proposed NHAs do not affect ownership rights, including access, grazing, sporting or turbary rights and accordingly land values should not be significantly affected by NHA designation. In relation to development in NHAs, the Deputy will appreciate that the NPWS would object to any proposals considered to be environmentally damaging.</P>

      <P>In 1986, two areas involving 99 acres were designated in Cork.  These were located in the South Parish/The Marsh/Shandon area of the city with a smaller area in Blackpool.  In 1990, the scheme was extended to include an additional 27 acres in the Union Quay/McCurtain Street/Anderson Quay area of the inner city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The former scheme expired on 31 July 1994 and a new scheme came into <Col N="278" /> effect on 1 August 1994.  Under the new scheme, approximately 49 acres were designated, consisting of four areas as follows: an area known as the North Gate, an area known as the South Gate, an area between St. Patrick's Quay, McCurtain Street and St. Patrick's Place, and an area around Blackpool.</P>
    <P>The previous scheme was very successful in Cork.  The latest information available in my Department shows that the level of private sector investment was in excess of £70 million in respect of projects completed and in progress. A complete locational breakdown of this investment is not available in my Department.</P>
    <P>The present scheme will continue up to 31 July 1997.  I intend to have a review carried out of the effectiveness of the scheme so as to better inform future policy decisions in this area.</P>

      <P>Within the European Union, the phasing out and elimination of substances which deplete the ozone layer is controlled by Council Regulation 3093/94.  Under the provisions of this regulation, the production and use of CFCs, chlorofluorocarbons within the Union has been banned since 1 January 1995 except in the case of a limited number of specified essential uses for which no suitable alternative is yet available.</P>
      <P>The regulation also prohibits within the Union the use of HCFCs, hydrochloroflourocarbons from 1 June 1995 except for a number of specified applications and provides for the phasing out of production of HCFCs by 31 December 2014.</P>

      <P>The school referred to by the Deputy currently has disadvantaged area status and as such has an additional concessionary teaching post.  The school also receives a special rate of capitation funding and this is being increased from £55 to £65 per pupil for the coming school year.</P>
      <P>I propose to expand the early start pre-school programme through the establishment of a further 25 pre-school projects in the coming school year.  This development will significantly expand the pre-school service and the areas targeted will be selected from among those already included in the disadvantaged areas scheme.  The process of selecting schools for inclusion in the expanded early start programme is currently underway in my Department and the needs of the area mentioned by the Deputy will be considered in this context.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="294" /> There are 3,983 members of the force employed in the greater Dublin area at present of which 123 are employed full-time on traffic duty.  However, all members of the Garda Síochána may be involved in traffic duties from time to time and members assigned specifically to traffic units may also be involved in other forms of policing, such as crime prevention and detection.</P>
    <P>I should also point out that many of the units based at the DMA headquarters, Harcourt Square, operate as required outside the Dublin metropolitan Area.  Some of these units also provide advice and assistance on a countrywide basis.</P>

      <P>I can confirm that an officer in the middle management ranks of the Department has been under suspension since December 1994.  This development arose from revelations in the Department concerning alleged misuse of departmental property by the officer in question.  The officer's suspension was extended in January 1995 in connection with alleged irregularities in relation to certain contracts placed by the Department for computer equipment in the prison service.</P>
      <P>The officer's suspension is continuing until a thorough investigation has been completed, including a Garda investigation of certain aspects of the administration of the contracts referred to.</P>
      <P>In accordance with usual practice, it is not proposed to make any further comment about the case until the investigation has been completed.  I hope the investigation will be completed in a matter of weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As with many large organisations responsible for substantial amounts of expenditure, arrangements are in place <Col N="297" /> to monitor payments made in the areas for which my Department has direct responsibility.  Again, in common with other large organisations both in the public and private sectors, various procedures and payments are the subject of ongoing examination and query in my Department with the aim of avoiding loss to public funds.  It is not unusual from time to time to find that procedural changes may be required.  In a relatively small number of cases some form of disciplinary action may be called for as well.</P>
    <P>As my Department carries responsibility for five separate Votes covering a combined annual expenditure of about £600 million and 16,000 public servants, I would need time to get a complete picture of all financial matters that may be under examination at any particular time and an assessment as to whether disciplinary action might be required.  I can confirm that this time no irregularity has been identified which is anything near the scale of that referred to in the Deputy's question.</P>

      <P>The disease was found mainly on long established plants during 1994 and it was not possible to determine the source of the infection.  My Department has served the statutory destruction notice on the owners of the infected plants and imposed quarantine restrictions on all host plants in the vicinity of the infection.  The trade and general public have been alerted to the need for extra vigilance and invited to submit samples of suspicious plants.  The help of local authorities has also been enlisted in carrying out systematic surveys of all host plants under their control. As in previous years, my Department will continue to monitor the situation and this will include a full survey of all nurseries trading in host material in 1995.</P>

      <P>I will take Questions Nos. 131 and 134 together.  The current programme for forestry development is based on the operational programme for agriculture, forestry and rural development 1994-99 and the forestry elements of the CAP.  The objectives of the programme are to increase the forest area and timber production and develop an efficient downstream processing sector, thereby developing the forestry based industrial sector, diversifying the rural economy, promoting the reform of agricultural structures, providing additional employment and stimulating rural development.  In this regard, I recently announced a major national forestry drive to plant 90,000 hectares over the next three years.  In addition, a strategic plan for development of the forestry sector to the year 2015 is currently being prepared.  This will address the integrated development of the entire sector, from forest nurseries through growing and processing to timber end-uses and woodcraft.</P>
      <P>The role of forestry as an agent of rural development will be encompassed by the strategic plan.  In providing an integrated framework for the development of forestry in its broadest sense over coming decades, the plan will have the objective of ensuring that all those involved with forestry, whether in the public or private sectors, will work in concert towards achieving the goals which it sets.</P>
      <P>I expect to be in a position to publish the plan by the summer.</P>

      <P>Coillte allows access to the public to all of its forests which are used by them for a range of <Col N="307" /> amenity and recreational activities.  It is not feasible, therefore, to spatially define the area of forest land used for leisure purposes.  The company maintains, however, over 180 amenity areas throughout the country, including forest parks, picnic sites and woodland walks, and is actively looking at ways to facilitate greater uses of its forests for public recreation and amenity development.</P>
      <P>In so far as my own Department's plans for the development of forest amenity areas are concerned, new schemes for urban and amenity forestry will be announced within the next few months and these will be actively promoted. Particular emphasis will be placed on linkages with tourism and on involving local authorities and communities. The Department has operated a planned recreational forest grant scheme for the past few years.  Uptake on this has, however, been limited.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 140 and 142 together.  In response to the conclusions of the Culliton and Moriarty reports, it has been accepted that the mandatory off-take of petroleum products from the Whitegate refinery will terminate by the end of 1996.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to enable the refinery to <Col N="310" /> trade on a fully competitive basis, Irish National Petroleum Corporation Limited is implementing a three-year programme of investment which will continue up to 1996.  The results of this programme, allied to a number of marketing initiatives, are expected by the company to enable the refinery to operate on a commercial basis to open market prices when the mandatory regime ends.</P>
    <P>Joint venture proposals for a further upgrading of the refinery continue to be explored and a number of inquiries have been made by third parties in connection with possible participation in the Whitegate oil refinery.  The current investment programme is compatible with any further upgrading which might emerge from a joint venture.</P>
    <P>A specific proposal for a joint venture major upgrading was received from a private company.  Extensive negotiations with that company failed to reach a commercial agreement.  Consequently, the question of carrying out detailed studies of that particular proposal did not proceed.  Independent studies of the general issue of different types of upgrading have been made which have indicated that such ventures have high capital costs and while the return would probably secure the long term viability of the refinery it is not particularly attractive in relation to the costs.  For this reason the company is at present pursuing its lower cost investment programme as offering the most cost effective means yet identified of achieving commercial viability.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to comment in detail on any specific proposal for reasons of commercial confidentiality and in order to safeguard the State's position in any negotiations.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 148 and 150 together.  The health implications of non-ionising radiation are primarily a matter for the Department of Health. However, my Department keeps abreast of developments in relation to the scientific research on electromagnetic fields and on the positions being taken by other Governments and international health advisory bodies.  Comprehensive assessments of the issue have been carried out by the chief technical adviser in my Department and were published in 1988 and 1992.  The reports are available from the Government Publications Sales Office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These reports found that on the evidence available there is, as yet, no widespread agreement among research workers that electromagnetic fields constitute a potential hazard to health. Despite the fact that many scientific studies have been produced throughout the world in recent years, it has not been established that power-frequency electric and magnetic fields encountered in normal living and working conditions cause adverse health effects in humans. <Col N="315" /> The results of these studies have been carefully analysed by independent international medical and review bodies, such as the World Health Organisation, WHO, the International Commission for Non-Ionising Radiation Protection, ICNIRP, and the UK National Radiological Protection Board, NRPB.</P>

His subsequent appeal claiming entitlement to higher payments was considered by the scheme appeals committee which found that the payment had been correctly assessed in accordance with the criteria governing BIM's administration of the scheme.</P>
