      <P>Has the Government abandoned the commitment to adopt an <Col N="443" /> all-party approach to the divorce referendum, particularly in view of the answers given to questions by the Minister for Equality and Law Reform last week when he said nothing about this new departure in relation to the upcoming referendum?

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been ongoing consultation with the Opposition on this mater. We are anxious that there should be an all-party approach.

      <P>In the context of tomorrow's debate on the White Paper on <Col N="445" /> Education, which was published almost a month ago, will the Taoiseach indicate whether copies of the White Paper have been printed for access by the general public. It is ridiculous and farcical that this House will debate a White Paper that is not available to the public. It makes a mockery of this House and the entire democratic system. This is an important point and the Taoiseach should respond to it.</P>

      <P>We have given an indication in response to various questions that we wish to have reasonable and fruitful discussions with the Opposition parties about this matter.

    <Title>Transfer of Sentenced Persons Bill, 1995: Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen) Nora Owen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The object of this Bill is to enable Ireland to ratify the Council of Europe Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons. It will also enable us to ratify an EU agreement on how the convention will be operated among member states.</P>
      <P>Both before and since becoming Minister for Justice I have attached considerable importance to Ireland's ratification of the convention. I am pleased that the priority which I gave to the drafting of this legislation has come to fruition in the Bill. In saying that I recognise that for some considerable time there has been widespread desire on all sides of the House that Ireland should be in a position to proceed to ratify the convention.</P>
      <P>The Bill has been warmly welcomed outside and in the House and it would be remiss of me not to acknowledge my appreciation of the work of the Irish Commission for Prisoners Overseas which has played a vital role in this area over the years. I met representatives of the commission early in my term of office to receive a draft Bill designed to enable Ireland to ratify the convention, but apart from the work it has carried out on the Bill it has consistently highlighted in recent years the humanitarian considerations which arise when prisoners have to serve their sentences in another jurisdiction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The thinking behind the convention &mdash; and of the Bill &mdash; is that persons serving sentences in other countries may have to endure added suffering beyond <Col N="449" /> that normally involved in the deprivation of liberty. Obvious additional difficulties can arise because of language barriers and cultural differences, but in the vast majority of cases the greatest additional penalty is the absence of contact by the prisoner with family and friends. A major practical concern of the convention is not just to ameliorate the conditions for prisoners, but to alleviate the plight of their relatives and to make visiting easier.</P>
    <P>Much of the attention given to this measure since its publication has arisen in the context of the role it will play as part of the consolidation of the peace process. It has that positive and worthwhile role and that will be welcomed by the House, but I believe Members will equally welcome the fact that the convention makes no distinctions based on categories of prisoners. In other words, applications can be made under the convention irrespective of whether there is a paramilitary background to the offences for which people are serving sentences.</P>
    <P>The basic aim of the convention is to provide for a simple and expeditious procedure under which persons sentenced in a foreign country can serve their sentence or balance of their sentence in their country of origin if that is their preference.</P>
    <P>Before going into some of the background to the convention, and the detail of the individual sections, it might be helpful to make three key points. First, the transfer prodecure is voluntary. The sentenced person, the state to which he or she is seeking a transfer and the state where he or she is serving a sentence all must consent to the transfer. Second, although it is a Council of Europe convention it is not confined to Council of Europe countries. Accession by non-member states is possible and so, for example, the convention applies to the US and Canada. Third, the approach which the convention takes is to set out administrative procedures. The Bill is an enabling one: it is not necessary to include in it matters contained in the convention which can be simply <Col N="450" /> implemented on an administrative basis, but what the Bill contains are the legislative measures which are necessary to enable Ireland to give effect to the convention. On this point I do not believe that there will be any difference of principle between the various sides of the House about the substance of the Bill, but if Members have views about what I might call the technicalities involved I will approach these with an open mind during the various Stages of the Bill.</P>
    <P>For a fuller appreciation of some of the issues involved it may be helpful if I set out some of the background to the convention. The initiative for the convention came as far back as 1978 when, at a Council of Europe Conference, Ministers for Justice discussed the problems posed by prisoners of foreign nationality, including the question of providing procedures for their transfer so that they might serve their sentence in their home country. Those discussions led to the setting up in 1979 of a Select Committee on Foreign Nationals in Prison whose tasks included the preparation of a multilateral convention providing for a simple procedure for the transfer of foreign prisoners. The text of the convention took a number of years to prepare and was eventually approved by the Council of Ministers in 1982 and opened for signature in March 1983.</P>
    <P>The operative date for the convention, the date it came into force, is 1 July 1985. Ireland signed the convention a year later on 20 August 1986.</P>
    <P>Meanwhile, the desirability of facilitating transfers of sentenced persons between member states of the EU was being increasingly appreciated and this culminated in a 1987 EU Agreement which supplemented the convention from the point of view of its application among member states. So far four EU member states have given effect to the EU Agreement, and 27 of the 33 Council of Europe member states &mdash; as well as some non-member states &mdash; have ratified the convention.</P>
    <P>I do not think that any of us would make any bones about the fact that <Col N="451" /> Ireland's performance in terms of pressing ahead with the ratification of this particular convention has been slow. We are now the only remaining EU member state that has yet to ratify. While obviously I can only account to the House for what has happened since I became Minister for Justice, as I understand it some of the delay related to certain concerns expressed about the repercussions the convention might have on an already crowded prison system. While these concerns are not unfounded, they are not insurmountable problems either. In any event I believe there was a growing acceptance on all sides of the House &mdash; not least in the context of the peace process &mdash; that ratification should not be further delayed. That is why I made it my business on coming into office to give priority to the necessary enabling legislation and thereby fulfil a commitment in the Government programme, <i>A Government of Renewal.</i> As I already indicated, I am very pleased to see it published so soon and debated here today.</P>
    <P>The convention does not place an obligation on any contracting party to effect a transfer. Instead, emphasis is placed on the three way consent I have already referred to. Special emphasis is placed on the consent of the sentenced person. Nothing would be gained by transferring someone against his or her will and without the person appreciating fully the legal consequences of such a transfer. Accordingly, consent of the sentenced person must be a voluntary and informed consent.</P>
    <P>In addition to that three way consent, the convention lays down four other criteria which must be satisfied before a transfer can take place. The first is that the sentenced person is a national of the receiving state. A contracting party has the option of defining the term &ldquo;national&rdquo; by way of declaration to be made when depositing the instruments of ratification to the convention. This possibility is intended to enable contracting states to define &ldquo;national&rdquo; in as <Col N="452" /> wide a sense as possible, and so broaden the application of the convention to cover, say, persons who, though not strictly speaking nationals, may have close ties with the receiving state. A similar approach arises under the EU Agreement, which supplemented the convention, to the extent that between EU member states, a national of one member state is regarded as a national of another where a transfer is considered appropriate and taking into account the person's habitual residence.</P>
    <P>The other three prerequisites for a transfer are: that the sentence imposed on the person is final, that the sentenced person has normally at least six months of the sentence left to serve and that the offence for which the sentenced person is imprisoned would constitute a criminal offence if committed in the receiving state.</P>
    <P>Under the convention the receiving or administering State is given a choice between two ways of enforcing the sentence imposed by the sentencing state. It may continue to enforce the sentence, in which case it is bound, subject to any necessary technical modifications, by the nature and duration of the sentence as determined in the original sentencing state: or, alternatively, it may convert the sentence into a decision which substitutes a sanction prescribed by its own law for the sanction imposed in the sentencing state.</P>
    <P>As regards transfers of prisoners into this country, the Bill proposes to use the procedure of continued enforcement which is considered the more straightforward of the two procedures provided for in the convention which should operate with greater certainty and thus generally in the best interests of the sentenced person. Legal authority for the continued enforcement in the State of a sentence imposed by a foreign state will be provided by way of warrant issued by the High Court. The warrant will issue on foot of an application to that court by me, as Minister, I have consented to the transfer. The involvement of the High Court was considered the safest legal approach from a constitutional law <Col N="453" /> point of view. When the High Court warrant has issued and the sentenced person is transferred into the State the person will be subject to the same rules governing administration of sentence as any other person sentenced in the State, for example, with regard to remission etc.</P>
    <P>As regards transfers out of the State, obviously we have no extra-territorial jurisdiction and therefore are unable, to legislate for the nuts and bolts of how a sentence will be enforced in another jurisdiction but, of course, parties to the convention will enforce the sentence in line with the terms of the convention. The facilitation of transfers abroad is treated under the Bill as an entirely administrative function as distinct from involving a judicial process. The Bill provides a legislative basis for the exercise of that administrative function. In keeping with the aim of the convention to provide a speedy and simple mechanism for transfers, the Bill provides that the legal authority for transfers out will be simply by way of warrant issued by me as Minister and there is no need for application to court.</P>
    <P>I mentioned earlier that concerns had been expressed about the impact the convention might have on prison population numbers here. It is fair to say that the convention could impact on this country more than on others because, on the one hand, we have a relatively small population of foreigners &mdash; about 180 &mdash;in our prisons today while on the other, we know that the number of Irish nationals serving sentences abroad at any given time far exceeds that number. The latest available figures indicate that there are at least some 600 Irish nationals imprisoned throughout the world who would be eligible to have their case considered.</P>
    <P>Clearly not all those persons will be interested in a transfer. Nonetheless, there is a potential problem because the number of potential transfers into the State is far far higher than the number of potential transfers out. While I certainly do not wish to have to stand in the way of transfers and am keen to <Col N="454" /> facilitate people where at all possible, the reality is that I have a duty to guard against placing an intolerable burden on our prison system. The best approach to this would be to draw attention to the problem when ratifying the convention and to enter an appropriate reservation at that time.</P>
    <P>This would allow the necessary flexibility between playing our full part in implementing the convention and avoiding unsustainable pressure on prison accommodation. I acknowledge freely that, in the absence of the convention being in force, it is difficult to ascertain precisely the likely level of interest there will be in applications under it. Certainly it should be borne in mind that very many Irish nationals serving sentences abroad &mdash; particularly in the United Kingdom &mdash; have long-established roots ther and would have no interest in returning here. It is worth nothing that at one stage the Irish Commission for Prisoners Overseas estimated that the number of prisoners seeking a transfer to here would be about 40 and would level off at fewer than ten annually subsequently. It has to be borne in mind too that, if needs be, applications into the country could be dealt with on a phased basis. If an inordinate number of applications were to be received it will always be the case that the Minister for Justice can withhold consent to transfers.</P>
    <P>Before I outline the main provisions of the Bill itself, I reiterate that the Bill does not actually implement the convention. Rather it is an enabling Bill, a means to an end, a necessary prerequisite to ratification of the convention. The convention itself is really only enabling as well, in the sense that it confines itself to providing the procedural framework for repatriation of sentenced persons. It places no obligation on contracting parties to agree to a transfer. It follows that many of the convention's provisions need not be laid down in statutory form and can be dealt with more speedily in an administrative way. Accordingly, the Bill is relatively short and succinct and does not elaborate <Col N="455" /> beyond what is necessary to comply with our eventual obligations under the convention.</P>
    <P>Section 1 deals with interpretation and follows closely the definitions in the convention. By subsection (2) the possibility for transfer into the State relates not just to persons detained in foreign prisons, but also to persons of any age who, by reason of incapacity or young age, are detained in places other than prisons, such as hospitals. Sections 2 and 3 deal with applications and legal authority for transfers of persons outside the State, that is, the outward traffic. Under section 2 applications for transfer must be made in writing to me, as Minister, by the sentenced person concerned. However, if the person is unable to apply him or herself, by reason of their young age or physical or mental condition, application may be made on their behalf by an appropriate person, such as a parent or a doctor.</P>
    <P>Before an application can be granted the conditions for transfer, as laid down by the convention, must be met. The first condition is that the applicant is a national of the receiving or administering state. However, where the person is a national of another EU member state which has ratified the 1987 Agreement that person may be deemed to fulfil this condition.</P>
    <P>The second condition is that the sentence must be final and enforceable. In other words, all available remedies must be exhausted, or the time limit for lodging an appeal against sentence and/or conviction has expired. However, this does not preclude the possibility of a later judicial review of the sentence or a petition for pardon in light of fresh evidence under the Criminal Procedure Act, 1993.</P>
    <P>The third condition concerns the length of sentence still to be served. Normally this must be of at least six months' duration or be indeterminate. However, in exceptional cases, this requirement need not be rigidly complied with and, provided the receiving or administering state agrees, a transfer <Col N="456" /> can be effected where there is less than six months left to serve.</P>
    <P>The fourth condition is that the transfer must be voluntary &mdash; the sentenced person must consent freely and with full knowledge of what the legal effect of his/her transfer will be from the point of view of both jurisdictions. Consequently, the convention and the Bill, in section 2, subsection (5), lay particular emphasis on the necessity for full and informed consent, since quite clearly transferring someone without such consent, would lack fairness and be ultimately counterproductive. There may be times though when someone is just not in a position to give consent, for example, when a person is too young or suffering from mental disability. In those circumstances, it is proposed that consent be given by an appropriate person on their behalf. Again, such an appropriate person might be a parent or a medical person.</P>
    <P>The fifth condition is that the offence concerned would constitute a criminal offence if committed in the administering state. This is intended to ensure compliance with the principle of dual criminal liability. It is not necessary that the criminal offence be precisely the same in all respects under both the law of this jurisdiction and that of the sentencing state, but some element of comparability is necessary.</P>
    <P>The sixth and final condition is that the administering state must also agree to the transfer. Therefore, this condition confirms the convention's basic principle that a transfer requires the agreement of the two states concerned.</P>
    <P>Section 3 of the Bill provides that the legal authority for the transfer of a person out of the state will be by way of warrant issued by the Minister for Justice. The warrant provides authority for the taking of the sentenced person to the point of departure from the state &mdash; which will normally be an airport &mdash; and for handing him or her over to the escorting officer authorised by the administering state. While the delivery and removal of the sentenced person is <Col N="457" /> being effected, he or she will be deemed to be in legal custody.</P>
    <P>After a person has been transferred, the sentence imposed by this jurisdiction will continue to be enforceable so that if, for instance, the person should escape from lawful custody he or she would be liable to be taken into custody on foot of the original court order made.</P>
    <P>The sentence will cease to be enforceable, however, when the receiving or administering state considers enforcement to have been completed. Clearly we do not want to have a situation where a person who is granted the equivalent of full temporary release in a foreign state would be liable to arrest and imprisonment should the person return here. Accordingly section 3 (7) provides that the Minister may direct that the sentence be varied or cease altogether to give effect to the convention.</P>
    <P>The procedure for transfers into the state, that is, inward traffic, is set out in sections 4 and 5. The grounds for a transfer to all intents and purposes are the same as those for outgoing transfers just outlined. The one significant difference is the role the High Court has to play in providing the legal authority for the transfer when it has been consented to. I will return to that in a moment.</P>
    <P>Applications for inward transfer must be made in writing, this time by the sentencing state. Again, the necessary conditions for transfer must be met and there must be no doubts as to the sentenced person's full and informed consent. When I, as Minister, have satisfied myself that those requirements have been met and I agree to the transfer, it would be a matter for me to apply to the High Court for the issue of a warrant providing legal authority for bringing the person into the State and the continued enforcement of the sentence here.</P>
    <P>The role of the High Court is set out in section 5. In sum, the court must issue a warrant if satisfied that the necessary conditions for transfer have been fulfilled. In issuing a warrant for continued <Col N="458" /> enforcement, the court will be bound by the type of penalty and duration of sentence as determined by the sentencing state. There may be cases, however, where the legal nature or duration of the sentence imposed in the foreign jurisdiction will be incompatible with the law of this State. This could arise by reason of different penal systems with regard to the division of penalties, or the minimum or maximum length of sentences prescribed. In such cases the High Court may, under section 5 (5), adapt the sentence to one prescribed by the law of this state for a similar offence. The adaptation procedure must take place within the limited boundaries specified in subsection (6): the adapted sentence must, as far as practicable, correspond with that imposed by the sentencing state. It must not aggravate the sentence imposed in the sentencing state and must not exceed the maximum sentence prescribed by the law of this state for a similar offence. In other words, the High Court may adapt the sentence to the nearest equivalent available provided this does not result in a longer sentence so that the sentenced person is no less well off from the point of view of length of time still to be served.</P>
    <P>The issue of the warrant will mean in practice that the balance of the sentence to be served will have the same effect as if it were a sentence imposed here. It will not be subject to appeal since that remains the prerogative of the sentencing state but, in all other respects, it will be served in precisely the same way as a sentence imposed here, and so be subject to all the normal rules governing administration of sentence generally, remission and temporary release.</P>
    <P>Enforcement will cease sooner than it would do in the normal course where notification is received from the sentencing state of any decision taken there other than one concerning remission which would mean in effect that the sentence would no longer be enforceable in that state. This could happen where there has been a quashing of the conviction by the sentencing state.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="459" /> Section 6 provides for the legal custody of the person being transferred into the State in accordance with a High Court warrant and the designation and powers of persons authorised to take the person to and from any place under the warrant. Under the convention the sentencing state alone has the right to take decisions on applications for review of conviction. The exclusive competence of the sentencing state in this regard is justified by the fact that review of sentence is not part of enforcement <i>per se</i> and, in any event, the sentencing state is for obvious reasons better placed to re-examine the material evidence. That said, the receiving or administering state must not stand in the way of enabling a person who has been transferred to seek review of a sentence. If the outcome of such a review is that the sentence be quashed, the administering state must reciprocate and terminate enforcement as soon as it is notified of any such decision or measure.</P>
    <P>Section 7 contains a general power for the Minister or the High Court, as the case may be, to revoke or vary the warrant under which the person has been transferred either out of or into the State, where necessary in order to give effect to the convention. Section 8 proposed the standard from of expenses provision and section 9 is the short title. Those are the Bill's main provisions.</P>
    <P>I said at the out set that I have given priority to this Bill. It will have very positive benefits for Irish nationals who are serving sentences abroad in foreign prisons and particularly for their families. Equally, it will also provide an avenue of hope for those non-nationals who happen to have been sentenced in this jurisdiction but who would prefer to be in their home country.</P>
    <P>I will, of course, consider with an open mind any points of detail raised by Deputies. Given that this Bill is fulfilling our responsibilities as a member of the Council of Europe, the humanitarian nature of what is being proposed and the part this measure will play in the <Col N="460" /> consolidation of the peace process, I am confident it will be welcomed by all sides of the House.</P>

      <P>This Bill will allow the transfer of prisoners, including those convicted of Republican paramilitary offences, from Britain to prisons in this State. Clearly the Bill is not just a humane and social prerequisite; it is also an important component of the peace process on this island. The eventual publication of this Bill will give teeth to the 1983 Council of Europe Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Prisoners. Ireland had previously signed the convention but it is only now that the necessary legislation to enact its provisions has been published. The delay was mainly due to the situation which prevailed in Northern Ireland and the inertia of the Government.</P>

      <P>In December 1994 the rainbow coalition Government in its Programme for <i>A Government of Renewal</i> stated: &ldquo;Legislation on the Convention on the Transfer of Prisoners will be expedited immediately following the formation of the Government&rdquo;. It said &ldquo;immediately&rdquo; but it is now May 1995. Fianna Fáil had given a commitment to Sinn Féin that the legislation would be enacted prior to Christmas 1994. As on so many other fronts &mdash; it gives me no great pleasure to say this &mdash; foot dragging by the Minister has hindered and hampered vitally important legislation. The Government must realise that it cannot kick to touch for ever.</P>

      <P>This enabling Bill will empower the State to ratify the Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Prisoners. I very much welcome the eventual publication of the Bill but I must register my disappointment at the paucity of information in it. It has taken 12 years to ratify the convention and I get the impression that insufficient consideration has been given to the practicalities of operating it. I am extremely pleased that at long last Irish people in prisons in the United Kingdom and elsewhere will have an opportunity to serve their sentences in Ireland. Fianna Fáil echoes the sentiments of the Committee on the Administration of Justice, the Irish Commissioner for Prisoners Overseas, the National Association of Probation Officers and the Northern Ireland Association for the Care and Resettlement of Offenders in welcoming the eventual publication of the Bill. We all understand why prisoners would like to have their families as close as possible to them &mdash; there is no need to go into this point in detail. The purpose of the convention and this enabling Bill is humanitarian: they will enable prisoners to serve their sentences close to <Col N="462" /> their families and friends in the country of their birth, thus avoiding the hardship experienced by them as a result of differences in language, culture and religion.</P>
      <P>On the question of the desire to repatriate prisoners, I wish to refer to a recent visit by my colleague, Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív, to Belmarsh Prison in South London and Fullsutton Prison in York. In his report Deputy Ó Cuív highlighted the startling costs of visiting prisoners in Britain. He estimated that the minimum cost, including accommodation, of visiting a prisoner in Belmarsh or Fullsutton is in excess of £300. He said that this was the cost for one adult travelling alone and he shuddered to think of the cost of travelling with children to these institutions. Bearing in mind the huge time, monetary and emotional costs involved in visiting prisoners overseas, we all welcome the Bill before us today.</P>
      <P>In his report, Deputy Ó Cuív also stated that the prisoners he had visited were pleased to hear that the Irish Government proposed to ratify the Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons. All Fianna Fáil Deputies echo the sentiments that the present regime is as much a sentence on the families as it is on the prisoners involved.</P>
      <P>Referring to the political position here, Deputy Ó Cuív stated that the prisoners he had visited had experienced little or no peace dividend since the ceasefire. They claimed access to their families was more restricted than ever and felt that, as a first step in the peace process, their conditions should be improved and, as far as their families are concerned, there should be a peace dividend. Obviously, the prisoners are anxious to transfer to Ireland. I pay tribute to Deputy Ó Cuív for his initiative and to his constituency colleague, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, for the great work she did in this area while serving as an outstanding Minister for Justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With the aforementioned factors in mind, with the peace process again gaining momentum and talks scheduled for <Col N="463" /> next week, it is not before time that we are today debating the Transfer of Sentenced Persons Bill. There was scarcely a day in the recent past when the Fianna Fáil Leader, Deputy Ahern, did not ask the Taoiseach on the Order of Business when this legislation would be brought forward.</P>
    <P>The Bill concentrates almost exclusively on the technical aspects of prisoner transfers, such as the issuing and revocation of warrants in respect of the free transfer of prisoners. While I understand that, for legislative reasons, extremely important and pressing issues have not been included in the Bill, nonetheless extremely important questions must be answered as a corollary to it. I would have expected the Minister to inform the House, first, of the number of Irish citizens currently held in United Kingdom prisons, second, the proportion of those that can be expected to seek transfers to Ireland and, third, the number of United Kingdom prisoners currently held in Irish prisons who are likely to seek transfers to the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>It is well known that our prisons are filled to capacity. I understand our prisons currently hold approximately 2,350 offenders. Can the Minister assure us that urgently needed additional prisoner places will be provided? It would be undesirable if prisoners sentenced by Irish courts receive premature parole and extra early release dates merely to fulfil a quota that the Minister's advisers believe is justified if the legislation is to be honoured. This is particularly important when one considers that of the approximately 2,350 persons currently incarcerated in Irish prisons a little more than 10 per cent are sexual offenders.</P>
    <P>I am sure it is generally accepted that prisoners should not be released unless prison officials are satisfied that early release has been earned during service of the sentence and, at the same time, the Minister must accept, no matter how late in the day, the immortal words of <Col N="464" /> Robert Service that &ldquo;a promise made is a debt unpaid&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I am sure we all sympathise with the plight of some of our emigrants who fail to adjust to the demands of living outside of Ireland. Many are vulnerable or incapacitated to such an extent that they serve regular terms of imprisonment, usually for relatively minor offences. Some of the transferees to our prisons may wish to resettle here. I suspect that a portion of them will experience further problems in attempting to reintegrate into a different society from that of the United Kingdom and elsewhere. I hope the Minister plans to provide special probation officers and social workers to assist with the attempts of such transferees to come to terms with life in their own country again. Ex-prisoners from the United Kingdom and elsewhere deserve an opportunity to reform and the State has a duty to assist them.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice has promised a referendum to tighten our bail laws. However, due to ministerial inaction on this urgent issue, we in Fianna Fáil have published a Bill dealing with bail, which will be debated tonight. It cannot be disputed that the incidence of crime committed by people on bail has increased sharply in recent years and, consequently, it is abundantly clear that our bail laws need to be tightened. We must bear in mind that a balance must be struck between the rights of a person to personal civil liberty and the necessity to protect society from hardened criminals. In publishing a Bill, we must recognise that the consequential increase in the number of remand prisoners, through the curtailment of the opportunities for bail, will place a greater demand on the prison service. Because of the necessity to tighten our bail laws and the number of prisoners returning from the United Kingdom and elsewhere, there will be an obvious need for additional prison places.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister say, in terms of resources, what exactly the peace process means to her Department and whether such resources could be <Col N="465" /> deployed to expand the prison service? I have been endeavouring to get that information for some time, but have failed. Who has the figures? When will we get transparency on this issue? I again call for an urgent examination and response from the Minister on the issue of resources, particularly in the light of freeing up Garda resources along the Border. Surely at least some Border resources could be diverted immediately to ensure that we have a prison service that will not fall on its face as soon as the prisoner transfer policy begins and our bail laws are tightened. Many questions are in need of urgent replies. Tardy and obtuse diplomacy are not a substitute for direct and honest endeavour.</P>
    <P>The drafting of the Bill is somewhat ambiguous. The definition section fails to define the meaning of the word &ldquo;Court&rdquo;. There are references to the &ldquo;High Court&rdquo; and to &ldquo;the courts&rdquo;. Am I to understand that only the High Court will be given jurisdiction to deal with such matters as the issuing of warrants and the adaptation of sentences as provided for in section 5? I am also aware that the remission of sentences may differ in each member state. In this country there is a standard remission of one-quarter of a sentence where the prisoner has been of good behaviour. In Britain the remission is one-third. Is the Minister saying that the remission in the case of a prisoner transferred here will be one-quarter?</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>As is the case here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister cover the costs of the transfer of prisoners? I would expect the receiving State to pay the costs of incarceration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the provisions of the Bill, it must be noted that the convention does not give sentenced persons a right to transfer to their countries of origin. It merely facilitates their transfer if they request it and both States agree to it. This does not prevent a State which ratifies the convention from providing, through legislation, that prisoners who <Col N="466" /> satisfy the relevant criteria, shall have a right to transfer out of that State if the State to which they wish to be transferred agrees. Nor does it prevent such a State providing that prisoners who wish to be transferred to that State shall have a right to be accepted by that State, if the State in which they are currently imprisoned agrees to their transfer. In other words, Ireland can legislate to give a right to a foreign national imprisoned here to transfer to his or her home country if that State agrees to accept him or her. Ireland can also legislate to give a right to Irish nationals or persons who are to be regarded as such to be accepted here if the state in which they are currently held agrees to transfer them. However, Ireland cannot legislate to give Irish nationals imprisoned in, for example, the United Kingdom a right to transfer out of the United Kingdom. It can only guarantee that if the United Kingdon agrees to transfer these nationals, they will automatically be entitled to acceptance here. Similarly, Ireland cannot legislate to compel another state to accept the transfer of that state's nationals; Ireland can only guarantee that it will transfer them if their home state agrees to take them. That said, however, it would seem much more preferable that Ireland should establish transfer as a right when certain criteria are fulfilled rather than as a matter of discretion for the Minister concerned. If Ireland adopts the attitude of making transfer a right, subject to agreement by the other State, that might also exercise a certain moral authority or pressure on other convention states to adopt the same attitude in relation to Irish nationals held in their territory.</P>
    <P>This Bill makes decision on transfer into or out of the State a matter of descretion for the Minister. The amendment which I intend to move on Committee Stage would make it mandatory for the Minister to agree to transfer provided that the criteria currently set out in the Bill, which are essentially those set out in the convention, are satisfied.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="467" /> In regard to transfer out of the State the amendments would, however, preserve a discretion to refuse transfer if there was a danger of the prisoner being subjected to torture, inhuman or degrading treatment or if other charges were pending here against the prisoner. The amendments would also provide that there cannot be any unwarranted discrimination against persons on account of their race, colour, gender, views, etc. and require that in the event of a refusal by the Minister, the reasons for that refusal should be set out in writing and furnished to the prisoner within a reasonable; period of time. This would clearly facilitate an appeal against such a refusal. The amendments would also provide for an appeal to the High Court against the refusal of a transfer request in either direction. The lack of provision for such appeals is a serious flaw in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister accept that the cost of human life cannot be measured and the very least the Irish people can now expect is that the money saved in the Department of Justice as a direct result of the peace process should be spent on ensuring an enduring, lasting and just peaceful settlement on this island? Peace with justice is within our reach and I ask the Minister to further reach out to it now.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons was completed at Strasbourg on 21 March 1983. Countries such as the United States, the United Kingdom, Cyprus and the Turkish Republic were signatories to the convention. Turkey does not have a very <Col N="468" /> good record on human rights but it was prepared to sign the convention. It has taken this country over 12 years to adopt the convention and my party supports this Bill which ratifies it.</P>
    <P>My information indicates that approximately 40 persons of Irish nationality who are at present serving prison sentences in Northern Ireland, the United Kingdom, the United States and elsewhere would be available for immediate transfer. As we in Fianna Fáil are originators of the peace process we call on the Government to facilitate the return to Ireland of those prisoners who wish to do so. Article 2 of the convention states:</P>
    <P>1. The Parties undertake to afford each other the widest measure of cooperation in respect of the transfer of sentenced persons in accordance with the provisions of this Convention.</P>
    <P>2. A person sentenced in the territory of a Party may be transferred to the territory of another Party, in accordance with the provisions of this Convention, in order to serve the sentence imposed on him. To that end, he may express his interest to the sentencing State or to the administering State in being transferred under this Convention.</P>
    <P>3. Transfer may be requested by either the sentencing State or the administering State.</P>
    <P>Article 3 of the convention states:</P>
    <P>1. A sentenced person may be transferred under this Convention only on the following conditions:</P>
    <P>(a) if that person is a national of the administering State;</P>
    <P>(b) if the judgment is final;</P>
    <P>(c) if, at the time of receipt of the request for transfer, the sentenced person still has at least six months of the sentence to serve or if the sentence is indeterminate;</P>
    <P>(d) If the transfer is consented to by the sentenced person or, where <Col N="469" /> in view of his age or his physical or mental condition [I understand many of our prisoners suffer physical or mental conditions] one of the two States considers it necessary, by the sentenced person's legal representative;</P>
    <P>(e) if the acts or omissions on account of which the sentence has been imposed constitute a criminal offence according to the law of the administering State or would constitute a criminal offence if committed on its territory; and</P>
    <P>(f) if the sentencing and administering State agreed to the transfer.</P>
    <P>2. In exceptional cases, Parties may agree to a transfer even if the time to be served by the sentenced person is less than that specified in paragraph 1.c.</P>
    <P>3. Any State may, at the time of signature or when depositing its instrument or ratification, acceptance, approval or accession, by a declaration addressed to the Secretary General of the Council of Europe, indicate that it intends to exclude the application of one of the procedures provided in Article 9.1.a and b in its relations with other Parties.</P>
    <P>4. Any State may, at any time, by a declaration addressed to the Secretary General of the Council of Europe, define, as far as it is concerned, the term &ldquo;national&rdquo; for the purposes of this Convention.</P>
    <P>That is quite clear and specific.</P>
    <P>A vital condition is the agreement of the sentencing state and the administering state &mdash; in this context, Ireland. Will the Minister confirm that she will support the convention in practice by (1) making representations to the sentencing states, in particular Great Britain and Northern Ireland, which is part of our own State, in addition to the United States and (2) making available accommodation for their returning prisoners but not to our overcrowded prisons where some of the conditions <Col N="470" /> are appalling? I am sure the Minister is aware that the expense involved in visiting prisoners abroad can be as much as £500 for one person depending on where the prison is located in the UK. I am using the UK as an example but I am not aware what the cost would be in regard to Cyprus or the United States.</P>
    <P>Many of these prisoners' families come from humble backgrounds and they have great difficulty in coming up with the necessary moneys to travel abroad to visit their relatives. I am aware that during their entire prison sentence some prisoners will never be visited by all the members of their family. I ask the Minister to ratify the convention on compassionate grounds.</P>
    <P>If the peace process is to be successful &mdash; and I hope there is the same generosity on the Government side of the House as there is on this side &mdash; we must be more sympathetic to the plight of these prisoners. I ask the Minister to clarify points that have been raised on this side of the House because the peace process is vital for the economic wellbeing of the island. The guns have been off the streets for some time due to the efforts of people on this side of the House going back as far as 1982, when Mr. Haughey was Taoiseach. I appeal to the Minister to do everything possible to assist in this area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>The introduction of this legislation which facilitates our ratifying the Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons is driven primarily by the peace process. There is no doubt about that and the Minister should say so. It is not driven by a wish to honour international obligations on human rights as it has taken us 12 years to ratify this convention. There is no doubt that commitments were made to Sinn Féin and we should know what we are taking about when discussing this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill facilitates the transfer of sentenced prisoners from foreign states to Ireland and <i>vice versa</i> to serve the balance of their sentence in their home country. This is welcome on humanitarian grounds and as an essential part <Col N="471" /> of the peace process. Although we are not allowed to set out a hierarchy of the elements of the peace process, it would be disingenuous to ignore its potential implications for the Exchequer. The Minister accepted this point in her speech and indicated that when it comes to ratification this Government may enter a reservation because it may turn out to be one way traffic given our emigration trends. Once there is a facility for the return of sentenced prisoners we may have far more prisoners being transferred to us rather than from us. The Minister stated that there were 180 foreign nationals in our prisons and 650 Irish prisoners abroad. There is a discrepancy in the figures because I have a figure of up to 1,200 prisoners of Irish nationality in prisons abroad. We have to be clear about possible implications for the Exchequer and I am glad the Minister is reserving the right of discretion. If you give absolute rights to prisoners to return home regardless of the State's capacity to accommodate them, we may see prisoners initiating proceedings in the High Court to vindicate their rights and this would cause many problems. A tripartite arrangement is very important &mdash; the receiving state must consent, the transferring state must consent and the prisoner must consent.</P>
    <P>I am not trying to minimise the humanitarian aspect of this Bill or to deny that it is a very important part of the peace process &mdash; one which we support &mdash; but we should discuss the economic implications of it. The non-capital cost per offender is £37,000 per annum and the capital cost of providing each new place of detention is £100,000 per place. In the document <i>The Management of Offenders &mdash; a Five Year Plan</i> the Government costed 210 additional places at £30 million with additional operating costs of £7.8 million per annum. On the basis of those figures, if 120 Irish prisoners overseas were returned to their home country to complete their sentence, the capital cost would be £17.14 million plus an annual <Col N="472" /> operating cost of £4.4 million. It would be irresponsible of us not to consider at least how we might deal with the fact that this Bill is not Exchequer neutral.</P>
    <P>The Minister does not need me to tell her that the prison system is close to collapse in terms of space for the number of prisoners. This Bill gives us the opportunity to challenge the Minister to address major policy and structural reforms that are needed.</P>
    <P>In the past 15 years there has been a substantial growth in the number of offenders in our prisons which rose from the daily number of 1,215 in 1980 to 2,175, an increase of 79 per cent. This is made considerably worse by the fact that due to the absolute scarcity of accommodation in our prisons we have to grant 500-600 prisoners temporary release. This aspect of prison policy has to be looked at as there is evidence that people on temporary release commit more crimes, as well as the revolving door syndrome, this is when somebody is put on remand somebody has to be released because there is no separate remand centre. Somebody awaiting trial, presumed innocent until proven guilty, is placed within the body of the existing prison population along with hardened criminals and drug addicts and a convicted prisoner is given early or temporary release.</P>
    <P>I wonder what is the status now of <i>The Management of Offenders &mdash; A Five Year Plan,</i> a document published by the Department of Justice in June 1994? Is all the intellectual work which went into this report set at nought? Does the Minister have plans for additional prison places? Does the Minister have a plan to deal with heroin addicts, who make up one third of the prison population in Mountjoy Prison? The latest reports from the Visiting Committee have been damning indictments of the system. Dreadful language was used in one report to describe how Mountjoy Prison is close to collapse and it is really convincing. I am sure anyone who has visited Mountjoy Prison, as I have, will testify to the fact that the system is only accommodating the problem. There is <Col N="473" /> no rehabilitation, there is no work and most of the prisoners do nothing all day except lie despondent in their cells. They are not encouraged to work as there are no facilities to do so. Drugs are widely available and they are sumps of despair. We are now considering the return of Irish people who have raped English women, have broken into houses in Britain or been involved in terrible crimes in England. I wonder if we have our priorities right in initiating such a procedure and putting it on our Statute Book when our own prison system is in a disastrous state. There is an absence of policy from top to bottom.</P>
    <P>There is across-the-board agreement in this House that as part of the peace process we have to honour this commitment to Sinn Féin. There is no doubt that apart from so called political prisoners &mdash; terrorists &mdash; there are many ordinary criminals, as they are called, who will experience racism in jails by reason of their cultural difference and language. In some cases they may be held in appalling conditions although we cannot boast fantastic prison conditions. It may well be that some Irish prisoners imprisoned overseas may not want to go to Mountjoy. I would not blame them.</P>
    <P>There is a number of small discrepancies between the Bill and the convention which I will address on Committee Stage. Article 4 of the convention provides that the Minister must inform all sentenced persons to whom the convention applies of the substance of the convention, in other words, of their right to apply for a transfer. However, the Bill does not place any such obligation on the Minister to inform Irish people imprisoned abroad. The Minister may say that all foreign prisoners will be informed of their entitlement to apply for a transfer as a matter of course but it is fair to say that in the past aliens detained in our jails were not afforded all their civil, human and legal rights. We cannot leave anything to chance. I am thinking of refugees who have been treated appalling in this State over the <Col N="474" /> years. It would be prudent for the Minister to include in the Bill a specific legal obligation to inform prisoners who are nationals of another contracting state of their right to a transfer.</P>
    <P>Despite my cautious welcome for the Bill it should not become law without having a good debate on what the Minister proposes to do with prisoners transferred here from abroad given the difficulties with space. The non-capital cost per year for every adult prisoner in Mountjoy is £37,000, an extraordinarily high figure. The capital cost is much higher with every extra prison space costing £110,000.</P>
    <P>There is little or no rehabilitative programme in the prison service. The level of recidivism and the continued failure of the prison service to deal with the problem of prisoners who abuse drugs and alcohol is evidence of that. Prisons should be places of detention, discipline and detoxification where appropriate. There is need for the Minister to consider setting up a national custodial detoxification centre for prisoner addicts given that one third of the prison population in Mountjoy are heroin abusers. At least then we can go some way towards treating that class of criminal rather than accommodating sick people who get worse in jail.</P>
    <P>The Minister should clarify the number of prisoners held abroad. I have a figure of 1,200 while the Minister referred to 650. Recent figures in a newspaper report indicated that there are 650 Irish prisoners in Britain alone. We need to know what we are doing in terms of numbers and the cost to the Exchequer. The Minister said she draws no distinction between terrorists and ordinary criminals.</P>

      <P>Regarding the enforcement of sentences handed down by a British court, for example a 20 year sentence for a terrorist, if the person is willing to come home and the receiving state &mdash; us &mdash; is willing to accept him and the sending state &mdash; Britain &mdash; is willing to send him, is the Minister saying that her executive power to remit the sentence in terms of the release of political prisoners will apply to such lengthy sentences? That is an important political point since only recently Irish people were sentenced to long terms of imprisonment for carrying out terrible <Col N="476" /> atrocities in British cities. Is that part of the deal? We will not hear about that; it is hidden between the lines.</P>
      <P>What is noticeable about the Bill is the lack of any understanding of or sympathy for the victims. We talk about the consent of the sending state, the receiving state and the offender but there is not a word about notifying victims or their families. It is part of the continuing failure of the Minister for Justice and the Taoiseach to recognise, even in a small way, the equal rights of the victims of crime. This is a theme I have visited frequently on the Taoiseach. The Minister is sympathetic towards a charter on victims' rights and has given a commitment to honour it. The Bill does not give a whit of recognition or understanding to the victims in Britain who have buried their dead as a result of terrorist acts.</P>
      <P>It may be seen as politically incorrect in the context of the peace process to talk about such matters but there has been an unhelpful suspension of our critical faculties so terrified are we that we might upset Gerry Adams. This is not to the good and has disimproved the level of debate about the rights of relatives and victims and decency and fairness in the context of the peace process. I am glad the Bill gives me an opportunity to say that.</P>
      <P>This Bill puts in place a mechanism which will enable Irish terrorists who were involved in very serious acts of terrorism in Britain to be brought back here and in due course released because the Government says so. That is the big political issue which is hidden in the lines of this Bill. We should have a good talk about that because we in this State can be flaithiúlacht about releasing terrorist prisoners. We have not picked up babies from the rubble as have people in Britain and Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to be alarmist but if Irish prisoners held abroad were to be returned here the number involved would be phenomenal. What is the position about the extra 210 places promised in this glossy document &mdash; a five year plan for the management of offenders?</P>
    </Speaker>

Other than that, the group is free to examine whatever aspects of composition and method of election of Members of both Houses of the Oireachtas that they think fit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The full membership of the review group is as follows: Dr. Thomas K. Whitaker (Chairman); Mr. David Byrne, S.C.; Dr. Alpha Connelly, Research Counsellor, Law Reform Commission; Ms Mary Finlay, S.C.; Mr. Dermot <Col N="482" /> Gleeson, S.C., Attorney General; Mr. James Hamilton, Legal Assistant, Attorney General's office; Mr. Mahon Hayes, retiring Permanent Representative of Ireland at the United Nations; Mr. Gerard Hogan, B.L.; Professor Áine Hyland, Professor of Education, UCC; Dr. Finola Kennedy, Economist; Professor Michael Laver, Professor of Political Science, TCD; Dr. Kathleen Lynch, Co-ordinator, Equality Studies Centre, UCD; Mr. Diarmaid McGuinness, B.L.; Mr. Dermot Nally, former Secretary to the Government, and Dr. Blathna Ruane, B.L.</P>
    <P>The review group will have a year to complete its work. To enable the all-party Oireachtas committee to start work early in 1996, the group is being requested to furnish, by the end of this calendar year, provisional observations on any range of matters which may then be at an advanced stage of consideration.</P>
    <P>Copies of the Government Press Release of 27 April 1995, setting out the terms of reference, background, membership and secretariat arrangements of the Constitution Review Group are being placed in the Oireachtas Library and arrangements are being made to convene the first meeting of the group on 11 May 1995.</P>

      <P>I understand that part of the committee's remit will be to review the electoral system. Is it the case that matters relating to bail and Cabinet confidentiality would be outside the remit of the committee? Has the Government, collectively, any views on the question of changing the electoral system for election to Dáil Éireann to what has been most often mooted, that is, single seat constituencies? Has the Government any views on the question of universal suffrage for elections to the Seanad? If the committee makes recommendations, what status will those recommendations have, and is the Government committed to implementing them? Further, will it be in a position to implement such recommendations?</P>

      <P>The Government will most certainly be in a position to implement any recommendations it wishes. However, the recommendations will be those of the expert group and will be going to an all-party committee. The Government will be in no way committed to implementing any of these recommendations, nor will any of the individual Government parties. They will be discussed in a normal way within the all-party group. The Government will then come to final decisions on whatever matters it wishes in the light of the deliberations and report of the group. As to the question of the electoral system, that is not excluded from the terms of reference but there is no specific request to the committee to deal with that matter any more than there is to deal with any other matter in the Constitution. It will be open to the group and, subsequently, to the Oireachtas committee, to decide which matters in the Constitution they wish to make recommendations about and which they recommend should be left alone.</P>

      <P>I asked the Taoiseach earlier this year to consult with Opposition parties before putting the names together. I thank him for so doing, although I appreciate nobody was there on a party political basis. Has the Government since taking office consulted with any party in Opposition on the holding of the forthcoming divorce referendum?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>My understanding is that there has been ongoing contact between the Minister for Equality and Law Reform and other parties. Certainly it is the Government's intention to have concrete consultations with Opposition parties at a time when this <Col N="484" /> would be most fruitful, namely, when it is coming close to a conclusion on its own views. I said this already in the House this morning.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the Government has formally consulted with one party in Opposition since taking office. As somebody very committed to the passing of the divorce legislation, I consider it unfortunate that the announcement was made last night. It is very unhelpful. The Government cannot expect to have an all-party approach if it comes to the table with a <i>fait accompli</i> which, I believe, is the Government's way of handling this matter. I wish to register my protest and that of my party that we have not been consulted on the matter since this Government took office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy is under a misapprehension. No final conclusions have been reached on this matter by the Cabinet. I chose my words carefully on the Order of Business. The Government's view is crystallising around a certain possible course of action but it is not finalised at this stage. All that was done last night was to alert public opinion and the Opposition to the options that the Government has in mind and give an indication of a general kind as to the likely choice the Government will make within those options. I stress that no final decision of any kind has been taken by the Cabinet on the matter of the wording that is to be put to the people. I want to further reiterate the commitment of the Government to engage in constructive consultation with the Opposition parties on this matter. I regard that as very important and I assure the Deputy that nothing that has happened to date is to be in any sense taken as pre-empting or limiting discussions with Opposition parties.</P>
      <P>I interrupted Deputy Harney in the middle of a question to clarify what I thought was a misapprehension and prevented her from asking a second question.</P>

      <P>I appreciate what the Taoiseach has said because I was very annoyed this morning when I read the reports. We need to learn lessons from what happened in this country in the early 1980s. More important, the divorce referendum will be in grave difficulty if there is not an all-party approach from the beginning. I am, therefore, delighted that the Taoiseach has given an assurance that that will be the approach because that was not my understanding from what I read earlier today.</P>

      <P>The meeting which the Minister, Deputy Taylor, had with the Leader of my party was in the nature of an informal discussion. I agree with Deputy Harney that unless there is an all-party consensus, the divorce referendum will be in difficulty. I am of the opinion that the passage of this referendum will be extremely tight so the greater the all-party consensus the better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I concur with that. It is highly desirable that there should be an all-party approach. We are all politicians with our own different points of view and I cannot, therefore, guarantee that we will reach final and complete agreement on everything. However, we will be seeking to do so. That will be the object of the consultation but whether we achieve it remains to be seen, and there are others apart from the Government who will have responsibility in that regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer the Deputy to <Col N="486" /> what I said in the original reply which was to the effect that it is not a question of excluding any matter. The following is a quotation from the terms of reference of the body: &ldquo;In their review the group should take into account that certain constitutional matters, i.e. Articles 2 and 3, divorce, the right to bail, Cabinet confidentiality and votes for emigrants are the subject of separate consideration.&rdquo; It is sensibly drawn to the attention of the committee that these matters are being dealt with separately.</P>

      <P>Is the Taoiseach confident that there is all-party consensus within Government on the issue of the divorce referendum? The Minister for Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Taylor, was definite about the approach he wished to take in regard to the referendum. If the Taoiseach is looking for all-party consensus, he should first look within Government. I agree that unless there is consensus we will not have the successful conclusion we are all seeking to the divorce referendum.</P>

      <P>The first report of the co-ordinating group of secretaries was received by the Government in early March. Phase II of the process on which progress needs to be made is now under way. This involves a deepening and strengthening of the Strategic Management Initiative launched 12 months ago by the former Taoiseach, Deputy Reynolds. The action to be taken includes the translation of departmental and divisional objectives into specific action oriented strategies in each Department and the accompanying measures of performance that will enhance the ability to monitor and actively manage outcomes &mdash; we expect to receive these by end of July; the publication of a strategy document by each Minister for their own Department or arm of State; drafting of proposals by the co-ordinating group of secretaries for the modernisation of the existing financial and personnel management functions in the Civil Service and setting up three pilot groups of assistant secretaries in the areas of child care, competitiveness and the environment to improve links between Departments and to examine now cross-cutting issues can be resolved.</P>

That committee comprises representatives of the Departments of the Environment, Marine, Foreign Affairs and Transport, <Col N="492" /> Energy and Communications and handles a particularly difficult issue for this country. There is much to be learned and done. If it can be proceeded with more quickly I will try to have this done.</P>

      <P>I note the first part of the question. The second point is a very important and serious one. I have started a round of meetings with the various public sector unions and I have been in constant contact with union representatives and shop stewards. This is a sensitive area which will be progressed as quickly as possible. Everyone must be involved in the strategic management initiative. In terms of reforming the public sector, there is now a critical mass within that sector that demands reform. I am optimistic of success in this area because the changes are not being politically imposed from the outside. Together with the public sector unions we will effect the changes necessary for a modern efficient public service that will bring us into the next century.</P>

      <P>I do not propose to introduce an oral assessment component for the junior certificate English examination in the 1996-97 school year. When this revised syllabus was introduced for examination for the first time in 1992 it was indicated that an oral-aural component might be introduced.</P>
      <P>As indicated in the White Paper, I intend to establish an implementation group before the middle of July to draw up a detailed timetable and programme for a fundamental restructuring of the assessment carried out at the end of junior cycle.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>My question is more specific in that it relates to oral and aural assessment in the English language at junior and leaving certificate levels rather than a general review of the curricula. Does the Minister consider it absurd that since we place great emphasis on the importance of oral assessment in the Irish language and modern European languages and consider it as a fundamental part of the language education process, we do not place as much emphasis on the importance of such assessment in the fundamental working language of students? Will the Minister agree the most fundamental skill we can impart to our young people before they leave school is a basic competency in and mastery of the <Col N="494" /> English language at oral and aural levels?</P>

      <P>The question asked what steps the Minister will take to introduce an oral English assessment at junior and leaving certificate levels for the academic year 1996-97 and the answer is that I do not propose to introduce such an assessment. An implementation group will be set up before July to consider this matter. When the junior certificate was introduced we expected that the full range of curricular objectives would be realised. This question is related to the difficult issue of school-based assessment. Deputy Martin will realise there are difficulties in the teaching profession about the introduction of school-based assessment, and the purpose of setting up the implementation group is to break the impasse resulting from the position taken specifically by the ASTI against school-based assessment.</P>
      <P>The intention is to introduce a competency test in the leaving certificate, but there are difficulties involved. This matter must be considered together with all the people involved. The implementation group will put proposals to the Minister in this regard. While I would not use such a word as &ldquo;absurd&rdquo;, I recognise we share a common belief that education is tested not only on written ability. Competency in the English language is important and the way we test such competency would best be considered in partnership with the teachers, managerial bodies and all those involved in education.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9 and 62 together.</P>
      <P>Managerial authorities of each school are responsible for ensuring that a fair and efficient code of behaviour, encompassing rules, sanctions and procedures, is drawn up and applied in the school. Circumstances will vary from school to school and it is only those intimately involved with a particular school who can draw up the detail of a code of discipline appropriate for that school. Accordingly, the most effective method of countering indiscipline is for each individual school to draw up its own code of behaviour. In drawing up the code, school authorities should have regard to guidelines issued by my Department.</P>
      <P>In 1990 and 1991, my Department issued &ldquo;Guidelines Towards a Positive Policy for School Behaviour and Discipline&rdquo; together with &ldquo;A Suggested Code of Behaviour and Discipline&rdquo; to all schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These guidelines provide a valuable framework for schools in putting in place their codes of discipline as well as the home school links programme which <Col N="496" /> is a very important initiative which can play a key role in combating indiscipline. This year Deputies will be pleased to hear that I will allocate a further 60 teachers in this vital area.</P>
    <P>Because I am aware that schools differ in the extent to which they encounter discipline problems, using the funds available to my Department for research I intend to set up a research study on school discipline. The study will survey practice and strategies in schools and identify best practices for dissemination among all schools. The outcome of this survey will be submitted to the interested partners for their response and updated guidelines will issue following this consultation process.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that teachers are under increasing stress as a result of indiscipline in our schools and that there is an increasing number of suspensions and expulsions of under 15 year old students because of behavioural and discipline problems? These students have nowhere to go. We cannot await research results on this fundamental issue. Does the Minister propose to introduce legislation in this area?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy can suggest an instant solution to this problem, I am more than willing to listen. It is inappropriate for him to dismiss the suggestion that an investigation should be carried out to ascertain why some schools within a three to four miles radius experience great discipline problems in the school community while others do not. It is worth examining practice in schools and reviewing the existing guidelines. The problem arises within the school community and can be tackled through the involvement of teachers, managers and parents. The Deputy can point to some schools in his city which have experienced greater discipline problems than others. It is worthwhile carrying out the research and surveying what is happening not only in schools but the best practice in other places and bringing forward <Col N="497" /> updated guidelines. While the expulsion of a pupil is the last discipline resort taken by a school, it can only be done after every effort is made to rehabilitate the pupil. It also involves legal consequences for schools. If a pupil under the age of 15 is expelled an alternative school placement must be secured for that pupil. I assure the Deputy that the Department's inspectorate devotes many hours to helping schools and parents in cases where a school wishes to expel a pupil who has a legal entitlement to stay in the school system until he or she is 15 years of age.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is a long way from reality. As a member of a board of management of a second level school which recently had to expel a 13 year old, I put it to the Minister that the pupil's parents had no access to the Department's complaints procedure. The Department's psychological service is woefully inadequate and was not available to the school in terms of referral. Will the Minister accept that we are dealing with a crisis in our schools involving many young people and it is no longer exclusive to any one school? The Minister should also accept that discipline problems arise in all schools. I speak from experience. It is unfair of the Minister to attempt to act wise regarding school discipline in certain schools and communities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a responsibility for children in the education system. It is not a realistic response to the problem to describe it as a crisis, say that people are unwilling to listen and the problem exists in all schools. I acknowledge pupils have behavioural problems, but coming from the teaching profession I must say that some schools which use a combination of the efforts of parents and teachers and clear discipline guidelines do not always experience the same level of disruption from pupils as others. That area is worthy of investigation. The Department's psychology service was non-existent until my arrival and I am pleased that in the <Col N="498" /> next school year 20 school psychologists will be available in the service. We must not wait until pupils are 15 or 16 years of age to expel them, rather we should identify behavioural problems displayed by pupils at an early date. As the Deputy said, pupils must display extreme behavioural problems before the last of the sanctions in the guidelines for expulsion is exercised. It would be productive and more useful if we proceeded by helping school communities experiencing these problems to look at good practice and put in place guidelines which can be fleshed out having regard to the community needs of individual schools. It is negative to dismiss this proposal and say the problem is beyond redemption.</P>

It is worth investigating where there is specific good practice in schools. Every school does not expel pupils daily.</P>

      <P>Most children, including the Deputy's and mine, go to <Col N="499" /> school. Most pupils and schools serve their communities well. Early identification of the disruptive problems caused by a small number of students would be much more satisfactory than identification of them at expulsion age. The 20 psychologists that will be available next year, the existing guidelines and the increasing role of parents and the home school links programme, which allows schools link with pupils who are experiencing difficulties in school, are positive measures to deal with the problem and evidence that we are responding to the needs of students who disrupt not only their education but that of others.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10, 12, 120 together.</P>
      <P>This is a vitally important issue and I would like to give a comprehensive reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome assurances given by the teacher unions that the State examinations will not be the subject of any industrial action being balloted on as a <Col N="500" /> result of motions passed at the recent teacher union congress.</P>
    <P>It is important that I should put on the record of this House that a very comprehensive and balanced set of proposals was offered to the teacher unions before the talks broke down.</P>
    <P>The offer comprised a general provision of retirement at age 55 with 35 years service for post-primary teachers to bring them into line with primary teachers; early retirement with added years for teachers who cannot function at acceptable levels of professional performance because of stress or for other reasons; early retirement, with added years for surplus teachers; reduction of the common basic scale for teachers from a 26 to a 24 point scale; phased payment of the pass degree allowance to teachers without a degree; payment of the H. Dip. allowance as well as a degree allowance to teachers holding four-year concurrent degrees; increases of up to £2,500 and £1,700 respectively in allowances for principals and vice-principals of larger schools; payment of a once-off lump-sum to all current post holders, and full recognition for pension purposes, for existing teachers, of capitation and supernumerary service in convent and monastery schools.</P>
    <P>I regret that negotiations on a wide range of issues broke down on the single issue of the claim made by the teacher union for an entitlement for all teachers of extra years of pensionable service over and above the years worked.</P>
    <P>The teacher unions are demanding: a reduction in the service requirement for early retirement from 35 to 33 years, and maximum superannuation benefits on attainment of 38 years service rather than 40 years as at present.</P>
    <P>Disagreement arose between the sides on the cost and funding of this proposal. In response to a request I made during the recent teacher unions' congress. I received information on the costings of their proposal. This is currently being examined in my Department and the Department of Finance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>Why has it taken the Minister so long to ascertain information crucial to the negotiations? Why had she to wait so long before requesting this information from the Department of Finance? Why does this unnecessary uncertainty continue on the overall issue? Would she agree that industrial action by teachers would not have been contemplated had she taken these steps months beforehand?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have detailed to the House the good offer made to the teachers unions. The negotiations broke down when the teachers pursued a claim which emerged from the talks that began in February last on 33 years' service, seeking the attainment of 38 years rather than 40 years service overall. My Department was informed of the figures calculated and well publicised by the teachers unions, but there is a difference of interpretation with regard to them. During the teachers' unions conferences I asked the unions to make the details of their advice available to my Department. The details furnished in the days following the teachers' unions meetings are now being examined. This is not an easily settled dispute. I must be careful because it would not be prudent, practical or in the best interests of good industrial relations to go into too much detail in this House about those differences of opinion. I am glad I have had an opportunity of spelling out for Members and the public generally what was on offer to the teachers' unions. Following my request to them figures have been made available to the official side, and are being examined by both Departments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan" hpid="Miss Coughlan Miss Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Miss Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>Why did the Minister give a commitment on which she cannot deliver two years ago to the teachers' unions conferences? She must address the reason she has not been able to persuade her colleague, the Minister for Finance, to provide the necessary funding. It is ludicrous to be told after so many years a solution cannot be found.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="502" /> A solution can be found and it is preposterous that there has been no movement with regard to primary teachers and only an unrealistic proposal with regard to post-primary teachers, the majority of whom do not get a permanent post until age 27 which means they are at least 62 before attaining 35 years' service. Can the Minister give all pupils and parents an assurance that she will be able to deliver on early retirement, thus preventing unnecessary industrial action?</P>
    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>I can deliver my commitment only if all sides agree, first, in identifying the problem and second, on reaching a solution. I attended the teachers unions' conferences in April 1993 at which the huge issue was the &ldquo;stressed-out teacher&rdquo;, the teacher who could no longer perform, the teacher who is a danger not only to himself or herself but to the children in the class-room. I do not want to read out the full list of proposals on the table following the talks that took place since April 1993. Very high on that list is early retirement with added years, for teachers who cannot function at acceptable levels of professional performance for stress or other reasons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the reason. My commitment to the teacher union conferences in April 1993 was that I would examine that issue. There is also early retirement with added years, for surplus teachers. There is the general objective to level the playing pitch <i>vis-à-vis</i> second-level and primary school teachers, the latter always having had the right to retire at age 55 without full pension. The House will see that there is a general early retirement provision on offer which will improve the overall position of the second-level teacher but difficulties arise when the teachers unions' ask that we examine their demand for maximum superannuation benefits on the attainment of 38 rather than 40 years service &mdash; an expensive <Col N="503" /> demand. There are differences of opinion on its annual cost and on how those figures have been calculated. Because there is that difference of opinion between both sides, I suggested &mdash; at the teacher union conferences &mdash; it would be helpful if their detailed calculations were made available to me. They are now being examined by both Departments. The House will realise there is much on offer to the teachers from the official side but the matter of the 38 rather than 40 years service presented considerable difficulty. In that regard there is either a very big cost down the road to the State or there is another interpretation of it. It is crucial to examine the figures and any commitment we might give. Of course, had we unlimited resources to fund pension schemes &mdash; and this would apply to all of the public sector &mdash; no difficulty or industrial action would arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree she is the author of her problems because of the assurances she gave at those teachers unions' conferences? If that is not her understanding, I am afraid that is the teachers' understanding of the matter. Is it not extraordinary the Minister took no initiative to examine the costs of the teachers' proposals until such a late date? If the Minister is endeavouring to inculcate enterprise and initiative among the pupils of this State I suggest that she begin within her Department where such basic questions should have been asked and which, if not asked by her, should have been posed by her officials.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan" hpid="Miss Coughlan Miss Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Miss Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister of the opinion that teachers should have parity of service for retirement purposes with other professionals in the public service? Why had the Minister not done her homework with the Department of Finance before entering those negotiations? It is unbelievable that a large <Col N="504" /> Department like hers would not have had its homework done before entering negotiations, would not have a fall-back position to resolve the problem. Will the Minister please inform the House when she will be in a position to go back to the teachers' unions on this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>This argument <i>visà-vis</i> parity of service does not hold water. The compulsory early retirement arrangements for the Garda, prison officers and psychiatric nurses are much lower than the public service norm, reflecting on and recognising the physical demands of the tasks involved. I should remind the House that very stringent conditions are laid down with regard to added years in respect of a number of professionals within the public service who can retire early. These professionals representing a very small proportion of professional public servants who qualify for added years, under which arrangement, added years are reduced, year for year, whenever a person retires before age 65.</P>
      <P>It is important that we put the facts on record. Statements which claim that other public sector groups are benefiting from such arrangements do not hold water. It must be recognised that the position <i>vis-à-vis</i> the Garda, prison officers and psychiatric nurses is different. In the last round of talks &mdash; if they can be described as such &mdash; the teacher unions sought maximum superannuation benefits on the attainment of 38 rather than 40 years of service and put a price on that. We were negotiating under the 3 per cent clause in the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i> The costing the teacher unions put on what they sought suggested it could be easily met, but when the figures were rejected by the official side additional information was sought. Information is forthcoming and detailed examination in respect of those figures is taking place.</P>

      <P>Many people, including myself, would like this matter dealt with, but we need to give consideration to very detailed figures which relate not only to this year's pension bill, but to the difficulties that will arise in 15 or 20 years time in this regard. We owe it to the taxpayers and to ourselves to ensure that the figures on which we agree have been properly examined. I thank the unions for giving me the details of their figures and I am sure they will bear with us while we carry out a detailed examination of them.</P>

      <P>I am taking Questions Nos. 11 and 24 together.</P>
      <P>I have publicy expressed my concern about the impact of the examination fees on students from disadvantaged backgrounds. The outright abolition of examination fees would not focus relief on those most in need. It would also be expensive &mdash; costing more than £6 million per year.</P>
      <P>The Society of St. Vincent de Paul wrote to me last year advising that it had discontinued its practice of assisting with the payment of examination fees and recommending that fees be dispensed with altogether or means-tested.</P>
      <P>At present my Department operates a number of measures aimed at alleviating hardship arising from the payment of these fees. A provision of £400,000 has been made available to schools in order that entry fees for the 1995 examinations may be waived or reduced in the case of those experiencing financial hardship.</P>
      <P>There is an additional provision of £600,000 for reduced fees in the case of candidates who are repeating the leaving certificate. These candidates would normally be required to pay a higher fee than first-time candidates but where the candidate, parent or guardian, holds a medical card, the maximum fee payable is the fee payable by first-time candidates.</P>
      <P>I have recently expressed my intention to review the possibility of abolishing examination fees in the case of disadvantaged pupils as resources become available to me. In line with this intention I have instructed my Department to examine the limitations of the existing arrangements for waiver so that improvements will be directed at those most in need.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that in the recent budgetary package on education, following the decision to <Col N="507" /> abolish tax covenants, it was estimated that the figure of £35 million would accrue to the Minister to be expended on education and that she decided to allocate it entirely to one sector, namely, in respect of the abolition of fees for third-level undergraduate students? Yet today she stated that none of that money could be allocated to alleviating the undoubted hardship imposed on many disadvantaged students from low income families as a result of the imposition of examination fees at junior certificate and leaving certificate levels. Does this not fly in the face of the principle of equality enshrined in the White Paper?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">

      <P>I will deal with the specifics of examination fees. A waiver scheme is in place and pupils from homes in which parents are unemployed, where a parent is suffering from a prolonged illness, where there is a large family with inadequate means, single parent families or families where more than one child is sitting examinations may benefit from it. All the examples outlined by the Deputy would qualify for benefit under the scheme. The Society of St. Vincent de Paul raised this issue with us. Up to last year it was involved with the Department in alleviating hardship. The Department's hardship fund stands at £500,000 and will be allocated to schools and the vocational education committees in respect of examinations for 1995. The fund was increased in recognition of the increased number of candidates, but there was no increase in examination fees since 1994.</P>

      <P>One approaches one budget at a time. The waiver scheme for examination fees at second level would appear on paper to be generous, but I would like to be satisfied that such a generous scheme would meet the requirements of students in need. The scheme has been publicised and we must be satisfied that those who suffer undue hardship benefit from an alleviation of fees. I have asked officials in my Department to examine the question of the payment of examination fees, but the fees for 1995 were paid earlier in the year. Therefore, the examination being carried out relates to fees for future years.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister recognise that hardship is widespread and despite the amount of money set aside to alleviate it, to a large extent, schools must decide who will benefit? I am aware of families in which two or three children are sitting State examinations who have been turned down on the basis that their fathers are employed, despite the fact that they are on a very low income. I assume the Minister's provision in the budget was merely a first step in the reorganisation of education.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister agree, having seen the latest OECD figures, that in the area which has the greatest participation in education, namely, primary level, we have one of the lowest financial investments and in the area where there is least participation, the third level sector, we have the highest investment?</P>

      <P>Will the Minister agree that, based on these figures, there should be free primary education and, as a first step, that she should abolish the fees for the junior certificate?

      <P>The Deputy <Col N="510" /> referred to two areas of common concern, namely, how we arrive at the figure and whether we are satisfied that those who need our help in a waiver scheme are getting that help. The amount allocated to each school in the vocational education committee for the 1995 examinations was based on the results of a questionnaire on hardship issued to schools in 1994. The schools were asked to communicate with the Department about their need for funding on the waiver scheme. The allocations were increased or reduced taking into account particular circumstances which the schools detailed for us.</P>
      <P>On the matter of the OECD and investment in primary education, that will be a useful measure of the contribution that I have made in the Department of Education as a member of this Government because the OECD is only a snapshot of the investment made in education in 1991 and 1992, years preceding my arrival in Marlborough Street. If we consider the improvements in the pupil-teacher ratio and the improvements in capitation grants, that is a fairly graphic illustration of the increasing amount of investment in the primary sector. However, I do not believe that we yet have the right balance of investemnt in the primary sector but with the demographic trend and the lowering of numbers in schools to maintain the teaching quota and the increasing investment at primary level, we are somewhat on the way to improving the lot of the primary sector. Those improvements will be measured quite graphically &mdash; probably when I am no longer Minister for Education &mdash; by the difference between the position in 1992 and the next OECD education figures.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">

      <P>Expenditure of this nature is a budgetary matter. By the time the budget is ready for 1996-97 the outcome of the examination may be known. However, I have already had some suggestions arising from various examinations of different schemes and I intend to take time to consider those. With the extension of the school leaving age to 16 all pupils will be sitting the junior certificate and I want to ensure that the examination fees will not be a barrier to any student sitting that examination. We are currently reviewing the manner in which we decide what schools are designated disadvantaged and in this regard the Combat Poverty Agency is due to report to me this month. At the AMCSS Conference in Cork, Mr. Liam Murphy said that not only should we regard some schools as having disadvantaged status but we must also remember that there are disadvantaged pupils in other schools. I must be conscious of that and I believe the remarks made by Mr. Murphy at the conference were timely.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister accept that an unhealthy development has taken place as a result of the imposition of examination fees in that many students are embarrassed to go to school at the time when these fees are due to be paid? Pupils are sitting with their fellow students in the class-room conscious of the fact that their parents do not have the money for these fees. This is creating an unhealthy atmosphere for students at second level. This is an important dimension to the whole issue of fees which sometimes is overlooked and it is one that the Minister should accept from the evidence I have obtained from those operating in the field. Will the Minister agree that the costs are not exorbitant and that in the context of the abolition of tax covenants, the revenue was there for the <Col N="512" /> Minister to do something about this in the last budget but she decided against it?</P>

      <P>The picture the Deputy paints is a rather sad one. It is one in which the circumstances of the family appear to be alien within the classroom and the school community. I would point to the greater need for parents and schools to realise that they are of one community and that where problems exist people should not be embarrassed in any way to communicate with the principal of the school to the effect that they would qualify under the waiver scheme. The money allocated to each school was decided upon following the results of the questionnaire sent by the Department of Education to the school management. The management furnished the details to the Department and the Department responded accordingly. If the Deputy is painting a picture of many students being embarrassed&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Will the Minister agree that following the bombardment which the education system has been under for the past ten years, particularly in relation to first and second level, and the destruction perpetrated by previous Ministers in the preceding years, the education system will be greatly enhanced by the abolition of education fees at the point of assessment of the young adult? I do not blame the present Minister for the destruction of the education system in relation to class sizes <Col N="513" /> and withdrawal of funding for special remedial teaching.</P>

      <P>I am very conscious of the fact that while 74 per cent of students complete second level schooling, it would be reasonable to expect that figure to be 90 per cent. Where barriers exist and people feel they are being driven out of the school system despite the massive investment the State makes in the future of our young people, I must ensure that those barriers are removed. They can be removed by positive intervention on behalf of the disadvantaged who are not getting equal access to education.</P>
      <P>The very nature of the curriculum was a barrier because there are and were for a long time sections of the community for whom the academic programme was irrelevant to their life's chances. There is the barrier of funding as well as psychological barriers. The White Paper has gone on sale today at a cost of £5, but of course I have a complimentary copy for the Opposition spokespersons and I ask everyone to look at it. The title of the White Paper <i>Charting our Education Future</i> describes what we are doing. We are spelling out the future direction of education which will ensure that all our children are cherished equally. The Proclamation puts an onus on us all to do it, not only with funding but with psychological enticements responding to the expectations of pupils.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13, 14, 17, 19, 28, 35, 36, 41, 44, 48, 50, 54, 56, 63, 66, 68 and 71 together.</P>
      <P>Essentially, teachers will receive two days in-service in the present school year in whichever subjects of the leaving certificate phase 1 syllabus they are involved. There are six subjects involved in phase 1 &mdash; Irish, Accounting, French, German, Spanish and Italian. The in-service will be delivered throughout the country commencing on 15 May. The plans for in-service courses to prepare teachers for the new leaving certificate syllabus (phase 1) were notified to all second level schools on 10 February last. They were also the subject of a question from Deputy Martin answered on 29 March last.</P>
      <P>The two-day sessions for the six subjects will be spread out over three sets of dates, namely, 15-16 May, 22-23 May and 29-30 May. The in-service delivery arrangements are being organised in this way so as to minimise disruption to schools at this critical period in the school year, prior to examinations.</P>
      <P>All practical aspects of introducing the new leaving certificate phase 1 syllabus, including the provision of the necessary in-career programme, were considered by a special implementation group which I set up for this purpose in 1994. The group included representatives from the partners in education &mdash; the Joint Managerial Body, the Irish Vocational Education Association, the Association of Comprehensive and Community Schools, the Association of Secondary Teachers Ireland, the Teachers' Union of Ireland and the National Parents Council (Post-primary).</P>
      <P>All relevant issues, including the context of the examinations &mdash; oral, aural, practical and written &mdash; were considered by the group. The report of the group recommended that the in-career programme should take place in the last term of the 1994-95 school year and the first term of the 1995-96 school year.</P>
      <P>The arrangements put in place are in accordance with the group's recommendations.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister not agree that the month of May, in advance of the junior and leaving certificate examations, is the worst time in the year to have such a comprehensive programme of in-service training for teachers, given the disruption it will obviously cause in the classroom? There will be a loss of teaching hours and this will lead to major headaches for school managers and, in particular, school principals and they have contacted me about it. The fact that in the month of May we are organising a series of in-service courses is a reflection of the lack of an overall strategy in the Department of Education for in-service training generally. Given all the talk we have had in recent weeks about the integrity of the school year, is this not absurd?</P>

    <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch" hpid="Kathleen Lynch Kathleen Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Kathleen Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate Deputy O'Donnell allowing me some of her time. I congratulate the Minister for Justice, Deputy Owen, for swiftly publishing this Bill, which will bring us into line with internationally accepted human rights practices and will enable us to ratify the 1983 Council of Europe Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons and the 1987 EU agreement on the convention's application. This will be particularly welcomed by prisoners' families who, if prisoners are transferred, will no longer be forced to undertake long journeys at considerable cost and hardship to visit them. It will be extremely encouraging for the family of a prisoner that he or she is nearer <Col N="598" /> home and it will make things much easier for them.</P>
      <P>Whereas the general provisions of the Bill are straightforward, I wish to query section 5 (5) which provides in certain cases for the sentence imposed by the sentencing state to be adapted to Irish law. Sentencing policy varies widely from state to state. I concede that sentences in some other jurisdictions would be considered unjustifiably harsh in Ireland but the reverse is also true. Sentences imposed in Ireland for some types of offences, particularly sexual offences, are often unduly lenient. I note that subsection (5) is qualified by subsection (6) which states:</P>
      <P>Where a sentence is adapted under subsection (5) it shall, as far as practicable, correspond in nature to the sentence imposed by the sentencing state and shall not, in any event, either&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) aggravate it by its legal nature or duration, or</P>
      <P>(b) exceed the maximum penalty prescribed by the law of the State for a similar offence.</P>
      <P>In other words we cannot adjust the sentence upwards. I welcome these qualifications but the section must be clarified. Does it mean that a prisoner who received a ten year sentence and is subsequently transferred back to Ireland can apply to the Irish courts for a reduction of sentence on the basis that if he had committed a similar crime in Ireland he would have received a lesser sentence? I am uneasy about this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am concerned about section 5. A lengthy custodial sentence imposed for sexual assault could be reduced in this State. We need only look at the reduction in sentence in the X case to see the implications of such a policy. The Minister should reassure us on this point. Section 6 (b) provides that the Minister may authorise any person to take a sentenced person to or from any place under the warrant and to keep the <Col N="599" /> person in custody under the warrant. Section 6 (c) further states that the authorised person shall have all the powers, authority, protection and privileges of a member of the Garda Síochána. Anyone in custody is at the mercy of the person having custody and they should be carefully selected in order to avoid abuses. Any person authorised pursuant to section 6 (b) should be a member of the Garda Síochána or the prison service.</P>

      <P>At a time of spiralling crime, prisoners' rights are a distinctively unpopular topic yet those held by the State are its responsibility. It is one which we have not always taken seriously in the past. I urge the Minister to look beyond the legislation being debated and to update the often antiquated legislation governing the prison service to place prisons within modern statutory framework. Such legislation should incorporate prison rules, a code of conduct for prison staff and establish legally enforceable conditions. Not only would this protect prisoners, it would give the protection of the law and a proper framework to those who work in prisons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Justice should not have sole authority for prisons. They should be placed under the aegis of an independent prison board which would monitor the implementation of relevant legislation and to which prisoners and prison staff would have recourse in cases of complaint. The Government programme is committed to examining the establishment of a prison board and parole board to ensure that prisoners are discharged from prisons in an orderly fashion rather than in the <i>ad hoc</i> manner they are today. Sometimes prisoners, having served extremely long sentences, get little time to adjust to society and find it extremely difficult to integrate as a worthwhile member. It is not that they do not want to do so but <Col N="600" /> that the world has changed so much since they went into prison. They need special treatment and this should be taken on board. I hope the Minister will move swiftly to honour these commitments and ensure that all legislation governing the prison service is transparent.</P>
    <P>When this Bill was first announced many commentators saw it solely in the context of the peace process and there is no doubt that it is an important step towards consolidating that process. However, I place the Bill in a wider context. It should be viewed as one part of a body of legislation which is necessary to bring Ireland into line with internationally accepted human rights practices. In 1993 Ireland was roundly condemned in a UN human rights report which noted, among other things, the absence of refugee legislation, equal status legislation which would give legal recourse to minorities such as travellers and our over-reliance on censorship. We have made some progress and this legislation consolidates that.</P>
    <P>We celebrate the 50th anniversary of the ending of World War II this month. That war was marked by a flood of refugees from the tyrannies of various nations, many of whom unsuccessfully sought refuge in Ireland. Since then there have been millions more refugees but rather than having a transparent, accountable, legislative framework we continue to operate an arbitrary refugee policy based on a loose arrangement with the UNHCR.</P>
    <P>Last year the Minister for Justice, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, published what Democratic Left considered a deeply flawed Bill, one which conformed to the lowest rather than the highest human rights common denominator. Following consultations with the relevant NGOs, my party tabled a number of amendments to the legislation to ensure it conformed to the highest possible standards. I urge the Minister to set an early date for the introduction of amending refugee legislation. Refugees are not the only people denied a place in our legislative framework. Last week <Col N="601" /> the British Government decided to extend race relations legislation to Northern Ireland, which I welcome. It is incumbent on this Government to bring forward the long overdue equal status legislation. It is unacceptable that travellers and other minorities should be protected in Northern Ireland but not in the Republic. Ethnic, religious and other minorities have little protection here. The Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred legislation introduced with such fanfare six years ago has proved to be a legislative paper tiger. Not one prosecution was taken under the legislation but who among us could argue that there has not been a case of incitement? Everyone could name them. They have been front page news yet there were no prosecutions.</P>
    <P>I am sure Deputies were as appalled as I was to hear over the weekend that a foreign teenager committed suicide because of the harassment he encountered on a daily basis. He felt he had nowhere to turn. The best legislation is only as good as its implementation or non-implementation as in the case of the Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Act.</P>
    <P>I urge the Government to establish an equality ombudsman. Legislation is of little use if people do not know about it and minorities are often excluded from the mainstream provisions of information. I envisage a system whereby those who feel their rights are infringed could contact the ombudsman and receive guidance in pursuing the matter further.</P>
    <P>The UN report also noted the prevalence of censorship. Since then we have abolished section 1 of the Broadcasting Act and I welcome that. It should have been removed long ago. If we cannot deal with ourselves we can deal with very little and confronting various elements of our political and violent past is necessary for us as a nation. Censorship is a reality in Irish life and I urge the Minister to review the Censorship of Publications Act.</P>
    <P>Democratic Left, Fine Gael and Labour are committed to bringing Ireland <Col N="602" /> into line with international human rights standards. Matters have been put on the long finger and I look forward to the introduction of future legislation which will expand the liberties of all who live in this State. It would appear we will have to deal with and take responsibility for people who may never have lived as adults in Ireland. This legislation will have implications for prisoners who are about to be transferred. We will have to examine how we deal with these people, how they will fit into society following their sentences, whether they have psychiatric illness and whether their crimes were committed because of various illnesses, their state of health, how we govern our prisons and the attitude of other prisoners towards them. The implications of the legislation are many.</P>
    <P>While I welcome the Bill, which is long overdue, we need to look at the wider arena. I know the Minister for Justice will be as sympathetic as I am to these problems.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv" hpid="Éamon Ó Cuív Éamon Ó Cuív">
      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on introducing this Bill. I had hoped for a long time that this Bill would be introduced, ratifying a convention signed in 1987. It is a pity it has taken so long to get this far.</P>
      <P>When we talk about prisoners we have to examine the reason we put people in prison and seek to find out whom we are trying to punish. People should not be put in prison for revenge &mdash; that should not have any part in the prison regime. Innocent families should not be victimised due to family members being imprisoned. I welcome this Bill as a humanitarian step in the right direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of years ago I lobbied strongly within my own party for the ratification of this convention and urged that a Bill such as this should be brought forward. I do not see this in the context of the recent troubles in our country but in the wider humanitarian context of ordinary prisoners being imprisoned throughout the world. I would hope that the problem of prisoners connected with the political troubles would not be <Col N="603" /> ongoing. I see this as a Bill for the future mainly related to ordinary prisoners.</P>
    <P>I have pointed out frequently when talking about this Bill that if a person was convicted of a crime in, for example, some state in the Mediterranean the sentence there would be much greater than if one was imprisoned at home for the same offence. The person would have to endure a different climate, different food, different culture, different language as well as fewer visits from relatives. In this context the Bill is important.</P>
    <P>Recently I visited some prisoners in Britain, including some imprisoned for offences connected with the northern troubles. I visited also a person from my own constituency who is in prison for an ordinary criminal offence. The costs and the difficulties involved in visiting relatives in prison in Britain, our nearest neighbour, are horrendous. By their nature, prisons tend to be built in out of the way places which are inaccessible. Because we live on an island, it is almost impossible for people from this jurisdiction to visit relatives in prison abroad. For that reason this Bill should have been introduced before now. It is more important in an Irish context than if we were talking about prisoners in Holland and Belgium where one could travel across the borders. Bringing this Bill before the House is a progressive humanitarian step. It cannot be stressed sufficiently that this Bill relates to all prisoners, to any person incarcerated and convicted in another jurisdiction so long as that jurisdiction is a signatory to the convention. I hope the number of signatories to the convention will increase over time.</P>
    <P>When lobbying for the Bill to be brought forward I was told the cost would be horrendous and that there are 1,000 Irish people in prisons abroad. I argued at the time &mdash; I think I will be proven right &mdash; that the vast bulk of those people are domiciled permanently in the country in which they are in prison, for example, in Britain or America, <Col N="604" /> where they have family members and will not be applying for transfers to Ireland. I am confident that the number of people seeking transfers, in global terms, will not be great and that it will be well within our ability to handle the financial ramifications of transfers. That does not reduce the importance if the numbers are small but it means that the Bill is more workable than people thought when the debate was going on in other fora. The biggest argument against it was cost. I recall suggesting that if the demand was for 1,000 or 500 transfers and we did not have sufficient prison places we could deal with that problem by means of a quota and facilitate, say, the first 20 or 30. My understanding is that that will not be necessary. I cannot help thinking that perhaps this could have been done sooner but mar a deirtear i nGaeilge, is fearr deireanach ná go bráth.</P>
    <P>The other issue that arises is that we will have to find a certain number of places for the people who have been convicted. We have to look at the prison system in its wider context. In the modern world there must be ways of dealing with some of the minor offences such as non-payment of debts and fines, for which people are imprisoned. We must find some system of dealing with these people and ensure they face the full rigours of the law short of putting them in prison. More imaginative solutions than imprisonment could be found for dealing with their problems. I am amazed that the only means of dealing with the non-payment of a fine is a committal order. In these days of attachment orders on social welfare and wages etc. it should be possible to force people to pay their fine if they did not do so in the ordinary way, short of putting them to prison. It might be a cheaper and more effective way of ensuring that they complied with the law. A prison sentence is no solution to that type of non-compliance with the law. Some people, when imprisoned become hardened criminals because of the criminal environment. If prison spaces were freed up in that way we would be able to deal <Col N="605" /> with whatever number of people have to be transferred under this arrangement without the necessity to provide a huge number of extra prison places.</P>
    <P>In connection with those who are imprisoned for offences connected with the troubles, I would hope the kind of policy being followed by the Minister, which had been initiated by the previous Government, will be followed by the British Government.</P>
    <P>Violence is wrong, and certainly the maiming and killing of people is wrong. However, circumstances pertained in the North that led to violence. We must set our face, as we did in this part of the country, to finding a permanent solution to the problems while recognising the historical reasons for the difficulties. One of the best ways to ensure that peace is a permanent feature both on this island and on our neighbouring island is to be magnanimous, deal with the problems and not seek vengeance.</P>
    <P>The question of prisoners is an emotive one, particularly in the context of Anglo-Irish relations. I hope the passing of this Bill will give the British Government the courage at least to apply the Ferrers report which recommended, within the British criminal code, that prisoners should be held in prisons nearest to the areas from which they come. That would mean automatic transfer to Northern Ireland for many prisoners held in Britain on terrorist offences. I hope the passing of this Bill will act as a spur to the British authorities to do for Northern prisoners what it is possible to do in the case of prisoners from the South, that is to transfer back to the North those prisoners who come from there.</P>
    <P>It comes across forcefully to me that the regime imposed on prisoners has become a conviction for the families, who are saying that despite having peace for the last eight months and seeing things happen that many people thought would never happen they have not seen a peace dividend. The prisoners say they themselves can live with the situation but it is hard to live with no peace dividend for their families. They <Col N="606" /> cannot understand why the families of prisoners have not seen some peace dividend. It has been argued, but such argument is self-defeating, that it is not fair to the victims if the situation of prisoners is eased in any way. However, the families are not guilty of any crime. Not alone but many prisoners are relatives of victims and the communities from which the greatest number of prisoners come are the communities which have the greatest number of victims. In many instances there is no clear separation between victims and convicted people because they have tended to feed in a tit for tat way on each other. This was brought home to me clearly when one prisoner mentioned to me that his father had been killed in the troubles. In that context it is easy to understand the close relationship between victims and convicted persons in the North that is peculiar to the troubles. It is a vicious circle that we must break out of. I hope this Bill will encourage the British Government to break out of the present impasse and take a more magnanimous view.</P>
    <P>It is also significant that prisoners and leaders of the Loyalist community have been in favour of a liberal attitude on this issue. It is not a cause of conflict between nationalists and loyalists in the North. Mar a dúirt mé, is lá iontach domsa go pearsanta an Bille seo a fheiceáil os comhair an Tí seo.

I do not understand the collective amnesia that seems to have affected Fianna Fáil. No sooner had they left the Government benches than they were shouting for Bills and criticising delays. I am sure it must have been trying for them when their Ministers did nothing about important Bills which they as backbenchers were so anxious to produce. However, they are lucky that we now have a good Minister who is producing the goods.</P>

    <P>Deputy O'Donnell, on behalf of the Progressive Democrats, went overboard by insinuating that the Minister was a Provo sympathiser and would not admit that the Bill was aimed at the release <Col N="608" /> of IRA prisoners and that Gerry Adams had a major role in it. I hate to quote lest I offend listerners but this was a case where the Deputy was willing to wound yet afraid to strike. She made several attempts to cast aspersions on a very good Minister, which is certainly not the standard one would expect from a Progressive Democrat. It is neither progressive nor democratic to suggest in regard to a Bill that has been lying around since 1985, even when the Progressive Democrats were themselves in power and did nothing about it, that the Minister has ulterior motives in introducing it. If this Bill helps the continuation of peace and furthers discussions, that is good. Prisoners are prisoners, and if this convention does not mention victims, we cannot blame the Minister.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill because it is important that prisoners are regarded as human. We may be prejudiced and feel that some of them deserve the harshest treatment. However, in our calmer moments we must always realise that they are human beings and, above all, that they have families. While we must always have sympathy for the families of their victims they should not be dumped in prison and left there. Many of those in foreign prisons encounter language difficulties or animosity, especially in England where actions were taken in our name. It should always be borne in mind that when in prison they are deprived of their freedom. This is sufficient punishment. They should be given every opportunity to improve themselves, not simply left to rot. There should also be modern facilities available. Each prisoner should have his own cell with modern toilet facilities.</P>
    <P>I had an opportunity last summer to visit a number of prisons in the United States where I was flabbergasted by some of the work being done. One prison near Washington reminded me of a modern German factory where prisoners were busily occupied in the production of uniforms and furniture which was used by the State Department. They <Col N="609" /> were highly trained and skilled and took no notice of visitors. For good behaviour they were promoted and moved to different production lines. The ultimate was to be moved to the printing section which had a special status.</P>
    <P>I was also impressed by the fact that prisoners received instruction in bricklaying. All kinds of archways and doorways were constructed with a product similar to plaster. There were knocked down on completion and certification. They were paid a nominal sum of £10 per week. It is important that we have a modern prison system. There is no point in transferring prisoners who can avail of such facilities back to Ireland when all they would be able to do is sleep in their cells.</P>
    <P>Another prison catered for drug addicts and those who had been imprisoned for selling drugs. Unlike here where drug addicts can end up worse off and where prisoners who have never taken drugs may end up using them, the prison authorities have been able to prevent drugs being smuggled in. We were guaranteed that there was no physical contact. While there was always the possibility that a prison officer might help a prisoner to obtain drugs it seemed that there was no way they could be smuggled in. Prisoners spoke to their families on the opposite side of a glass partition by way of a telephone system and were not allowed to have physical contact. If drugs are being smuggled into prisons here perhaps we should reconsider our approach.</P>
    <P>We also attended a group therapy session. When we asked some of the prisoners involved if they were attending because they had nothing else to do they assured us that the intended to go straight although they were aware they might find themselves in a situation where they would be tempted to use drugs again. At least they were receiving encouragement and the advice of counsellors. We should think about adopting a similar approach here.</P>
    <P>It may be argued that we should not do anything to help many of those who <Col N="610" /> have fallen by the wayside but we must adopt a humane approach to see to it that they are given a chance in life. Many come from deprived backgrounds, in terms of a lack of education and home circumstances. Deputy Ó Cuív mentioned a prisoner in England whose father was killed during the troubles. It should be borne in mind that because of their background people often do things that they would never dream of doing if their circumstances were better. We should ensure that if prisoners are allowed to return they will be able to avail of better facilities. I am not saying that they should live in the lap of luxury; it is often claimed that prisoners live better lives but a balance has to be struck in terms of reasonable facilities such as sanitation.</P>
    <P>The fact that many prisoners reoffend means they learn nothing positive while in prison. This presents a difficulty. I do not know why it costs so much to keep someone in prison &mdash; a figure of £37,000 has been mentioned. What is the reason for this? Should extra staff be employed rather than allow prison officers work overtime? We were given figures which showed that some prison officers were earning colossal sums in overtime.</P>
    <P>The Minister has done a good job. She is giving prisoners the option to return here if the state concerned accept their request. It has been argued that we will be flooded but I do not think every prisoner abroad will want to return, because of embarrassment or shame. The Minister should therefore be able to control the flow. I repeat that I would not like to see them return if they will not be able to avail of modern facilities and if they will receive little help in overcoming their drug addiction and end up worse off.</P>

      <P>On my own behalf and that of my party I warmly welcome this legislation in so far as it goes, although this may not be as far as some people would have us believe or might like to think. Deputy O'Donoghue was correct when he said that we were ready to introduce this legislation on leaving office. I was Minister of State at the Department of Justice at the time. A newsletter dated 15 January 1995, published by the Irish Commission for Prisoners Overseas, an organisation set up specifically to deal with this problem, refers to a draft Bill produced by lawyers employed by the commission for the information of the Minister for Justice, Deputy Owen, and given to her at a meeting to which they advert in the newsletter. The co-ordinator of the group, Nuala Kelly, is quoted as saying about this Bill, which is similar in many respects to the Government legislation:</P>
      <P>This is primarily a humanitarian issue. The principal beneficiaries of ratification will be the families of prisoners, those who suffer most.</P>
      <P>I agree with that statement. The newsletter records the presentation of the draft Bill to the Minister stating: &ldquo;She accepted it and promised to make it a matter of the utmost priority, and welcomed our draft as a model to draw upon&rdquo;. That document was published three and a half months ago and I am mystified as to why this matter, which the Minister promised to consider as top priority, is only introduced now. Nevertheless, it is better late than never. I welcome this measure which is being introduced for humanitarian reasons. It is also intended as a measure that will help to consolidate the peace process which we all welcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill enables Ireland to comply with its international obligations by ratifying the European Convention on returning prisoners to their place of origin. Deputy O'Donnell said today that some people in the United Kingdom may be reluctant to implement this Bill because of their sufferings in the violence of the past 25 years. However, <Col N="612" /> Britain is not the only country that has suffered from the violence of the past 25 years; we have also suffered. I have many friends in the United Kingdom and am aware of their attitude to legislation such as this. They regard it as a very small price for the absence of carnage, violence and fear from the streets of the major cities in Britain. The legislation will be warmly welcomed throughout Britain.</P>
    <P>This Bill will benefit a number of my constituents, whose families have made representations to me for some years, two of whom are incarcerated in the United Kingdom and one of whom is serving a very long sentence in Greece for a rather trivial offence. The conditions in that prison are appalling and that prisoner's family finds it impossible to visit him. The families of the two people incarcerated in the United Kingdom also find it very difficult to visit them because they are elderly and living on social welfare. I hope when this legislation goes through, these prisoners will be able to apply for a transfer to Ireland and their applications will be sympathetically considered.</P>
    <P>When introducing legislation the least we expect is to know the extent of the problem we are dealing with and the number of people who will be affected by it. The Minister has been very remiss in giving information. Some newspaper reports suggest there are 1,200 or 1,300 Irish people incarcerated abroad. One newspaper report suggested there are 650 Irish people incarcerated in the United Kingdom alone. The figure quoted by the Minister this morning was about 600 in total, with no separate figure for the number incarcerated in prisons in the United Kingdom. The Department of Justice, in a statement referred to in this morning's newspapers, quoted a figure of 600. A representative purporting to speak for the Department of Justice some time ago referred to a figure of 650 or 700 &mdash; I cannot recall the figure. Surely we should have clear information on the extent of the problem and the number <Col N="613" /> of people likely to apply under the legislation.</P>
    <P>The Minister said in her speech: &ldquo;It is worth noting that at one stage the Irish Commission for Prisoners Overseas estimated that the number of prisoners seeking a transfer to here would be about 40 and would level off at less than ten a year subsequently&rdquo;. That statement is extraordinary. We are bringing in legislation to deal with this issue and the only clue we have as to the extent of the problem and the number of people who will be affected is a statement by the Minister referring to research, or perhaps the opinion of a voluntary organisation that has no connection with the Department of Justice. That statement refers to the organisation's conclusions at one stage, but even if its conclusions were correct then, and we have no way of knowing they were, they may not necessarily be correct now. There is no logical basis for such a statement. We do not have a clue what we are dealing with here. Apparently the Department of Justice, the Department of Foreign Affairs and people in authority have not even pretended to attempt to ascertain the extent of the problem and the number of people involved. All we have is a bland statement from the Minister that at one stage a voluntary organisation estimated that the number would be about 40.</P>
    <P>My colleague, Deputy Ó Cuív agrees that the number involved will be small and insignificant, and he may be right, but we have no way of knowing. Perhaps several hundred prisoners will apply to be transferred here under this legislation. Assuming the figure at the upper end of the scale is correct and that there are 1,200 Irish people incarcerated abroad, if 150 of those successfully apply for transfer here, that would take up the entire capacity of the new prison being built in Castlerea.</P>
    <P>The Minister has claimed this is a humanitarian measure. I am prepared to take her at her word and to believe it is being introduced primarily for humanitarian reasons and in fulfilment <Col N="614" /> of our international obligations, bearing in mind the need to consolidate the peace process, but she said in her speech: &ldquo;if an inordinate number of applications were to be received it will always be the case that the Minister for Justice can withhold consent to transfers&rdquo;. That seems to give the lie to her statement that this measure is primarily humanitarian. Is she saying our hearts go out to the unfortunate people who are incarcerated abroad and that they should be near their families, but if the number applying for transfer is such as to put pressure on our prison system, humanitarianism will go out the window? Our approach to this measure is either humanitarian or it is not; there is no middle ground.</P>
    <P>It would be extremely cynical of me to think the Government is not serious in talking about humanitarianism. I would hate to think the legislation before us, much as I welcome it, is a mere device to fulfil the letter of a promise made, with no intention to implement the spirit of that promise. If that is the case, and I am prepared for the moment to be convinced otherwise, this legislation would be the most cruel and reprehensible deception ever perpetrated by an Irish Government.</P>
    <P>If the Government is genuine about this measure, the legislation must be put in context, and I find it very difficult to do that because it was announced in a vacuum along with other measures that will have similar effect. Other measures in this area include legislation to change the law on bail, which will involve more people occupying prison places while on remand, legislation to crack down on fraudsters and white collar criminals and to declare war on drug barons. All those measures will increase detection, the number of prosecutions and the numbers coming into our prison system. Those measures are being announced without details of any commensurate funding or provisions to deal with the consequence, which will inevitably flow from them. That is my criticism of this type of approach.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="615" /> Every year the courts sentence approximately 4,500 offenders to serve terms of imprisonment. Another 3,000 to 4,000 are annually held in prison on remand either awaiting trial of sentence. Added to those figures are those in prison who are ridiculously being held for defaulting on fines and not paying their civil debts. The total number incarcerated annually averages 8,000 to 8,500. There are approximately 2,350 people in prison at any one time, despite the fact that approximately 8,500 pass through the system each year. Most of our prisoners are young and approximately 75 per cent are under 30 years of age. Approximately 75 per cent are in prison for offences not involving violence. A total of 31 per cent of prisoners, approximately 720 to 750, are juveniles and one in six of those is under the age of 14. Despite that and in the context of the measures being announced by the Government, the prison system is horrifically overcrowded. That gives rise to two problems. It gives rise to problems in the system and huge social problems arising from the consequences of our system of early releases.</P>
    <P>Overcrowding in our prisons was the subject of severe censure by the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment which inspected prisons here last year and produced a report that is nothing short of a damning indictment of the Irish penal system. In addition to that, there is growing public frustration at the failure of the prison system to hold enough prisoners in custody for a sufficient part of their sentences at a time when crime is increasing in volume and viciousness. Even with the present number of inmates the prison system is in danger of becoming unmanageable. Overcrowding is placing the most intolerable strains on infrastructural services. Far too much effort and time, both at prison management level and in the Department of Justice, is being wasted and there is manipulation of the prison <Col N="616" /> population to keep numbers at approximately 2,350, the number with which the system can cope.</P>
    <P>The Whitaker committee pointed out that the prison population could be reduced by remitting one-third rather than one-quarter of sentences. In the context of what is happening at present that would be a facile suggestion. If such an approach were adopted and accompanied by a policy which required prisoners to serve two-thirds of their sentences, ironically many people would serve longer sentences than they serve at present. The prison system is so reliant on the early release of prisoners to create space that many would have to stay in prison longer if such a policy were introduced.</P>
    <P>Dr. Paul O'Mahony, the psychologist to whom we are indebted for the breadth and depth of his research into the prison system, put the case well in a recent article in the <i>Irish Journal of Psychology.</i> He said that at present about 600 people are serving their sentence of imprisonment while at liberty. I referred already to the effect of early releases; their effect on Garda moral must be devastating. I am aware of many cases in my constituency where gardaí painstakingly pursued a case from beginning to end and ultimately secured a conviction, often against the odds, only to see the criminal walk away.</P>
    <P>We have to make a decision on the system we will adopt regarding penal policy. If we are to go down the road of putting the primary focus on incarceration, deterrents and punishment, it will require hard decisions in terms of allocating resources and providing extra prison spaces. If we are to go down the other road, the Whitaker road, of structured early releases and community-based alternatives to imprisonment, it will require massive investment in the probation and welfare service. We, as a country, must make that decision. If we totter along as we are, confidence in the prison system, which is already at an all time low, will be dangerously reduced. If we introduce the measures <Col N="617" /> announced, the prison system will have a bigger turnover than Dunnes Stores. That is the reality of the position. If we continue along that road without making clear decisions on the allocation of resources to back up those decisions, the consequences for our tottering, creaking penal system will be unthinkable.</P>

      <P>This Bill could be seen as a social and humanitarian one, but it begs certain questions. We are all aware of the trauma experienced by prisoners abroad. As it is expensive to travel abroad, many prisoners have had a visit from their parents since being imprisoned. There was a sense of desolation and total separation and the introduction of the Bill, even at this late stage, is welcomed. It was part of an agreement with Sinn Féin made while the previous Government was in office. The Bill was ready prior to Christmas 1994 and that begs the question why it was not introduced immediately, given that it was part of an agreement and tied into the peace process. It has led to questions being asked as to why the Government was so stubborn, obdurate and insensitive on an issue critical to the peace process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Dea mentioned the question of the numbers of people transferring, a vital consideration. If we accept that the Bill is a humanitarian one, how can a Minister introduce it without having put a financial package together to ensure that we have room to accommodate the number of sentenced persons who wished to transfer from abroad? Deputy O'Dea referred to the most unseemly part of the Minister's speech, that if we cannot accommodate those persons, the Minister has permission to refuse a transfer. The prisoners involved have had to wait for many years for the introduction of this Bill and were led to believe in recent times that the opportunity to transfer would be available to them. Now the Bill is being introduced and the Minister has more or less admitted in her speech that she has not obtained any additional resources to <Col N="618" /> free up our prison system, which is already tottering in terms of the numbers detained. Those prisoners have been held over for the years without the possibility of transfer and now that the Bill is being introduced the Minister is slapping them in the face by saying she will reserve the right to refuse a transfer. Surely any Minister introducing this Bill would have ascertained details of the numbers likely to seek transfer and the existing imbalance between the numbers seeking transfer to and from here and made provision in the budget for the introduction of this Bill. I fear that many of those prisoners and their families who are already asking what is in the peace process for them will feel totally let down if refused a right of transfer by the Minister when the Bill is enacted. That could have major implications.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister outline who will cover the cost of the transfer of prisoners and what determination will be agreed on the remission of sentences? Since one-third of the sentence is applicable in the United Kingdom and one-quarter here, is it not fair and proper that prisoners transferred from one jurisdiction to another &mdash; who had certain rights within the first jurisdiction &mdash; have them honoured here, or in the second jurisdiction?</P>
    <P>What additional provisions will be made within our prison service for the total reintegration of prisoners coming here from abroad, an important aspect that will have to be catered for?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill and compliment the Minister on its introduction, within four months of assuming office, to ratify the Council of Europe Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons, 1983, which had been agreed by the preceding Government. Many of its provisions had already been drafted within its term of office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the constructive comments of Deputies O'Keeffe and O'Dea, on our prison system. It may well be an opportune time to examine our prisons <Col N="619" /> system, overall, the recommendations of the Whitaker report, the operations of our prison service, its reform, and ascertain where we are going. Undoubtedly certain aspects will have to be examined, in particular the last matter referred to by Deputy Batt O'Keeffe &mdash; the fact that there is a one-third remission in the United Kingdom and one-quarter here, meriting considerable examination.</P>
    <P>This Bill has broad party support, has been in the offing for a considerable number of years and was a specific commitment enunciated in the programme <i>A Government of Renewal.</i> I pay tribute to the various organisations instrumental in having mounted a forceful campaign over many years to have this convention ratified by this country. I pay a particular tribute to the Irish Commission for Prisoners Overseas, the bishop's commission, very much to the fore in that regard, in addition to NIACRO in Northern Ireland, the CAJ and NAPO, all of whom co-operated in the campaign and in the formulation of a draft Bill presented to the Minister for Justice this spring containing admirable provisions on the transfer of prisoners.</P>
    <P>I am delighted that all that hard work done in a studious, rational and methodical fashion &mdash; involving the compilation of statistics, with interviews with individual prisoners in foreign counties, thus building up a profile of Irish prisoners abroad presented to the Irish people and successive Governments and Ministers for Justice, particularly by the Irish Commission for Prisoners Overseas &mdash; is bearing fruit. I compliment those organisations and the Irish Council for Civil Liberties and Amnesty International, also to the fore in this regard.</P>
    <P>Despite having signed the convention in 1986, successive Governments were reluctant to ratify it, as it meant having to face up to the implications of the transference of prisoners. We have never been given a full account of the reason it has taken until now to ratify that convention. The Minister was not <Col N="620" /> very clear on the matter in her remarks this morning. It appeared that successive Governments were fearful of the numbers of prisoners abroad who, on transference here, would result in our already overcrowded prisons being crammed even more, as a considerable number were held in prisons in Britain over many years. Presumably, it was the view of our Department of Justice that those large numbers, if transferred here, could totally overwhelm our prisons, there is very little space available within out prisons system, with the exception of Portlaoise, to accommodate additional prisoners. Presumably also, the Department of Justice would have taken the view that it would largely involve one-way traffic, as there are more Irish prisoners serving sentences abroad than at home. In addition, while the troubles in Northern Ireland continued, there was considerable reluctance on the part of our Department of Justice to facilitate the transfer of people sentenced for very serious offences of a political nature. There was also concern expressed in this House, particularly by the Progressive Democrats, that, in enabling the transfer of prisoners, we were facilitating the return of criminals here to a less severe regime, a most unfair interpretation of the intention behind ratification of this convention.</P>
    <P>The vexed question of numbers is central to the overall issue. Deputy O'Dea referred in strong terms to the confusion, as he saw it, within official circles of the precise numbers of prisoners held abroad, the numbers stated by the Irish Commission for Prisoners Overseas is approximately 1,000 whereas the number stated by the Minister was 600. However, the Minister was referring to 600 prisoners who would be eligible to seek transference under the provisions of this Bill, which apply to those prisoners who have to serve at least a further six months of their sentence, and does not apply to those who have not already been sentenced.</P>
    <P>There are approximately 180 foreign or non-national prisoners here who are <Col N="621" /> entitled to seek transference to other jurisdictions, who would be unlikely to have strong roots here, unlike the proportionately larger numbers of Irish prisoners serving sentences abroad, particularly in Britain, and who would be anxious to return here to serve or complete their sentences. Therefore, the imbalance between the two categories may not be as great as thought. The Irish Commission for Prisoners Overseas, who keep a constant eye on these statistics, maintain that approximately 40 such prisoners would seek transference, eventually reducing to perhaps ten or 12 annually.</P>
    <P>That is the profile of the problem and puts in perspective the reluctance of past Governments to deal with the issue. The Government, having examined the matter as well as developments on the other part of our island, introduced legislation dealing with the transfer of sentenced persons, something we were obliged to introduce. We were obliged to fulfil our European and international commitments in this regard much sooner. The legislation is not being introduced for the benefit of prisoners, but for the benefit of their families. It is humanitarian in nature, but will not facilitate an easy life for prisoners. It will facilitate easier access by families to prisoners.</P>
    <P>Travel to another jurisdiction from this country is expensive. When visiting prisoners in other jurisdictions members of their families must make a train, boat or aeroplane journey and frequently endure considerble hardship and additional travel on reaching the other jurisdiction. In some cases, they are faced with language difficulties. Also, on arriving at the prison in question family members frequently discover that the prisoner whom they have come to visit has been moved to another prison, a process known as &ldquo;ghosting&rdquo;. Prisoners are frequently moved at very short notice and, in some cases, without prior notice being given to their families. It is logical that prisoners should serve their sentences in prisons close to their homes and families. Otherwise, we <Col N="622" /> are punishing innocent people, such as prisoners' families and friends. From that point of view, there could be no argument against the principle of the transfer of sentenced persons.</P>
    <P>The peace process is another important dimension of this legislation and, to a certain extent, has facilitated its introduction. It was the intention of the previous Government to introduce a Bill that would allow the transfer of prisoners sentenced in other jurisdictions for politically motivated offences, thus giving momentum to the peace process. I have no doubt that is the case. I have received a number of letters from prisoners sentenced in the United States, Great Britain and elsewhere on the Continent for offences relating to the troubles in Northern Ireland. Now that there is a cessation of violence in Northern Ireland and a peace process in operation, the transfer of such prisoners should be considered. Some of their colleagues have been released here. A means of giving momentum to the peace process would be to provide a mechanism whereby prisoners can be transferred to this jurisdiction, and this legislation provides for that.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to a matter that has occupied a great deal of Opposition time, namely, the state of our prisons. Now that we are contemplating the transfer to this jurisdiction of prisoners from abroad, we should examine the operation of our prison system, which we have been slow to reform. Dr. T.K. Whitaker's report in 1985 proposed radical changes in the structure, management and operation of our prison system, but very few of his recommendations have been implemented. Our prisons are grossly overcrowded and at times operate on a revolving door principle. There are no prison places for many offenders sentenced by the courts and the Governor of Mountjoy Prison has no choice but to find places by releasing prisoners before their term has expired or the remission to which they are entitled is due. That is very unsatisfactory. <Col N="623" /> We have not explored the range of alternatives to imprisonment. People are being imprisoned for non-payment of debts, not a suitable function of the prison system. We operate on the basis of a standard remission of one-quarter of a sentence whereas on the other part of this island the standard remission is 50 per cent or one-third of the sentence and in Great Britain it is one-third for all prisoners. If we increased the remission rate from one-quarter to one-third of a sentence, approximately 8 per cent, it would roughly constitute the amount by which our prison system is overcrowded. Our prisons could then operate on a manageable daily basis. The Minister should consider the remission rate, not only in the context of overall prison reform, but in the context of the transfer of prisoners from jurisdictions where they are entitled to remission at the rate of one-third of their sentence.</P>
    <P>Rahabilitation facilities must also be examined. In recent years the profile of our prison population has been made up mainly of prisoners who have committed drug related offences. Another category of prisoners which is increasing is that relating to sex offenders.</P>
    <P>I welcome the legislation. It will ease the burden on families of prisoners serving sentences abroad and bring us into line with best practice in Europe, particularly the European Union. It will, I hope, stimulate prison reform here. I heartily commend the legislation and, as there are some areas I would like amended, I welcome the fact that the Minister indicated she will consider amendments on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Mr. Flood Mr. Flood">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>
      <P>I warmly welcome the Bill. I first became interested in this issue many years ago when the family and friends of a former constituent of mine contacted me regarding the wish of a parisoner serving a sentence abroad to return here to serve the remainder of the sentence. It was from then on that I became interested in this issue. It was a source of disappointment to me that <Col N="624" /> under successive Governments &mdash; my own included &mdash; we were unable to make the sort of progress many of us thought should be made in bringing forward legislation of this kind.</P>
      <P>I can be satisfied in one regard in that before the Fianna Fáil Government left office we had a Bill ready and I am glad there has been no undue delay on the part of this Minister in bringing forward the Bill. Perhaps she has put her own stamp on it &mdash; I did not have access to the previous Government's proposals in this regard &mdash; but she has brought forward the legislation in a relatively short period of time and I welcome her initiative in that regard. I look forward to a worthwhile debate on the legislation, especially on Committee Stage when we will consider the legislation line by line.</P>
      <P>As public representatives many of us have been contacted either by individuals, members of families or organisations who would be affected by the enactment of this legislation, which enables the European convention to be ratified. Many people are aware of individual cases where legislation of this kind could help and might well have helped in the past.</P>
      <P>In the past month I was contacted by a female prisoner in an English prison who required permission to visit her very ill mother in an Irish hospital. She had applied, and people had applied on her behalf, to transfer out of the prison for one day in order to see her seriously ill mother who was in a Dublin hospital. Despite the intervention of myself and many others, including the Tánaiste and various organisations, I was greatly saddened that the English authorities found it impossible to allow that person visit her ill mother in hospital knowing full well that the medical records indicated that her mother was quite ill and was likely to die within a matter of days. Tragically, the mother died and the person in the English jail was not allowed even a one day visit to say good-bye.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are serious questions to ask about a penal system that operates on that basis. If such a system applied in <Col N="625" /> this country there would be serious criticisms of it. It was a source of great personal regret to me that this person was unable to see her mother before she passed away, regardless of the circumstances of the crime concerned. I raised the matter at a meeting of the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body, of which I am a member, but despite the intervention of no less a person than the Tánaiste, we were not successful. I hope that legislation of this kind might go some way in the future towards helping in circumstances such as those to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>In the past, one of the reasons there were considerable objections to bringing forward legislation of this kind to allow the ratification of the European Convention was the question of cost. I have seen reports from the Department of Justice which brought that question to the fore. This was always a difficult obstacle for many of us to overcome because we knew that our own prison system was overcrowded and that the transfer of additional prisoners to be accommodated in Irish prisons would further exacerbate that situation. It was difficult to overcome the objection on the grounds of economics.</P>
    <P>Further information that is beginning to emerge indicates that this legislation will not necessarily mean that the floodgates will be opened in so far as the return of prisoners to this country is concerned. The figure of 40 has been given, although there are obviously cases in the pipeline that have not yet been dealt with. Thereafter, the figure might be 10, 12 or 14. That may not be a precise figure but it is an indication of the type of situation we are likely to face. Consequently, I do not believe there is a great argument to be made concerning the unavailability of places.</P>
    <P>We know we have a job to do in regard to our penal system and dealing with offenders. The case has been made time and again that there are a substantial number of people currently in our prisons who would not be there if we had a more enlightened approach to <Col N="626" /> dealing with offenders. I am not suggesting we should be easy on offenders or that we should allow offenders to get off scot free but we must examine our penal system which sends people to jail for non-payment of civil debts.</P>
    <P>The other thorny issue involves the non payment of fines. I realise there is a public debate taking place at the moment on the question of ministerial intervention in the reduction or cancellation of fines. This is an area of which I have some experience because in my constituency I get a fair representation from people concerned about their inability to pay fines. These fines are usually associated with motor offences, either the non-availability of insurance or a vehicle that is not properly taxed.</P>
    <P>My understanding is that any citizen of the State is entitled to make an appeal to the Minister and I simply advise my constituents to write to the Minister for Justice of the day setting out their personal circumstances and any other information they wish to provide and the Minister will then decide on an appropriate response. It was clear to me that people who, for one reason or another, found themselves incurring fines and who were on quite low levels of social welfare had no possibility of paying such fines and were simply faced with the prospect of going to prison or finding some other way to mitigate the penalty. As we know, the fine must be paid in one lump sum but to ask a person on social welfare to pay a £500 or a £750 fine within three or six months is asking the impossible. These people end up in our jails but are released just as quickly because there is no room for them.</P>
    <P>That is an example of one category of person and we must ask whether it is reasonable to impose a fine for payment in that manner. If a fine has to be imposed, can it not be paid on a weekly basis either by direct deduction from social welfare payments or by some other system that would allow people to make remuneration and pay the penalty imposed by the courts? It must be done in a way with which such people can <Col N="627" /> cope because they are being penalised financially. This would be one way of dealing with the large number of people who are sent to our prisons but who are released just as quickly, causing a lot of disruption. There are several ways in which we can provide the additional accommodation that might be necessary arising from the passing of this legislation. I have suggested one way but I am sure there are many others also.</P>
    <P>We must accept that there are two categories of prisoners who want to transfer to this country. There is the category of prisoners in foreign jails who are associated with what have been described as &ldquo;the troubles&rdquo; in Northern Ireland. The outgoing Minister for Justice and the present Minister, in tackling this issue and the release of prisoners, have shown a great humanitarian approach which has been welcomed by all shades of opinion. I do not recall hearing any volume of objection to the early releases which are under way and it is unfortunate that the same does not apply on the neighbouring island because it would give a great impetus to the peace process.</P>
    <P>The other category involves prisoners who are not connected with the troubles in Northern Ireland. Many of these prisoners have family members living here who find it difficult to visit them. This has been a great bone of contention with many people. I have come across cases where people have travelled from this country to a jail, particularly in the United Kingdom, only to find that at the very last moment, the prisoner was transferred to another jail. Others have referred to that as the system of ghosting, an appalling practice.</P>
    <P>A penal administration that transfers a prisoner from one jail to another in the dead of night, knowing that the prisoner's relatives are coming to visit from overseas has serious flaws and must be criticised.</P>
    <P>It is important in terms of rehabilitation that prisoners maintain contact with their families, relatives and friends. We all hope that when a person leaves <Col N="628" /> prison he is rehabilitated and capable of taking his place in society. That can only happen if prisoners are treated humanely and are allowed continuing contact with relatives and friends. I am concerned that the practice to which I referred has happened more than once to the same family and we should speak out against it.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes to use the procedure of continuing to enforce the sentence which is considered by the Government to be in the best interests of the prisoner and as the more straightforward of the two procedures provided for in the convention. That is a fair and reasonable approach but the Irish Commission for Prisoners Overseas who have studied this issue carefully and made proposals have taken the view that the Bill should opt for the conversion of sentences and I understand this has been adopted by the Dutch Government. This precedent can be studied to see how effectively it works. I hope the Minister will be prepared to take on board amendments from this side of the House to strengthen the Bill and give expression to our views.</P>
    <P>Areas of weakness in the legislation need to be addressed, for example, the question of information. If a prisoner here applies for a transfer and is refused by the Minister for Justice, does he have the right to information about the grounds for refusal? We speak continuously about openness and transparency and people are increasingly entitled to information on the issues that affect them. As a consequence there is room for a procedure to set down in writing the reasons a person is refused a transfer. There should also be a right of appeal either to a court or some other body to have the case re-evaluated.</P>
    <P>We tend to be sensitive in dealing with minorities and we have yet a long way to go in accepting them. We run a two-streamed system when dealing with naturalisation. I have worked on behalf of people in my constituency seeking naturalisation. I hasten to add this had nothing to do with passports for sale. <Col N="629" /> They were probably living in local authority housing and were unable to return to their own country for a variety of reasons and therefore applied for naturalisation. Some applicants move relatively easily through the system but obstacles are put in front of other applicants. If I was asked to explain it I could come to the conclusion that it is because of race, religion or some fundamentalism to which they subscribe. Even though they seem to have fulfilled all the requirements they find it very difficult to be naturalised. There should be provision in the legislation to prohibit the Minister for Justice refusing a prisoner entry on grounds such as religion, sexual orientation or medical health. We know that AIDs is an emerging problem in our prisons and I imagine that when prisoners require substantial medical treatment, this could be a difficulty. A prisoner seeking a transfer should be provided with a written statement giving the reasons for a refusal.</P>
    <P>Where a prisoner from another country wishes to transfer to Ireland, the Government Minister of that country should not take all the initiative and a prisoner should have a right of direct appeal to the Irish Government if he feels his application is being treated tardily by another government. We need to tackle a number of issues and we can do so on Committee Stage only if the Minister is prepared to accept amendments that strengthen the Bill. I wish the Bill a speedy passage and look forward to the Committee Stage debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill has been a long time coming and lobby groups inside and outside this country have lobbied for its passage. I am glad my colleague, the Minister for Justice, is in a position to introduce it. It was almost ready during the final days of the previous administration and I heard one or two Fianna Fáil Members comment unfavourably on the fact that the Minister did not introduce it immediately she <Col N="630" /> took office. One must concede that the new Government is only in office for a few months and the Minister moved carefully with all due speed to bring forward the legislation at an appropriate time. Obviously, there will be no difficulty in putting the Bill through the House. I am sure the points made by a number of speakers and the positive questions put forward by Deputy Flood will be addressed by the Minister.</P>
      <P>We usually have a broad debate when we discuss matters appertaining to prisons or prisoners. This debate is not centred on sentencing policy, criminal law or the ever-increasing crime wave. While those matters are of concern to everyone, this debate is more confined and is on how to deal with and respond to the situation faced by a number of Irish prisoners in jails overseas and a not insignificant number of foreign prisoners who are in Irish jails.</P>
      <P>We are aware of the number of people demanding this legislation from correspondence and representations we have received from various groups at home and abroad. Sometimes the demand was made on political grounds but it was also based on humanitarian grounds. In particular, groups such as the Irish Commission for Prisoners Overseas presented the case to us in a fair and balanced light. Those of us who may have difficulties about the sensitive situation we may have to deal with when the Bill is passed will be convinced of the merits of the legislation by the very reasonable and reasoned arguments which such organisations put forward. Many of us are aware of problems faced by former constituents. Our politcal system is often criticised for bringing politicans too close to constituents but it makes politicians aware of problems faced by them. Many of us would be aware of friends or constituents who have been incarcerated in prisons overseas. This legislation is required to allow them to return home to serve out their sentence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="631" /> There is a strong humanitarian aspect to this legislation. Many Deputies spoke about such simple but important matters as visits by friends and relatives. Deputy Flood spoke about the difficulties experienced by relatives who, having travelled from the Republic to Britain to visit prisoners, found they had been transferred. He also mentioned the difficulty of travelling, the expense involved and the little opportunity that relatives may have to visit prisoners. This Bill will help to redress that. Relatives of prisoners have not been convicted but they are being punished by having to undertake such expensive and long journeys. Prisoners are punished for the crimes they commit and their freedoms are curtailed but they cannot be described as lepers. They have rights and entitlements and one of these is the right to visits.</P>
    <P>An important aspect of prison policy is rehabilitation of prisoners. Prisoners who serve their sentence close to home can keep in contact with their family and friends. This legislation will assist in fulfilling our European and international obligations. The enactment of the Bill enables the State to ratify the Council of Europe Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons, 1983 and gives effect to the agreement on the application among member states of the European Communities of the Council of Europe Convention. This legislation, which I welcome, will allow us to take another positive step to secure and develop the peace process.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies spoke about the mechanics of the legislation. Deputy O'Dea asked how we would deal with the hundreds of prisoners who may wish to return home as we have a problem with prisons accommodation. It is akin to Jury's Hotel on a rugby weekend. However, I am confident that the Government and the Minister are willing to tackle this problem.</P>
    <P>The question of the number of people who may wish to take advantage of the legislation was raised. Some people, <Col N="632" /> including the Minister, suggested a figure of 600 but one or two of the Opposition spokespersons suggested a much higher figure. Deputy Joe Costello pointed out that prisoners who may wish to take advantage of this legislation will have to fulfil certain criteria, including having served at least six months of their sentence which indicates that the number would be much closer to the 600 mark, as mentioned by the Minister, rather than the higher figure mentioned by Opposition spokespersons. In view of the fact that there are approximately 180 foreign prisoners here who could take advantage of the legislation to return home, the problem of extra accommodation may not be as grave as some people indicated. It is a practical problem but I am confident that the Government, having introduced the legislation, will deal with its implementation.</P>
    <P>The provisions of this legislation are sensible in that transfers can only arise where the judgment is final, where the prisoner consents to the transfer, where the crime for which the applicant is in prison constitutes a criminal offence in the administering state, where the sentencing state and the administering state agree to the transfer and where the applicant had served at least six months of the sentence. Those issues are based firmly on commonsense and will ensure that the appropriate people will take advantage of the legislation.</P>
    <P>In the short time available to me I wish to address briefly what I described earlier as being an important follow up to the legislation, namely, the effect it will have on the Northern peace process. The British-Irish Inter-Parliamentary Body, of which I have the honour to be co-chairperson, investigated this matter in 1991 under the co-chairmanship of the former Deputy, Jim Tunney and the transfer of prisoners was debated and reported on. The security and political committee of the British-Irish Inter-Parliamentary Body produced a report which was debated at the plenary session in December 1991. The Irish Government responded to that <Col N="633" /> report at the July 1992 plenary session. The strongest possible support was given by the British-Irish Inter-Parliamentary Body for the production of this legislation. That support was given at a time when the political situation was not as advanced as at present and before the peace process. The support given in 1991 and 1992 would be redoubled at this stage. What we are talking about here &mdash; and the Bill which will shortly be enacted &mdash; can have a positive impact on the peace process.</P>
    <P>We have to take note of the fact that the issue of prisoners in relation to the Northern problem is a key issue. As said in relation to other matters, it is not the only issue but it is an important one. Anything we can do which will progress that issue will help not only to strengthen but to secure the peace process and help to build a genuine and workable political process. In that regard, I welcome the introduction of any legislation which would facilitate the transfer of prisoners between Britain and Ireland. The legislation we are debating will develop and maintain a strong sense of momentum which will help to create confidence in the peace process and will be seen clearly on all sides as a further part of the peace dividend which was created as a result of the ceasefires of 1994. The legislation will build confidence on both sides.</P>
    <P>The prisoner issue has always been a difficult one as far as the northern situation is concerned. Any lack of movement in dealing with that problem has potential to cause frustration and doubt on the ground in Northern Ireland. We must do everything possible to stem any doubts, to build on the peace process and to create confidence. We are taking a small but significant step forward in that regard today.</P>
    <P>We are speaking about prisoners who, on both sides of the political divide in Northern Ireland, played a genuine and important part in bringing about the ceasefires. In a sense this is not our response to that but is a small recognition and it creates confidence and trust. It shows the peace process is working <Col N="634" /> and that it can deliver. It is only through the peace process we can have genuine progress, political development and a political solution. In that regard I compliment the Minister for Justice and the Government on their response by virtue of the early release of a number of paramilitary prisoners. I also compliment the outgoing Minister for Justice who operated in the same fashion. The release of parliamentary prisoners is a difficult and sensitive issue. Both the previous Minister and the present Minister have dealt with it in a sensitive fashion. We cannot rewrite history but we cannot afford to forget the people who have suffered as a result of the troubles and violence at home and abroad, we cannot ignore the victims and their families. There was a genuine effort to take into account the views and fears of victims and their families. Paramilitary prisoners were released in a constructive and well thought out fashion, for which I congratulate the Minister.</P>
    <P>A corresponding movement by the British Government and the Northern Ireland authorities would be helpful. It would send positive signals, generate further confidence and build further on the peace process. I recognise it is an extremely sensitive issue but I hope progress can be made.</P>
    <P>I accept that serious consideration must be given to the question of reoffence. That is the most difficult issue which a sentence review has to take into account. What we have witnessed since 31 August 1994 and continue to witness on a daily basis is that with each passing day and week there is less likelihood of a return to paramilitary violence. In that regard the likelihood of reoffence is lessening. I hope such matters can be taken into account by the British Government and that the movement generated by the Minister and the Government will be matched on the other side because it will be helpful to the overall position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DeclanBree" hpid="Mr. Bree Mr. Bree">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bree</NameTxt>
      <P>Having signed the Council of Europe Convention on the Transfer <Col N="635" /> of Sentenced Persons in August 1986, and despite repeated promises and commitments, successive Irish Governments failed to publish the necessary enabling legislation to allow us to ratify the convention. Today I am pleased to be part of a Government that is delivering on its commitment to Irish prisoners overseas and to their families at home.</P>
      <P>The Bill in essence provides a procedure for facilitating the transfer of sentenced persons from foreign States to this State and <i>vice versa</i> so as to allow them to serve their sentence in their home country. I welcome the fact that it will additionally allow us to give effect to the EU agreement on the application of the convention among member states of the European Communities. Thirty-one States, including all the other EU countries have already ratified the convention and it is timely that Ireland has now produced this enabling legislation.</P>
      <P>The number of Irish born nationals in foreign jails today is approximately 600 and it is estimated that those wishing to be repatriated amount to between 40 and 50 in the first year and five to seven thereafter. Although the majority of Irish prisoners abroad are in English jails a significant number, some 20 per cent, are estimated to be in other countries including France, Germany and the USA.</P>
      <P>The passing of the Bill will enable us to ratify the Council of Europe Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons without further delay and, in essence, will help in reducing the severe punishment that has been endured by the families of prisoners over the years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That punishment takes a variety of forms: the financial hardship alone of funding visits to loved ones hundreds or even thousands of miles away can severely restrict the number of visits a family can make, or even rule out any possibility of visits. There is no statutory right to financial assistance for those visiting relatives in prisons overseas. For those existing on social welfare, any money provided is entirely at the discretion of the local community welfare <Col N="636" /> officer and rarely comes to more than two-thirds of the cheapest fare, with no allowance for accommodation. The long journeys involved make it almost impossible for elderly parents or infirm relatives to visit prisoners and this leads to great emotional stress. For young families, long journeys represent a formidable hardship. Even journeys to the most accessible jails abroad involve a boat journey, train journeys, taxis and overnight accommodation.</P>
    <P>Families of Irish prisoners convicted of politically related crimes have even further difficulties to face. These problems can be exacerbated by &ldquo;ghosting&rdquo;&mdash; the practice of moving a prisoner from one jail to another without notice resulting in the relatives, at best, having to replan and reschedule their visits and, at worst, arriving at the gates of a jail to find that the prisoner has been moved hundreds of miles away to another jail. Relatives visiting loved ones imprisoned in Britain are under constant threat from the Prevention of Terrorism Act. They risk intimidation, detention, strip-searching, deportation and even exclusion from the State.</P>
    <P>Now more than ever, particularly in terms of the peace process, it is of the utmost importance that we address the issue of those Irish prisoners convicted of politically related charges. Today there are about 30 such prisoners held in the UK, and while the conditions of imprisonment for these prisoners have always been harsh, in recent times they have deteriorated alarmingly and this is a cause of concern for everyone interested in the developing peace process. Eleven of these prisoners are now serving their twentieth year in prison and none of them has been given any indication of a release date. The treatment of these prisoners differs from that of similar prisoners convicted in Northern Ireland. Had they been sentenced in the North they would have been released many years ago. That they were sentenced in Britain makes them different in the eyes of the British administration. The youngest of these was sentenced to life imprisonment in <Col N="637" /> 1975 for using a fire-arm to resist arrest. He was 17 years old at the time.</P>
    <P>Prisoners from Northern Ireland convicted of politically related crimes in Britain have never, with any ease, been granted transfers to jails near their homes and families. Transfers have followed hunger strikes, force feeding, and legal challenges rather than an obvious decision by the British Government to move prisoners from their overcrowded and claustrophobic prison conditions in England to the relatively under-occupied North of Ireland prison accommodation. Most Irish prisoners convicted of politically related crimes are held in what are called &ldquo;special secure units&rdquo;. These units were first introduced in the 1960s and their use was to be reviewed on a regular basis.</P>
    <P>It is unclear what reviews, if any, have been carried out, or what conclusions have been reached. The units are in fact prisons within prisons. People held in them have no contact with the general prison population. The units are small, usually holding at most eight to ten prisoners, with limited facilities. Prisoners are monitored at all times both by prison officers and on camera. Prisoners held in SSUs are not allowed to participate in any of the normal jail activities such as going to the library, church, the main gym or playing fields. Therefore, the range of activities possible within the unit is severely restricted.</P>
    <P>A number of observers have expressed concern at the oppressive nature of SSUs. Many believe that prolonged detention in such facilities can only be detrimental to a person's health and well-being. Today Irish prisoners held in Belmarsh Prison are being subjected to a savage regime which denies them visits for six months, access to exercise facilities, access to religious services and access to education facilities. By all accounts hygiene is appalling and all the prisoners are suffering from headaches, gastric problems and skin complaints.</P>
    <P>The right of prisoners' families to reasonable and meaningful access to <Col N="638" /> their imprisoned relatives is being blatantly flouted. Irish prisoners in Belmarsh and Full Sutton prisons are being subjected to the worst conditions seen in English jails since the 1970s. It is common knowledge that the conditions of imprisonment of Irish prisoners convicted of politically related crimes in Britain have always been harsh and severe. However, it is British Home Office policy to ensure that prisoners are housed as near their families as possible. This is not designed as a concession to prisoners, but to facilitate family relationships and rehabilitation of the prisoners.</P>
    <P>Following riots at Strangeways Prison in England, Lord Justice Woolf reiterated the importance of housing prisoners near their families. However, Irish prisoners convicted of politically related offences have never been granted transfers to jails near their homes and families in the North of Ireland. It was only following pressure from legal campaigning and professional groups that the British Government was forced to acknowledge that Irish political prisoners are systematically refused transfers from England to the North of Ireland.</P>
    <P>An interdepartmental review group was set up in 1990 to examine the effects on families of having to travel to England to visit their relatives in jails there. The report of the review, the Ferrers report, was published in November 1992. Its key findings were the very minimum that could be made in the face of the clearest possible evidence of hardship caused to prisoner's families. Disregarding Home Office policy that prisoners should be housed near their homes and families the Ferrers report established a new category of &ldquo;temporary extended transfers&rdquo; for Irish prisoners convicted of terrorist type offences whenever the prisoner has family connections in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>Many would ask what is the problem with temporary extended transfers? The first is that almost two-and-a-half years after the publication of the Ferrers report only eight prisoners have been <Col N="639" /> granted temporary extended transfers. Two have been granted permanent transfers. Approximately 30 sentenced Irish political prisoners in England still wish to be transferred to the North.</P>
    <P>The second problem is that the Ferrers report excludes prisoners with families in the Twenty-six Counties from temporary extended transfers even though a land journey anywhere in Ireland is easier than travelling to England. Irish prisoners in England are held as prisoners of the British Government and as such can be held anywhere within what is described as the United Kingdom. National or ethnic origin is not allowed to determine where other categories of prisoner are held.</P>
    <P>The third problem is that prisoners transferred remain under the authority of the British Home Office rather than the Northern Ireland Office. This means that the prisoner can be returned to England at any time at the whim of the Home Secretary. This causes anxiety and stress for families who are trying to rebuild relationships after many years of infrequent visits.</P>
    <P>Why have so few prisoners been granted temporary extended transfers? The British establishment is continuing its relentless practice of handing down the most savage sentences it can and ensuring the worst prison conditions and ill-treatment of prisoners and their families that it can get away with. The Ferrers report was commissioned and published not as a gesture of goodwill but as a result of the legal, professional and campaigning challenges to the systematic refusal to transfer Irish prisoners convicted of political offences. No one has to be a believer in conspiracy theories to note that the production of the Ferrers report has effectively bought off much liberal criticism of the British Government on this issue although it has failed to implement it fully. Professional and liberal organisations took the view that something was being done and everyone should wait and see. However, prisoner's families rightly take a different view.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="640" /> What are the effects on prisoners' families of the continuing refusal to transfer such prisoners to Ireland? There is a feeling that the British Government is deliberately playing malicious games with the lives of Irish political prisoners and their families, giving rise to division, fear, anxiety and suffering. Some prisoners have been promised transfers but they have not been implemented. Others have been told that they are to be transferred but following the breakout from Whitemore jail recently these have been cancelled. Prisoners are being &ldquo;ghosted&rdquo; in spite of pre-arranged visits. In essence, prison conditions have deteriorated to the point where some prisoners are receiving &ldquo;closed visits&rdquo;, that is, with a pane of glass separating the prisoner from the visitor. Conversations in Irish have been ruled out and many prisoners convicted of political offences continue to be held in solitary confinement.</P>
    <P>Last week I received a letter from a woman in Belfast who has relatives in prison in Britain in which she pointed out:</P>
    <P>It is now eight months into the ceasefire and the British Government are not showing one ounce of good faith towards Irish political prisoners and their families. Prisoners' families continue to be harassed under the recently renewed Prevention of Terrorism Act. Fear, debt, isolation and infrequent visits are the reality of travelling to England to visit an imprisoned relative there. Prisoners are repeatedly ghosted in spite of visits being pre-booked. Children see their imprisoned parent at intervals of up to two years. Visits in Irish have been terminated; closed visits, i.e. between glass panels with no physical contact, have been reintroduced and elderly relatives are unable to travel. Irish political prisoners in England are being held in solitary confinement. They are suffering skin complaints, vomiting and diarrhoea and serious allied weight loss. Prison conditions in England have deteriorated <Col N="641" /> dramatically to the point where the health of prisoners and their relatives is severely affected.</P>
    <P>She asked Members of the Oireachtas to help in bringing to an end the suffering of prisoners' families by securing the transfer of Irish prisoners from England to the North so that they can gain meaningful access.</P>
    <P>With the development of the peace process it was hoped that this issue, with others stemming from the conflict in the North, would be resolved. It is unfortunate that the response to date from the British Government has been negative in the extreme. Many would suggest that the British administration is deliberately provoking trouble with the prisons. To date prisoners have shown great restraint in the face of provocation and are seeking to resolve the issues without engaging in prison protests. If they are to resolve the issues they will need the continued assistance and intervention of all those who wish to see the peace process further developed at this critical stage.</P>
    <P>For several years humanitarian organisations have not only been campaigning for the transfer of prisoners from England to the North but also to ensure that the Government would ratify the Council of Europe Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Prisoners. Now that the enabling legislation has been introduced it would be remiss of me not to pay tribute to the officers and members of the Irish Commission for Prisoners Overseas and the Committee for the Repatriation of Irish Prisoners for ensuring that this item remained near the top of the political agenda. I also thank and pay tribute to the Minister for Justice, Deputy Owen, for ensuring that this Bill was introduced at an early stage and the former Minister for Justice, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, for her efforts.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute in particular to the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Spring, who from the day Labour entered Government made <Col N="642" /> this issue a priority in the Government's programme. I thank him for his continuing efforts to resolve the difficulties arising with regard to Irish prisoners in Britain.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. Currie)</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise not to conclude the debate but rather to contribute a few words of my own. As someone who has responsibilities in the Department of Justice, I am pleased to be associated with this measure. The Minister, Deputy Owen, has given it high priority. Despite what has been said by some Members on the other side of the House, this legislation was not in a state of readiness when the Minister entered the Department. From the very beginning she was determined to ensure that no time would be wasted in bringing it forward. This was not unexpected because she voiced similar sentiments when in Opposition and has for a long time been a supporter of this measure. It does happen on occasion that things said in Opposition are forgotten on entering Government but that is not the position in this case.</P>
      <P>I have a personal reason for being a strong advocate and supporter of this legislation. For many years I have practised the profession of politics and represented constituencies north of the Border. I am well aware of the hardship caused to relatives of prisoners held in England particularly to elderly parents who have to travel in many cases to remote areas. Practically all of these people, many of whom come from what might be described as a good Republican background, feel alienated while visiting prisoners in England, knowing that they are not applauded by the local population. I am aware of instances of very real fear among relatives making those long journeys. They were not made welcome and some of them had the impression that warders and others went out of their way to indicate their strong opposition to them. This is another reason I am in favour of this legislation.</P>
      <P>The contribution of this legislation to the peace process has been emphasised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="643" /> The position of prisoners has always been a central issue both historically and in terms of peace in the North. Their support of violence was on occasions very much a determining factor in the continuation of the campaign of violence. The sacrifice made by prisoners, particularly those who gave their lives &mdash; in my opinion wrongly, but that was primarily a matter for them &mdash; the hunger striker, particularly those who died on hunger strike, was a very important element in the continuation of violence. Similarly, the support of prisoners for the peace process is a very important element and is recognised as such by everyone involved. This is a very good reason to support this legislation and I am particularly glad to support it.</P>

      <P>I am very glad to have the opportunity to contribute to this important Bill. I agree with previous speakers from all sides of the House that it is long overdue. The convention dealing with this matter was approved by the Council of Ministers in 1982, almost 13 years ago. It came into force in July 1985 and we signed it in August 1986. Many people have been imprisoned since 1986. I compliment the Minister on introducing this Bill within such a short time of taking office. We were told by the outgoing Government it was at an advanced stage of preparation and the Minister lost no time in introducing it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill primarily deals with the transfer of prisoners, a group of people <Col N="644" /> whom many of us are inclined to overlook &mdash; it is a case of out of sight, out of mind. It deals with foreigners in prison here and Irish citizens in prison throughout the world. The Minister said in her speech there are about 180 foreigners in prisons here and about 600 Irish nationals in prisons throughout the world &mdash; I am sure many of those are in the UK. Many of them are political prisoners, both republican and loyalist. At this stage of the peace process it is proper that we should be aware of those prisoners. It has been the policy in the UK for a number of years that prisoners serve their sentences as close as possible to their families, and that has been widely implemented in respect of prisoners from England, Scotland and Wales, but unfortunately this concession is not extended to republican and loyalist prisoners in the UK.</P>
    <P>This Bill is an important element in the peace process. I compliment the Minister on her recent action in paroling and releasing political prisoners in this jurisdication, a move which is helping the peace process about which we have been all so excited. Coming from a Border county I travel through the North very often and I know the peace process has changed the social environment in Northern Ireland. It is a great experience now to travel though that part of the country where the security forces are no longer evident on the streets of towns, as they were in the last 25 years, and to see families going about their everyday activities without fear and without having to undergo body searches or looking over their shoulders to see bombs going off. The peace process has brought a new life in all communities in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>This Bill will be of great interest to many Irish prisoners in the UK and other parts of the world. When implemented, it will be possible to have these prisoners repatriated to serve the remainder of their sentences here provided that is their wish. I am sure many Irish prisoners in foreign jails wish to serve out their sentences there. That is their choice, but if they wish to serve the <Col N="645" /> remainder of their sentence here they can be repatriated by making an application, provided the Minister and the authorities under whose jurisdiction they are held are agreeable to their transfer. A number of speakers indicated that this may create difficulties. For example, if the 600 prisoners serving sentences in foreign prisons were to apply for a transfer when the Bill is enacted where would they be accommodated? Having listened to the Minister, I do not believe that will happen. Research indicates that it is unlikely that there will be more than 20 or 30 applications for transfer per year and the facilities here would be more than adequate to cater for them.</P>
    <P>As public representatives and Members of this House, we often receive letters from prisoners in jail in various parts of the world, particularly in the UK. A letter written to Gareth Pierce, a well known legal person in the UK who often represents Irish people, by an inmate in Belmarsh Prison in England indicates what the inmates are subjected to. It states that the food is inadequate, cold, served on dirty trays and causes stomach disorders; all vitamin and mineral supplements have been withdrawn from the canteen; all toiletries, except soap and shampoo, have been disallowed and all materials needed to keep cells clean, such as mops, detergents etc, have been withdrawn as have all educational facilities and so on. I hope the accusations in the letter will be investigated because even though Irish prisoners are serving sentences in another jurisdiction, the Government has a certain responsibility for their well-being.</P>
    <P>Not alone will the Bill facilitate prisoners, it will also facilitate their families, those who have to travel to the UK and further afield to see them. The costs involved in visiting relatives in jail in the UK are almost prohibitive &mdash; travel and accommodation may cost a few hundred pounds. It is doubly difficult for elderly and infirm parents who are pensioners or are social welfare recipients to visit their sons or daughters who are serving <Col N="646" /> long sentences in the UK. Some Irish prisoners in the UK have only occasional visits from their loved ones at home.</P>
    <P>I am aware a number of people from the Gaeltacht area I represent who are serving sentences or on remand in the UK find it disturbing that new rules and regulations introduced prevent their loved ones conversing with them in the Irish language. Sílim gur mór an trua é sin. Níl a fhios agam cén fáth go bhfuil siad ag cur a leithéid i bhfeidhm. B'fhéidir am éigin go ndéanfadh an tAire agus an Rialtas fiosrúchán maidir leis sin.</P>
    <P>I know of one family from my constituency who were prevented from conversing in Irish, the language they use in their Donegal home, when they visited their brother in a UK prison a few weeks ago.</P>
    <P>Another difficulty is that of ghosting, where prisoners are moved to another prison with only a few hours notice. Ghosting has consequences for families. As no notification of the move is given, families can never be sure where a prisoner is being held, that letters are reaching their family member in prison. When they visit they may be told at the prison gate their loved one has been moved to another prison, possibly hundreds of miles away. It is not unusual for a prisoner to be moved 500 miles to another prison. Such instances are an added stress to worried relatives. The practice does not allow prisoners serving long sentences to settle into a stable regime which is necessary to maintain psychological well-being. This practice should be investigated.</P>
    <P>When we think of prisons, we think of a number of Victorian institutions. There were three great Victorian institutions, the prisons, the workhouses that date back to famine times, and what became known eventually as the psychiatric hospitals. The latter two have certainly changed. Psychiatric hospitals are no longer what they used to be. They have been opened up, liberalised and do not care for as many people as they used to. They have changed completely and there is little difference between <Col N="647" /> them and general hospitals. Many of the remaining buildings which were workhouses have been converted into comfortable homes for senior citizens where they are well cared for. The only Victorian institutions that have not changed much in the past 100 are some of our traditional jails. I have never been to Mountjoy, but I have visited Portlaoise on a number of occasions and it is one of the most forbidding places I have ever been. It is very scary, dark and unattractive and visiting it, even for a short time, would prevent one doing something that would cause one to end up there on a semi-permanent basis.</P>
    <P>During the last meeting of the British-Irish Inter-Parliamentary Body held in Kilmainham a number of British MPs expressed an interest in visiting Kilmainham jail. They had heard a good deal about it and wanted to see where Parnell and other Irish patriots spent a few months. Having visited the jail, the general consensus was that it was a fine place to visit, but it would not have been a pleasant place to spend even one night. The cells were dark with small windows one could not see out through unless one had something to stand on, a forbidding place. It is regrettable that we have not reformed or modernised prisons, but this aspect is being addressed, I understand, in the building of new prisons.</P>
    <P>In the weekend newspapers we often read of constituents who fail to pay a small fine, such as that imposed for not paying car tax, and often are sent to jail for one, two or four weeks. We hear of our prisons being overcrowded, the revolving door syndrome and people being in and out almost in the one week. Instead of sending people to prison for minor misdemeanours such as the nonpayment of fines, community service would constitute more appropriate punishment but, whenever violence or an assault on a person or property is involved, a prison sentence would be more appropriate.</P>
    <P>The provisions of this Bill will be of considerable advantage to Irish <Col N="648" /> nationals in prisons abroad who will be able to return to prisons here, thus facilitating easier visits by their families.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on the introduction of the Bill so early in her tenure of office.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of my parliamentary party colleagues I congratulate the Minister on introducing this Bill which will have our full support.</P>
      <P>As already pointed out by Deputy McGinley, this convention dates back to 1983. As a member of the Council of Europe, having attended its various committees and plenary sessions, I know countries that had not ratified the convention were named on several occasions and I was always most unhappy that Ireland was the subject of criticism for not having done so. Many people might have concluded that we were endeavouring to excuse or in some way condone the actions of those who had committed serious crimes. Here I refer to the actions not alone of non-nationals in prisons here but Irish nationals imprisoned in many countries worldwide, of whom there are in excess of 600. the substantial proportion located in prisons in the United Kingdom.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister will give a breakdown of that figure, informing us where such prisoners are located, so that we will have a bird's eye view of the overall position, in addition to informing us how many non-nationals are imprisoned here. Both categories are interlinked and a number of Members referred to the potential problems if, on enactment of this Bill, we tried to effect such transfers under the regulations laid down in the convention. It would be impossible to accommodate some 600 Irish prisoners at present located in foreign jails, assuming that agreement was reached with the relevant countries for their transfer. If we transferred all the non-nationals accommodated in our prisons back to their respective countries, if their governments were prepared to accept their transfer we would not have sufficient <Col N="649" /> room for returned Irish nationals imprisoned abroad.</P>
    <P>I am not too clear on the relevant criteria to be applied for such transfers. For example, is there any onus on foreign Governments to accept their nationals at present imprisoned here? Does this convention make it obligatory, or is it purely voluntary?</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>All voluntary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore, it will be on a voluntary basis under which Governments will have to decide in each individual case. In turn, it would mean that our Government or Minister for Justice of the day would be required to examine each of the 600-plus individual cases, taking a decision in conjunction with the relevant authorities in the countries in which our nationals are held involving considerable manpower, many hours of discussions and negotiation over a long period. Therefore, after the enactment of this Bill &mdash; and the sooner the better &mdash; I do not think we should expect an influx of Irish prisoners from abroad to, say, Mountjoy, Portlaoise or other prisons. As I am sure the Minister appreciates even if that was possible politically, it would not be physically possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The overall question of different categories of prisoners will have to be examined in considerable detail. When replying the Minister might inform us what the relevant process of transfer will involve. Let us suppose ten Irish prisoners are acommodated in a prison in London and whose families submit an application for their transfer to the Minister for Justice. The applications would be considered, after which dialogue would commence between officials of the Minister's Department and those of Her Majesty's Prison Service, or the British Department of Justice, reaching a decision on each individual case. I can foresee it being a protracted process. Therefore, it would be wrong to give the impression that all our prisoners abroad would arrive back next week, from Holyhead, Dublin Airport or elsewhere. One of the largest <Col N="650" /> files retained in my office since my election over 12 years ago deals with correspondence, mainly from mothers or wives of men in jail in other countries, the majority in the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>Ratification of this convention should not be viewed as our condoning breaking the law in other countries, in some cases involving very serious crime. On the contrary, we must consider this matter in a compassionate manner. We must remember that these prisoners have families, wives and children, surviving on low incomes, in receipt of social welfare benefit. Equally, public representatives receive correspondence from parents mainly about their sons, but in some cases daughters, imprisoned, say, in Cork, far removed from their home in counties Louth or Donegal. I remember one case of a mother having to travel to Cork, take a ferry across to visit her son, which involved travelling all day, remaining overnight and returning the following day. I estimated this would have cost her a minimum of £100 although her only income derived from social welfare. Travel by train or bus is bad enough, but one can imagine the cost involved for those visiting family members imprisoned in France, Germany or even America or Canada. I accept that such families receive a social welfare allowance, but that does not provide assistance towards the cost of travel to visit their loved ones in prison. We want our nationals returned to prisons here to facilitate communication between them and their families.</P>
    <P>Many of our prisons, which date back to the early part of this century and were probably built for different reasons, are grossly overcrowded. Deputy McGinley referred to the revolving door syndrome, something with which I am familiar. I am aware of a case where a garda squad car brought a prisoner, sentenced in a court in Dundalk, to a prison in Dublin and later met that prisoner on the way back to Dundalk. The provisions of this Bill can be successfully implemented only if <Col N="651" /> accommodation is made available for prisoners.</P>
    <P>The legislation or regulations introduced by the Minister will fail miserably if this is not done. Prior to this the Minister could make the excuse that Ireland was not a signatory to this convention or that the necessary legislation was not in place for the transfer of prisoners, but that will not be the case in the future. The ball will be in a different court, we can no longer blame the Taiwanese, the Canadians or the British, the blame will lie with the Minister for Justice and the other agencies involved.</P>
    <P>In the United Kingdom, in particular, members of religious orders, the Irish-London Association, the Irish-Manchester Association, the Irish-Birmingham Association and other voluntary groups visit Irish prisoners. Indeed, many prison chaplains are of Irish extraction and do tremendous work in helping our nationals who are imprisoned in Great Britain. I am not as familiar with the position in other countries where there may not be the same Irish community spirit as in Great Britain. From visiting prisons in England, Scotland and Wales I was made aware of the great fear of many prisoners because they are Irish. The psychological effect of what happened on the British mainland regarding the wrongful imprisonment of persons created a fear in the minds of Irish prisoners abroad that they would not receive justice outside their own country, but I did not witness such fear in the prisons I visited. That fear was removed when Irish people living in Great Britain were allowed visit prisoners and assure them that all was well at home. As someone who worked abroad for many years I am well aware of people's concern about the welfare of their relatives at home. One can imagine, therefore, what it must be like to be imprisoned in a foreign country where the majority of the prisoners are non-Irish and in some cases do not speak English. Communication with families is one of the most important psychological problems facing prisoners abroad and I am <Col N="652" /> sure foreigners in our prisons face similar problems.</P>
    <P>We should also consider the difficulties facing those who cannot visit their relatives in prison abroad either for financial reasons or because they cannot afford to take time off work to do so. My greatest sympathy lies with Irish nationals who do not have family, but want to return to Irish soil to complete their prison sentence because of their belief that they would be in a more friendly environment.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill but await an indication from the Minister as to how she proposes to deal with the 600-plus prisoners who are located in a variety of countries. Where are they located? What form will the transfer of such prisoners take? What regulations will be put in place, either nationally or internationally? Will separate arrangements be required with every country involved or are there guidelines in the convention to deal with the matter?</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on moving rapidly on this matter and for making an indirect, if not a direct, contribution towards the peace process. Much of the discussion that has taken place, for example, regarding political prisoners, centred around their release. I admire the Minister for moving in a sympathetic manner in that regard. However, it must be recognised that there are many people in prison here for committing serious crimes over the past 25 years.</P>

      <P>Over the past two <Col N="653" /> years the quality of life in urban and rural Ireland has been all but devastated by wave after wave of remorseless crime. There is not any village, town, city or townland that has not felt the effects of the wave of crime sweeping through this country. Criminal activity on a scale which was once unthinkable has now become a grim and loathsome reality. Cruelty and depravity, of a nature which in the recent past was unacceptable, have become commonplace. This tide of criminal terror has overwhelmed the elderly and vulnerable and turned many of our streets into fearsome incubators of evil. It has been allowed to flourish in an atmosphere of legislative paralysis.</P>
      <P>There is a widespread belief that our criminal justice system does more to protect the perpetrators of crime then to deter them. The flourishing body of jurisprudence on the rights of persons charged with criminal acts has all but eclipsed the sad plight of victims. To contemplate the continuation of a system of justice which imprisons the elderly and the vulnerable in terror in their own homes is unthinkable. A system of justice where wrongdoers appear to be licensed to roam the streets to plunder and pillage at will is equally unthinkable. The scales of justice need to be realigned to take cognisance of the reality of life and crime in modern Ireland.</P>
      <P>In recent days public attention has been focused on the inadequacy of our bail laws. The RTE &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme highlighted the shortcomings of the present system and invited the Minister to appear and discuss her area of responsibility. She refused.</P>

      <P>When the heat was on, the Minister who promised openness and transparency delivered absence. Unfortunately, absence was a welcome advance on the usual committee of procrastination which the Minister establishes in times of political pressure. It is <Col N="654" /> an advance but it is not an answer. Above all else, the Irish people want an answer to one simple question &mdash; what is this Government's policy on bail?</P>
      <P>On RTE's &ldquo;Farrell&rdquo; programme earlier this year, the Minister for Justice said there would be a referendum on bail. There is a grave necessity for such a referendum and I applauded the Minister for stating there would be a referendum on bail in the autumn in tandem with the divorce referendum.</P>
      <P>The law relating to bail, relying for the most part on the case of the Director of Public Prosecutions <i>v.</i> O'Callaghan in 1966, is outdated. The reason is that the nature of crime has changed and laws based upon either the 1966 case or the Ryan case of the 1980s are inadequate today. For example, a quarter of a century ago the use of prohibited drugs was virtually unknown here. The concept of drug addiction was foreign. It was unthinkable that Irish cities and towns might go the way of New York, London or Amsterdam. Sadly, the past two decades have seen the menance of serious drug addiction spread its evil tentacles into virtually every city, town and village. Crime, the inseparable by-product of addiction, has become endemic. A tide of violence has overwhelmed the elderly and many are forced to live as prisoners in their own homes. Directly or indirectly, each one of us has been affected by crime and the time has come to bring in measures in our criminal law to deal with what is an entirely new situation.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister, and through her the Government, to outline the Government's policy on bail. When pursued by me on this question in this House, neither the Taoiseach nor the Tánaiste would back the statement by the Minister for Justice that there would be a referendum on bail this year. This leads me to the conclusion that this Government may not have any policy on bail but if it has such a policy, I want to know whether the Minister has the permission of the Tánaiste to come into this House and announce it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The absence of the Minister from the <Col N="655" />&ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme has reinforced the view held by many in this House that since she embarrassed the Government by announcing an unauthorised referendum, she has been muzzled &mdash; and the Tánaiste appears to hold the key. The people deserve better &mdash; whatever about the Tánaiste &mdash; than a Minister for Justice who is on political probation, guarded by a division of handlers, managers and advisers lest she upstage the Tánaiste or give an unattributable interview as to the full extent of her admiration of the Tánaiste and his methods.</P>
    <P>The recent attempted political assassination of the Minister by the Tánaiste reveals the true nature of the workings of this Government and its replacement of policy development with what I can only describe as governmental guerrilla warfare. Meanwhile, crime rampages unabated while members of the Government seek to publicly undermine each other.</P>
    <P>The Government has failed to lead in the fight against crime. It has failed to implement any proposal, to announce any initiative or to form any policy. Recent figures show an extremely serious growth in the incidence of crime committed by people while on bail. It is useless, therefore, to point the finger at these benches and say that this measure should have been brought in two years ago. The truth is that the incidence of crime on bail has increased dramatically in the past year and it is the duty of this Government to legislate for that.</P>
    <P>Since it cannot lead I invite the Government at least to follow. I invite it to consider the plight of tens of thousands of people who have become prisoners of terror in their own homes. I invite it to consider the thousands of small businesses whose existence is threatened by the ever escalating costs of theft and vandalism. I invite it to think of the victim rather than the perpetrator and to support Fianna Fáil's initiative.</P>
    <P>This Bill represents a considered and measured response to the inadequacies <Col N="656" /> of the present laws relating to bail. It represents a necessary and legitimate recalibration of the scales of justice to take account of modern reality. It codifies and extends the law on bail, spelling out in precise terms the powers a court will have. It proposes a number of practical, enforceable and permissable restraints on the nature of the liberty a person charged with a criminal offence may enjoy.</P>
    <P>There is an erroneous perception, fuelled to a great degree by the Minister's impromptu announcement of an as yet unformulated referendum, that there is a constitutional right to unrestricted bail pending trial. That is not so. The constitutional status of bail was spelled out with great clarity by Chief Justice O'Higgins in 1975 when he stated (in re Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Bill, 1975, reported at 1977 I.R. 129 at page 154):</P>
    <P>What is termed a right to bail is not a constitutional right but a recognition by the Courts that a person presumed to be innocent shall not have his liberty interfered with unnecessarily pending his trial on a criminal charge.</P>
    <P>There is no constitutional right to commit crime. There is no constitutional right to unrestricted bail pending trial and only unnecessary interference with a person's liberty is prohibited by the Constitution. The measures in this Bill are necessary, fair and constitutional. It is not possible for me to provide that the court can refuse to grant bail on the basis of a likelihood of the accused committing an offence while on bail. Only the people through an amendment to the Constitution can do that. The law is very clear, that bail may be refused if the individual is likely to abscond and escape justice or if he or she is likely to interfere with witnesses. It will take a referendum to allow a court to refuse bail on the likelihood of an individual committing a crime and I unreservedly call for such a referendum. In the meantime I have produced a Bill which deals <Col N="657" /> with the situation within present constitutional parameters. If the parties in this House decide to defeat this Fianna Fáil Bill, everyone will know that all of the tears shed about a referendum on bail and tightening bail laws were crocodile tears shed in Opposition and in the case of the Minister, in Government. I always suspected that crocodiles cry most on shore.</P>
    <P>The measures in this Bill fall into four broad categories. First, it codifies the existing common law position. In this respect there is a need for the Department of Justice at some time, I hope in our lifetime, to codify the criminal law. Restrictions which the courts have traditionally placed on the liberty of a person charged with a criminal offence are set out with clarity. Thus, the need for the accused person to specify where he will reside, to sign on at a Garda station and the requirements that he does not interfere with witnesses all restate the existing law. The requirement that an accused person surrenders his passport is neccessary to remove the undoubted uncertainty in relation to this power.</P>
    <P>At the conclusion of the preliminary examination in the District Court in the &ldquo;X&rdquo; case the presiding judge, a judge of considerable experience and seniority, refused to insert a requirement that the accused man surrender his passport on the grounds that he did not have power to do so. This Bill removes such doubt and clarifies the law. There can be no objection to that.</P>
    <P>The second category are provisions in aid of the victims of crime. The Bill empowers a court to prohibit, as a condition of bail, the accused person from attending at the home, the place of work or any specified place where a victim might socialise until the conclusion of the case. This is a limited and necessary restriction on the liberty of an accused person. It is necessary to realign the scales of justice and prevent victims having to further disrupt their lives whilst awaiting the commencement of the trial. Where a decision has to be taken as to whether the victim or the accused person must suffer social inconvenience in <Col N="658" /> the run up to the trial Fianna Fáil is unashamedly on the side of the victim.</P>
    <P>In addition, in further aid of the victims of crime, the Bill seeks to empower a court to exclude an accused person from certain premises and location. If an accused person is charged with robbery at an Allied Irish Bank the court could prohibit him entering any branch of that bank or, if deemed appropriate, any other financial institution. If a person is charged with shop-lifting in Grafton Street the Bill would permit the exclusion of the accused person from a specified street or area until the conclusion of the case. Again this is a limited and necessary restriction on the liberty of the accused person. It is necessary to enable others to pursue their constitutional right to earn a livelihood without the fear of repeated plunder. The third category proposed by the Bill are measures directed at an accused person. The courts would be empowered to make a curfew order between 9 p.m. and 7 a.m. in the case of adults or 7 p.m. and 7 a.m. in the case of persons under 17 years. The courts would also be permitted to require an accused person to enter a bond to keep the peace and be of good behaviour pending trial. This provision is designed to give statutory effect to the fact that there is no constitutional right to possess and consume drugs. It also provides for the monitoring of accused persons to ensure compliance with their terms of bail. If the accused person has a drugs problem the court will assist him in obtaining treatment. If the person refuses treatment and seeks to feed his habit by theft this Bill places obstacles in his way and provides for his re-arrest.</P>
    <P>It is important to point out that much crime is committed by people who unfortunately are drug addicts and are on bail. An addict with a modest drug habit will need between £50 and £100 per day to feed his addiction. Many will consume up to £200 worth of heroin each day. Invariably this money is acquired from crime. A drug addict stealing cash through muggings or robberies needs to steal between £18,000 <Col N="659" /> and £40,000 a year. In many instances the amount required will be greater and, in some cases, as much as £75,000 per annum is required. If an addict tries to fund his addiction through the theft of goods from houses or shops the amount of goods he needs to steal will increase dramatically as stolen goods are frequently sold at a fraction of their true value. An addict who wants £20 in cash must steal goods worth £100 or more. The harsh reality is that each serious drug addict is a one man crime wave.</P>
    <P>Addiction is an illness and drug addicts are entitled to our assistance and sympathy but they are not entitled to an ongoing licence to plunder and terrorise. If addicts cannot remain on our streets without constant recourse to theft they must be removed and treated.</P>
    <P>The Bill prohibits temporary release by the Minister of any person serving a sentence in respect of an offence committed while on bail. The final category of measures proposed by the Bill is directed at persons who offer themselves as a surety for an accused person. Bailspersons will be obliged to enter into a bond to guarantee compliance by the accused person with all the terms of the bail order. Thus it would be the responsibility of a bailsperson to ensure that the accused was of good behaviour. If the accused person committed an offence while on bail the bailsperson would forfeit the money lodged or pledged.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil legislation is framed within constitutional parameters. It is careful to strike a balance between civil liberties and the right of the general public to be protected from crime. The Minister should take this opportunity to clarify the Government's position on a bail referendum. No amount of political tension within the rainbow coalition on the issue should deny the people the right to openness and transparency. In the final analysis, the Government should be concerned with accountability, not the saving of political skins. Political foot dragging, prevarication, procrastination and indecision are of <Col N="660" /> little comfort to the victims of crime. The massaging of political muscles to assuage tensions on the issue of bail within the rainbow coalition appears to be the prerequisite rather than tackling crime in a meaningful way. I am coming to the conclusion that this Government is in front of everything and behind nothing.</P>
    <P>The measures proposed in the Bill are reasonable, considered and legitimate. They are necessary to restore balance to the criminal justice system. They are pro-victim and anti-crime. I invite support for the measure from all in the House who wish to assist in the battle against crime. The time has come, especially in the light of recent events, to expose this Government's lack of resolve on the issue of crime. The fact that Fianna Fáil had to publish a Bill on bail illustrates the Government's legislative paralysis. The failure of the Government to support this Bill will be a serious indictment of its capacity to govern for the safety of people's bodies, lives and property.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy O'Donoghue in bringing forward this Bill. Bail is a concept enshrined in our law to balance the rights of the accused against the rights of society at large to be protected and to live in harmony. From time to time reassessment of the checks and balances enshrined in our laws is required. Crimes of violence against persons and property are on the increase. People do not bother to report some crime because they get little or no satisfaction. The gardaí are frustrated and angry with us, the Legislature, for inaction. They need help. They do not understand why we delay and prevaricate. We are well aware of the many instances in the courts where the gardaí rather than criminal are on trial. Nothing is done to help them.</P>
      <P>The present laws, in practice, reflect the Supreme Court judgment in 1966, almost 30 years ago. In 1966 we did not speak every day, if at all, of drugs, muggings, robberies and kidnapping. Sadly today we speak of many of these evils.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="661" /> Many citizens &mdash; the disabled, the old and not so old &mdash; live in fear. It is a sad reflection on our Government and on society. The court's reserve judgment, no matter how proper, even now reflects, as it must, laws that are badly out of date.</P>
    <P>The jurisdiction of the courts to grant bail is covered by common English law, the Petty Sessions Act, 1851 and the Criminal Procedure Act, 1967. The right to liberty is enshrined in our Constitution which is now almost 60 years old. However, it should be noted that the landmark 1966 judgment set out the fundamental test, that is, the likelihood of the prisoner attempting to evade justice. Mr. Justice Murnaghan enumerated 11 matters for consideration in applying that test.</P>
    <P>The 1966 objection to bail being granted, which failed, covered only one of the 11 points &mdash; No. 4 &mdash;&ldquo;The likelihood of the commission of further offences while on bail&rdquo;. Point No. 10 which was related to bailsmen was not commented on and is now a principal feature of the Bill. For completeness I will quote the 11 points from the case of <i>The People v. Roger O'Callaghan</i> which is reported in <i>The Irish Reports</i> of 14 October-8 December 1966 &mdash; at pages 503 and 504:</P>
    <P>There are a number of matters which may be, and should be where appropriate, taken into account by the Court in considering whether or not it is likely that the prisoner may attempt to evade justice. These I enumerate as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>1, <i>The nature of the accusation or in other words the seriousness of the charge.</i> It stands to reason that the more serious the charge the greater is the likelihood that the prisoner would not appear to answer it.</P>
    <P>2, <i>The nature of the evidence in support of the charge.</i> The more cogent the evidence the greater the likelihood of conviction and consequently the greater the likelihood <Col N="662" /> of the prisoner attempting to evade justice.</P>
    <P>3, <i>The likely sentence to be imposed on conviction.</i> The greater the sentence is likely to be, the greater the likelihood of the prisoner trying to avoid it. The prisoner's previous record has a bearing on the probable sentence and consequently must be before this Court.</P>
    <P>4, <i>The likelihood of the commission of further offences while on bail.</i> In this connection, a prisoner facing a heavy sentence has little to lose if he commits further offences. A prisoner may consider that he has to go to prison in any event and in an effort to get money to support his family may commit further offences.</P>
    <P>5, <i>The possibility of the disposal of illegally acquired property.</i> Stolen property may be stored or cached away.</P>
    <P>6, <i>The possibility of interference with prospective witnesses and jurors.</i></P>
    <P>7, <i>The prisoner's failure to answer to bail on a previous occasion.</i></P>
    <P>8, <i>The fact that the prisoner was caught red-handed.</i></P>
    <P>9, <i>The objection of the Attorney General or of the police authorities.</i></P>
    <P>10, <i>The substance and reliability of the bailsmen offered.</i> (This is primarily a matter for the District Justice).</P>
    <P>11, <i>The possibility of a speedy trial.</i></P>
    <P>This Bill is mainly about bail terms and addresses some of the causes of crime. Drug law enforcement is very important and requires further resources in terms of manpower, legislation and rehabilitation centres adequately staffed by trained medical personnel. I am sure the Minister agrees with that sentence and <Col N="663" /> the need for more manpower, legislation, adequately controlled centres and trained personnel to deal with a growing and dangerous problem facing society.</P>
    <P>Crimes are committed while people are out on bail as the criminal may feel that there may be little or no additional sentencing involved. Criminals and potential criminals are not too worried about bail or sentencing. They defy the Garda Síochána, who know most of them, because when they are caught they get bail and when sent for trial they have a good chance of acquittal. Because of lack of evidence and regardless of whether the Garda know they are guilty, the reason these wrongs remain unpunished is the so called right to silence.</P>
    <P>The Government claims to be strong on law and order. If this is so it should modify the right to silence. I ask the parties in Government with liberal agendas to be even more liberal. I ask the Minister to think of the Garda Síochána who seek to carry out &ldquo;mission impossible&rdquo;&mdash; trying to put known and blatant criminals behind bars. I ask the Minister to think of her own home and family. The Minister, her constituents and the rest of us we have the right to be protected from murder, manslaughter, death, kidnapping, injury, robbery, burglary and theft all of which are now the order of the day throughout the country. We all pride ourselves on the safe havens of rural Ireland but it is as dangerous to live in rural areas as in Dublin. That strengthens the argument of my colleague, Deputy O'Donoghue, in bringing the Criminal Law (Bail) Bill before the House, to ensure the safety of all decent citizens in their homes.</P>
    <P>It is the Minister's solemn duty to maintain and protect the rights of the 3.4 million law abiding citizens living in this State. We have the right to a peaceful existence. This comes as a stark reminder following the second attempted kidnap of a family in County Wicklow last night. They were having a quiet night when they were attacked in <Col N="664" /> their home but, because of lessons learned from their previous experience, were safe. I compliment the Garda on calling to the home without delay. I compliment also the lady of the house who had a mobile phone and showed great courage. As far as I can see one would almost need a bunker to be safe.</P>
    <P>The Bill deserves the support of the Government parties. In Opposition the parties in this rainbow coalition spoke with diverse tongues, one side espoused traditional law and order values, the other &mdash; without expecting to have to make a decision spoke glowingly of the rights of the accused. Will the Minister, whose party espouses law and order, amend the bail laws and take away the right to silence? If the Government still favours law and order this Bill is their chance and all constructive amendments will be welcome. We do not need more reviews, second opinions or any other delaying tactics. We need action and this Bill is only a step on the way to the right to peaceful nights.</P>
    <P>This is the first Private Members' Bill of substance to have come before the House since we went into Opposition. When we were in Government many Bills came before the House. This is a solid Bill and has the support of our citizens who look to us to introduce stiffer penalties.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister and the Government to act but they will have a difficulty in this regard as Deputy Kemmy will talk about civil liberties and shed crocodile tears. The people are entitled to their freedom and to walk the streets cities and towns. Democratic Left will probably have the same liberal agenda but in the last few days we have seen a major swing to the right when the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Rabbitte, who is now known as the banker's friend, said he has no hang-up about banks.</P>

      <P>As Deputies will be aware I have some prepared information to give to the House but I wish to refer first to points made by the <Col N="665" /> Opposition. I do not think Members would expect me to ignore some of the things they said. It was not in my nature to do so when I was on their side of the House and I will not do so now. Deputy O'Donoghue as Opposition spokesperson for Justice, with the plethora of advisers and PR people his party has hired, has been given an instruction to ignore the issues and find a few good buzz words. That is not the kind of constructive opposition that Fianna Fáil promised when it found itself pushed into Opposition. I saw constructive opposition not from the Fianna Fáil spokesperson on Justice but from Deputy Ó Cuív who, graciously and with courage, thanked me for introducing a Bill for which he had lobbied so hard behind the scenes when his party was in office. His party failed to introduce it and Deputy Ó Cuív had the good grace to welcome the Bill.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Donoghue's way of dealing with it was to find a few buzz words, for example, &ldquo;muzzled&rdquo;, &ldquo;embarrassed&rdquo;, &ldquo;lethargy&rdquo; etc. It was as if he was given a Thesaurus as his first present as spokesman on Justice and was working his way through it until he found many derogatory words to use. I got a good sense of what Deputy O'Donoghue, as a solicitor, thinks of our justice system when I heard his &ldquo;top off the head, seat of the pants&rdquo; reaction to Mr. Justice Geoghegan's judgment last week &mdash; he said it was a bit troublesome and expensive for people going through the system to go from the District Court to the Circuit Court. That amounted to undermining the justice system that the former leader of his party, the great Éamon de Valera, introduced; it is his Constitution we are talking about and Deputy O'Donoghue should remember that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to comment also on the comment of Deputy Ned O'Keeffe. It was not today or yesterday that the Garda expressed anger and frustration at the way our bail laws operate, and Deputy O'Keeffe should know that better than anybody in any other party because his party had it in its power during the past <Col N="666" /> seven years to do something about it. Deputy O'Donoghue absolved Fianna Fáil of responsibility for the increase in crimes committed by people out on bail to the point where he tried to imply that the incidence of it only started to rise in the past few months since his party left office. However, the figures have been increasing since 1990 &mdash; I will deal with them in my speech. If Deputy O'Donoghue does not know that, he does not deserve to be in the position he is in because it is his business to get such information. Whatever criticism is levelled at me, or any member of this Government, it cannot be said that somehow or other until January 1995 our society was free of crime and free of people committing crimes while on bail. The statistics show, sadly, that crime is growing inexorably here as it is in all democratic societies. It is my job as Minister for Justice to operate under existing powers and find ways to reduce the level of crime in our society.</P>

      <P>Earlier today Deputy O'Donoghue asked questions of the Taoiseach as if there was a panacea, one single legislative step that I or another Minister for Justice could take. Does Deputy O'Donoghue think that if there was one answer Ministers of Fianna Fáil or of any other party would not have incorporated it in a Bill? Hundreds of Acts are used to fight crime in our cities, towns and rural areas.</P>

In thousands of instances, the Garda have been effective in stopping crime in this society. Fianna Fáil has, like my party, been in existence almost since the foundation of the State <Col N="667" /> and its members would do well to avoid creating the impression that somehow or other the Garda Síochána are not doing their job. Every time Fianna Fáil Deputies criticise something that has happened they are subliminally saying the Garda are not doing their job, and they had better remember that.</P>

      <P>It should be clear by now that I share the public concern that our bail laws are being abused and I had this concern before becoming Minister for Justice. Every Member knows people who have suffered from crimes committed by persons on bail. The number of crimes committed by such people has increased from 2,494 in 1990 to 4,416 last year, while the last Government was in office. My concern is to tip the balance against the criminal and protect the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was glad to hear Deputy O'Donoghue call for a referendum on this issue. He said there had been a public debate in recent times about bail but it <Col N="668" /> was I, as Minister for Justice, who started the debate, not Deputy O'Donoghue or anybody else.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome Deputy O'Donoghue's support and I am glad he shares my concern &mdash; I assume he is speaking for Fianna Fáil. As a Deputy and a solicitor he knows that at present the only two grounds on which bail can be refused are if there is a danger that the accused will not attend court for trial or a danger that he or she will interfere with witnesses, jurors or tamper with evidence. They are the only constitutionally permitted grounds. Any proposal which might, in effect, operate to reduce the possibility of an accused obtaining bail which is unrelated to those two grounds is likely to be unconstitutional. Deputy O'Donoghue's Bill, where it goes beyond re-stating existing law &mdash; and much of the Bill is a re-statement &mdash; is just such a proposal. On these grounds the Government must oppose it. If there were a simple and foolproof way of strengthening our bail laws without a constitutional change I have no doubt that previous Ministers and Governments would have done it.</P>

I am awaiting a report from the Law Reform Commission on the law on bail and I hope to receive it soon.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Donoghue referred to what he called my impromptu statement on the &ldquo;Farrell&rdquo; programme. Perhaps the Deputy does not bother about what I say in interviews, but I would have thought it was the logical thing for a spokesperson to do. If he followed the two extensive interviews I gave to the Garda magazines, and others, he would realise that my statement was not impromptu.

I made it clear in those interviews that it was my advice that a constitutional amendment on bail was needed and that I was hoping to proceed with it.

      <P>The areas dealt with are ones which could ultimately make a contribution to the rationalisation of the law, but it is impossible to divorce the <Col N="670" /> question of possible statute law initiatives from the constitutional context in which they would take place. In the absence of facing up to the constitutional issue any legislative proposals are unlikely to do more than tinker with our law. Clearly, that is not a sufficient response to the problem.</P>
      <P>I recognise that for their own political purposes some people seek to introduce a divisive element into every debate, but there is no mystery or confusion surrounding my approach to the question of amending the Constitution in relation to bail. This is ultimately a matter for the people to decide &mdash; I hope Deputies have respect for them &mdash; and I will bring my proposals before Government on this matter as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>Since becoming Minister for Justice I have not been content to adopt a &ldquo;wait and see&rdquo; approach. The issue is far too pressing and important to do that. Much of the advice available to me has indicated that it is unlikely that real, substantial and effective changes in this area can be made while the constitutional position remains as determined in the O'Callaghan case. A measure of the validity of that advice will be seen from what I will say later about some of the provisions. It was in the context of that advice&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="671" /> The fundamental question to be addressed is whether our bail laws under the conditions laid down in the O'Callaghan judgment are operating satisfactorily. There is a widespread view that they are not and it will be clear that I share that view. The nub of the problem is that, as things stand there is a clear temptation for serious offenders facing the likelihood of a long period of imprisonment on other charges to use their time on bail to commit further offences.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the Minister going to do about that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>There is clearly a need for balance in this area. I do not believe anyone would regard it as desirable to stand the present situation on its head and bring about a situation where, irrespective of the seriousness of offences likely to be committed, a general presumption would arise against the granting of bail. That could result in the incarceration of a large number of unconvicted persons, many of whom might subsequently be found not guilty. Other European countries are trying to reduce the number of unconvicted persons in custody on human rights grounds. We have by far one of the lowest remand rates among Council of Europe countries and this has its positive side in terms of the general desirability to keep the proportion of unconvicted persons in custody as low as possible, but it is probably that those figures arise at least in part because our bail laws are among the most liberal of these countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is an absolutist view that no person should be held in custody prior to conviction, but, however liberal our bail laws might be perceived to be, we do not go that far. The courts may refuse bail to a person who is unlikely to turn up for trial or will attempt to pervert the course of justice. Most people would support that approach as a minimum, but that involves the courts imprisoning someone who may be guilty <Col N="672" /> of a crime on the basis of a view of the likely behaviour of someone if he or she were to be released on bail.</P>
    <P>It is not proper to suggest, therefore, that a situation where the courts can deprive unconvicted persons of their liberty on the grounds of belief about future behaviour would represent an entirely new development. The issue which arises is whether the court should have that power on the basis of its view of likely criminal behaviour unrelated to the questions of turning up for trial or perverting the course of justice.</P>
    <P>The argument against such an approach is sometimes stated in terms of the damage this does to the presumption of innocence. Since the fact that a person is refused bail does not lessen the burden of proof necessary to secure a conviction at the trial, the presumption of innocence is not affected. That is the situation in the cases where bail is refused by the courts. What is at issue is whether society should reserve the right to protect itself by allowing a person to be deprived of his or her liberty while awaiting trial because of the fear that the person involved will commit further offences if released. In practice, any view of likely future behaviour would generally be based on past, probably persistent, behaviour. This is an issue which cannot be addressed in terms of abstract statements of principle. The conflicting rights of the accused and potential victims have to be reconciled in practice, not in theory.</P>
    <P>Take for example the case of a repeat offender who has frequently committed serious offences while on bail but who has always honoured the bail by turning up for trial. As things stand, the courts may well be convinced that there is a strong probability that the offender in question will perpetrate further serious crimes &mdash; and add to the list of victims &mdash; if bail is granted but, because of the record of turning up for trial, the courts have no choice but to grant bail. When the proposition is put in those stark terms it will be clear why many of us believe that the system has to be re-balanced in favour of society and victims. <Col N="673" /> This is all the more so as all of the recent evidence points to the fact that the initial success of the provisions of the Criminal Justice Act, 1984 about mandatory consecutive sentences for offences committed while on bail is being eroded. After that Act the number of detected offences committed by persons on bail dropped significantly but, unfortunately, they have been on the increase in the last few years. Between 1990 and 1994 the number increased from 300 to 4,000 approximately.</P>
    <P>It will be clear to anyone who has studied this area of our law that the task of devising an appropriate wording for a constitutional amendment is complex. A key issue which obviously arises in relation to any wording is an assessment of its likely practical effect on the willingness of the courts to grant or refuse bail.</P>
    <P>Strictly speaking, there is no constitutional right to bail. As the then Chief Justice said in the O'Callaghan decision: &ldquo;What is termed a right to bail is not a constitutional right but a recognition by the courts that a person presumed to be innocent shall not have his liberty interfered with unnecessarily pending his trial on a criminal charge&rdquo;. For all practical purposes this might be seen as a distinction without a difference because in reality the granting of bail is the means whereby the right to liberty is not interfered with unnecessarily.</P>
    <P>I mention this point in the context of formulating a wording for an amendment to the Constitution because we would have to assess what balance the court would decide on between the fundamental right to liberty enshrined in the Constitution and an amendment the effect of which would be, for example, to allow the court in considering whether to grant bail to take into account the likelihood of the commission of further offences. While many of us may take the view that we are not interested in bringing about a fundamental change in the bail regime for petty offenders and, broadly speaking, <Col N="674" /> we want to go after those where there is a substantial risk of the commission of serious offences, we would have to be satisfied that any wording which we might adopt would be likely to achieve that end. I do not pretend that it will be easy to devise a formula to achieve a satisfactory wording but I do not accept either that it would be beyond the wit of the Government and this House to do so.</P>
    <P>I am not overlooking the practical considerations which arise &mdash; for example in relation to implications of proposed change for prison accommodation. Obviously those implications would be greater or lesser depending on the precise nature of any proposed change.</P>
    <P>I have tried in this debate to outline some of the background against which I am progressing this matter. I assure the House that I will do everything in my power as Minister for Justice to ensure that this process will bring about real results, that a problem which might be seen to have been around for the best part of 30 years, and which many now regard as unsustainable, will be tackled as effectively and comprehensively as possible. That commitment was not given by any Minister for Justice in the last seven years.</P>
    <P>I propose now to turn to some of the detail of what Deputy O'Donoghue is proposing. Where I raise questions about his approach this is not done in any way as nit-picking. I well appreciate the pressures on individual Deputies in bringing forward legislative proposals and I hope that what I have to say may have some value in encouraging an informed debate on the difficult issues which arise.</P>
    <P>My analysis of the Bill is that it has two main features: it seeks to put on a statutory basis the conditions which a court may attach to granting bail and to provide a procedure whereby bail money would be forfeited if any of the conditions are breached. As I mentioned earlier, there may be advantages at some stage in enshrining in our statute law the conditions which may be <Col N="675" /> attached to bail provided, of course, they are in conformity with constitutional considerations. However, I wonder whether, with the exception of condition (i) in section 5 which I will deal with later, there is anything new of substance being proposed by Deputy O'Donoghue. In practice at present courts use their common law powers in many cases to attach conditions to granting bail &mdash; for example, reporting regularly to a Garda station. Most of the ten conditions in section 5 are of a kind in practice applied by the courts in particular cases at present. Any suggestion, therefore, that the Bill contains a whole series of new conditions which can be attached to the granting of bail would not be well-founded.</P>
    <P>In making any changes to the law in this area it should be borne in mind it appears to be the case that the grounds on which conditions may be applied to bail at present must relate in some way to the grounds under which, constitutionally, bail may be refused at present: a danger that the accused will not attend court for trial or will interfere with witnesses, evidence or jurors. For example, while an obligation on an accused on bail at present to report regularly to the gardaí might act as an incentive to be of good behaviour generally, the legal rationale of such a condition would be likely to be based on the consideration that compliance with that condition would lessen the chances of failure to turn up for trial.</P>
    <P>The question of whether it would be feasible to go beyond this approach in statute law and link conditions of bail to a view by the courts of likely or possible future criminal behaviour, unrelated to the offences which the person is accused of, raises complex issues and this is a matter which I expect to be dealt with in the Law Reform Commission's report which was requested by the last Minister for Justice, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the most significant feature of the Bill is that it would allow the courts to apply a condition to bail requiring the accused to enter a bond to <Col N="676" /> keep the peace, be of good behaviour and abstain from any form of criminal activity. Moreover, a bailsperson would be made responsible to the court for compliance with this condition and breach of this condition could lead to forfeiture of the bail money. Under the Bill breach of any other condition could also lead to forfeiture of bail money. However, I propose to concentrate on the questions of ensuring good behaviour and the position of the independent bailsperson as these probably give rise to the greatest difficulty, although similar considerations might apply in relation to the other conditions.</P>
    <P>In relation to the bail money put forward by the accused I suspect that threatening to forfeit that in the event of the commission of an offence while on bail is unlikely to be a greater guarantee of good behaviour than the present arrangement where the person in question must receive consecutive sentences in relation to offences committed while on bail. The proposal that the courts should be able to forfeit bail if it is proved that the accused committed other offences while on bail is not a new one. It was examined some years ago in my Department and not proceeded with primarily on the basis of doubts about its constitutionality.</P>
    <P>The Chief Justice in the landmark O'Callaghan case in 1965 said: &ldquo;it must be borne in mind that the single question in all bail applications is: is the applicant likely to stand his trial. If yes, then he should be granted bail and set at liberty&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The import of the Supreme Court judgment in that case, and confirmed in the subsequent Ryan case in 1988, was that the likelihood of the accused committing further offences while on bail was not a ground which the courts could use to refuse bail. What is proposed in Deputy O'Donoghue's Bill would, at the very least, involve the court at the time of granting bail with the question of likely future criminal behaviour unrelated to the question of whether the accused is likely to stand trial or attempt to pervert the course of justice.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="677" /> The advice available to me is that, under our present constitutional requirements, the courts would be unlikely to countenance such an approach. A condition which could, in effect, make it very difficult to secure a guarantor could be seen by the courts as a denial of bail and thus in conflcit with the right to liberty of the accused. An analogy can be drawn with the fact that the courts have said that the amount of money to be set in bail cases should not be such as to amount to a denial of bail.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of the proposal which might give cause for concern on constitutional grounds is that a condition requiring a recognisance to be of good behaviour would be the equivalent of the accused being bound over to keep the peace. Indeed that would seem to be the effect of the wording used by the Deputy in condition (i) of section 5. At present this sanction is normally imposed when an accused has been found guilty of an offence. Under the Bill it would be imposed at a stage where the accused is presumed to be innocent. There must be at least some doubt whether it would be permissible under the Constitution to require an accused to enter into such a bond when he or she has not been tried for an offence.</P>
    <P>Some practical issues also arise in relation to the proposal. The accused would have to be convicted of the other offences committed while on bail before the bail could be forfeited. Conviction might not occur until long after the trial for the original offence in respect of which bail was granted. This would require that the bail be &ldquo;frozen&rdquo; until after the trial for the subsequent offence or offences even where the accused had turned up for trial for the first offence and complied with the fundamental condition of bail.</P>
    <P>In some cases the offences committed while on bail might not be detected for some considerable time after the trial for the original offence. In turn the trial for these offences might not take place for some time. One approach might be to &ldquo;freeze&rdquo; bail for a specified period <Col N="678" /> after trial in all cases to allow for the possibility of offences committed on bail coming to light. It might be argued that, in all cases except where cash bail has been imposed by the court, the bailsperson would not be deprived of assets for that period. However, such an arrangement would tend to intoduce a fairly open-ended commitment for the bailsperson and the merits or viability of such an approach would be debatable.</P>
    <P>Again, I expect that the issues to which the proposals put forward by the Deputy give rise would be among those dealt with in the forthcoming Law Reform Commission report. A point worth repeating is that there are doubts as to how far we can proceed with such proposals in our statute law, whether desirable or otherwise &mdash; I accept some of them are desirable &mdash; without being in conflict with the Constitution.</P>
    <P>Finally in relation to the detail of the Bill, section 10 proposes that a person serving a sentence of imprisonment in respect of an offence committed while on bail should not be granted temporary release unless for grave reasons of a humanitarian nature and, even then, only of a limited duration justified by those reasons. That section is almost identical to a provision in the Criminal Justice Act, 1990, dealing with the temporary release of prisoners serving sentences for what had formerly been capital offences.</P>
    <P>While I can assure the House that in assessing any case for temporary release due regard would be had to the fact that an offence was committed while on bail, the inclusion of such a blanket provision in the case of offences committed on bail would be too inflexible and disproportionate. To take a practical example, I do not believe that it would be right that a Minister for Justice should be precluded from granting temporary release to an offender with a drugs problem for the purposes of residing in a treatment centre where a relatively trivial offence had been committed by that person while on bail and where there was a chance of tackling effectively the offender's drug problem.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="679" /> Lest the Deputy is concerned that no legislation is being prepared, there are a number of Bills completed or nearing completion in my Department. I know that all Members of the House, particularly the Opposition Justice spokespersons, will co-operate in advancing my programme of legislation. I commend Deputy O'Donoghue for the work he has put into this measure. I will note with interest the rest of the debate on his proposals, but for the reasons I have explained I, regrettably, cannot commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate Deputy O'Donoghue for taking the initiative and introducing this urgently needed and essential legislation in Private Members' Time. I am sure he will readily acknowledge this is only one of a number of Bills which will have to be introduced as a matter of priority to try to restore public order in Dublin and throughout the country. There is no doubt about the growing concern at the manner in which criminals out on bail simply abuse the liberty afforded them to commit numerous other crimes secure in the knowledge that while they build their nest eggs the additional penalty on the day of reckoning will be minuscule. There is equally no doubt that in the Dublin area, in particular, most crime is drug related and most crimes committed on bail are simply to feed the habit. Estimates put eight out of every ten crimes in this category.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last year three known criminals in that category out on bail committed an additional 14 or 15 known aggravated burglaries around an area of the northside of Dublin city over a period of a few weeks. They were so brazen and crazed for a fix they rarely wore balaclavas and were frequently filmed on security cameras. They terrorised the <Col N="680" /> local communities. The family members and staff of the small family businesses they targeted were extremely traumatised. It is regrettable, but it is little wonder, that a number of those business people have since tried to sell up and move out. The Minister will agree that this is just one of numerous examples of crimes committed in the Dublin region which her party colleagues have brought to her attention during the past four to five months since she took office. Since I entered public life I have become aware of examples too numerous to mention, particularly during the past four to five years. Neither Deputy O'Donoghue, I nor anybody else is trying to hide from the fact that this problem has existed for some years and is increasing.</P>
    <P>All fair minded people accept that in a democracy it is a fundamental principle of common law that a person is innocent until proved guilty. Also, a balance must always be struck between individual personal liberty and the need to protect society. Notwithstanding that, recent evidence of the flagrant and blatant abuse of bail clearly shows that the pendulum has swung very definitely in favour of the habitual offender and away from the innocent victim as well as from the well-being of society as a whole.</P>
    <P>As clearly articulated by Deputy O'Donoghue, judges in deciding on bail are bound to a strict adherence to the rulings in the case of the Supreme Court judgment of 1966. To change that practice would require a constitutional amendment. I loudly applauded the Minister when she publicly announced recently that she would hold a referendum on our bail laws in the autumn.</P>

I am still not convinced about what is in store. I appeal to the Minister to come clean and take this political monkey off her back. It is time for her to publicly clarify her position. She said tonight she is in favour of an amendment and has people working on the wording of it.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. L. Fitzgerald Mr. L. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a good deal of logic in what I am saying and quite a deal of waffle and evasion in what the Minister said. As made clear by our spokesperson, the measures in the Bill deal with some of the areas where the bail system is being abused. As Deputy O'Donoghue acknowledged, they can only address some areas because, in the absence of a referendum, we must operate within current constitutional parameters. I read the Minister's speech carefully and she has not definitively said the proposed provisions are unconstitutional, she said there are questions about constitutionality. I warmly welcome the provision in section 5 to give the court discretion to attach to the granting of bail a wide variety of conditions. While there is scope for general application, the main thrust of the Bill is that those conditions are intended for habitual offenders. They are wide-ranging and target many of the ways in which the habitual criminal or the drug addict can and does abuse his rights while on bail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is almost irrelevant now to refer to consecutive sentencing for criminals who commit crime while on bail although the Minister referred to it. If it had any meaning and effect, the three menaces to which I referred who committed 14 to 15 crimes while on bail over a short period would have been removed from society for the rest of their natural lives. Among the conditions listed are powers that restrict the movement of the criminal, and they were never more needed. The new <Col N="683" /> power to forfeit a sum pledged by a bailsperson if the accused commits a crime while on bail will not deny the criminal his constitutional rights. Deputy O'Donoghue rightly pointed out that there is no such thing as a constitutional right to bail and I will not repeat the quote he gave from the judgment. On the contrary, in Dublin it will have the effect of driving a wedge between the habitual hardened criminal and Ireland's modern day A1 Capones, the real leeches feeding off the hardened criminal's addictions who have found no difficulty up until now keeping the criminal merry-go-around moving at an accelerating pace secure in the knowledge that their bail money would be returned to them after the trial. I refer to the so-called independent bailspersons.</P>
    <P>Most of the crime committed in Dublin is drug related judging not only from estimates reported in newspapers and quoted by others, but from the experiences of victims in my constituency. The measures requiring a person on bail to keep the peace and abstain from any form of criminal activity including drug abuse are therefore heartily welcome. There is nothing more intimiding or demoralising for a law abiding community or the Garda Síochána than a local hardened habitual criminal out on bail thumbing his nose at all and sundry or, even worse, marauding his community, crazed out of his mind from drugs, targeting his next hit and prepared to go to any lengths of brutality or threat and intimidation to pull it off.</P>
    <P>That kind of scenario has the effect of bringing the law and judicial system into disrepute, the criminal perceiving himself to be almost above the law. Indeed the law-abiding community views him in that way, resulting in ordinary, decent people losing confidence in the overall system, invariably leading to deepseated cynicism and anger on the part of ordinary, decent, law-abiding citizens.</P>
    <P>The fundamental question the Minister and Government must face now &mdash;<Col N="684" /> if they are to act responsibly &mdash; is what to do with a system that is blatantly abused, simply does not work and promotes wreaking havoc on crime-torn communities. To procrastinate &mdash; and there was nothing in the Minister's remarks this evening but procrastination, when she spoke about a referendum to be held some time in the future when this or that committee will have agreed the requisite wording &mdash; within the present climate of crime and context of bail, is a clear dereliction of duty and abdication of her responsibilities.</P>
    <P>The Bill introduced by Deputy O'Donoghue should be taken on board by the Minister, as her immediate predecessor. Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn and her Fianna Fáil predecessors did whenever good legislation, such as this, was introduced on the Opposition benches.</P>
    <P>The position is so serious in regard to abuse of bail, pending the implementation of legislation such as this and holding a referendum &mdash; if it requires legislation, in turn, so be it &mdash; the Minister should immediately set up a courts executive to target long delays in criminal cases between the initial arrest and charge and the date of plenary hearing of such criminal cases. I know the Incorporated Law Society advocates the establishment of such an executive to cater for civil cases but Members must place emphasis on criminal cases.</P>
    <P>Why not appoint an additional two or three judges to deal with criminal cases in the greater Dublin area? Such a twopronged approach would have a major impact on ensuring that hardened criminals, habitual offenders, drug addicts, committing crime after crime while on bail, could be removed from society within a much shorter space of time.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Liam Fitzgerald for sharing his time with me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I commend Deputy O'Donoghue on the introduction of this Bill, which constitutes a major contribution at two levels, first, in addressing an issue on which the Minister's performance has <Col N="685" /> been disastrous when, initially, without adequate preparation or consideration for the opinions of her Cabinet colleagues, she promised to hold a referendum on the issue, a major blunder which may have resulted in her having learned a lesson even to some extent, since she has been largely silent on the matter ever since. The sad fact is that our citizens cannot afford the time it is taking the Minister to come to terms with the basic prerequisites to significant legislative reform on bail.</P>
    <P>In the absence of any meaningful contribution on the part of the Minister, the introduction of this Bill by Deputy O'Donoghue is very welcome. A detailed examination of its provisions clearly reveals the quality of its legislative proposals.</P>
    <P>Before addressing the more urgent areas in need of reform on the granting of bail, I must stress to the greatest possible extent the grievous threat an increasing crime rate poses, resulting in our having no option but to place the State's full resources in the battle against crime. While that objective may involve extra security personnel, better equipment and improved custodial facilities, equally it is the responsibility of this House to ensure that appropriate legislation is enacted to allow the various State agencies to operate most effectively. Our laws on bail are a specific example of circumstances in which excellent police work can be seriously undermined when guilty parties are given further opportunity to engage in crime. Ultimately the burden of such legal inadequacies is borne by our law-abiding citizens.</P>
    <P>The proposed changes address two main problems with our current legislation. First, they provide the Judiciary with greater flexibility with regard to the circumstances in which they can refuse to grant bail. Second, they allow for sanctions against a person on bail where such bail provision has been abused. The provisions of this Bill provide the House with an excellent opportunity of taking much needed action against committed criminals since every <Col N="686" /> day these reforms are delayed, leads to increased opportunities for habitual criminals. Do we really wish the present unsatisfactory position to continue when Deputy O'Donoghue's comprehensive, prudent proposals would lead to an immediate, substantial improvement overall?</P>
    <P>To be the victim of crime is the worst nightmare for any ordinary, decent member of society. Assault at the hands of a violent criminal is even harder to endure and from which to recover, but it must be almost totally impossible to come to terms with such victimisation when that crime is committed by someone who should properly be in custody at the time of its committal. There is little point in Members offering sympathy and understanding to victims of crime when it is our prime duty, as legislators to endeavour in every possible way to devise a fair, equitable and efficient system of justice. In the case of repeated lawbreaking incidents by experienced criminals, brazenly availing of loopholes in our bail provisions, it is outrageous to sympathise with their victims while failing to introduce the necessary amending legislation.</P>
    <P>Sadly, the Minister does not appear to have grasped that simple reality. It is sometimes claimed that we do not have sufficient places in our prisons to accommodate an increasing number of convicted criminals. Such an excuse is simply unacceptable, constituting passive acceptance of some perceived economic limitation as an excuse for allowing criminals to go largely unpunished for their crimes. One cannot overemphasise the need to ensure our citizens live in a safe, secure society. Surely the right to freedom from attack and abuse is as basic as that to free speech? Modern society places extreme pressure on our policing and judicial systems in particular in combating problems associated with the distribution and use of illegal drugs. While, thankfully, the position here has not yet reached the levels experienced in many other countries, the trend in relation to drug abuse is most worrying.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="687" /> This Bill affords us an opportunity to convey a much needed message to three different constituents in this State. First, we can say to the committed criminals that we are taking more determined steps to ensure that they are hindered in every possible way from prepetrating further violence or crime on their fellow citizens by tightening our bail provisions. Second, we can send the message to our law enforcement agencies that we will provide them with every possible facility to ensure they have the upper hand in dealing with the cynical, committed criminal. Finally, and most importantly, we can say to each and every law-abiding member of our society that we are taking every step possible to protect their safety and wellbeing.</P>
    <P>All Members will have seen and read of recent events in relation to criminals in Cork, of their intimidation of and threats to members of the Garda Siochána, their families, and other members of the community providing a service in a certain part of our city; the threats to certain people if they sold <i>The Cork Examiner.</i> I am very glad they did not give in to such threats. I assure them this evening that, irrespective of our political affiliations, they have our full support. Indeed, we assure the Garda that all the necessary resources will be made available to them in this task. If we allow such people to take over our cities and threaten our law-abiding citizens in this manner, God help us, where are we going?</P>
    <P>We are not playing politics, we are here because this issue is of major importance to the electorate generally. The Minister, and all Members, know that such criminals are flouting the law, committing crime while on bail, in the full knowledge that the same sentence will be handed down by the court. We know also that criminal cases are being transferred from Cork to Dublin, and are put at the end of the queue, so that anything from eight to 12 months may elapse before they are heard. Yet we know people are commiting crime while <Col N="688" /> on bail, which is totally unsatisfactory and it is the responsibility of the Minister for Justice to deal with that matter.</P>
    <P>In regard to the Minister's remark about her predecessor not being in the House tonight, for the short time she will be Minister for Justice I hope she achieves half as much as her predecessor, and it will be the people outside this House who will be the judge of that. The Minister has a great deal of work to do to catch up with her predecessor, and I wish her every success.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Wexford):</i> I thank you, Sir, for giving me an opportunity to raise this important issue. St. John's Hospital, Enniscorthy, has been long regarded as one of the best geriatric hospitals in the country, with excellent nurses and general staff. It covers a wide hinterland catering for patients from all over County Wexford. The hospital has moved with the changing needs of the elderly. It provides geriatric services, day care, rehab and outreach facilities as well as meals-on-wheels. Every aspect of the needs of our senior citizens is catered for excellently by St. John's Hospital. Those services are being provided while staffing levels are totally inadequate, much below that required for the proper provision of such facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>St. John's Hospital has a total of 190 patients at night time and the nurses' organisation has informed me there is a shortfall of some 18 nurses in the hospital. Ten nurses are urgently required to provide proper night duty care. At present nine wards are covered by five night nurses when at least one nurse per ward is required. Night nurses must look after the needs of 50 patients, both upstairs and downstairs. They spend their time moving from ward to <Col N="689" /> ward and going up and down stairs. It is difficult for them to provide proper care and attention to the 50 patients they are looking after. In other wards there is one nurse taking care of 23 patients during the day. There are 16 patients in the rehab unit, many of whom are very ill and have been sent from Wexford and Ardkeen hospitals to recuperate following hip and other limb operations. One nurse takes care of those 16 patients on a daily and nightly basis.</P>
    <P>The demands on the staff of St. John's Hospital have increased dramatically in recent years. The hospital caters for geriatric and cancer patients, people suffering from senility, recovering from many types of limb operations and ailments as well as providing day care and many other services to the wider community. The staff have done their best to provide a decent standard of care against all odds and have lobbied in a peaceful manner up to now, but to date have been ignored by the health board and the Department of Health. The health board recently offered the hospital two additional nursing posts. This is an insult to the excellent nursing staff at the hospital.</P>
    <P>The nurses are not prepared to take any more and are certainly not prepared to continue lobbying in a peaceful manner. They have decided to take a tougher stand and from 12 p.m. to 2 p.m. on Monday next they will take strike action and will not provide services at the hospital. They have had many meetings with the South-Eastern Health Board, but have been offered only two additional nursing posts. There appears to be much passing of the buck, the South-Eastern Health Board is blaming the Department of Health and the Department of Health is blaming the South-Eastern Health Board. This is no way to treat the 190 patients and the excellent staff at St. John's Hospital. They deserve better.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister of State, who is from the south east region and is well aware of the excellent services provided by that hospital, to make the necessary staff available. As the hospital provides <Col N="690" /> a service for the whole of County Wexford it is important that the nurses are at their posts. They have remained at their posts for a long time despite being overworked. Will the Minister intervene between the South-Eastern Health Board and the nurses' organisation to ensure that the necessary staff is made available as quickly as possible so that we can avert the strike action the nurses propose to take on Monday next?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. O'Shea)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Browne for raising this matter and for giving me the opportunity of clarifying the position.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will, of course, be aware that the provision and management of services at St John's Hospital, Enniscorthy, are matters in the first instance for the South-Eastern Health Board. Decisions on the level of resources available to St John's Hospital are taken by the board, having regard to its service priorities within the overall financial resources available to the board. It is also a matter for the board to determine the appropriate staff mix in its various hospitals including nurse staffing arrangements.</P>
      <P>In terms of overall resources available to the board, the board's original non-capital allocation has increased steadily from £104.715 million in 1991 to £160.563 million in 1995. This represents an increase of 53 per cent over the five year period.</P>
      <P>In the context of implementing the recommendations on services for the elderly contained in the report, <i>The Years Ahead &mdash; A Policy for the Elderly</i>&mdash; substantial additional funds have been allocated over the years to the South-Eastern Health Board. The extra funding has enabled the board to expand home nursing services, provide day care centres and day hospitals, increase the number of physiotherapists and speech therapists in the community and develop services for the elderly mentally infirm.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Furthermore, I should add that the introduction of the Health (Nursing Homes) <Col N="691" /> Act, 1990 has provided the South-Eastern Health Board with another option to help meet the needs of the dependent elderly locally. Since the Act came into effect on 1 September 1993, a total of almost £31 million has been made available to the health boards to fund subventions under the Act. At 31 March 1995, 43 nursing homes in the South-Eastern Health Board area had been registered and 420 nursing home subventions had been approved.</P>
    <P>In recognition of the priority attached to services for the elderly, an additional £2.2 million has been made available in the current year to further enhance and develop such services. Of this total, the South-Eastern Health Board has received £273,000 which will be used to fund the department of medicine for the elderly in Wexford General Hospital and to continue the development of community care services for the elderly.</P>
    <P>The 1995 financial allocation to the board includes specific funding for additional nurse staffing posts at St. John's Hospital, Enniscorthy. In the context of negotiations with the Irish Nurses' Organisation in relation to nurse staffing levels at the hospital, the board has indicated that on foot of the additional funding provided, it proposed an increase of two posts to alleviate the nurse staffing problem. The outcome of the subsequent ballot of members of the Irish Nurses' Organisation was rejection of the board's offer and a vote for industrial action. The action is of a limited nature and will take the form of a lunch time picket commencing on Monday, 8 May 1995. The board does not anticipate that the action will affect patient services and is keeping the situation under review.</P>
    <P>In the context of future developments in relation to services for the elderly in the South-Eastern Health Board area, it should be noted that discussions are currently taking place with the Department on proposals which should assist in alleviating overcrowding in St. John's Hospital.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="692" /> I ask the Deputy to have regard to the commitment of the Government to the continued development of services for the elderly in the South-Eastern Health Board area and express my hope that it will be possible to reach an early solution to this problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I raise this issue to urge the Minister to immediately withdraw the quotas imposed on Higher Diploma in Education places in our universities. It is totally unacceptable that the Minister should arbitrarily decide on the future career options of thousands of students who wish to develop a teaching career. Many of the students will have started their courses in university in the expectation of being allowed to progress to the H.Dip. programme. It was a natural and traditional path to follow, one pursued for generations by students.</P>
      <P>These students were not given any notice in their first year in college that there would be such a quota.</P>
      <P>The quota arrangement is very unfair. Information received by me from a number of universities indicates that this year there were 1,058 applications to UCD with only 170 places available; there were 800 applications to UCC with only 165 places available and letters to this effect were sent out late last week to the students involved. In Maynooth there were 860 applications for 150 places.</P>
      <P>Those figures illustrate the huge number of students who will be bitterly disappointed again this year. Some students who were debarred by the quota system last year have been unlucky again this year. A number of school principals have informed me that the quota system operates without reference to the subject needs of our schools. This has already been well articulated by the Association of Secondary Teachers of Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a shortage of teachers for <Col N="693" /> certain subjects such as Irish, woodwork, chemistry, physics and home economics and no cognisance has been taken of this fact. A few years from now there will be a grave shortage of qualified teachers in these subjects unless remedial action is taken urgently.</P>
    <P>We are also concerned about the selection procedures to be adopted in deciding which students should be allowed to progress to the diploma programme. Universities adopt different criteria to decide which students should be allowed go forward, ranging from academic qualifications to the size of a curriculum vitae, etc. This will raise serious questions in the minds of students, parents and educationalists generally.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to be more caring, compassionate and equitable in the treatment of these students.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Ms. Bhreathnach)</NameTxt>
      <P>The issue of the number of students who should be admitted to Higher Diploma in Education courses is a difficult one. My objectives are to ensure an adequate supply of teachers and to maintain some reasonable balance between the supply and demand for teachers.</P>
      <P>In particular, I wish to avoid a situation where there is an oversupply of secondary teachers or outcry about the number of teachers who cannot get employment, such as happened not so long ago.</P>
      <P>The exact forecasting of teacher requirements is a difficult exercise, but from the enrolment projections and other information available to me, it appears that the quota of Higher Diploma in Education students enrolled for the 1994-95 academic year will be adequate to fill the vacancies available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the Higher Diploma in Education intake for the 1995-96 academic year, I am re-examining the position and I will take into account such factors as enrolment projections, the estimated teacher numbers required and other statistical information. Other features which will have a bearing on <Col N="694" /> the question are natural wastage of teachers, transition year take-up and the likely additional posts to be approved for schools for 1996-97. These issues will be balanced against the total teacher supply; the output from specialist teacher-training college, such as home economics, psysical education, and technology; and the output from the Higher Diploma in Education courses.</P>
    <P>In attempting to make projections, it is impossible to guess how some schools will attempt to fill their vacancies &mdash; for example, how they will redeploy their existing staff and what subject mix they will seek in advertising the vacant post.</P>
    <P>Another problem is that there are perceived shortages of teachers of certain subjects. The mobility of teachers comes into play here, and the location of the school may well have a bearing on the ease with which a particular vacant post can be filled. The output from Higher Diploma in Education courses does not ensure any particular mix of basic degrees.</P>
    <P>It does not follow that the removal of the quota imposed on places in Higher Diploma in Education courses would enable more students to pursue a career in secondary school teaching. Rather, it might result in an oversupply of graduates qualified to teach in secondary schools. This is a situation which I should like to avoid if possible.</P>
    <P>I expect to make a decision shortly on the question of the number of places on Higher Diploma in Education courses for the 1995-96 academic year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to raise this important matter on the Adjournment and I thank the Minister for coming into the House to respond.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Army Apprentice School was established in 1956 in Devoy Barracks, Naas, by the Department of Defence for the education and training of apprentices. All apprentices there complete a <Col N="695" /> recognised apprenticeship and are registered with FAS for this purpose. The school is staffed by 13 teachers who are employed by County Kildare vocational education committee and seconded to the Department of Defence.</P>
    <P>If one were to examine the history of the school, one would have to be impressed by its proud record. The school has produced the best of apprentices every year and a high standard has been maintained over many years. In the national apprentices competition, the Army Apprentice School has produced three winners in the carpentry section in the past six years. Each year the school provides competitors for the finals. Unfortunately, the teachers responsible for achieving these marvellous results were forced to picket outside the Department's offices today. That is the thanks they received for those achievements.</P>
    <P>The dispute between the teaching staff in the Army Apprentice School and the Department of Education could and should have been resolved a long time ago. There is little point in the Minister suggesting that it would be appropriate for the union to pursue the claim through the machinery of the conciliation and arbitration scheme for teachers. They have been down that road already, unfortunately to no avail. Despite an assertion by the Minister earlier today, no agreement was reached in regard to this matter. It would appear that what the Minister was referring to was the Department's interpretation of the findings of the arbitrator.</P>
    <P>The present dispute in the Army Apprentice School has developed as a result of the Department of Education refusing to apply fully the appropriate agreements &mdash; agreed reports 14/79 and 5/82 &mdash; to the teaching staff. Following the findings of the arbitrator in 1987, these agreements have been applied, in part only, to the teaching staff in the school. The agreements are applied in full to their counterparts in the regional technical colleges and the Dublin Institute of Technology. Why is this <Col N="696" /> blatant discrimination allowed to continue?</P>
    <P>The teachers in the Army Apprentice School are only looking for equal pay for equal work. The arbitration report, No. 15, states that the teachers in the Army Apprentice School are doing the same work as their colleagues in the regional technical colleges and the Dublin Institute of Technology. Does the Minister agree that the work in the Army Apprentice School is equal to that carried out by the colleges?</P>
    <P>Will the Minister allow this type of discrimination to continue? The teachers in the Army Apprentice School in Naas are seeking parity with colleagues doing similar work in the regional technical and Dublin Institute of Technology colleges.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Education has a very demanding job and I know it is impossible for any Minister to be kept informed on everything that is ongoing in the Department. From my experience of dealing with the Minister I have found her to be fair-minded and I appeal to her to read the file. I have no doubt she will then find it impossible to disagree with the case being put by the teachers in the Army Apprentice School.</P>
    <P>The teachers have patiently explored every avenue open to them in search of a solution. Today they are angered and frustrated by the lack of progress. They deserve better. I ask the Minister to rectify this ridiculous situation and give the teachers what they rightly deserve and allow them to continue their excellent work.</P>

      <P>I am glad the Deputy has raised this matter as it gives me an opportunity to inform the House of my Department's position. I understand that the Deputy is referring specifically to teachers on the staff of the Army Aprentice School in Naas, County Kildare. The teachers there are employed by County Kildare Vocational Education Committee. My Department is aware that teachers in <Col N="697" /> the Army Apprentice School are seeking pay levels equivalent to lecturer 1 in a regional technical college. The matter has been taken up with my Department on their behalf by the Teachers' Union of Ireland.</P>
      <P>The existing arrangements in the Army Apprenticeship School for salary levels and promotion structures for teaching staff were agreed by my Department with the Teachers' Union of Ireland in 1988.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">

    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>This agreement was reached on foot of an arbitration finding on a TUI claim for salary increases for teachers in the Army Apprentice School, Naas and the Air Corps School, Baldonnell. The agreement was in full and final settlement of the union's claim and provided that: six staff members be granted salary scales at a level equivalent to lecturer 1 grade; all other staff members be granted salary scales equivalent to college teacher grade; selection procedures for award of lecturer 1 salary to six teachers would be by way of competitive interview by selection board; nothing in the agreement could be construed as regrading of teachers concerned; existing conditions of service of staff would not be altered and the effective date of all salary changes be 1 December 1987.</P>
      <P>The current position in relation to promotion posts in the school is in line with this agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Teachers' Union of Ireland is seeking to have promotion arrangements appropriate to regional technical college grades applied to the staff in the Army Apprentice School. The TUI hold that as the staff in the Army Apprentice School are paid the salary scales payable to college teacher and lecturer 1 grades in regional technical colleges the terms of agreed reports 14/79 and 5/82 of the Conciliation Council for Teachers should appy to them. Agreed report 5/82 sets out the terms and procedures for promotion from college teacher to <Col N="698" /> lecturer 1 in the regional technical colleges and Dublin Institute of Technology. Under agreed report 5/82 where a college teacher is required to teach in excess of 40 per cent of his/her time tabled hours on third level work, a teacher concerned may be up-graded to lecturer 1.</P>
    <P>Neither the arbitaration report nor the agreement on its implementation had the effect of grading the teachers in the Army Apprentice School as either college teacher or lecturer 1. They retain hours of work and other conditions of service appropriate to vocational teachers on the common basic scale. As teachers with salary scales at levels equivalent to college teacher but without the grading of college teacher, the teachers do not come within the ambit of the terms of agreed reports 14/79 and 5/82.</P>
    <P>My Department's view on the union's claim is that it constitutes a claim for improvement in the conditions of service of the teachers concerned. As such the claim has to be processed under the relevant provisions of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> pay agreement.</P>
    <P>It would be appropriate for the union to pursue the claim through the machinery of the conciliation and arbitration scheme for teachers. The union has been advised accordingly.</P>

      <P>Yesterday it was announced that funding under Leader II would be <Col N="699" /> distributed to groups around the country and this was greeted with considerable disappointment in County Louth. It was the second time under the Leader programmes that the very positive and worthwhile development plan put together in the county was not funded. All prior statements clearly indicated that the distribution under the Leader II programme would be on a nation-wide basis. Apparently the statement indicates there is merely a pre-development provision for County Louth and for one or two other countries.</P>
      <P>The opportunity is there to provide a specific sum and nothing will concentrate the minds of community groups better than the availability of a specific sum to proceed with their plan. I am sure the criteria for expenditure under the Leader II programme will reflect the lessons learned under Leader I.</P>
      <P>What worried me greatly is the perception that counties such as Louth do not need the funding available under the programme. There are many worthwhile projects there awaiting support from Leader II. Early this morning two constituents came to me having realised from this morning's newspapers that County Louth would be effectively excluded this time round. Louth is a Border county and the rural communities need the dynamic the Leader programme provides. The success of projects under the Leader programme reflects its importance to the development of rural communities. There is a great danger that rural communities will die and many are dying. There is a need to invest to stimulate the local community and to stimulate the concept of self help, which is very strong in rural Ireland.</P>
      <P>I am very disappointed that County Louth was excluded from the Leader II programme and I will be more than pleased if the Minister decides to reverse the decision and provide a worthwhile sum for the County Louth business plan.</P>

In areas such as Louth and dare I say my constituency there are wealthy farmers as well as people who are unemployed and there is a need for this type of project to improve employment. An explanation has not been given to those who have been disappointed by the refusal to provide funding. Will the Minister spell out in detail the reasons for such refusals so that we can talk about the facts?</P>

      <P>Louth or Deputy Ahern's constituency is excluded from Leader II and I hope all groups involved will be included in its developmental phase as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>The Leader II programme, which is the EU Community initiative for rural development, provides for aid for local action groups in the form of two measures: first, &ldquo;acquiring skills&rdquo;, or the pre-development stage as it is called, and second, &ldquo;Rural Initiation Programmes&rdquo;, implementation of a business plan on the lines of Leader I.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The pre-development stage is intended particularly to apply in areas where the practice of the integrated development process is new. It is clearly <Col N="701" /> intended to apply in areas where the group is not sufficiently strongly established or where the underlying strategy of the business plan requires some further research and improvement before the group moves on to fully-fledged Leader status.</P>
    <P>The operational programme for the implementation of Leader II here, which was prepared by my Department and recently approved by the European Commission, provides for aid under the two measures I have described to meet the Commission's requirements.</P>
    <P>While there is generally a high level of awareness of the approach to local development and a high degree of competence to implement local integrated plans, rural development is a long term process. It is evident from the experience of recent programmes, including the Pilot Programme for Integrated Rural Development, 1988 to 1990 and the Leader I initiative, that rural communities can be at different points in the development learning curve. In preparing for Leader II, the Commission recognised the need to provide for a pre-development stage where some communities require special support, through animation and capacity building, to assist them in the establishment of a cohesive local action group, build their confidence, set about identifying local potential and engage in strategic planning to advance to the point where the group is capable of implementing a local development plan.</P>
    <P>As the House may be aware, 48 business plan applications were received under Leader II representing all parts of the country, including County Louth. My Department engaged independent consultants to help to evaluate the various plans and to recommend on the selection of groups to implement Leader II. While acknowledging the work of the local group in preparing the plan, the overall quality of the proposals did not rank sufficiently highly, by reference to the Leader criteria, for inclusion in the programme as a fully fledged Leader group. However, the group was <Col N="702" /> approved for aid under the pre-development phase of the programme.</P>
    <P>Under this arrangement, a fund of £1 million has been set aside to provide technical assistance to the pre-development Leader groups for the purposes I described above.</P>
    <P>My Department will very shortly be in touch with the Louth group to discuss its financial needs in the pre-development phase. The intention is that aid will be available for the group to establish itself legally, to form internal structures and administrative procedures, implement a community consultative and animation process, devise a strategy for local development and, finally, amend its business plan. Subject to satisfactory progress in this regard, I envisage that the group will proceed quite quickly to full Leader status and the implementation of an acceptable business plan.</P>
    <P>A fund of £7.747 million has been reserved for allocation to the groups selected in the pre-development phase who will ultimately qualify for full Leader status. Allocation of this amount is dependent on the progress of the groups in the initial phase. While individual allocations are not being made at this stage I am confident, based on the work undertaken to date and the determination and commitment of those involved, that all of the pre-development groups, including the County Louth group, can quickly advance to the point where they can implement business plans for their areas with their own substantial level of public funding.</P>
    <P>I understand the concern expressed by Deputies Kirk and Ahern. Communities will be disappointed that they are not in the development phase but I am hopeful that all groups will be in this phase as quickly as possible. I am prepared to meet the County Louth group immediately to ensure it understands how to get into the development phase. Other Deputies from the constituency were in contact with me concerning this matter, including my colleague, Deputy McGahon. Obviously there is concern in Louth about this matter.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="703" /> I am also prepared to meet the Cork group. There was some consultation with the Cork groups and I hope the problem there will be resolved as soon as possible. As Deputy Ahern is no doubt aware, four groups in Cork were successful and there are a further five groups. There was a large number of <Col N="704" /> applications from Cork and I hope some of them will come together and form strong Leader groups. If groups cooperate with my officials I am sure they would all be in the developmental phase as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.10 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 4 May 1995.</P>

      <P>I regret that the information sought by the Deputies is not readily available in my Department. Prior to 1 January 1993 the age of individual pensioned primary teachers was generally not recorded on the computer system for retired teachers. Details of the date of birth of teachers who retired prior to 1993 are held on the paper or manual files for each individual teacher. The information sought by the Deputies would take some time to compile as it would require the examination of over 5,000 manual files and could only be obtained at disproportionate cost. There are currently 5,463 retired primary teachers in receipt of pension.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy may be <Col N="519" /> aware, all the posts which were due to be lost in primary schools at the end of the current school year due to declining pupil enrolments are being retained. The retention of these posts has enabled me to reduce the general maximum class size guidelines by two in all ordinary primary schools for the 1995-96 school year. The specific guidelines depend on the type of school.</P>
      <P>In addition, I am pleased to inform the Deputy that I introduced a maximum class size guideline of 29 for primary schools classified as disadvantaged in the 1994-95 school year.

The maximum class size guideline of 29 will apply for the 1995-96 and subsequent school years.</P>
      <P>The majority of schools which have been given disadvantaged area status have been allocated additional ex-quota teaching posts to assist them in dealing with the particular difficulties presented in disadvantaged areas.

      <P>My Department provides capitation grants to assist schools in meeting their general operating costs. These costs include the purchase of educational equipment and teaching aids, such as computers. The Deputy will be aware that I have made significant improvements in these grants over the <Col N="520" /> last three years. The standard capitation grant for primary schools has been increased from £28 to £40 per pupil over the period 1992 to 1995, while the special capitation grant available to schools in disadvantaged areas has been increased from £45 to £65 per pupil over the same period.</P>
      <P>In addition, over the last few years, I have made special additional funding allocations to schools in disadvantaged areas which were encountering serious financial difficulties. In 1993, a sum of £250,000 was allocated for this purpose. In 1994, I increased this sum to £320,000. I am currently considering the possibility of making further allocations available in 1995. Furthermore, as part of a special initiative begun in 1990, my Department has to date provided 133 computers with wordprocessing and database software for selected schools. Under this initiative, priority was given to schools which have pupils with special needs for whom the computers would be of particular assistance. Twenty-eight of these computers were allocated to selected schools in disadvantaged areas.</P>
      <P>In addition to the above measures, the Deputy will be aware that in 1994, I took a particular initiative in relation to the island schools. In the case of the 14 schools designated as island schools, arrangements were made for the installation of communications facilities including telephones, fax equipment, modems, computers and printers. My Department's inspectorate is in continuing contact with these schools to offer support and guidance to them in utilising this additional equipment to best effect.</P>

      <P>I have not removed any responsibility from the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment for the Relationships and Sexuality Education Programme. I should explain that there are three groups currently working with my Department on the implementation of the Relationships and Sexuality Programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First, I have asked the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment to develop curriculum guidelines, teaching and learning strategies and assessment-evaluation procedures. I have also asked the council to compile a list of all available resource materials. Second, I have established an implementation group, representative of the Department of Education, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment and the Partners in Education. This group will make recommendations in regard to the necessary supports for school policy development and implementation, including a broad strategy for in-service provision. Third, I have established an interdepartmental group, representative of the Department of Education and the Department of Health. This group has <Col N="523" /> been established to identify all initiatives relating to health education currently under way in primary and post-primary schools with a view to further development and dissemination of good practice.</P>
    <P>The three groups have distinct but complementary tasks and the work of all three is progressing. The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment has indicated that initial guidelines will be available within the next month and the report of the implementation group is expected before the end of May.</P>
    <P>A programme of in-service training in connection with the Relationship and Sexuality Education Programme will be initiated without delay following receipt of the report of the implementation group and the guidelines being prepared by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment. I have arranged for my Department's in-career development unit to allocate specific funding for this purpose. The budgetary provision for the introduction of a programme of relationships and sexuality education will be finalised when I have considered the recommendations made by the three groups.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 22, 53 and 60 together.</P>
      <P>The general legislative provisions regarding the supervision of pre-school services are contained in the 1991 Child Care Act. These matters are the responsibility of the Minister for Health. My Department's responsibility for pre-school children is limited to its involvement in the delivery of the early start pre-school programme. This service is being developed as an integral part of the primary schools to which the pre-schools are attached.</P>
      <P>The objective of the initiative is to provide young children with an educational programme which will enhance their overall development and lay a foundation for successful attainment in future years. The service is being targeted on areas of particular disadvantage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="525" /> I intend to establish a further 25 pre-schools under the early start initiative with effect from September next. The process of selecting locations for these new pre-schools is currently under way. The focus will again be on areas of greatest disadvantage. It is intended that the criteria referred to above will also be used in deciding on the location of the new pre-schools. As part of this process, my Department will consult with all relevant agencies to ensure that the most suitable locations are selected.</P>
    <P>I have established a monitoring committee in my Department to advise on the development of the early start programme. This committee has representation from my Department, the Department of Health, all the voluntary bodies involved in pre-school services for this age group, as well as representatives of the teacher unions and of relevant third-level colleges involved in staff training. This committee will also advise on the co-ordination of pre-school provision. In addition, regular consultation will continue to take place between my officials and those of the Department of Health in this regard.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 23 and 112 together.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to inform the House that I am undertaking a number of significant initiatives aimed at improving current provision in the young offender area. In the case of young female offenders, arrangements are being made to provide an industrial school for girls, four additional reformatory school places for girls and three secure places for seriously disruptive girls. In the case of young male offenders, arrangements are being made to provide an additional 28 to 30 reformatory school places.</P>
      <P>I am not aware that lack of accommodation is contributing to a significant level of release of young offenders referred on remand for assessment. Occasionally, cases are refused admission. This usually arises where the centre cannot cater for the particular needs of the offender concerned. I am satisfied that there is no overcrowding in any of the custodial centres.</P>
      <P>At present, the five young offender centres operated under the aegis of the Department of Education provide a total of 210 places for boys and 15 places for girls. I am satisfied with the quality of service provided by each of these centres.</P>
      <P>With regard to occupancy levels, the Deputy will appreciate that the number of persons in custody can vary from day to day depending on court decisions. However, it is clear that there is growing pressure for accommodation in reformatory schools in particular. These facilities, which currently provide 48 long-stay places, deal with the older children who are usually involved in more serious offences. Throughout 1994 these facilities operated at or close to capacity. Experience throughout the past year would suggest that the 130 places currently available in industrial schools are adequate to meet likely demand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can assure the Deputy that I share his view that no young offender should have to be released because of lack of suitable accommodation. I am satisfied <Col N="527" /> that the measures which I have outlined will make a significant contribution to ensuring that adequate accommodation will be available in the future.</P>

      <P>There is no specific discrimination against insulin dependent diabetics in the assessment of applications for admission to the statutory secondary teachers superannuation scheme. When applying for admission to this voluntary scheme each applicant must provide proof of health and physical fitness. For this purpose, the scheme provides that the applicant must submit to a medical examination.</P>
      <P>A decision on whether or not an applicant may be admitted to the scheme is based on the outcome of the medical examination and on the advice of the chief medical officer for the Civil Service. This procedure applies to all applicants. It reflects the fact that an applicant's state of health is an important consideration in deciding on admission to any pension scheme. From time to time applicants have been refused admission to the scheme because of a variety of physical or psychological conditions. There have been two cases where applicants with insulin dependent diabetes have been refused admission on medical grounds. The chief medical officer is prepared to review these cases in the light of any new medical evidence.</P>

      <P>The article in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> of 23 April cites official UK data on occupational mortality. On the basis of this data certain conclusions are drawn about the stress levels of a number of occupations. It asserts that teaching is the least stressful occupation because teachers outlive all other groups. I am not in a position to comment on the validity of the conclusions drawn in the article.</P>
      <P>I do not intend to get into making comparisons of the stress levels of different jobs, but I can observe that different levels of occupational stress can be experienced to a greater or lesser degree by different individuals in similar work situations. Also, a certain amount of stress is accepted as being necessary for optimal health and work performance. It is possible to devise strategies to help individuals cope with stress where it begins to be destructive.</P>
      <P>I am seeking to address stress-related problems in teaching on a comprehensive basis. I am doing this through provision for relevant in-service training, the development of a welfare service for teachers, and early retirement provisions in the case of those teachers who find themselves unable to function at an acceptable level of performance because of stress or other reasons.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to establish a special class for children with severe or profound mental handicap in the Inishowen area. It is also intended that suitable transport arrangements will be made to enable children, including the child mentioned by the Deputy, to attend this class.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will appreciate that the establishment of such a facility requires not only the provision of suitable accommodation but also the putting in place of a range of specialised support services. The services in question would relate to the children's special educational and health care needs. My <Col N="530" /> Department is currently pursuing these issues with a view to having the special class in operation as speedily as possible.</P>
    <P>Since my appointment as Minister for Education, I have attached particular priority to developing services for children with special educational needs. In the case of children with severe or profound mental handicap, a particularly important development has been the reduction in the pupil-teacher ratio for such children from 12:1 to 6:1.</P>
    <P>In the past 12 months, my Department has established 37 new special classes to meet the needs of such children. This brings to 55 the number of such classes now in place. As part of this development also, arrangements have been made to provide the services of a child care assistant to each special class. It is intended that the special facility to be established in the Inishowen area will enjoy a similar level of resourcing.</P>
    <P>I should also advise the Deputy that my Department does provide grant support to assist parents in arranging transport for their children to the school in Derry. Such grant support was offered in the case of the child mentioned by the Deputy. However, this offer was not availed of. At present, one family is in receipt of grant support for this purpose. It is intended that grant support will continue to be made available for those children attending Foyle View who wish to remain at that school after the special class is established in Donegal.</P>

      <P>I am aware of and welcome the increase in the number of postgraduate students in recent years. The level of postgraduate fees is determined by the individual third level institutions. Generally, postgraduate fees are lower than undergraduate fees at present.</P>
      <P>Postgraduate students will continue to be eligible for tuition fee and maintenance grants subject to a means test under the third level student support schemes. Moreover, since 1989-90 an average of about 2,000 postgraduate students per annum have received free tuition under the advanced technical skills programme which is funded by my Department with assistance from the European Social Fund. Funding is also available from Forbairt for research students.</P>

      <P>The implementation of the Stay Safe Programme at classroom level in each individual case follows agreement between the teacher, the board of management and the parents involved. It is essential that parents continue to have the right to decline to have their children participate in the programme if they so wish. For this reason, I do not envisage a situation where the programme would be made mandatory in schools.</P>
      <P>Under the Government of Renewal, the Government is committed to the extension of the Stay Safe Programme on a national basis. At present, approximately 60 per cent of all primary schools are teaching the programme. It is expected that this will increase to over 80 per cent during 1995.</P>

Remedial teachers in both primary and second-level schools are employed as teachers in the first instance and on the same terms and conditions as apply to all other teachers. These include an appropriate Irish language qualification. To apply a separate range of qualifications to remedial teachers would not be desirable in principle.</P>
      <P>The White Paper acknowledges the value of improved mobility of teachers including mobility within the island of Ireland. In this connection the White Paper indicated that one of the issues which will need to be examined is the question of the Irish language qualification for teachers who have received their training in Northern Ireland.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 40 and 123 together.</P>
      <P>Under the Community Support Framework, 1994-1999, an investment of £182.13 million will be made in the development of infrastructure in the education sector. The European Union contribution to this investment will amount to £103.625 million from the European Regional Development Fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The investment by the European Union will assist towards the provision of a range of capital projects in the second and third-level sectors as well as towards the provision of teachers' centres to support the major investment <Col N="535" /> in the in-career development of teachers.</P>
    <P>While the capital projects being assisted from the European Regional Development Fund are not aimed specifically at language development, they will facilitate the enhancement of the curriculum at second-level and course development at third-level, including provision for European languages.</P>
    <P>The recently published White Paper on Education, <i>Charting our Education Future,</i> contains a commitment that, in the context of a European awareness programme, primary school students will be introduced to European languages, life and culture.</P>
    <P>Modern European languages are an intrinsic element of the curriculum at second level. The White Paper proposes a number of initiatives to develop languages still further at this level. At junior cycle level, schools will be encouraged to promote a wide range of languages, including Spanish and German. The White Paper proposes that all junior cycle students should have access to the study of a modern European language.</P>
    <P>Transition year, now available in 60 per cent of schools and soon to be extended, offers a special opportunity to underpin in a non-examination environment students' appreciation of our European environment and to put their language studies to use in developing contacts and exchanges with European schools and students.</P>
    <P>Modern European languages will also be an integral part of the senior cycle, including the established leaving certificate programme, the leaving certificate applied and the leaving certificate vocational programme.</P>
    <P>The White Paper proposes a phased increase in the proportion of marks awarded for oral and aural competence in the junior certificate and leaving certificate examinations. The policy objective will be to move towards a position where 60 per cent of the total marks available will be awarded for oral and aural competence. This objective, and <Col N="536" /> its implementation, will be the subject of full consultation with the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment.</P>

      <P>I am aware that there is some evidence of an increase in alcohol and cannabis use among the post-primary schoolgoing population in the Dublin area. I am aware also that concern exists that there appears to be an increased exposure of children and young people to the dangers of drug abuse in certain urban areas. I understand the worries of teachers and parents. For this reason my Department supports substantial educational projects for schools. These are being extended to schools generally as quickly as possible. The following initiatives have been taken.</P>
      <P>I launched a major programme for post-primary schools on substance abuse education in October 1994. This programme, which is being disseminated to post-primary schools, was developed by the Departments of Education and Health in conjunction with the Mater Dei Counselling Centre. There is an associated in-service training programme for teachers being organised at centres throughout the country. This in-service training is supported by my Department and by the Department of Health. The training will continue in the coming school year.</P>
      <P>The provision of health education, including substance abuse education, at primary school level, is being reviewed by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment. This review will take account of the experience of programmes developed in conjunction with certain of the regional health boards.</P>
      <P>There is a development project on the health promoting school at primary and post-primary levels. This project seeks to develop a comprehensive approach to health promotion in schools. In particular, it is concerned with the involvement of parents and the community in the school's work on health promotion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The in-career development unit of my <Col N="543" /> Department gives priority to applications for support of in-service training courses for teachers on health education, including substance abuse education.</P>
    <P>My Department co-operated actively with the Department of Health in organising the Irish initiatives for European Drug Prevention Week in October 1994. Information leaflets and posters outlining the dangers of drug abuse were sent to all primary and post-primary schools.</P>
    <P>It is intended that these initiatives will be continued and developed.</P>

      <P>I have achieved substantial improvements in the funding of primary education since taking office.</P>
      <P>Since 1992, the standard rate of capitation grant has increased by 43 per cent, from £28 per pupil to £40 per pupil. Over the same period, the grant in respect of pupils in designated disadvantaged schools has increased by 44 per cent from £45 to £65 per pupil.</P>
      <P>Significant improvements have also been made in class sizes. By retaining teaching posts which were due to be lost because of declining enrolments, I will have reduced the pupil teacher ratio to 22.9 to 1 by September next. I have also achieved a considerable reduction in maximum class size, particularly in schools which are designated as disadvantaged, where a maximum of 29 now applies.</P>
      <P>In line with Government policy as set out in <i>A Government of Renewal</i>, I am committed to further increasing capitation grants, and to continuing reductions in class sizes in primary schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As stated in the White Paper <i>Charting</i><Col N="544" /><i>our Education Future</i>, the provision of adequate resources for primary education will continue to be a priority.</P>
    <P>In the allocation of these resources, priority will continue to be given to those in greatest need, to ensure equality of access for all children.</P>

      <P>Along with our EU partners, Ireland has been most concerned that NGO representation at the Fourth World Conference on Women should be as complete and wide reaching as possible and that every effort should be made to assist at official level with NGO attendance at the Conference. In accordance with this view Ireland co-sponsored, together with our EU partners, a UN Resolution requesting that the deadline set for accreditation be extended, and that the rules for accreditation of NGOs should be applied transparently and fairly. This Resolution was adopted on 21 April 1995 and an extension of the deadline for accreditation was agreed.</P>
      <P>Ireland shall, with our EU partners, continue to monitor this question closely with a view to achieving the accreditation of all NGOs who meet the attendance criteria for the conference.</P>

    <P>As you are aware, the Government decided to extend the 5 per cent of income restriction which applied to tax relief on covenants between a parent and child to all covenants with effect from 6 April 1995 with the exception of those in favour of the permanently incapacitated. This change was introduced as part of the restructuring of State support for third-level education and also <Col N="549" /> to curb the growing cost of covenant tax relief to the Exchequer.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): I am informed by the Adelaide Hospital that the patient concerned was placed on the waiting list for total knee replacement in August 1994. The hospital authorities are not in a position to provide an exact admission for this patient at present. However, I understand that the hospital has experienced an imbalance in demand in relation to male and female orthopaedic beds, and it intends to rectify the situation by increasing the complement of female orthopaedic beds as and from this week. This should allow for a corresponding increase in the throughput of female orthopaedic patients at the hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will appreciate that the admission of a patient to hospital is a matter for the consultant concerned and each patient is assessed to determine medical priority. Should the patient in question feel concerned about her condition, she should return to her general <Col N="552" /> practitioner who would be in the best position to emphasise the urgency of her case directly to her consultant.</P>

      <P>The European Union has adopted the objective of stabilising CO2 emissions in the Union as a whole at 1990 levels by the year 2000. As part of this policy, it is recognised that countries such as Ireland with, as yet, relatively low energy requirements, which can be expected to grow in step with their development, may need targets and strategies which can accommodate that development, while improving the energy efficiency of their economic activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland's national CO2 Abatement Strategy was formulated in 1993 with the objective of limiting the increase in CO2 emissions to 20 per cent over 1990 <Col N="562" /> levels by the year 2000. Latest reviews indicate that it may be possible to implement a lower limit on Irish CO2 emissions for the year 2000.</P>
    <P>Despite the growth in electricity consumption so far in the 1990s, it is an objective to manage the growth in electricity demand towards the level of 3 per cent per annum, while not constricting national economic growth.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 111 and 113 together. I am very much aware of the need for more guidance counsellors in our second level schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The allocation provided in the 1995 budget to cater for the creation of 100 additional guidance posts shows how much importance I attach to the area of guidance. I expect that those who will apply for the new posts will include trained guidance teachers who are not <Col N="566" /> at present employed: teachers with a guidance training who are not at present involved in this area &mdash; perhaps because the school in which they are teaching does not have an ex-quota guidance allocation; qualified guidance teachers living abroad who might wish to return to this country in view of the available posts.</P>
    <P>I have requested the Higher Education Authority to consult with the universities regarding the provision of adequate facilities to train the required number of guidance teachers. I also intend initiating a review of the whole basis of training of guidance teachers.</P>
    <P>The in-career development unit of my department facilitates the ongoing training and development of qualified guidance counsellors by funding appropriate courses. Training for other teachers interested in the area of counselling is also funded by my Department.</P>
    <P>There is no recommended ratio between guidance teachers and pupils. Generally speaking a school has not qualified for a guidance allocation where the enrolment is below 350 pupils. However, this aspect is being reviewed in the context of the additional allocation of 100 posts and the greatly increased emphasis which I have placed on guidance.</P>

      <P>The present position regarding the length of the school day and year is as follows: At primary level, schools are required to be in operation for a minimum of 183 days in the school year. They are required to provide a minimum of 4 hours 10 minutes of secular instruction daily. It is the practice also to include 30 minutes of religious instruction each day.

The number of hours of instruction per week in such schools is required to be not less than 28. A small number of six-day week schools catering mainly for Protestant pupils have shorter days and are required to be in operation for 199 days each year. As regards community and comprehensive schools &mdash; which are under the direction of boards of management and vocational schools-community colleges &mdash; which are under the direct control of vocational education committees, the position is that these schools are not required by Department regulation or circular to operate for a minimum number of days each year. In general, however, they remain open for the same number of days as secondary schools.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="569" /> The following policy approach is outlined in the White Paper in relation to the school year: boards of management will be obliged by statute to ensure that schools adhere to the prescribed minimum number of teaching days per annum and to the minimum number of teaching hours per day. The minimum numbers will be prescribed from time to time by the Minister for Education. In the context of the present minimum, the six &ldquo;remaining days&rdquo; will be used for school-related activities, such as curriculum development, school planning and staff development, as well as for special closures. Each board of management should critically assess proposals for the closure of its school, in order to determine whether the closure is in the best interests of the students. The boards should bear in mind that the reasons which might warrant the closure of a school for student-teaching purposes need not necessarily justify the nonattendance of teaching staff to engage in other essential or desirable school activities. Each board, therefore, should ensure that the opportunities offered by such closures are fully availed of by the teaching staff working together to further the aims of the school. Each board should also give parents at the beginning of each year a calendar of events in the school, including closures. It is desirable, at post-primary level, that the period of the certificate examinations be used for purposes such as in-career development and in-house examinations and assessment for students not directly involved in the certificate examinations. Discussions will take place with the relevant interests before this proposal is implemented.</P>

      <P>I understand that the Deputy's question refers specifically to teachers on the staff of the Army Apprentice School in Naas, County Kildare. The teachers there are employed by County Kildare Vocational Education Committee. My Department is aware that teachers in the Army Apprentice School are seeking pay levels equivalent to Lecturer I in a regional technical college. The matter has been taken up with my Department on their behalf by the Teachers' Union of Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="573" /> The existing arrangements in the Army Apprentice School for salary levels and promotion structures for teaching staff were agreed by my Department with the Teachers' Union of Ireland in 1988. The current position in relation to promotion posts in the school is in line with this agreement.</P>
    <P>The union is seeking to have promotion arrangements appropriate to regional technical college grades applied to the staff in the Army Apprentice School. My Department's view is that this constitutes a claim for improvements in the conditions of service of the teachers concerned. As such the claim has to be processed under the relevant provisions of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> Pay Agreement.</P>
    <P>It would be appropriate for the union to pursue the claim through the machinery of the Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme for Teachers. The union has been advised accordingly.</P>

      <P>The recently published White Paper on education <i>Charting our Education Future</i> sets out Government policy in this area. It has been decided that there will be legislative reform and rationalisation of the vocational education committee system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An important factor in considering the geographical remit of vocational education committees is the need for a sufficiently large area to provide for the effective concentration, rather than a wide dispersal, of resources. Judged by this criterion, the areas of jurisdiction of many of the existing vocational education committees would appear to be too small to be cost effective. This <Col N="574" /> applies, in particular, to the urban district vocational education committees but also extends to some county vocational education committees.</P>
    <P>The Commission on School Accommodation Needs, which will be established shortly, will, as a first task, examine the existing vocational education committee structure and report and make recommendations on the rationalisation of vocational education committees. The report and recommendations will be set in the context of the establishment, functions and responsibilities of the education boards. The Commission will also have full regard to the key principles and policy aims set out in the White Paper.</P>
    <P>The legislative rationalisation of vocational education committees will be implemented in advance of the formal establishment of education boards, taking full account of the recommendations of the Commission.</P>

      <P>The permanent assignment of judges of the District and Circuit Courts is a matter for the Government.</P>
      <P>Judges of the Circuit Court are permanently assigned to Circuit Court Circuits by the Government in accordance with the legislative provisions set out in section 2 of the Courts Act, 1977 as amended by section 18 of the Courts Act, 1991. In accordance with section 10 of the Courts of Justice Act, 1947, the temporary assignment of Circuit Court judges is a matter for the President of the Circuit Court and is one in which I have no function. Judges who are not permanently assigned to a circuit are temporarily assigned at the discretion of the President.</P>
      <P>The legislative provisions governing the assignment of judges of the District Court are set out in the Sixth Schedule to the Courts Supplemental Provisions Act, 1961. In accordance with this schedule the permanent assignment of judges to District Court districts is a matter for Government and the temporary assignment of District Court Judges is a matter for me. The Courts Act, 1991, allows for the appointment of 11 permanently unassigned District Court judges. The temporary assignment of judges would usually involve informal consultation with the President of the District Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Supreme and High Courts are centralised and, therefore, the question of the assignment of judges of these courts to a particular geographic area does not arise. The day to day allocation <Col N="581" /> of judicial resources of these courts is a matter for the Chief Justice and the President of the High Court respectively and is one in which I have no function.</P>

      <P>Family income supplement is designed to provide cash support to families on low earnings and, thereby, preserve the incentive to remain in employment. The payment is not, in general, assessed as means against other schemes administered by the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The issue of treating family income supplement (FIS) as additional income for means tested schemes such as the differential rent schemes was not specifically addressed when FIS was originally devised. In the past, however, my Department has had discussions with other relevant Departments with a view to ensuring that FIS would not be assessable as income in the appropriate means tests. These discussions were successful in some cases for example, in the <Col N="585" /> case of the means test applied to recipients of the medical card. In the case of the differential rent schemes I understand that the Department of the Environment took the view that it could not specify that one particular source of income, such as FIS, be excluded from the assessment of income for the purposes of the means test applied under the differential rent scheme, as responsibility for this scheme, had been devolved to the relevant housing authorities.</P>
    <P>It is my view that FIS should not be assessable as income for the purposes of determining entitlement under the differential rent schemes and I propose to take up this matter with my colleague, the Minister for the Environment.</P>

      <Quest>if he will have arrangements made for a person (details supplied) in Dublin 12 to obtain adequate supplementary welfare allowance in view of the fact that he has been assessed as being entitled to £7 per week by his community welfare officer despite the fact that he is a mature adult with basic needs; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The person in question was released from prison three weeks ago. On release from prison, a person would normally sign on for unemployment assistance; however, in this case, the person claimed a basic supplementary welfare allowance payment at his local health centre.</P>
      <P>As the person was living at home with his parents, a &ldquo;benefit and privilege&rdquo; assessment, i.e. for board and lodgings, was made by the community welfare officer which resulted in the person receiving a reduced basic payment of £7 for that first week. He also received an exceptional needs payment of £40 for clothing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the provisions of the scheme, health boards must take account of any <Col N="586" /> benefit and privilege accruing to a claimant in assessing his/her entitlement to a payment. In practice, benefit and privilege is taken to mean the value of board and lodgings to applicants residing in the parental home. The purpose of the benefit and privilege assessment is to achieve a degree of equity between applicants in different family circumstances.</P>
    <P>The person concerned subsequently applied for unemployment assistance and received a payment of £52.90 on 26 April 1995. The full rate is £58.90; however, in the case of unemployment assistance a standard minimum assessment of £6 applies in respect of free board and lodgings where the client is living with his parents.</P>
    <P>As SWA is generally intended as a short term payment, the assessment of benefit and privilege is not as favourable as that which applies for UA purposes. However, in view of changes in the benefit and privilege provisions for UA recipients and in view of the need for clarity in this area, the assessment of benefit and privilege is being reviewed at present.</P>

      <P>With effect from September 1995, child benefit will be payable in respect of 18 year olds who are in full-time education or are physically or mentally handicapped. In addition, the rates of payment will be increased from £20 to £27 for each of the first two children and from £25 to £32 for the third and subsequent child.

      <P>My Department has never engaged in currency speculation. The Department as Irish Intervention Agency borrows to fund ongoing FEOGA Guarantee expenditure pending subsequent EU recoupment and to finance intervention purchases. Borrowing facilities are subject to the consent of the Minister for Finance who guarantees them.</P>
      <P>My Department's objective at all times is to borrow the funds required at least cost in accordance with general Government policy.</P>
      <P>The Government decided as from 1982 that these borrowings should be largely in foreign currencies. It did this to relieve pressure on the Irish market and to enable the Department to take advantage of lower interest rates than applied domestically. It was conscious of the fact that this would inevitably lead to some exchange rate losses but expected that these would be outweighed by the interest rate gains. This expectation was in fact borne out in practice. Over the period 1982 to 1994 it is estimated that the interest rate savings exceeded in the net exchange rate losses by about £45 million. Government policy on this issue as operated by my Department was, therefore, successful in generating overall savings for the Exchequer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the situation regarding field staff at my Department's Portlaoise office.</P>
      <P>The staffing situation, not only at Portlaoise but at many other Department offices, is the subject of continuous and ongoing review by my Department's management to ensure that, within resources available, the best possible service is provided and, in particular, that applications are processed and grants paid with the minimum of delay.</P>
      <P>Following my recent announcement that, due to the provision of insufficient finance under the Structural Funds, I was forced to suspend acceptance of applications under the control of farmyard pollution scheme, I have made arrangements for the setting up of a consultative group involving officials of my Department, the farm organisations and other interested parties to seek to establish priority categories and enable as many as possible of the 12,000 applicants under the scheme currently on hand to proceed with essential work.</P>
      <P>Such priority categories could, in my view, include applications in counties where processing of applications has been particularly affected by Department staff shortages. I have asked the group to report as a matter of urgency and by the end of May at the latest.</P>
      <P>To ensure that the suspension of the CFP scheme will have minimal impact on participants in the rural environment protection scheme all REPS participants, approved on or before 27 April 1995 who applied for grant aid under the CFP scheme, will have valid applications approved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would point out, in conclusion, that approvals already issued under the CFP scheme together with approvals issued <Col N="591" /> under the other on-farm investment schemes should be more than sufficient to ensure adequate work for the farm building sector in the summer months.</P>

      <P>The position is that the individual in question was discharged from the Permanent Defence Force at his own request &ldquo;on pension after 21 years service&rdquo; with effect from 26 January 1972. Prior to his discharge he was examined by a Medical Board and found not to possess the medical standard required for service in the Defence Forces. However, in view of his earlier application to be discharged &ldquo;on pension after 21 years service&rdquo; it was decided to proceed with his discharge on that basis. In that regard the pension and gratuity which he received when he left the Defence Forces would not have been increased had he been discharged on medical grounds. In addition to a service pension he is also in receipt of a disability pension under the Army Pensions Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The individual in question has been advised on a number of occasions that if he wishes to have his discharge papers (LA89) amended to show that he was below army medical standards at the time of his discharge from the Defence Forces he should return them to Enlisted Personnel Section. Defence <Col N="594" /> Forces Headquarters, Parkgate, Dublin 8. If he returns the Discharge Papers they will be amended accordingly.</P>

      <P>Under the Army Pensions Acts a disability pension may be granted to a former member of the Permanent Defence Force in respect of permanent disablement due to&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) a wound or injury attributable to service in the Defence Forces;</P>
      <P>(b) a disease, but only if attributable to or aggravated by service with a United Nations Force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Application for a disability pension must be made within a statutory time <Col N="596" /> limit of 12 months after discharge or retirement in wound or injury cases and within eight years in cases of disease. The latter provision was enacted in 1960 to provide an extended period of application in the case of personnel who serve abroad with the United Nations.</P>
    <P>It has been established practice for many years to provide all Defence Forces' personnel on their discharge or retirement with information setting out their possible entitlements under the Army Pensions Acts and emphasising the statutory time limits for submission of completed applications. This information is included with each individual's discharge documents.</P>
    <P>As the relevant periods for the making of applications are strictly governed by statute the extension of the time limits in individual cases is not permissible.</P>
