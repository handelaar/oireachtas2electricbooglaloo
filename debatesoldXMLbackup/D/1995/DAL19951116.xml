      <P>I am sure it is in order on this occasion to congratulate the Northern Ireland soccer team on its fine result and to pass on commiserations to our team.  I cannot help but think that we saw clearly last night in a manifest way what North-South co-operation can do, it would be better than any tomes or fine studies.</P>

      <P>I raised with the Taoiseach the other day the proposed appearance of the DPP on a live radio programme and how irrelevant this House is becoming.  This morning I read in a newspaper that the Taoiseach had received a letter from the British Prime Minister.  When I sought information here yesterday on the response from the British Government the Taoiseach did not give me that information.  If the Taoiseach and the Government withhold essential information from the House and brief the media on it, they will further undermine the House, their authority and the role of Deputies.  I ask <Col N="662" /> the Taoiseach for an explanation as to why I was not given the information I sought during Question Time yesterday.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not aware of it when I answered questions in the House, hence I did not disclose it.  I hope the Deputies will appreciate that I tell the truth to the House.  I share the concerns expressed by the Deputy in regard to the proposed appearance of the DPP.  I believe it is important that at the very minimum the House should not be treated in a less informative way than any other institution.  It is a matter I am considering at this stage, I understand Deputy Harney tabled Dáil Questions for next week and I hope to be able to answer them reasonably fully.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I want the House to picture a letter arriving from the British Prime Minister to the Taoiseach and the Taoiseach not being given the letter as a matter of priority by his staff.  I accept that he did not see it, but it is incredible that the Taoiseach was not immediately given a letter from the British Prime Minister on the issue of the peace proces.  It says something about the running of the Taoiseach's office and this Government.</P>

      <P>I expect the Taoiseach will say that is a matter to be discussed when the Bill comes before the House next week.  The Taoiseach already indicated to the House that he is unhappy the DPP will be appearing on the Marian Finucane radio show.  We can take that as read.  Perhaps then his Government will allow the DPP to come before a committee.</P>

      <P>Does the Government intend to bring forward legislation to restrict and control the availability of firearms in view of the fact that people are being gunned down on the streets?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>My understanding is that the legislation on the availability of firearms is among the most rigorous and exacting in Europe.  The problems that may exist in regard to firearms exist because people are breaking that law. Obviously what we need is enforcement of firearms legislation and the passing of all necessary information about the existence of illicitly held firearms to the appropriate authorities, namely, the Garda Síochána.  We also need to ensure that we do not have significant amounts of illegally held firearms in our jurisdiction.</P>

      <P>On 14 February the Government promised that the defamation Bill would be taken in nine <Col N="666" /> months, i.e. 14 November.  Today is 16 November and I wonder whether the Government has problems about matters concerning defamation and why the Bill is not before the House?  When is it intended to bring the Bill before the House?</P>

      <P>In a reply I received on 14 November from the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Proinsias De Rossa, he promised legislation on exempting the money received under the REPS scheme from assessment for unemployment assistance.  When is it proposed to introduce this legislation and will it be brought before the House in this session as small farmers cannot benefit from the scheme until this legislation is introduced?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>My understanding is that the Minister for Social Welfare did not make a promise of the kind to which the Deputy has referred.  Obviously all matters affecting social welfare entitlements can be dealt with annually during the discussion on the Social Welfare Bill which is presented each year.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I appreciate the co-operation of the Opposition parties in the prompt taking of the Bill.  My primary aim in introducing this Bill is to deepen and widen our capital markets by providing a new instrument for secure investment.  This will enhance the range of investment opportunities in the Irish capital market.</P>
      <P>The main function of the Bill is to provide the legislative backing to the securitisation of certain moneys due to local authorities from the repayment of mortgages financed originally through loans from the local loans fund.  This form of securitisation is common in many states of the United States of America.  It is beginning to be used in Europe.  Ireland will be among the first European countries to utilise this form of financial instrument.</P>
      <P>As the House is no doubt aware, the need for securitisation arises from the Government's obligation to pay to women the arrears owed to them arising from a High Court ruling in relation to the EU Directive on equality of treatment in social security payments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An EU Directive on equality of treatment for men and women in social secruity was adopted by the Council of Ministers on 19 December 1978.  The deadline for implementation of the Directive was 23 December 1984.  The measures necessary to introduce equality of treatment, in accordance with the provisions of the Directive, were contained in the Social Welfare (No. 2) Act, 1985, which was enacted in July 1985.  The provisions of that Act were brought into force by way of commencement order in two phases with effect from May and November 1986. <Col N="672" /> Consequently, equality of treatment in accordance with the provisions of the Directive was not fully provided for in respect of the period of delay from 23 December 1984, the deadline for implementation, to November 1986.</P>
    <P>There were four areas of the social welfare code which were discriminatory within the terms of the Directive during the period of delay.  These were that married women received a lower personal rate of benefit than men and single women in the schemes of disability benefit, unemployment benefit, invalidity pension and occupational injuries benefits; they were entitled to unemployment benefit for a maximum duration of 12 months, as against 15 months for claimants generally; they were precluded from qualifying for unemployment assistance; and as a general rule, they did not qualify for increases in respect of adult or child dependants.</P>
    <P>When the 1985 Act became fully operational in November 1986, many married men lost entitlement to an increase in respect of their spouse as an adult dependant and to half of the increases in respect of children, where the wife was not an adult dependant.  To avoid a sudden reduction in income for the families concerned, the Government decided to introduce transitional payments in these areas.  These payments, which were paid to men but not to women, were subsequently found by the courts to have been discriminatory also. These payments were reduced annually from 1988 onwards and they were discontinued entirely in July, 1992 by my colleague, Deputy McCreevy, former Minister for Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>Arising from the delay in implementing the necessary measures in accordance with the requirements of the Directive, court proceedings were initiated by a number of married women in which they sought to have their entitlements in the period of delay determined on the basis of the rules applied to married men.  They also sought payment of the transitional payments to them on the same basis as applied to men.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="673" /> In a judgment delivered in the High Court on 3 February, 1995, in what was effectively a test case, Miss Justice Carroll found that married women were entitled to be paid on the basis of the rules applied to married men in the period of delay and that they were also entitled to transitional payments paid to men in similar circumstances.  The judgment also provided for the payment of compensatory interest at a rate equivalent to the consumer price index on the arrears of benefit up to the date of payment.</P>
    <P>The Government authorised the Minister for Social Welfare to put in place arrangements to implement the High Court judgment.  This is in line with the commitment given in <i>A Government of Renewal</i> to pay the legally determined entitlements of married women to social welfare equality payments.  Under these arrangements the estimated 70,000 women involved are receiving payments on the basis of the rules applied to married men in the period of delay in implementing the Directive.  They are also receiving transitional payments.  The total cost of implementing the judgment is estimated at some £260 million, of which up to £200 million will have been paid by the end of 1995.  The remaining £60 million will be paid in 1996 and 1997.</P>
    <P>At budget time, I provided £60 million for the payment of these obligations. I indicated that, if it were necessary to pay more than the £60 million this year, I would consider disposing of certain State assets so that the EBR would not be increased.  It was in this context that I asked for an examination of the means by which certain assets of the local loans fund could be realised as a cash payment to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>The National Treasury Management Agency suggested a route which would involve the sale of the proceeds of the mortgages to the private sector.  I decided to adopt the NTMA's suggestion.  I hoped this proposal would encourage the financial markets in Ireland to look afresh at the idea of securitisation of mortgages and that the <Col N="674" /> scheme would give an impetus to this area of financial market development.  It is the Government's policy to encourage the development of corporate and mortgage bonds in Ireland, thus making the real economy less vulnerable to any temporary volatility in the financial markets particularly with regard to fluctuating interest rates.  Since my decision earlier this year, two private sector schemes have been announced involving the securitisation of mortgages, albeit floating rate based transactions.</P>
    <P>The local loans fund was established in 1935 under the control of the Minister for Finance to provide a new system of local authority capital funding.  The fund is financed by the Exchequer.  Over the years it provided loan capital to local authorities at fixed rates of interest for various purposes including on-lending to individual house purchasers who satisfied a means test, that is, the so-called SDA loans, or Small Dwellings Act loans.</P>
    <P>Since 1988 new loan approvals by the fund have been very limited, having been replaced by direct Exchequer grants in the main for local authority capital projects.  In the case of the housing loans, the Housing Finance Agency has since 1986 provided the local authorities with the requisite funds at variable rates of interest.</P>
    <P>Total loans outstanding from the fund to local authorities are of the order of £480 million and of these about £440 million are SDA loans.  A little less than half of these loans are involved in the proposed securitisation.</P>
    <P>The National Treasury Management Agency, at my request, consulted my Department and the Department of the Environment as well as various financial institutions and the local authorities in the development of its proposal. Broadly, the proposed scheme is as follows: first, a special purpose vehicle, or SPV, will be established in the private sector but managed by the NTMA; second, this SPV will raise £140 million in the current year by a bond issue to investors and pay the proceeds to the <Col N="675" /> Exchequer; third, the local authorities, with the help of the NTMA, will agree a pool of mortgage repayments, the revenue from which will be assigned to the SPV &mdash; the SPV will fund payments to the bond holders from this assigned revenue; fourth, all payments by the local authorities to the SPV will be routed through the Local Loans Fund which will act as agent for the SPV; fifth, as a local authority makes payments through the Local Loans Fund to the SPV, it will be deemed to have made a repayment of its LLF debt; sixth, the local authorities will continue the existing practice of paying over the mortgage payments as they become due to them, even if not collected; seventh, in the very unlikely event of a local authority defaulting on its payments, the Minister would pay to the SPV the amount due and pursue the local authority by way of the Local Loans Fund's legal powers, which give it a charge on the local authorities' general revenue; eighth, in the event of early redemption of a mortgage in the pool, the sum can be passed to the SPV by the local authority and this would be invested by the SPV and, finally, any surplus remaining in the SPV will be handed over to the Exchequer on the winding up of the company.</P>
    <P>In essence, this scheme means that the Exchequer will receive a lump sum up front in exchange for a stream of income that would have been payable to it from local authority sources over the coming years.  This structure is necessary because I wish to ensure that the underlying mortgage asset is not affected in any way by the proposed securitisation scheme and also that the local authorities are in no worse position under this scheme than they are at present.  I want to emphasise this point. There will be absolutely no change in the existing relationship between the individual mortgagor and the local authority and there will be no adverse effect whatever on the finances of the local authorities.</P>
    <P>While the proposed scheme may appear complex, similar schemes are <Col N="676" /> standard financial market practice for securitised bonds and a special purpose vehicle is almost always a feature of such schemes.</P>
    <P>As stated already, the scheme provides that the Minister for Finance will guarantee the payments to the SPV thereby ensuring that the SPV will not have, or require to have, access to the security of the mortgage itself.  The local authorities will have their Local Loans Fund debt forgiven to the extent of the payments made to the SPV.  As each payment is made it will be deemed to be a repayment off their Local Loans Fund debt.</P>
    <P>As is the case at present, if there is a default by a mortgagor the local authority will be obliged to continue paying to the Local Loans Fund and pursue the debtor.</P>
    <P>If a local authority itself were to default, then the Local Loans Fund would be able, through its general powers, to enforce the debt.  This is no different to the present position where the Local Loans Fund can pursue a defaulting authority.  Of course, the possibility of a default by a local authority is largely theoretical; no local authority has ever defaulted on its debt to the fund and I do not anticipate that any ever will.</P>
    <P>Deputies can be assured that the reason I am dwelling on these points is because I do not wish there to be any misunderstanding of the position and I want to ensure that unfounded fears are not generated.  We are not disposing of mortgages; we are disposing of the proceeds of the mortgage loans, and there is a fundamental difference.</P>
    <P>I would make one further general point.  This scheme involves the sale of a State asset to the private sector.  In return for a lump sum payment of £140 million this year, the State sector will assign the loan repayments due to it from persons with mortgages financed by funds from the Local Loans Fund. These repayments are due under contract law to the State and this securitisation scheme involves the sale of the repayments.  In this, it is identical to a <Col N="677" /> sale of assets, via securitisation, by a private sector mortgage lender.</P>
    <P>I hope this securitisation scheme will act as a catalyst in the development of the securitisation market as a whole, with consequent benefits for both investors and borrowers.  In this instance, investors will be provided with a new investment alternative in the form of fixed rate bonds to be issued by the SPV.  For some time, institutions here have been channelling a significant portion of their resources abroad, citing the lack of suitable investment opportunities in Irish financial markets.  These bonds will provide a new investment opportunity for them.</P>
    <P>One of the major gaps in the Irish mortgage market has been the absence of long-term fixed rate mortgages for householders.  The lead which we are giving through the launch of this transaction should facilitate the development of a mortgage bond market.  In turn this should increase the availability of fixed rate mortgages.  This process will, of course, take some time; nevertheless a start has to be made.  Such a development would merely be following trends in the United States and Europe which have highly developed markets for mortgage backed securities.</P>
    <P>The Exchequer borrowing requirement will be unaffected, as the £140 million to be raised under the scheme in 1995 represents the balance between an original £60 million provision for equal treatment on budget day, and the £200 million which is actually being issued to the social insurance fund for this purpose.  While the current budget deficit will be higher, the capital deficit will be correspondingly lower than anticipated, because issues to the social insurance fund are treated as current expendituures in the <i>Estimates Volume,</i> but the proceeds of the scheme are classified as an Exchequer capital inflow.</P>
    <P>The general Government deficit will also be unaffected.  Under the accounting conventions from which this deficit is derived, on a standardised basis for each member state, loan and equity transactions are not counted as either <Col N="678" /> receipts or expenditures &mdash; these international conventions view such transactions as &ldquo;financial&rdquo; or balance sheet transactions.  It follows that the proceeds of this scheme will not appear on the revenue side of the general Government accounts.  However, the accounting conventions also provide that benefit payments should be treated as attributable to the year in which the liability was due &mdash; that is, on an accruals basis.  The primary benefit payments accrued due over the years 1985 to 1993, when the women concerned did not receive their full entitlements under the EU Equal Treatment Directive, and the benefit payments are thus spread back over these years, rather than recorded in the years in which they are actually being paid.  To present the full picture, I should add that the court also determined that in addition to the arrears of primary benefit due, the women were entitled to compensation for the delay in payment.  This latter element, which is calculated as representing some £65 million of the total £260 million liability, is not spread back. It is treated in the accounts as due in 1995 &mdash; the year in which it was determined by the court.</P>
    <P>There is a commitment by Government to limit expenditure increases to 6 per cent in 1995.  The exceptional £140 million being issued this year breaks that limit.  However, because of the Government's commitment to fiscal discipline, the once-off £140 million has been excluded from the base for the purpose of calculating the 2 per cent real increase for 1996.  If it were not excluded, the spending limit for 1996 would accordingly be increased by £146 million.</P>
    <P>In addition, I would draw attention to the provisions of section 2 of the Bill. That section provides that should a future Minister for Finance wish to fund expenditure by securitising more of the assets of the Local Loans Fund, the approval of the Dáil must be obtained. I would stress that I have no plans to approach the Dáil for this purpose.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="679" /> The Bill is designed to facilitate the development of this particular securitisation scheme.  Of necessity, because there is no precedent, we must make provisions for all eventualities and not be too restrictive.  However, we are being cautious and keeping tight control on the operation of the scheme.</P>
    <P>Section 1 of the Bill is a definitions and interpretation section.</P>
    <P>Section 2 specifies the purpose for which the provisions of the Bill can be brought into effect.  The immediate proposal is for the financing of part of the social welfare equality arrears payments.  As I do not wish to restrict freedom of action in the future I have also included provision that the Bill, if enacted, can be used for other purposes, but only with the approval of the Dáil. As I said earlier, this will act as an assurance that this scheme will not be abused or lead to a weakening of our commitment to our budgetary targets.</P>
    <P>Section 3 refers to the existing power under section 14 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1992, whereby a local authority, at the direction of the Minister for the Environment, shall transfer, sell or assign mortgages.  This power is now defined as including assignment of the debt secured by a mortgage and it is provided that such an assignment shall be deemed to be an equitable assignment.  The SPV will not have any right of enforcing the debt directly against the individual borrower.  There will be no circumstance in which the SPV can give notice to, pursue, or otherwise deal with the individual mortgagor.</P>
    <P>Section 4 gives the Minister for Finance the power to designate the body which will, in return for a lump sum, receive the assigned payments and to arrange for its management.  The management of this designated body is a function which will be delegated to the National Treasury Management Agency under section 12.  Provision is also made to allow the Minister to own a company as the designated body.  This provision, <Col N="680" /> while it will not be utilised for this securitisation, is included to ensure flexibility in the future should a Minister wish, or need, to establish a company for this purpose.</P>
    <P>The existing local loans fund legislation provides that the fund will have a lien on the general revenues of local authorities in respect of borrowings by the authorities from the fund.</P>
    <P>Section 5 excludes the amounts assigned by local authorities to the SPV from the general revenues for the purpose of that lien.  This provision ensures that these revenues are &ldquo;ring-fenced&rdquo; in favour of the SPV and that the Exchequer can have no call on them.</P>
    <P>Section 6 provides that any payments made by a local authority for the purposes of the Bill to a designated body will have the same effect as a payment directly to the local loans fund.  In this way there will be no change in the arrangement for making their biannual payments to the local loans fund.  The local authorities will make their payments, as at present, directly to the local loans fund.  It is only at that point that the allocation of payments due to the designated body will be made.</P>
    <P>Section 7 provides for a guarantee by the Minister for Finance of the amounts assigned by a local authority to the designated body.  The reason for this provision is that the SPV is barred from recourse to the mortgagor.  In a straight commercial securitisation, this recourse is the ultimate security for the bondholder.  In the absence of this recourse in the present case, the Bill provides for a Government guarantee as the ultimate security for the bond.</P>
    <P>Other sections deal with related matters, such as the tax treatment of the designated body and securities issued by it; delegation of powers to the National Treasury Management Agency; management of the assets and liabilities of a delegated body; provision of information by local authorities and expenses incurred by the Minister in the administration of the Bill.  The accounts of the designated body will, under <Col N="681" /> section 16, be audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General.</P>
    <P>I am sure Deputies will have much to say on this Bill.  This innovative scheme is designed so that there will be no change in the position of the mortgager or the local authority.  It is designed in effect to broaden and deepen our capital markets.  All Deputies, I am sure, are conscious of the need to observe the budgetary parameters, but, at the same time, meet the once-off costs of the social welfare equality payment arrears.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Fianna Fáil welcomed the Government's decision to pay the arrears due to many women on foot of the court decision regarding equal treatment.  This <Col N="682" /> issue has bedevilled many administrations for over a decade and, as a former Minister for Social Welfare, I am glad that this saga has come to an end.</P>
    <P>These payments arise from the 1979 EU directive on equal treatment and the decision of the High Court earlier this year that the terms of the directive must be implemented to the letter.  It is estimated that approximately 70,000 married women will receive back money as a result of this decision.</P>
    <P>This is not the appropriate occasion on which to revisit this episode &mdash; the delays on the part of successive administrations, the Irish High Court and European Court cases or the dramatic political aspects of events of almost a decade ago &mdash; suffice it to say that, the entire mess should be prescribed reading for any student of public administration and an abject lesson to any future administration on how not to go about implementing an EU directive.</P>
    <P>This saga has, unnecessarily, cost the taxpayer many millions of pounds.  This is not meant as a criticism of well meaning politicians and civil servants at the time; no one was trying to do anyone out of their just entitlements.  The merits or otherwise of this sorry mess are a matter for another day, but the spindoctoring by some politicians and by at least one political party is not <i>ad idem</i> with the facts.  The equal treatment directive is exceptionally complex and its complexity has inhibited proper debate.  As a result of some political posturing, the incorrect message has come across that the State is not honouring its responsibilities.  This saga is far more complex than that, but in the end many millions of taxpayers' money has been wasted unnecessarily.  What is now at issue is the method being used by the Government to make these payments.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister indicate the total cost involved to the Exchequer?  A sum of £260 million has been mentioned. The Government of which I was a member put over £20 million aside in each of the years, 1992, 1993 and 1994.  I calculate that the final figure will be between <Col N="683" /> £400 million and £500 million.  When the Government of 1983-87, of which the Minister, Deputy Quinn, was a member, tried to grapple with this problem in 1986 it was subjected to political pressure from this side of the House and its own backbenchers and came up with the idea of transitional arrangements.  If the EU directive on equal treatment had been implemented in full many social welfare recipients would have lost out while others would have gained because of the way adult dependant allowances etc., are calculated, but this was not an option the then Government could consider.</P>
    <P>On one famous night a former Minister and close friend of mine found himself in considerable difficulty in deciding which way to vote on a Private Members' motion dealing with this issue.  He finally voted with the Government.  It was these transitional arrangements which got us into this fine mess. As the Minister pointed out, I did away with those transitional arrangements finally in 1992, which comprised one of the &ldquo;dirty dozen&rdquo; cuts which became an issue in the general election of that year. My advice was that I would receive considerable political flak for doing so, yet, if I had not done so, that mess would have been carried forward, creating even more problems in 1993 and 1994. While they had been reduced over a period, no Minister seemed willing to finally bite the bullet.  While it may not be a matter of great interest to the House now nonetheless, despite questions tabled to the Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare in the last Government and the present Minister for Social Welfare, none of those decisions of mine was reversed.</P>
    <P>Although I do not recall the Minister for Finance criticising the issue of equal treatment, I object to the fact that since the overall complexity of this issue has been a minefield of legal actions and counteractions in Departments, there may be only ten people nationwide who understand all its legal complications and the reasons for losing certain court <Col N="684" /> cases.  For that reason it has been easy for certain political parties to give the impression that successive Governments had been deferring the payment of the arrears of equal treatment payments to married women, whereas the true position is far removed from that.</P>
    <P>It is dangerous for a Member on any side to refer to it as most people and the majority of politicians are unable to understand it, but the limited few who do know my portrayal of it to be correct. Nonetheless, the constant political charge being levelled &mdash; particularly this year when the good, shining white Minister for Social Welfare came along &mdash; was that these arrears had to be paid. The issue is not at all simple as portrayed.  It is not popular to say so because one risks being again criticised in the media for standing out against the matter.  It has been an unmitigated disaster because those funds of some £400 million to £500 million, instead of being paid to a small number of people, could have been allocated to general social welfare increases which might have been more advantageous to a greater number of people.</P>
    <P>My fear is that in future people will have forgotten what the issue was really about, when what may well be portrayed will be the fact that for a period of nine or ten years successive Govenments never faced up to the difficulty, but rather attempted to deprive married women of their just entitlements, whereas it is not as simple as that.</P>
    <P>Having accepted the court's ruling that sums in the region of £260 million should be payable by the Exchequer, the Government went about raising those funds in a strange manner.  The 1995 budget included an amount of £60 million for these arrears as it was assumed that their payment would be spread over four years.  I do not recall any objections to this proposal from any quarter but, presumably due to pressure on the part of the Minister for Social Welfare, the Government decided to pay another £140 million this year.</P>
    <P>I have no difficulty in accepting the Government's right to take the decision <Col N="685" /> to pay those arrears in one year but I reserve the right to question whether that was the most prudent policy.  I have strenuously objected to the Government, at the outset, endeavouring to delude the electorate on the method of financing those payments.  By sleight of hand the Government attempted &mdash; in all its publicity and press statements earlier this year &mdash; to create the illusion that the payment of £140 million would not break the 6 per cent increase in Government spending for 1995 as against 1994.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the Government attempted to create the illusion that the proposed method of financing the securitisation of part of the local loans fund would not break the Exchequer borrowing requirement &mdash; thus leading to illusion <i>versus</i> reality; they are very different but can often become clouded in the machinations of any Government. The illusion on the part of the Government was to attempt a form of creative accountancy to give the impression it was living within its own financial parameters outlined in A Government of Renewal.</P>
    <P>A little history lesson on how the local loans fund operated in its application to these types of mortgages will illustrate my point.  Until 1986 mortgages of that kind were advanced by local authorities.  Money would be advanced to the local loans fund by Government borrowing; a certain sum by way of loan, at an appropriate interest rate, being allocated to each individual authority, dependent on demand; an individual borrower would obtain a loan from the relevant local authority at a rate of interest equivalent to the rate at which the tranche was borrowed by the local authority from the local loans fund, plus a small excess to cover administration costs.</P>
    <P>The reverse procedure applied to repayments, the borrower repaid the local authority and the latter remitted the sums periodically to the local loans fund.</P>
    <P>To follow that repayment procedure to its logical conclusion, if part of the <Col N="686" /> local loans fund is to be securitised and an SPV created, as the Minister pointed out, that involves a change in how it will affect Government borrowing.  Before this proposal, the funds received from all local authorities on foot of repayments to the local loans fund and on foot of repayments of individual borrowers would have led to the fund being set off against the original amount borrowed and would have been shown in the national accounts as a capital receipt.  Henceforth this proportion of income to be paid into the SPV will not appear as a capital receipt.  Therefore, as my mathematics teacher in Gormanston College used say, there is a change there.</P>
    <P>I have no objection in principle to securitisation of the mortgage book relating to these loans but it is not correct to state, as the Government did earlier this year, that this had no effect on its own self-imposed financial criteria.  As my earlier example will have shown, the Government has now decided to sell off a future income stream to obtain capital to pay for current expenditure.  This nonsense was the essence of the economics of self-delusion practised by all Administrations in the 1970s and 1980s until 1987.  The money raised by securitisation of these mortgages should not be used to pay these equal treatment arrears, the latter being deferred current expenditure.</P>
    <P>My antipathy to the foregoing style of economics is well recorded in the public domain, my objections are not deep-rooted in any ideology but are purely pragmatic; it never worked in any economy and the long-term problems created were greater than any short-term gains, even political gains.</P>
    <P>Yes, the equality treatment arrears must be paid; yes, the Government is within its rights to take the decision of paying those arrears in one year; yes, there is nothing wrong in the principle of securitisation of the local loans fund, but not for this purpose.  The Government is not within its right to attempt to delude the electorate and certainly has <Col N="687" /> no right to use long-term capital to finance current expenditure.  The hard facts are that the public finances were in order at the beginning of this year.  As we can all acknowledge, the Fianna Fáil-led Administration left our economy and national finances in fine fettle at the end of 1994 when confidence throughout the country was high and things generally improving.</P>
    <P>The firm public financial control of the previous Administration, under the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Bertie Ahern, was set aside by that first, major decision of the new Government on the payment of equal treatment arrears.  The hand on the steering wheel clearly began to slip early in the year and has been slipping ever since.</P>
    <P>There is a direct correlation between lower public expenditure and taxation reform.  There is no point in advancing grandiose schemes in areas of public policy costing millions of pounds and, in the same breath, advising the electorate that taxes will be cut, the electorate know that controlling public expenditure is a necessary prerequisite to lower taxation.  This is why I am particularly scathing of the present Government which has let off the brakes on public expenditure.  The real increase in the cost of public services in 1995 over 1994, comparing like with like, is of the order of 10 per cent plus.</P>
    <P>From day one of our current period in Opposition, I and my party colleagues have highlighted the mistake of returning to the bad old days of budget deficits.  The Government did not listen. Ministers only began to take notice when the annual OECD survey on the Irish economy hit their desks with a resounding thud during the summer. The OECD survey stated that the economy &ldquo;continues to face high levels of public debt and unemployment... tighter control on public expenditure appears to be necessary in order to sustain progress in reducing the debt to GDP ratio as specified in the Maastricht Treaty and to make room for a further reduction in the tax burden&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="688" /> It is amazing that the Government had to wait for the OECD survey before taking notice of lax controls on public spending.  It did not need an outside body to tell it what the Opposition and independent economists had been stating for months.</P>
    <P>Good economic management is hard to find, and it was many years before any administration succeeded in doing so.  The question now is why it was lost so quickly.  Perhaps old left wing socialist reasoning dies hard, notwithstanding the economic lessons of the past 20 years and the failure of socialist driven economies world-wide.  There is always a hankering for the good old socialist rhetoric of the 1960s and 1970s among the left wing parties of this Dáil.</P>
    <P>Within two months of assuming office the Government decided to breach by a huge margin its public expenditure limits as set out in its programme for renewal.  It is difficult to understand why budget decisions were so suddenly relaxed.  The breaching of expenditure limits is grossly irresponsible.  It undermines the credibility of Irish financial policy by putting a question mark over the ability of the Government to stick to limits set by it.  Increasing expenditure and borrowing also reduces the scope for relieving the tax burden in years to come.  The Government's priority has been to maintain the scope for spending increases, with tax relief coming a very poor second.</P>
    <P>The priority accorded by the Government to the plight of thousands of long-term unemployed has come too late. The recent news of the establishment of a task force on the long-term unemployed is yet another case of proposals and publicity over substance.</P>
    <P>A massive slice of our community are caught in a poverty trap.  Only now is the Government slowly turning its attention to those caught in almost inescapable poverty.  Apparently it will consider tax incentives and employer subsidies among a series of proposals to be examined by another newly established task force.  There are so many Government task forces that an association of <Col N="689" /> task forces should be the next step; Croke Park is the only venue which would accommodate such large numbers.  Perhaps these task force members could be joined in an annual jamboree by all the members of State boards, agencies and the many other quangos. Committees used to be the salvation of any Government or Minister in difficulties; now the buzz word is &ldquo;task force&rdquo;. I confess that the administration of which I was a member was not behind the door in establishing task forces, but I am tired of them.  Perhaps Deputy Rabbitte could be entrusted with the job of coming up with a name other than &ldquo;committee&rdquo; and &ldquo;task force.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The proposals emanating from the task forces cost money, and these proposed costs fly directly in the face of the plaintive call from the Minister for Finance for cuts of the order of £630 million in Estimates already submitted by Government Departments.</P>
    <P>Despite calls from many Ministers to the Minister for Finance for funds, it is critical that this administration should get back to a sound financial strategy and stick to the Maastricht criteria.  The targets set out in the Government's programme of renewal for increased spending and inflation of 2 per cent plus are too generous.  In this period of good economic growth, there is a strong case to be made for financial prudence.  Any faltering on the Maastricht route will affect Ireland's chances of gaining entry to the European Monetary Union at the first entry date.  However, I have no confidence that the Government will manage the public finances, and this Bill will remain a legacy of its financial incompetence.</P>

      <P>The Progressive Democrats have no objection in principle to the enactment of legislation which would permit the Government to realise now the discounted value of future cash flows which are secured on assets such as housing.  It is, when boiled down, an exercise in asset management. Any large institution faced with immediate requirements for capital would be wise to consider disposing of future cash flows.</P>
      <P>The problem with this Bill, however, is not that what is proposed in its text is wrong in principle but that its practical effect will be to convert a capital asset in the hands of the State into liquid cash in order to defray what is in effect an accumulation of unpaid current expenditure.</P>
      <P>The sum of £260 million which the State is now liable to pay to married women by reason of our failure to obey the laws of the European Union is an enormous amount.  It ought never to have accumulated.  If the Department of Social Welfare had been properly administered and advised, this huge bill to the taxpayer would never have accumulated.  These arrears could and should have been paid over many years as current spending.  We should have made provision for such payments within the Estimate of the Department of Social Welfare on an annual basis. Given that we have no option but to pay the moneys which, as a matter of European Union law we owe, the question which arises is whether it is right for a Government to liquidate capital or to borrow against future revenues to defray accumulated current expenditure liabilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is the view of the Progressive Democrats that we should not be facing this dilemma, but given that we do face such a huge bill we ought to have paid the amounts in, say, five instalments as a current liability funded by current receipts.  Securitising mortgage payments is no more sensible a means of <Col N="691" /> defraying current expenditure liabilities than, say, using the proceeds of the privatisation of Telecom Éireann, Aer Lingus, or the ACC Bank for that purpose.</P>
    <P>If this principle is now established, can we expect a sale of further assets to pay, for example, for future unexpected current liabilities, an example of which would be the fines which the European Commission proposes to impose on this State because of the incompetence of the Department of Agriculture in managing and supervising the intervention system?  What will be sold to pay those fines which are proposed at approximately £110 million?  It is wrong to use capital disposals to fund current spending.  There is no essential difference between borrowing to pay for current spending and selling assets to pay for it, especially when our national debt is approximately £30 billion and is growing at the rate of £1 billion per year.</P>
    <P>While the Progressive Democrats Party has no objection in principle to a Bill which is designed to enable the State to discount and capitalise future cash flows into the Exchequer, we should have no illusions about the propriety of the motives which lie behind this measure.  Ireland is disinvesting capital assets to pay what are in essence current expenditure liabilities.  If these assets in the form of future loan repayments were being realised either (a) to repay debts or (b) to reinvest in a genuine capital investment there could be no principled objection, although some might argue that debt repayment makes more sense than many of the so-called capital projects now undertaken by the State.</P>
    <P>As originally proposed, this centre left coalition defended the sale of State assets on the grounds that the purchaser could be a semi-State body.  The National Treasury Management Agency or the Housing Finance Agency were mentioned in this context.  One of these bodies was to borrow the purchase price of the loan portfolio from the banks. The excuse offered for this transaction <Col N="692" /> was, on the face of it, ludicrous.  If the State borrowed the money directly from the banks it would show up in the Exchequer borrowing requirement figures.  By using a semi-State agency such as the National Treasury Management Agency or the Housing Finance Agency the borrowings would not be counted in the EBR but would only appear in the less sensitive public sector borrowing requirement.  This sleight of hand economics fools nobody but it would have permitted the Minister to disguise public indebtedness as semi-State indebtedness.  This House should reject such cosmetic accounting practices.  If the Government proposes to sell off future cash flows it should sell them to the private sector directly and up front.  If a State guarantee is needed so be it but there was never any excuse for disguising what is happening here.</P>
    <P>Given our huge protfolio of capital assets, some profitable, others loss making, some valuable and others worthless, it is remarkable that alone of the economies west of the Urals we behave as if we belong to COMECON, the former Iron Curtain economic pact.  Our Government, thanks in particular to the presence of the Labour Party, stands alone in the OECD countries as being unwilling to divest public ownership and control over transport, communications, ports, airports, banks, broadcasting, oil refining, energy production and transmission.  We have a Government with a Warsaw pact economic mentality in office.  The Tánaiste, Deputy Spring, and the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa, would put the reformed communists of Eastern Europe to shame for their revisionism.  We have full-blooded no nonsense socialists in control whose desired political constituency is apparently a cohort of grey faced apparatchiks of the State and semi-State.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, poses as a somewhat reconstructed house trained socialist and we are told that the &ldquo;Ho Chi Quinn&rdquo; days are gone, while the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, Deputy Lowry, poses as a reformer of <Col N="693" /> the semi-State sector.  Even by their own standards, they have achieved very little reform.  The only recent transaction which vaguely resembles privatisation is the proposed sale of Irish Steel which is only being &ldquo;sold&rdquo; with a huge golden hand shake because it has negative work in accounting terms.  For the left of centre Government, Irish Steel has become more embarrassing to own than to sell.</P>
    <P>It is abundantly clear that the Govenrment has neither strategy nor commitment in relation to the management of State owned assets.  On the contrary, it is driven by a political imperative to keep the red flag flying over the commanding heights of the economy.  It is a sad reflection in an economy which is crying out for major strategic change that the only proposal put before the Dáil for the management of the State's assets is one which proposes to convert the capital asset of future cash flow into liquid form for the purpose of paying current liabilities.  Sadly, that is the measure of the Government's collective incompetence and confusion.</P>

      <P>I listened to the debate from the beginning on the monitor as this is probably the only time we will have the opportunity to discuss under an obscure heading the biggest pay out in the history of the State for married women who stayed at home for medical reasons.  The reasons put forward by many people for not paying this money are astonishing.  Deputy McCreevy said the money should not have been paid because the legislation is too complex and is only understood by ten people.  If the Deputy had received the phone calls I received over the past year he would know that virtually all the women who are owed the money fully understand what happened, and this despite the attempts by Fianna Fáil to confuse people so that they would not understand.

    <P>The local loans fund is the ideal way of ensuring that the 70,000 women denied these entitlements for the past ten years are paid their money.

As the method used for giving the loan in the first instance cannot be altered this is an ideal way to pay the money.

      <P>I have heard people say that it is impossible to understand the issue but the organisation in Cork, Married Women for Equality, played a greater part in educating others about this than any politician.  These ordinary women set about informing themselves on EU legislation and European Court decisions.  They did not keep the information to themselves but disseminated it to other women throughout the country.  This morning a woman from Cavan rang me inquiring whether she was entitled to this money.

      <P>Deputy Lynch referred to a woman from my constituency of Cavan-Monaghan ringing her. Perhaps she will be able to help me with regard to another woman who when she inquired what she should do was told that she should go to a solicitor in Cork <Col N="697" />&mdash; a long way from Cavan-Monaghan. Having done that, she rang the Department of Social Welfare to ask when the arrears might be paid but she was told that she could not be paid when she was consulting a solicitor in Cork.  I would like Deputy Lynch to talk to the Leader of her party and ask him to get rid of this nonsense and ensure that people are paid.  This happened in the past week and I have tabled a Parliamentary Question on it to be answered next week.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Lynch that few are offering to speak but I would have thought that the Leader of Democratic Left, as Minister for Social Welfare, would speak on this Bill.  He made a great fuss about this issue when in Opposition but he might explain why he is appealing a somewhat similar case to the courts in regard to people with disabilities.  If he believes it is right for women to be paid their arrears &mdash; and we all agree with that &mdash; how can he take a directly opposing view with regard to people with a disability?</P>
      <P>This Bill arises from the 1978 EU decision on equal treatment for women. The money should have been paid by 1984 but that did not happen.  Following a series of court cases a decision was made on 3 February 1995 and the Government decided to pay the arrears forthwith.  We fully support that decision.  It is grossly unfair that a Member should claim that the Opposition had suggested the payment should be delayed or should not be made.  Our party is very particular that the money should be paid as a matter of urgency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The difficulty I have with this Bill is that I believe the Minister could have taken a different route.  The point has been well made this morning that we should not sell off a capital asset to pay a current account.  Deputy Lynch takes an alternative view and thinks it is an ideal way to fund it.  I do not think it is necessary to sell off a capital asset.  We do not have the right to sell off capital assets to pay current bills.  If we have to sell off capital assets, the proceeds should be used to pay some of the <Col N="698" /> national debt.  In a year when the economy is buoyant surely funds could be found in some other way.</P>
    <P>During the budget debate we pointed out that we did not agree with the course the Government proposed to take.  It inherited a surplus of £15 million but it budgeted for a £310 million deficit.  We believed it was wrong and that the Government should have lived within the 4.5 per cent increase in expenditure outlined by the Fianna Fáil Party Leader, Deputy Bertie Ahern, when he was Minister for Finance.  It was not prudent to increase expenditure by 6 per cent, particularly when the Government had inherited a budget surplus and a buoyant economy.  We have all seen what happened between 1982 and 1986 when the national debt doubled from £12.5 billion to £25 billion and borrowing was at an unprecedented level.  Unemployment almost doubled in those years and this is a path we certainly want to avoid.  Since 1987 all Governments have made an effort to control public finances.  It is important this Government does likewise.  The Minister stated this decision would not increase the Exchequer borrowing rate, but it will increase the public sector borrowing rate.  Will the Minister deal with that matter in his reply?  It will increase the budget deficit and break the 6 per cent limit the Government set for itself, which was too high in the first place.</P>
    <P>We take credit for the buoyant economy because of what we did from 1987 onwards.  When the economy is buoyant there should be no borrowing or budget deficit.  The time has come to make an effort to pay off our national debt.  The money raised as a result of this legislation should go towards reducing that debt.  We owe that to the public.  While the equal treatment payments should be made, in a buoyant economy the Minister should have been able to come up with the money to pay them.  The seeds of this difficulty were set in the budget.</P>
    <P>We should make an effort to pay off our national debt because the Minister for Finance at the time of the next <Col N="699" /> downturn in the economy &mdash; the economy works in cycles &mdash; will experience great difficulties.  I hope we will not have to face that downturn for a long time.  We must also provide for the difficulties we will face in 1999 when only part, or perhaps none, of the country will be given Objective One status.  That is another reason for tightly controlling our finances and we should be prudent in managing our finances when the economy is booming.</P>
    <P>It is wrong that under the legislation we will make current account payments from a capital asset.  We are spending approximately £2.5 billion to service our national debt, approximately ten times that spent on our county roads annually and much more than we spend annually on our health and education services. As that is an enormous amount of money, the matter should be addressed. We do not have a right to provide a level of public service for this generation and make our children foot the bill.  The Government has a major responsibility in this regard.  While the Minister indicated he will not do so, under section 2 the Minister for Finance can come back to the Dáil with another proposal in this regard.  I hope if that happens the proposal will not involve the funding of current spending.  We must get away from that.</P>
    <P>In the past few days I tabled a parliamentary question to each Minister requesting the amount of the reduction in public spending in their Departments as a result of the Government decision announced by the Minister of Finance on 8 June 1995, the number of new posts established in their Departments and agencies under the aegis of their Departments and asking them to make a statement on the matter.  Three or four Ministers answered the questions asked but the majority did not.  The reply from the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications is typical of most others.  He stated:</P>
    <P>The purpose of the Government announcement was to stabilise staff <Col N="700" /> numbers and this has been achieved in my Department.  While public expenditure levels are always under scrutiny, it is not possible to attribute any specific reductions in such expenditure to the Government announcement referred to by the Deputy.</P>
    <P>That does not answer my question or give any useful information.  For a Government that promised openness and transparency, it is not appropriate to answer a parliamentary question in that manner.  We are entitled to more useful information.  Approximately 15 per cent of Ministers answered the question asked and the others waffled around it.  That is not good enough. There was a reference on the Order of Business to information not available to Members appearing in the newspapers. It is in the interest of all Members that useful information is made available.</P>
    <P>I sympathise with the Minister.  In the past we had two-party coalition Governments under which it was difficult to operate.</P>

      <P>There is no difficulty with one party Governments.  Good minority Fianna Fáil Governments performed extremely well.  We have not had a coalition Government with more than two parties since 1947.  I sympathise with the Minister on having Democratic Left in Government.  Three parties, with different ideologies, in Government make the task almost impossible.  It will be interesting &mdash; I hope we will all be alive &mdash; to read the debate on this legislation in 30 years' time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>It is regrettable that Deputy Lynch has left the House.  She indicated that Members were not coming in to speak on this Bill.  That is not the fault of the Opposition as we want to speak on this important legislation. While it deals with the equality payments, it adopts a new approach to the <Col N="701" /> area of securitisation, a new and developing issue.  We may be one of the first in Europe to go down this road.  It is disappointing, therefore, that the Government does not have speakers to contribute.</P>
      <P>In spite of what Deputy Lynch stated, the Minister accepts that we do not object to making equality payments. Deputy McCreevy, who is very know-ledgable on this matter, outlined the sequence of events in this sorry saga.  On principle, the payments should be made. The Minister will recall that when this issue arose prior to the budget and the question of the local loans fund began to get currency, I indicated that in spite of statements by the Government these payments should have been made over three or four years.  Those due the payments did not pressure the Government into making immediate payments or threaten that it would face enormous difficulties if it did not do so.  Time will prove that the Minister was wrong to use this issue to put himself on a pedestal.  Apart from those in Cork who pursued the matter and will follow this debate there is not much public interest in it.  People see this as a windfall.</P>
      <P>We are taking a capital asset and using it for current expenditure due.  It is wrong to create such a precedent. Future Governments will cite this as an opt out clause if serious problems arise in the context of current expenditure.  It is an undesirable development.  There are many State capital assets which could be used in an imaginative way. Privatisation was the only way mentioned for many years and I supported that, but I have broadened my view and see the possibilities of a mix between public and private.  Rather than let State assets lie dormant we should look for imaginative ways to create new structures and capital investments within the State system that may in years ahead create a current stream themselves.  This is important in a State such as ours with a relatively small economy in international terms and few natural resources.  I welcome the option of securitisation as a possible way forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="702" /> As regards the equal treatment payments, we are conveying an image to the public that the Government is picking up the tab and it will not affect the taxpayer.  The reality is the taxpayer will pick up the tab.  There is nothing wrong with that in principle but I object to the way in which this matter is being handled.  It is only through our combined contributions that we will continue to develop a competitive economy, efficiency in the work place and high living standards.  The message must go out to the unemployed and others that, no matter how minimal the contribution, it is important that it be made.  I object to the Minister's sleight of hand in dealing with this issue and the portrayal of the Government as being able to accomplish this with no costs attached when what is involved is a transfer of money from those who pay taxes to those who are due equality payments. The tragedy of dealing with the issue in this way is that the State loses an income stream over the next few years and an opportunity to use the fund for capital investment.  I object to the use of capital assets for current expenditure.</P>
    <P>The cutbacks demanded by the Government have been well handled by the Government PR team.  People say the Government is under great pressure and ask where it will save £640 million. In preparing the Estimates Ministers were over-zealous in their demands and the Minister for Finance rightly said that the spending requirements put forward were out of court and could not be tolerated.  They were beyond the 2 per cent increase in real terms for 1996 which the Minister spoke about.  However, the issue was portrayed as if the Government was struggling to cut back and save £640 million.  It is not saving £640 million but cutting back the demands made for excessive expenditure.</P>
    <P>In the past Governments made severe cutbacks in the interests of the economy.  That was real and painful and we suffered in our constituencies as a result.  It is disingenuous to suggest, when the economy is booming, that <Col N="703" /> what this Government is doing is similar.</P>
    <P>It is simply greed on behalf of many Minister who, if given the opportunity, would squander the fruits of the last few years and therefore when conditions demand that we prime the economy we would not be in as good a position to borrow.  In view of the fact that the economy is doing so well, as is evident from yesterday's figures, we certainly do not need to borrow now.  I am sure the Minister is happy, as we all are, that the economy is doing well.  However that is not as a result of this year's budget but of good government in the last five or six years.  It takes 18 months or two years to see the effects of a budget and of decisions taken in the Department of Finance on changes in fiscal policy.  We are now seeing the real benefits of the work of our party Leader, Deputy Ahern, as Minister for Finance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Minister will be successful in ensuring the maximum allowable increase is 2 per cent in real terms, taking into account the original figure of 6 per cent rather than the increased figure.  That would make a substantial contribution to the development of the economy.  I am not satisfied with the level of spending this year and the fact that the limit has been exceeded, something the Government has endeavoured to conceal.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer to a point in the context of the Maastricht Treaty and European Monetary Union.  As a result of our approach to the Maastricht Treaty it is not anticipated that the conditions pertaining in the Irish economy and generally in the European economy, which are very favourable, will change very much in the next few years.  This week in France the new government faced difficulties in regard to European Monetary Union.  It hopes to get the French franc back on track so that it will be in a position to join the European Monetary Union, and that is welcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="704" /> In anticipating that circumstances in 1999 will be similar to those at present, Ireland should make it clear that, irrespective of what Britain does, it will be among the first countries to join the European Monetary Union.  The Government should have the courage to say to Irish business that since we have been involved in Europe for many years and are committed Europeans, we will be among the first countries to join. That would give industry three or four years to prepare.  It could consider options that would be available at that time, where it would buy raw materials, future markets and so on.  It could make decisions that will minimise whatever effects may result from Britain not joining the European Monetary Union. From attending seminars and from talking to people recently, I am aware that clarity in that regard is required.</P>
    <P>I have raised this question with the Minister during Question Time, and I am sure IBEC, the unions and business would agree that a national forum should be set up to consider this matter. Another speaker referred to task forces, but there is certainly need for a forum involving Irish industry, business, agriculture, trade unions, Government and Opposition who would discuss this issue and tease out the difficulties.  Leadership will be required.  A much more dangerous strategy would be to wait until 1999 to make a decision on the matter.  The opportunity to plan is now available to companies.</P>
    <P>I do not know the Minister's view on this issue but I suspect that the effects of Britain not joining the European Monetary Union are not as great as some might like us to believe.  Some people are putting pressure on Government to postpone making a decision in principle, but those people have other agendas.  There should be a response now on this matter, and if something dramatic happens in two or three years' time we will consider the matter further at that stage.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the matter of Structural Funds raised this morning by my colleague, Deputy O'Hanlon, on which <Col N="705" /> I take a slightly different view.  I have a copy of the very interesting speech made by the Commissioner on this matter last week, in which she spoke about Ireland's future in the CSF.  I have no doubt that post-1999 Ireland will be the recipient of EU funds.  We should stop saying that we will no longer be entitled to funds; we will receive aid under many headings, and it is time this House put out that message.  We are damaging our cause by saying otherwise.  I accept there may be substantial changes in the allocation of money, but the Cohesion Fund may be enhanced post-1999.</P>
    <P>Developments may take place in the next few years and it should not be suggested that we will experience a huge problem.  Some problems may arise but we should concentrate on the opportunities that will result from a further programme of funding between 1999 and 2005.  The European Monetary Institute recently issued a statement about making definite commitments in the run-up to 1999.  In 2003 there will be a change in all sovereign currencies.  The European Union must ensure that countries such as Ireland reach the standards required to make sure the Union works. It will not work if decisions are made that will disadvantage some countries.  It is important to put across the message that EU funding will not be discontinued in 1999; it will most certainly continue.  The Minister has a responsibility in that regard.  I hope he listened to what I said.  Something should be done to put across those messages and I am interested in the Minister's views on that.  It is time we had a debate in the House on Europe, the Structural Funds and monetary union and it would be most useful.</P>

      <P>It is highly amusing that Deputy Cullen, a member of the Fianna Fáil party, a former member of the Progressive Democrats Party should talk about his concern about trends in public expenditure since public finances began to run out of control again during the period those parties were in Government together.  It is only in the <Col N="706" /> past year or two and under the present Minister for Finance that we have brought them under control; at least the trajectory is in the right direction.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>Deputy Cullen may not agree, but the facts prove it.  During the period when the Progressive Democrats were in Government with Fianna Fáil, the two parties with which he has been associated most recently, growth in public expenditure resumed.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say that.  I did not suggest we wanted to be disadvantaged.  I said we are entitled to play our full role in Europe.  The Deputy should not misquote me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy is as good at listening as he is at talking he will learn something.  The Deputy argued in support of an attitude that would lead us to continue to depend on subsidies and grants from the coffers of Europe.  The reality is that Cohesion Funds have been voted to us to help us attain a standard of living equivalent to the European average.  The average <i>per capita</i> income is hovering at about 80 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should also be aware of the average household income here.  It is now 95 per cent of the average in Europe, 1 per cent behind the UK.  As the decline in the birth rate leads to a fall in the population, <i>per capita</i> income will increase regardless of any increase in wealth.  We will not, nor should we, readily seek grants.  Our main objective should be to create wealth under our own steam to <Col N="707" /> provide a standard of living for all our people comparable to the best standard in the other 14 member states of the European Union.  We should realise that the grants are available to assist us in attaining that standard where the momentum is such that we will create our own wealth to provide a standard of living comparable to the best in the European continent.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The main way to achieve that is to increase employment. It is heartening that jobs are coming onstream now although not in sufficient numbers.  Not only does the labour force survey indicate that, but the evidence on the ground supports it.  I was delighted to attend a recent meeting in Bally-fermot during which officials in FÁS told me the placement rate was such that they needed additional trainees.  If we can break through the barrier preventing us using economic growth to substantially reduce the numbers on the unemployment register, we will be on to a good thing.  We have had a low inflation rate for ten years and we have had the lowest interest rates in the European Union for a long time.  We have had a balance of trade surplus for ten years and a balance of payments surplus for nine years.  Mortgage interest rates are low and except for the level of unemployment economic indicators are favourable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been progress in recent budgets in dealing with the poverty trap and tax on employment.  I hope the Minister for Finance will be able to do more next year than he did last year to reduce taxes on employment but that may involve sacrifices.  Because of my absolute committment to reducing tax on employment &mdash; the present position is preventing economic growth from being turned into jobs &mdash; I favour the retention and extension of the property tax. If we are honest, we will admit that we <Col N="708" /> overtax everything dynamic and undertax everything static.  Tax on property is one of the least avoidable taxes. The present property tax discriminates against a certain category of people and property owners in Dublin where property values are higher but we should not throw the baby out with the bath water because aspects of the property tax are unfair.  We should reform and extend property tax on the basis that any increased amount raised will be directly and proportionately offset against income tax, PRSI or both.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Cullen regarding his support for our continued determination to be part of the European Monetary Union.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>My point is relevant. One of the criteria for joining the European Monetary Union is the reduction of our debt-GNP ratio to 60 per cent.  I agree that we should continue to pursue a policy of joining the European Monetary Union while acknowledging that such membership may pose problems for us in the UK market even assuming that the Labour Party in Britain when it comes to power &mdash; which I believe is inevitable &mdash; will not embrace the idea of European Monetary Union.  It would be easier for us if the Labour Party comes to power in Britain in the next few years and if it was more pro-European than the present Government and decided to join the European Monetary Union.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was heartened to read in a newsletter on what is happening in Europe that 90 per cent of British business want Britain to stay in Europe and a high percentage favour it joining the European Monetary Union.  However, we must plan on the basis that it is more likely that if and when European Monetary Union becomes a reality Britain will not join it.  That would cause problems for us but at least we have a lead-in time to make preparations to cope with that and <Col N="709" /> to ensure that our joining the European Monetary Union will not disrupt the economy.  That will require a continuation of the existing disciplines if not a further tightening of them.</P>
    <P>I hope the concerns expressed by Mr. Attley and Mr. Somers of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions which are casting doubt on a further national agreement can be addressed and that the much improved industrial relations atmosphere which is so helpful to the economic well-being of this country will continue beyond next year.  One of the criteria for our joining European Monetary Union is that we would get down to a debt-GNP ratio of 60 per cent.  In recent years and months certain questions have been raised about the veracity of our national statistics.  Some people query whether the economic growth figures are true, if the unemployment register is a true indicator of unemployment and whether our trade surplus, as reported, is accurate. Although statistics cannot be absolutely precise, are they as accurate &mdash; plus or minus a reasonable percentage &mdash; as they should be?</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Acting Chairman Acting Chairman">
      <NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very difficult to relate the Deputy's remarks to the Bill before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is relevant to the national debt.  Is there a question mark about other economic indicators? If so, there is also a question mark about the true level of the national debt as highlighted by this Bill.  Here the State borrows money to pass it on to mortgage holders but the Bill proposes only to use a portion of the mortgages lent to fund the social welfare equality payments.  The Minister may want to go further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To get an accurate measure of our national debt, as compared with other countries, we should compare like with like.  For example, the UK, with which we are most familiar, has sold off a great number of its State companies and the money raised reduced the level of borrowing there.  The level of borrowing as <Col N="710" /> represented in the UK seems much lower than ours.  Yet, we still have in State ownership the greater part of what was the State empire.  We have only disposed of a small number of State companies.</P>
    <P>I raised the question before as to whether, without selling off State assets, it would be reasonable to put a value on those assets and offset them against the national debt to get a more accurate picture for comparison purposes.  I will be interested to hear the Minister's observations on that.  If that is a reasonable course of action, we may be nearer the target of 60 per cent than we realise.  If we are to write off a portion of State assets to make the social welfare equality payments, without increasing the national debt, what is wrong with using the value of all our State assets to reduce the national debt?  In reality the State is only a vehicle, it is not the true borrower.  Should loans by the Irish Permanent Building Society, Irish Nationwide or the First National Building Society be included in the national debt?  Of course not.  Similarly, lending by local authorities, through the local loans fund, should not be part of the national debt because it distorts and exaggerates the level of national debt.</P>
    <P>Some people accuse the Government of creative accountability but whoever thought up this means of paying the once off bill of equality payments deserves to be commended.  It helps us also to address the true level of our national debt when we discount the value of assets that we still retain, assets which have already been sold by some member states in the European Union.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>We on this side of the House have no problem with the Government ensuring it is able to meet its legal responsibility in making equality payments and dealing with the sorry saga of equality arrears.  Clearly this should have been done in the mid-1980s and we would not have to deal with the problem that confronts us today in finding large sums of money which, if paid over 14 or 15 years, would <Col N="711" /> not have had a significant effect on current expenditure.  It would have avoided the legal wrangle and some of the pain associated with it for the people who have to wait so long for the Government to discharge its responsibility.  The principle of ensuring that these payments are met, as quickly as possible, is not argued.</P>
      <P>The second question concerns securitisation.  I have no difficulty with the principle of securitisation.  As a former Minister of State at the Department of Energy, with special responsibility for forestry, I was astonished that the forestry service had a policy for over 50 years of not disposing of any property. It would be obvious to anybody looking at the landscape, particularly land in the ownership of the forestry services, that there were tracts of land close to urban settlements which could be extremely valuable for alternative purposes.  I saw to it that policy was changed.  The one proviso missing from this Bill is that the resources from disposal of assets should be used either to pay off a part of the national debt or to reinvest in capital expenditure.  In the case to which I have referred, it was easy to go out to different regions and purchase ten times, 15 times, 20 times the land space for the funds.  Asset management, how the Government approaches what it owns, a sensible approach to disposal and reinvestment are not issues we argue against on this side of the House.</P>
      <P>While I was Minister of State at the Department of Energy, the shares in Tara were disposed of in circumstances in which we had not received any significant return from State investment, mainly because international companies are able to do their accounting, their reinvestment and so on in a way which makes it difficult to leave the surplus available to meet the State's requirements and a natural return for the shares.  In that case funds were directed to reinvestment in alternative energy security areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="712" /> We would argue with the Minister in regard to the main thrust of securitisation and the idea of having funds to meet equality payments.  Following many years of prudent management of the State finances where we continued to have a surplus in our balance of payments &mdash; increased exports, income, tax receipts and an overall improvement in buoyancy &mdash; and having had, over six or seven years a variety of different Governments, comprising different parties but headed by Fianna Fáil, which had equal commitment to managing the State's finances, we produced that situation but this year the successful tradition of ensuring the funds raised by the disposal of State assets do not go towards current expenditure appears to have been broken.  The Minister must explain more fully why he has taken this move this year to meet current expenditure.</P>
    <P>Could it be possible that the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa, was so anxious to deal with the matter he was happy to live with the paltry increase granted to old age pensioners, the lowest in 30 years, provided he got his way?  This is despite the fact that the Minister for Finance did not see how he could meet the outstanding payments in one year and may have preferred to deal with it over a number of years, thereby ensuring it would not be necessary to sell the family silver to meet the payments.</P>
    <P>Even in those circumstances, why did the Minister not take the route of the Housing Finance Agency?  The Minister will recall two provisions in the Housing Act, 1992, one of which foresaw the securitisation of local authority housing mortgages as a potential source of income for future investment and how private Irish financial institutions could be involved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>We could argue the point but, having served with the Minister in Government, I would prefer if we did not play around with figures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="713" /> Members with business experience are aware that if one owes money, it is possible by a sleight of hand to produce a scenario where, even though one owes the amount, it can be paid by somebody else or figures can show one does not owe it.  The principle of economics is that we are all in the ship together, irrespective of whether it is Government or semi-State borrowing.</P>
    <P>It would be as easy to present the exact position to the public, rather than trying to persuade ordinary taxpayers that the figures for public sector or State borrowing look better because amounts have been transferred to other areas.  It is still State borrowing.  The Bill is more cumbersome and may be more expensive in the long run.  Guarantees have been given to the mortgage holders and it is claimed there will be no effect on local authority finances.  However, will that be the position in the future?  The Housing Finance Agency may have been a better route.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell tried to present a scenario where the national debt could appear less than it is often portrayed.  It would be extremely serious if a Minister for Finance took any heed of that argument.  A sum of £2.5 billion must be found just to pay the interest on the loans.  The National Treasury Management Agency has done fantastic work in recent years in managing the debt.  It has been instrumental in making significant savings for the State.  It has been fast off the mark in understanding the trends of international markets and this has made the task of successive Ministers easier.</P>
    <P>However, it would be extremely serious to consider the national debt as anything other than a burden of astronomical proportions on the taxpayer and a major concern for Governments. It would be dangerous to play around with figures or suggest moves just because there is capital ownership of certain items from which loans are made.</P>
    <P>Economists in the early 1970s said borrowing was the solution to high inflation.  When the second oil crisis struck in 1979, economists again said the <Col N="714" /> solution to high inflation and cost increases was borrowing.  I shudder at that thought because the mistakes of those years, for which all parties must take responsibility, place a burden of pain on future generations to pay for what we enjoyed for nothing.  It is quite foreboding if this matter is being considered as less than serious.  In preparing the budget, I hope the Minister will take little heed of Deputy Mitchell's points in that regard.</P>
    <P>It would be one thing if it could be said that borrowing increased employment, reduced inflation, resulted in the growth of capital assets and laid foundations on which new employment, social developments and other essential services could be improved.  However, it was only when we started to cut public expenditure and take tough measures that investment in these areas increased and private finance institutions and other commercial companies became involved.  We lost out on all counts in that sorry saga.</P>
    <P>This is the basis of our fundamental objection to the Bill.  We made mistakes and did not always believe the facts.  I do not know the views of the officials in the Department of Finance.  I had some tough arguments with them from time to time but I never doubted their integrity or that they wanted to ensure we paid our way.  They wanted each Department run in a way which ensured borrowing for current expenditure was a thing of the past.  I do not know how the officials view the legislation because it goes against everything they suggested.</P>
    <P>The Minister can minimise the position or state it will not have specific effects but using capital assets or selling potential cash flows to meet daily spending requirements sends out the wrong signal.  The Government has a majority but it does not appear willing to come to the House and show its support for the Bill in any principled manner.  There is a dearth of Government Deputies in the House and the Minister for Finance is the only figure on that <Col N="715" /> side.  He has the votes of the three parties in Government but not their principled support for the Bill.  We cannot defeat the Bill but I urge the Minister not to bring forward another Bill during the lifetime of this Government under which the sale of State assets and potential cash flows can be used for current expenditure.</P>
    <P>If the survival of the Government is at stake &mdash; Democratic Left has made it a condition that this money should be paid in the one year in circumstances where old age pensioners have received a paltry increase &mdash; the least that we expect is a statement from the Minister that this is the last time legislation will be introduced to sell a piece of the family silver to buy a loaf of bread.</P>

      <P>We are all aware of the reasons for the introduction of this Bill.  This has been an ongoing saga since 1984 when the former Minister for Social Welfare, Barry Desmond, provided for the partial implementation of the terms of the 1979 EU directive on equal treatment.</P>

      <P>I intend to praise him. If the Government had pushed for full implementation and the Opposition had raised the roof to have it fully implemented Democratic Left or Sinn Féin-The Workers' Party as it was then known would have objected on the grounds that hardship would have been imposed on those dependent on social welfare.  In the light of this, the Government made a wise decision to provide for the phased implementation of the directive.  Others who felt they were entitled to equal treatment saw an opportunity to secure a pay out to which they were legally entitled.  Successive Governments decided to proceed by way of the legal process, perhaps, in an effort to keep the public finances under control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="716" /> A Cork Deputy based her political future on fighting this issue.  Many other local representatives, including Deputies and councillors supported the case being made.  However, she misrepresented the reasons the Fianna Fáil-Labour Government refused to pay and suggested that it did not want to pay the arrears, although it had no option but to proceed by way of due legal process.  It would be wrong of any Government to illegally pay out taxpayers' money. There is a responsibility to ensure that it is spent correctly and wisely.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lynch said this morning that some Members were of the view that the money should not be paid.  I have yet to hear a member of any party say that it should not be paid, if it is legally due.  It is wrong that a Deputy should make false statements about other Deputies.</P>
    <P>The Government had just set its limits on expenditure when this issue hit it. This caused great difficulties in context of the Maastricht Treaty guidelines on European Monetary Union.  If the figure of £260 million was to be paid in full, the Government would exceed its guidelines and cause severe problems for us in progressing towards European Monetary Union.  Some other method had to be found to raise the money. Some members of the Government would have preferred if the money had been paid over a number of years out of current expenditure.  That would have been the wise course of action.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I was under the impression that it was.  This Bill provides the way out in allowing the Government to remain within its own limits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no objection to the sale of State assets.  I would prefer, however, if the proceeds were used to reduce the national debt and provide jobs.  It should be used for productive purposes, but that is not what has been done on this occasion.  I hope it will not become <Col N="717" /> the practice to sell off State assets whenever there is a danger that the Government will exceed its expenditure limits.</P>
    <P>As Members are aware, there has been a change in the legislation dealing with the payment of service charges on which councils and corporations depend.  Some people are under the impression that they no longer have to pay them, despite the fact that if they refuse to pay they will be pursued through the legal system.  In the meantime local authorities will find themselves in some difficulty because of the inclination of some to withhold payments.</P>
    <P>I must refer again to Democratic Left who have called continuously, but especially in Opposition, for more State subsidisation.  We must remember the State can obtain funds only from the taxpayer or borrow them.  That leads me to question whether Deputy Lynch and her colleagues will support the service charges struck by their relevant local authorities within the next few weeks.  If not, they will be in grave dereliction of their duties as public representatives at local and national level and will be doing the country a grave disservice.</P>

      <P>If they do not support the raising of such service charges they will be forcing the Minister to obtain funds from another source, by borrowing, increasing taxation or through the sale of additional national assets.  I hope they will take the honourable, just and proper path rather than engage in political expediency, as has been their tendency over the years.  It never fails to amaze me how some public representatives, when in Opposition, have been able to oppose local authority estimates but, once they become chairpersons of urban councils, support them; their mental gymnastics never cease to amaze me.  I look forward to seeing whether their agility will continue in this and future years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="718" /> I agree with this Bill in principle.  Its provisions allow the Minister greater scope to raise funds for badly needed expenditure.  My objection is to their expenditure in areas which will not be of greatest long-term benefit to the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the tenor of this debate and express my appreciation of Members' contributions.</P>
      <P>Let me address a number of points raised by various Members.  The first was the rather censorious admonition that the Government was introducing some new kind of deviation, that we were selling the family silver or capital assets to pay for a current account liability.  I do not want to engage in historical retribution but I must remind Fianna Fáil Deputies, and current and former members of the Progressive Democrats, that the sale of State assets &mdash; beginning with the disposal of what was then the Irish Sugar Company, now Greencore &mdash; was resorted to by the two parties opposite for current account purposes, there being a current account deficit at that time.  Likewise, the disposal of Irish Life was used for current account purposes.  Therefore, it will be seen that capital assets have been disposed of by various Administrations, including those of which I have been a member when in Government with Fianna Fáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The attempt by the Fianna Fáil Party to suggest that, for the first time, I am introducing the principle of disposal of a capital asset for the purposes of funding a current account liability is misleading; inadvertently they may be selectively presenting an historic comparison that does not accord with fact.  Second, it is not true to compare a flow of income, which by definition will come to an end at a specified time, in the case of a capital asset, such as a company or, as in the case to which Deputy Michael Smith referred, a piece of land, as representing similar type capital assets. Since some types of capital assets, such as land, or a company, may be held in <Col N="719" /> perpetuity the flow of income, by definition, does end at a specified time. Therefore, it is misleading to compare the two.</P>
    <P>What we have done is capitalise that flow of income to meet a once-off liability.  Deputy McCreevy put it most accurately on the record &mdash; I would not disagree with a word of what he said &mdash; or, to use a phrase of Deputy Michael Smith, it was a sorry saga.  As Deputy McCreevy said, it should act as a salutary lesson for any future Administration on how not to deal with the problem, since every party in the House shares some responsibility for that mistaken course.</P>
    <P>The total cost of this will be of the order of £300 million &mdash; we do not know precisely &mdash; but it will be of that order or possibly somewhat less.  Were we to revert to the point in 1984 when the liability first commenced it would have been a much cheaper option, although perhaps unpalatable at the time, than that with which we are now faced.  I think and hope that lesson will have been learned.</P>
    <P>Deputy Michael Ahern suggested that perhaps this money could have been paid over a number of years, contending there had been an expectation of its being phased over a number of years.  The fact of the matter is that, when the High Court ruling was handed own earlier in February this year, the Government took a decision, on the advice of the Attorney General, that its option of an appeal to the Supreme Court had little prospect of success and that the probability would be that not only would the Supreme Court find against the Government but the actual cost would be increased and the Government would have to pay out everything there and then.</P>
    <P>As Members will be aware, the current amount of exposure is of the order of £260 million.  I cannot be more precise on that because, with 70,000 people involved, each with different entitlements, it is not possible to be more accurate.  The fact is we took a decision, <Col N="720" /> correctly in my view, to accept the decision of the High Court to pay out the money.  We had some room for manoeuvre in terms of phasing our payment, the largest constraint being the physical logistics of calculating individual entitlements for transference to its rightful recipients.  I had made a budgetary provision for £60 million, the Department of Social Welfare having advised me of a balance of £140 million; in other words, a total of £200 million could be paid in the current year, which is what we are in the process of doing, the subsequent balance of £60 million to be paid in 1996 and 1997.  I am happy to report that that money is flowing to its beneficiaries.  I suspect the reason there is not that much interest in this technical Bill is that that money is already reaching very receptive households nationwide and, I understand, is being put to excellent use.</P>
    <P>Members may ask why securitisation; why this particular mechanism?  Deputy Michael Smith, a former Minister for the Environment &mdash; well briefed in the options relating to the Housing Finance Agency &mdash; raised a valid question on why I had not taken the HFA route.  I propose to explain a number of questions pertaining to that in greater detail on Committee Stage.  The primary reason I decided to take the National Treasury Management Agency route, as distinct from the HFA one was that, notwithstanding the merits of the HFA proposal, I wanted to use the expertise of the NTMA and endeavour to widen and deepen our capital markets.</P>
    <P>The technical aspects of the nature of the debt, the manner in which the money is being raised; whether it represents Government borrowing, direct or indirect, or an independent, stand-alone, method of raising funds can best be clarified on Committee Stage.  I had two purposes in choosing the route encompassed in the Bill.  The first was to make it clear that this money did not represent another form of State borrowing, and I shall be quite happy to explain why that is the case.  My second reason was to provide a new possibility <Col N="721" /> for investment in our markets at present.  Our national debt stands at approximately £32 billion, yet our total pension funds, and the resources contained therein, amount to almost £14 billion, practically half the national debt.  Because of the fiduciary responsibilities on trustees and fund managers to invest that money in prudent instruments, there is a dearth of such instruments available to fund managers here, as a consequence of which we have the highest level of investment of Irish pension funds invested in savings outside this economy than any other European country and, possibly, worldwide.</P>
    <P>This mechanism will provide a new opportunity for investment.  On Committee Stage we can examine the way in which this special purpose vehicle will function and its relationship to the NTMA and the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>Another point &mdash; and I am happy it has been made by Deputies across the House &mdash; is that the relationship between local authority tenants who have SDA loans, including Deputy McCreevy who is still, no doubt, faithfully and honourably paying it off, and the local authority which granted the loan will remain intact and will not be altered by the provisions of this Bill which will enable us to raise the money on a once off basis to fund this liability.</P>
    <P>The Deputies concerned are no longer in the House, but having read the debate they may wish to raise on Committee Stage the fact that we have not included the additional expenditure of £140 million in our base figure for the purpose of calculating expenditure in 1996.  It is deliberately excluded to enable us to maintain rigid discipline on levels of public expenditure in the economy.  We have been open about that.  In my opening comments on Second Stage, I stated clearly that the extra £140 million is in breach of the figure we set for ourselves because of a decision we took and legal advice to the effect that if we delayed payment of the £260 million arising from the High Court action we would probably have to pay more and <Col N="722" /> all at one time.  For that reason we have taken this road.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Ms McManus)</NameTxt>
      <P>I very much welcome this opportunity to focus attention on the important issue of social housing.  Decent housing for all our people is a basic concern of Government.  Each and every family is profoundly concerned about, and influenced by, the quality of its housing. Accordingly, it is appropriate that Deputies should have the opportunity to consider and debate the Government's policy set out in the document <i>Social Housing &mdash; The Way Ahead.</i></P>
      <P>Housing is the key determinant of many of our attitudes, our capabilities and our life choices.  People cannot develop properly if their housing conditions cause them difficulty, anguish or distress.  Relationships suffer in the absence of decent housing and those who are marginalised will remain so if we do not enable them to enjoy housing conditions appropriate to their needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Housing, therefore, is one of the priorities of this Government.  Our special commitment to the social housing area was written into the Government's policy document <i>&ldquo;A Government of Renewal&rdquo;</i> with the undertaking <Col N="723" /> to increase social housing starts to 7,000 annually.  This was a significant commitment when one considers that there were fewer than 3,000 starts under the social housing programme as recently as 1992.  We are well on our way to delivering on this commitment of 7,000 starts this year.  Overall, and including vacancies in the existing local authority housing stock, we expect to cater for some 9,500 households in housing need in 1995 rising to over 10,000 next year, compared to just 6,000 households in 1992.</P>
    <P>There has been an enormous increase in recent years in the financial resources directed to the social housing programme.  Capital funding for social housing in 1995 amounts to some £286 million compared to £226 in 1994 and £148 million in 1993.  The sum of £286 million is enormous, and in this context I would like to refer briefly to a recent assertion that the cost to the housing budget of introducing divorce would be £135 million.  This is simply scremongering.  Marital breakdown is already a significant factor in housing need.  Divorce, and the giving of what I consider a basic human right of a second chance, will not increase the rate of marriage breakdown.  Indeed it may well serve to assist marriage where second unions exist.  To argue that divorce will increase Government expenditure on housing is untrue.  It is further evidence of the alarmist and misleading approach of the No Divorce Campaign that this argument is being used.  I can assure this House that voting &ldquo;yes&rdquo; for the amendment will not lead to additional demands on the housing budget.</P>
    <P>I also emphasise that the provision of funding does not solve all housing problems.  Proper policies and structures must be in place to ensure that the funding is spent wisely, benefits those most in need and has a positive effect in the long term.</P>
    <P>While I have given some figures relating to our social housing output to indicate progress over recent years, housing <Col N="724" /> progress simply cannot be measured in terms of numbers alone.  We remember the mistakes of the past, the large, sprawling local authority housing estates on greenfield sites where basic communal development proved difficult.  Nor can we easily forget the problems of the low cost housing experiment &mdash; the legacy of which continues to absorb so much badly needed capital. The numbers of new local authority houses being built were very impressive when the low cost housing programme was in full swing, but these numbers were achieved at great social cost to the tenants and economic cost to the taxpayer to remedy the defects inherent not only in the concept but equally in the houses.</P>
    <P>We still live with the social and financial consequences of these mistakes. However, the important thing is that we have learned.  My aim, therefore, is to ensure that we do not have to rely on a single policy response to social housing needs but that a variety of appropriate measures are available.  In addition we must ensure that the increased output from the social housing programmes is of the highest quality in terms of the physical housing conditions and their location and integration with the wider community.</P>
    <P>Against that background &ldquo;Social Housing &mdash; The Way Ahead&rdquo; was published in May.  It grew from a review of the measures introduced in the earlier &ldquo;Plan for Social Housing&rdquo; which was, in many ways, a groundbreaking document.  It radically redirected social housing policy from the traditional single solution of building local authority housing and brought to the forefront many important concepts, such as counteracting social segregation which had not previously been a major objective of housing policy.  It brought choice into the social housing area in a radical way through programmes to expand housing provision by the voluntary sector and additional options for local authorities, including the purchase of existing dwellings to meet needs.  It made home <Col N="725" /> ownership available to persons who previously could not have aspired to owning their own homes.  It, furthermore, stressed the need for better management of the public housing stock.</P>
    <P>However, circumstances change.  In 1991, local authority waiting lists stood at 23,000 households but subsequently reached 28,600 in 1993.  The pressure of increasing needs made it urgent for us to consider the social housing area in detail and this has been achieved in &ldquo;Social Housing &mdash; The Way Ahead&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, this document reports progress in housing since 1991, reviews the operation of the new measures in the &ldquo;Plan for Social Housing&rdquo;, gives details of important changes being made in the terms of these and other longer established schemes to increase output, and maps out the further development and implementation of the housing commitments in <i>A Government of Renewal.</i></P>
    <P>My Department commissioned the ESRI to undertake a detailed analysis and evaluation of the 1993, assessment of local authority housing needs.  I have decided that the next assessment of needs should be undertaken in March 1996 and that this assessment should take account of the conclusions of the ESRI analysis.  My Department will, therefore, shortly issue detailed guidelines to local authorities which will assist them in carrying out a comprehensive assessment of social housing needs which takes account of the range of needs, including homeless and travellers, and the social housing options now available.</P>
    <P>Local authority housing remains the mainstay of the overall response to social housing need.  The previous Government more than trebled the size of this programme in 1993 to 3,500 starts and maintained it at that level in 1994. This Government has further increased the programme to 3,900 starts in 1995.</P>
    <P>However, the local authority housing programme of the 1990s is fundamentally different in character from that of previous decades.  A key policy consideration now is to provide housing in <Col N="726" /> a manner which does not contribute to or reinforce social segregation.  Local authorities are now providing housing in small, well designed schemes often on infill sites and without recourse, as in the past, to large estates on greenfield sites at the edges of cities and towns. Authorities are also increasingly purchasing existing houses to meet needs. These acquisitions should reach approximately 600 this year in comparison with 462 last year and, of course, few, if any, under the old style local authority housing programme.  The expanded local authority programme is, therefore, now responding to needs in a much more sensitive, flexible and socially aware manner.</P>
    <P>The improved physical appearance of recent local authority housing schemes is marked.  Dublin Corporation's Bride Street development in the inner city is a good example of how local authority housing can and does compare favourably with the best private sector developments.  To encourage authorities towards better and more appropriate housing I have recently introduced a design award scheme.  These awards will recognise the excellence and quality which we now find in the design of many of our local authority housing schemes.  It will encourage all authorities to achieve higher standards in their housing provision.</P>
    <P>The policy document &ldquo;Social Housing &mdash; The Way Ahead&rdquo; also deals comprehensively with the management of the existing local authority housing stock. The provision of a quality service to tenants and the general public alike through proper management by authorities of their housing estates is a particular priority.  As a former councillor, I am well aware that housing management is a demanding task for local authorities.  Nationally, it involves responsibility for some 95,000 dwellings and expenditure of approximately £90 million annually.  Good management requires planning, organisation, direction and effective implementation.</P>
    <P>Management relates, in part, to taking care of the physical condition of the <Col N="727" /> housing stock.  In this regard, my Department and the housing authorities have worked well to bring about significant improvements in the quality of existing housing.  Since 1985 capital investment of over £136 million has been made through the remedial works programme.  Similarly, since 1991 £13.5 million has been invested in providing bathroom facilities in local authority dwellings.</P>
    <P>Good housing management is about more than maintaining and improving the physical fabric and facilities of housing.  It is also about improving the quality of life in the estates and addressing issues such as alienation and anti-social behaviour.  Tenants need to be involved in running their estates and have an opportunity to contribute to the development of their community.  Good housing management hinges on good relationships between the local authority, as landlord, and tenants.  I want authorities to increase and improve tenant involvement at all levels in running estates as they know better than anybody else the strengths, weaknesses and problems in the area.  The key point is to develop mechanisms which allow the knowledge and interest of tenants to be utilised and harnessed for the betterment of everybody.  Involving tenants in a real way in housing management requires new skills and attitudes by local authorities.  Many of the new housing management initiatives contained in &ldquo;Social Housing &mdash; The Way Ahead&rdquo; will assist tenants and local authority housing officials to develop the new concepts and skills confidently and successfully.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to some of the initiatives which have the capacity to contribute significantly to improving housing management.  Last May I announced a new scheme of grants to support and encourage selected pilot projects in housing management.  We set aside £100,000 for housing authorities to develop projects focusing on specific activities, additional to their normal <Col N="728" /> day-to-day management and maintenance.  These projects must have the scope to deliver lasting benefits to the authority itself and have potential to be replicated by other authorities.</P>
    <P>The response to the scheme has been very encouraging.  Thirty four authorities put forward 55 projects for consideration and I have now chosen 16 of them for grant aid.  Eleven of the proposals focus on involving tenants in the management of their estates and include training programmes for both tenants and housing officials.  These projects should help to promote greater skills, knowledge, understanding and closer working relations among the participants.  We must build on these pilot projects and extend the lessons from them throughout the country.  I foresee each authority, in due course, developing its own blueprint for effective estate management which reflects its own unique combination of needs and resources.</P>
    <P>I also announced in May my intention to establish a housing management group, comprising representatives of the local authorities and the Department, to promote best practice in housing management in consultation with the voluntary sector.  This group can contribute significantly to developing policies on many key housing management issues. These issues include training programmes for local authority personnel, provision of housing information, identifying key performance indicators for use by local authorities and developing an overall programme for the promotion of best practice throughout all authorities.  In dealing with its remit, I expect the group to liaise with other interests, including the voluntary housing sector whose experience and perspectives will be relevant.  New ideas and ways of dealing with problems are always valuable and should be sought on as wide a basis as possible.</P>
    <P>In recent years the role of local authorities has moved from the traditional function of the direct provision of housing for rent towards a new promotional and facilitating role in the delivery of the full range of housing services within <Col N="729" /> their area.  This involves the authorities in actively and imaginatively promoting the various options and schemes now available to address housing needs.</P>
    <P>One of the most important tasks of the housing management group will be to set out proposals for the development of a comprehensive housing information service through the local authorities.  In common with all public bodies, authorities must become much more responsive to the needs of their clients, they must be customer driven.  Accordingly, I proposed the establishment of local housing advice centres or &ldquo;one-stop-shops&rdquo;.  A major element in the Department's support for the new housing information service is the preparation and publication of a range of housing information in leaflet form.  Ten housing information leaflets have already been published by my Department and supplied to authorities and voluntary organisations.  They cover such issues as a summary of the range of housing options, local authority housing, the voluntary housing schemes, disabled persons grants and so on.</P>
    <P>One of the most important features of housing policy is the expanded role for the voluntary housing sector.  Progress in this area has been considerable since 1991.  Overall voluntary housing output doubled to 900 units in the two years to 1994.  Some 1,000 units will be provided this year and I expect output to continue to increase.</P>
    <P>In order to support this expanded role for the voluntary sector significant improvements to the terms of the capital assistance scheme and rental subsidy schemes were provided for in &ldquo;Social Housing &mdash; The Way Ahead&rdquo;.  The maximum assistance under the capital assistance scheme was increased by £2,000 to £27,000 per unit for one and two person dwellings and by £7,000 to £33,000 per unit for family type dwellings.  The rental subsidy scheme was boosted by the raising of general income eligibility limits, improvements in the unit cost limits on construction from £35,000 to £41,000 generally and to £46,000 in major urban centres and by a <Col N="730" /> 50 per cent increase in the maintenance and management allowance.</P>
    <P>The benefits of involvement by the voluntary sector in the social housing programme extends beyond the provision of accommodation, vital though that role is.  Voluntary bodies generally have a key role in developing community spirit, in fostering self-help rather than dependency and in enabling people to become active players in shaping their own futures rather than passive recipients.</P>
    <P>There is no single repository of all housing knowledge.  We can only tackle the range and complexity of housing needs in a modern society with a corresponding range and diversity of responses.  Above all, the statutory and voluntary sectors must work together and exchange the benefit of their experience if we are to successfully address housing problems and build thriving communities rather than soulless housing estates.</P>
    <P>The priority housing needs of travellers and the homeless were particularly addressed in &ldquo;Social Housing &mdash; The Way Ahead&rdquo;.  All of us who have responsibility for the housing system &mdash; and I specifically include among this group Deputies who are members of a local authority &mdash; must strive to secure minimal acceptable living conditions for the travelling community.  Whatever extra funds over and above the annual provisions are required for the local authority traveller accommodation programmes will be provided.</P>
    <P>There has been some progress in recent years but despite the best efforts of a number of local authorities lack of action by others continues to adversely affect the programme.  The report of the Task Force on the Travelling Community was published in July 1995.  The implications of implementing the task force's wide-ranging recommendations, including the proposed establishment of a travellers accommodation agency, are now being considered by a group representative of the Departments involved.  I expect the group's findings <Col N="731" /> to be with Government before the end of the year.</P>
    <P>The homeless, of course, clearly benefit from the expansion of the local authority housing programme.  They will also benefit particularly from the changes I have introduced into the capital assistance scheme which, in recent years, has provided much badly needed accommodation for homeless persons.  However, our policies on the homeless must be continually assessed and developed to ensure that our actions are targeting the areas where needs are most acute. &ldquo;Social Housing &mdash; The Way Ahead&rdquo; identifies a number of specific priority areas to deal with homelessness, including the availability of accommodation in which homeless persons can be assisted to make the transition to a more settled way of life; improving liaison between statutory and voluntary bodies in order to provide a more integrated service; the availability of suitable accommodation for certain categories not adequately catered for at present, for example, emergency accommodation for people with particular needs arising from health or addiction problems.</P>
    <P>To provide accommodation is vital but in the case of the homeless it is rarely enough on its own and a range of support services are usually also needed.  I am anxious that the statutory and voluntary sectors are properly structured to ensure that services are available not alone to provide accommodation but also to prevent homeless persons from becoming trapped in the cycle of homelessness.  Services must be comprehensive, responsive and flexible. No single statutory agency working alone will be able to meet the complex needs of homeless persons.  I have been examining the position over recent months including the roles and responsibilities of local authorities and health boards, especially in the Dublin region. I hope to be in a position shortly to announce the results of my review.</P>
    <P>Before leaving the issue of homelessness.  I simply cannot let the opportunity go without expressing my <Col N="732" /> appreciation of those who work with the homeless, whether in statutory or voluntary agencies, for their selfless dedication, hard work and real achievements.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Social Housing &mdash; The Way Ahead&rdquo; recognises the increasingly important role of the private rented sector in meeting social housing needs.  Important steps have been taken to improve the lot of tenants since 1992, including the introduction of the requirement of at least one month's notice to quit; mandatory rent books; legally binding minimum physical standards of rented accommodation; the abolition of distress, under which a landlord could seize tenants' property to enforce the payment of rent; and tax relief on private rents provided in this year's budget.</P>
    <P>I am also moving ahead with my proposals for the registration of private rented accommodation.  I have consulted widely with the various interests in relation to registration and I intend to finalise the necessary regulations as soon as possible.  This will also assist local authorities in the enforcement of the other statutory requirements relating to the sector and the fees payable on registration will provide a source of income to assist authorities in discharging their regulatory functions in relation to the sector.</P>
    <P>Home ownership is the preferred tenure of the vast majority of our population and &ldquo;Social Housing &mdash; The Way Ahead&rdquo; includes a number of measures to assist marginal house purchasers.  The shared ownership system was introduced to assist low income households who aspired to home ownership but who simply could not afford home ownership under the conventional loan repayments system.  I am glad to say that over 3,700 households moved into their own homes since 1991 with the aid of shared ownership.  Arising from the review of the system, I took the opportunity to reduce the minimum initial equity that must be purchased under the system from 50 per cent to 40 per cent. The new limit gives additional flexibility and should enable the system to make a <Col N="733" /> greater impact on social housing needs without attracting people into the system who do not have the resources to achieve ownership.  For example, the initial purchase of 50 per cent of a £30,000 house would cost £15,000 whereas £16,000 would purchase 40 per cent of a £40,000 house.</P>
    <P>Local authorities continue to provide mortgage finance for people who cannot obtain mortgage finance from a bank or building society.  The maximum house purchase loans from local authorities has been increased from £25,000 to £33,000 generally with a higher limit of £35,000 on certain off shore islands.</P>
    <P>The mortgage allowance scheme is an important incentive for local authority tenants and tenant purchasers who wish to return their present house to the local authority and acquire their own house in the private sector.  I have significantly improved the terms of the scheme from £3,300 payable over five years to £4,500 over the same period.</P>
    <P>It reflects well on the quality of the vast majority of our local authority housing stock and the living conditions of the tenants, that, when the opportunity arises, many wish to purchase rather than continue to rent their houses.  Tenant purchase of local authority dwellings has, for many years, been a feature of our housing system. Tenant purchase has now been put on a permanent, open-ended footing rather than the earlier schemes which tended to apply for set periods only.  During my review of the social housing system, I noted that the 1993 scheme was much less generous than those which had previously applied.  To redress this situation, I was pleased to be able to introduce in &ldquo;Social Housing &mdash; The Way Ahead&rdquo; revised terms for the tenant purchase scheme to make purchase more affordable to a greater number of tenants by increased discounts and also a shared ownership option.</P>
    <P>The publication of a policy document such as &ldquo;Social Housing &mdash; The Way Ahead,&rdquo; is sometimes mistakenly seen <Col N="734" /> as the end of a process.  It most assuredly is not.  Housing needs are constantly evolving, constantly changing. Housing policy must therefore, continually adapt to new situations, concerns and challenges.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Social Housing &mdash; The Way Ahead&rdquo; acknowledges the need for change and sets out a framework for the development of social housing policy which will stand us in good stead over the coming years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Department of the Environment on its policy document &ldquo;Social Housing &mdash; The Way Ahead&rdquo;.  I had not expected a comment on divorce but as the Minister of State managed to refer to her pet issue, I wish to contradict her assertion that the argument that divorce will increase Government expenditure on housing is untrue.  I could not agree with that, but I will not argue whether it will cost £1 million or £135 million. Obviously, there would be some additional demands on Government if divorce were introduced.</P>
      <P>It is said that a man's home is his castle and Irish people very much want to own their own home.  Housing is very important but cannot be considered in isolation from other priorities such as job creation, schools, shops and so on. Historically, the Government put money into providing housing without making adequate provision for infrastructure such as schools and shops. Resources were scarce and priority was given to housing.  In many respects that strategy worked.  People were housed in green field sites a mile or two from the nearest shop, with the school being built six years later.  With unemployment becoming a fact of life in these new estates those people have been caught in a downward spiral.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is regrettable that many unemployed people are located in green field sites with few facilities and little hope or community spirit.  In politics, particularly in regard to housing, we are inclined to let issues slide until there is a major problem and then try to address <Col N="735" /> it quickly and cheaply.  Ballymun is frequently portrayed as an example of cheap housing, but it is not a true portrayal.  We merely tried to do too much too quickly, and it is not the worst housing development in Dublin.</P>
    <P>There have been many good housing developments in Dublin in the past ten or 15 years and the award scheme proposed by the Minister will encourage local authorities to design better schemes.  I find the word &ldquo;starts&rdquo; used by the Minister very confusing.  Perhaps I am old fashioned in taking the word to mean house construction when the meaning the Minister attributes to it includes vacant houses and house allocations.  In the mid-eighties Fianna Fáil introduced the £5,000 surrender grant scheme which led to a number of house vacancies.  The scheme solved many housing problems but tore the heart out of many communities and created problems.  In seeking innovative measures to solve problems, we should hasten slowly.  A quick solution can often mean a greater problem in the long term.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on providing additional money for house construction.  Fianna Fáil also did a great deal of work in this area.  There were many major drives in local authority house building when my party was in power.</P>
    <P>The cutbacks in house construction from 1987 to 1989 can be excused on two grounds, the economic position and the introduction of the £5,000 grant scheme.  There were 420 empty flats in Ballymun at one stage during that time and houses were being vandalised, burned and used by children for amusement.  In that type of atmosphere, the obvious thing is to stop building.</P>
    <P>A sum of money is generally allocated each year in the Government's programme for housing schemes and if that stops for a year or two, it is difficult to get approval for it again.  Even when it is approved, it can take up to two years to complete a development as architects may have been transferred to other projects.  House building approved three <Col N="736" /> years ago was completed only last year. As a housing crisis has developed in the past few years I am pleased that funding is being allocated to deal with the problem and that the houses for which money was approved two years ago are now being completed.</P>
    <P>The current plan is an update of the 1991 plan, for which Padraig Flynn did not get much credit.  It was rubbished by people who believed the only way to solve the problem was to build more houses.  The plan confirms that the 1991 plan was innovative and proposed strategies geared to the changing housing scheme.  As a local authority member at that time.  I believed the Department was innovative, particularly in estate management.  At many meetings during that time departmental approval for house building was given, subject to proper estate management.  Many of us did not know what the Department meant as we felt proper estate management was common sense.  We considered it a delaying tactic by the Department.  We could not understand why it would not allow us get on with the job of building houses.  However, while we labelled that a time wasting tactic, having regard to the extent of the current housing problem the Department was very innovative at that time. The Minister outlined the key achievements under the excellent 1991 plan, but in hindsight the main emphasis must always be on construction.  Now that more resources are available the plan is seen to have been worthwhile.</P>
    <P>Our main objective must be to provide good quality housing for those who cannot afford to purchase houses and I support the Minister's view that they should have a choice in that regard.  The Minister mentioned the number of house constructions.  I agree with the policy of having infill developments of 75 houses as greenfield areas are often the site of social problems.  I wonder how long the scheme will last as every available site will have been infilled in a few years.  There will be problems in Dublin about infilling sites labelled as <Col N="737" /> amenity or play areas.  However, it is a good policy.</P>
    <P>As regards design, some distinctive local authority housing was built in the last three years.  While Bride Street is an architectural gem, unfortunately, one would pick out a local authority house a mile away.  People complain that the houses have small windows.  We were told that was necessary to comply with the planning and energy regulations but surely that must apply to private houses also.  Local authority housing has the look of an army barracks about it. Although many are wonderful houses, built to a very high standard, they are easily identifiable and people would prefer if this were not so.</P>
    <P>The Department has provided funding for refurbishment.  It is stated in the plan that there will be a review of the future direction of refurbishment.  What does that mean?  Is the Government suggesting that as money is now being put into house reconstruction it will not be put into refurbishment?  I would not be happy with that.  We must continue to fund refurbishment projects.  In Dublin it was not necessarily the oldest buildings that were refurbished but those in areas with great social problems.  Some established blocks of flats built around the turn of the century were passed over in favour of houses built 30 or 40 years ago in areas of social deprivation.  Some refurbishment was of a Rolls Royce standard but I am not sure if that is necessary.  Sometimes all that is required is money to replace windows, provide indoor toilets and so on.</P>
    <P>Wooden houses were built in 1969 in parts of my constituency.  It is said they had a 12 or 15 year life span although I have my doubts about that.  Many of them were purchased by the tenants under the 1988 scheme for £8,000 or £10,000 and sell today for £30,000.  The cost of maintaining them is very high and as many of those who live in them depend on social welfare a scheme will have to be introduced to make money available for essential repairs.</P>
    <P>Many people aim to own their house. <Col N="738" /> The shared ownership scheme is a marvellous one, although in the beginning there were many legal and teething problems.  I urge the Minister to continue that scheme.  I am glad the initial equity has been reduced to 40 per cent but that does not fully solve the problem.  The scheme is only used by those on a low income.</P>
    <P>The best form of estate management is to allow people own their houses.  If they own even 10 per cent of it they will have a different approach to how they look after it.  While many tenants would like another chance to avail of the 1988 tenant purchase scheme the £3,000 grant and the shared ownership option has reopened the door for many on social welfare.</P>
    <P>I raised with the Minister last week the issue of houses with an indoor bathroom and an outdoor toilet.  Under the current scheme the local authority cannot help such people.  The bathroom scheme should be extended to cover such houses.  It is fine to build new modern houses but we must try to keep the old ones in good repair.  Last year Dublin Corporation received funding from the proceeds of the tax amnesty for replacement windows.  That was necessary in the refurbishment of many flat complexes in Dublin.  The Rolls Royce scheme is not always necessary.</P>
    <P>The report does not mention a house repair grant scheme.  I hope such a scheme will be introduced.  Social housing and private housing are intertwined. Many local authority houses become private houses as a result of the tenant purchase scheme.  Much money was spent on the previous scheme.  What is needed is a better focused scheme, targeted at older houses.  On a previous occasion I opposed the provision of a grant to a person in a 15-year-old, £100,000 house for the building of a conservatory.  That is a waste of taxpayers' money.  There are many houses, some of which were previously local authority houses, which would benefit from a well controlled grant scheme, and I hope such a scheme will be introduced in the near future.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="739" /> Many of the anti-social problems in Dublin occur in flat complexes.  A scheme should be considered to provide for the sale of flats.  The report states that there are legal difficulties in this regard, but if the legal problems can be overcome such a scheme would be welcome.  Many flat complexes are considered as transit camps, although I should not use that term.  People move into them in order to get points with a view to being transferred to a house.  If people could buy flats it would help to reduce many of the problems in these areas.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to proceed with the changes proposed in the private rented sector.  It is unacceptable that voluntary regulations apply whereby people with houses and flats may register their interests with the local authority.  A fee must be paid and there must be policing in this regard.  Many people rent houses which are not fit for a dog. People wishing to be put on the local authority housing list should be provided with accommodation that is up to a certain standard.  Some houses in my area are simply passing camps for people wishing to get points in the hope that they will qualify for local authority housing.  In many cases people are living in dreadful conditions.  Some of the accommodation provided by the Eastern Health Board is not fit for human habitation.  Landlords, who are interested only in the subsidy they receive, are ripping off the system and provide accommodation that is in very bad condition.</P>
    <P>Many people are unhappy with maintenance standards.  Local authorities cannot maintain houses due to a lack of finance.  We should consider a system under which, as in the case of private accommodation, local authorities would receive a rent subsidy.  Since such a system operates in the private rented sector I see no reason that it cannot be introduced for local authority houses.</P>
    <P>When will the ESRI report on this matter be published?  A newspaper report some months ago suggested that <Col N="740" /> in future emergency cases would become the priority rather than housing people on a points basis.  I have much sympathy for people who have to live in a flat or in a parent's front room while waiting for a house.  A system whereby a person who arrives off the train or boat is housed immediately on the basis that it is an emergency case would be unfair.  There are concerns in this regard in view of the abolition of the residency qualification.  People who have accumulated points over the years must get priority.</P>
    <P>There is an ongoing argument between Dublin County Council and Dublin Corporation about which body governs certain areas.  I would like to know when action will be taken on this issue.  It was expected that some measure would be introduced 18 or 21 months ago but the problem still exists. I could go on at length about the problems that may arise in future for Dublin Corporation in regard to the building of houses and so on.</P>
    <P>I welcome the report and hope that the good work continues.  I would ask the Minister to consider the points I raised particularly in regard to Dublin. Dublin Corporation is buying 300 houses this year, but the result of the purchase of such a large number of houses is that prices will increase, thereby impacting on the shared ownership scheme.  Therefore, the lifespan of schemes such as that may be limited.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this report, a forward looking, innovative document which gives much grounds for encouragement in the way we shape public housing policy in future.  It incorporates certain key elements of the 1991 plan devised by former Minister, Padraig Flynn, with which I agreed enthusiastically at the time.  I am happy those principles have been included in this document.  There must be a good deal of openness and flexibility in terms of housing policy in the years ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Dramatic changes have been made in recent years in the composition of family and family size, and public housing <Col N="741" /> policy must respond vigorously to such changes.  It is critically important that policy changes be based on the best up-to-date information available at any given time.  In that respect I note that the ESRI is currently engaged in an indepth analysis and evaluation of housing and I understand its report is imminent.  A full debate of that report in this democratic forum would be very worthwhile.  Arising from such a debate we would be better equipped to formulate future housing policy.  I ask the Minister to bear that in mind.</P>
    <P>Enormous improvements have been made in the manner in which we have dealt with housing in recent years.  For example, there is a much stronger awareness of the need to put in place new principles in respect of management and maintenance of local authority housing.  That is a key element in this plan, which I welcome.  Such principles are already in place and working well in parts of the country, including my constituency of Cork North Central. We must learn from that experience and strive to extend this system to all sections of older housing estates, many of which are currently grossly undermanaged and undermaintained.  I refer specifically to flat complexes, but is also applies to older housing estates, particularly in urban areas.</P>
    <P>I welcome the many changes indicated here under the umbrella of the social housing programme.  Many more and better options are open to housing authorities and housing applicants than has been the case since the foundation of the State.  Voluntary housing programmes run by groups like Respond are proving particularly successful as they have put in place an excellent model of a housing estate in terms of how it can be best designed, managed and maintained.  They have provided for the active involvement of families in the management and maintenance of their estates.  That approach has made a fundamental difference and the key beneficiaries are the children who grow up in a healthy environment in an estate free from vandalism and despoliation of <Col N="742" /> public property.  The long-term benefits of such a scheme are obvious and must, of necessity, benefit the next generation.</P>
    <P>An estate management system was put in place in a local authority housing estate in Cork approximately two years ago, and it reduced the level of petty crime by more than 50 per cent. Observers in the area relate that reduction in the level of crime directly to the better principles of estate management that have been put in place and are being sustained.  We should learn from the experience and extend that system to other estates.</P>
    <P>I recommend that the housing programmes of voluntary bodies which provide essential services should be funded on a multiannual basis.  Voluntary bodies should be informed of their estimated budgets on a three or five year basis.  If that was done and if there was a stable funding environment, it would enable those bodies to make better forward planning and to develop their schemes.  To date their schemes are proving very cost effective.  I ask the Minister of State to consider that matter and to provide additional funding for special programmes of housing aid for the elderly.  Deputy Bradford could testify to the existence of a shared housing programme for the elderly in Cork under which houses are built on a voluntary basis to address not only the housing but the integrated needs of the elderly.  Those programmes have proved eminently successful.  Given the direction of the age profile of our population, there is great scope for extension and development of those programmes and I recommend them to the Minister as a future objective.</P>
    <P>Another option being explored rapidly in the provision of housing is the payment of rent and mortgage subsidies under the supplementary allowance scheme.  I understand that in 1994 approximately £54 million of taxpayers' money was paid out under that scheme. I appeal to the Minister to point out it is critically important to ensure that such money is not used to prop up slum landlords.  I urgently call for proper control <Col N="743" /> of such rentals.  It is essential that minimum standards, as defined in our housing Acts, should be applied to such dwellings.  It is important that the owners of such dwellings are subjected to the requirements of section 14 of the 1995 Finance Act.  If those requirements were met fully, I would be pleased to give my full support to that scheme.  It enables housing agencies to provide housing for young single people in particular who, traditionally, have fared badly.</P>
    <P>In my local authority area there is an ongoing housing crisis.  If young single housing applicants were taken off the housing list, it would cut the list by almost 35 per cent.  I recommend it is a significant factor which should be examined.</P>
    <P>Recent changes in social welfare have encouraged young people to leave good homes to live in poorly maintained flats to qualify for their full social welfare payment.  If those people continue to live at home, they would draw down as little as £5 per week social welfare benefit whereas if they leave home they are entitled to draw down approximately £40 per week social welfare benefit. That measure which was well intentioned in terms of finance has had a counterproductive effect in creating large bills for health boards in terms of supplementary welfare allowance.  I ask the Minister to confer with the Minister for Social Welfare to examine that provision as it is a bad deal in economic and social terms.  Young people would be better off if they lived with their families for as long as possible.  I ask the Minister to seriously examine this matter to ascertain how that trend can be reversed.</P>
    <P>There is great merit in the shared housing scheme.  I commend the Minister for raising the limits in terms of eligibility and the money given to those who wish to participate in that scheme. It goes a long way towards meeting the ideals of people who wish to own their houses and any step we can reasonably take to assist that trend is welcome.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="744" /> I commend all the bodies involved in providing housing for the homeless such as the Simon Community, Focus Point and other such bodies.  I also commend the Minister and her Department for putting before us a number of options under the social housing document that opened up the way for a much more flexible and intelligent approach to the provision of public housing in the years ahead.  I look forward to a comprehensive debate on housing when the ESRI report becomes available.  That document must be given the widest possible democratic debate in this House.  I also look forward to discussing the issue of housing on the publication of that document.  I thank the Minister for her presentation today.</P>
    <P>I hope we have learned from bad experiences in the past when authorities built huge housing estates which at the outset were undermanaged and undermaintained.  I hope we never return to such a housing policy, that we will build public housing estates in much smaller units and put in place at the outset proper recreational facilities for young children who will be raised in those estates.  The lack of such facilities for young people has been a major defect in some of the older housing estates.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister of State, Deputy Currie, will agree with what I have said.  We are now dealing with the result in trying to come to terms with vandalism, hooliganism and petty crime, much of which is derived from the fact that young people in large sprawling housing estates were not provided with constructive outlets for their energies. Instead they embarked on destroying and despoiling public property.  We must learn from that experience and move on.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware during the past year the addition of a number of new schemes has resulted in a considerably increased demand on the operations of the local offices of the Department.</P>
      <P>In the period to 31 October 1994 some 7,338 approvals issued under the various schemes representing a grant commitment of some £24.6 million.  In the same period this year a total of 13,500 approvals issued representing a grant commitment of £86.83 million.</P>

      <P>My understanding is that under the farmers' charter, once the certification is received the grant will be paid in the normal period.  I thought the Deputy would refer to the position in Laoighis-Offaly which I acknowledge is a particular difficulty.  I do not have the <Col N="746" /> figure for actual payments.  We now have the REPS, the dairy hygiene, the farm improvement programme and the control of farmyard pollution schemes whereas in 1994 we had only the farm improvement programme.  These schemes are moving ahead but there is a problem in some counties due to a shortage of staff.  For example, in the Deputy's constituency there are only two field staff where I acknowledge a minimum of four is required.  In discussions with the unions I have been endeavouring to get some staff to move from the western seaboard where there are too many staff to the eastern seaboard.</P>

      <P>In reply to a question I tabled on 11 October on the dairy hygiene scheme I was informed that the number of applications was 4,700, the number of approvals was 2,100 and the number who had been paid was 127 amounting to £620,000.  The problem with the reply given by the Minister is that he is referring to approvals issued under the various schemes.  Apart from the dairy hygiene scheme there is also control of farmyard pollution and REP schemes.  There have been 9,000 applications for REPS, only 4,500 of which have been approved and few have been paid.  Will the Minister agree it is vital, given the level of investment in farming which the IFA have been pointing out in their submission for the forthcoming budget, to address this issue?  Given that the Minister is experiencing serious difficulty with the administration of these schemes will he consider identifying those farmers who could be given a write-off in respect of investment under these schemes so that he can release the grant money for those farmers who do not have a taxable income?  If he does not have sufficient money and if too many apply for benefit under the scheme, which is the claim being made by the Department&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Once they have gone through the approval process we carry out the inspection and the payment will issue. The payments issue from the Cavan office and there is no unnecessary delay. On the matter of tax, the Government is in the process of finalising the Estimates which will be published shortly.  We will them move on to the tax provisions.

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose taking Questions Nos. 2, 20, 22, 25 and 36 together.</P>
      <P>The 1995 TB testing programme is proceeding satisfactorily, with about eight million animal tests completed out of a planned ten million tests.  The objective is to complete a full monitor of all herds as well as to undertake any consequential testing from reactor breakdowns.</P>
      <P>My objective for the future is to introduce an effective programme which, while meeting that requirement, is also less costly on both taxpayers and farmers and to seek to develop technology to finally earadicate TB.  Work on this programme is well advanced and I hope to publish it on Wednesday.  I am, therefore, not in a position to comment in detail at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The level of bovine tuberculosis in Ireland is low with more than 99 per cent of the seven million animals in the national herd clear of the disease.  The remaining incidence is essentially <Col N="749" /> residual infection which has been difficult to reduce.  At the same time, we must keep essential control arrangements in place if we are to maintain our trading status and our access to EU and Third Country markets.</P>
    <P>In the context of a request for funding in respect of Ireland's programme for 1996, the EU Commission recently sent a mission to Ireland.  I met the mission representatives on Friday last and impressed on them the need for a positive recommendation to the Commission in relation to providing funding for the 1995 TB programme particularly in recognition both of the degree of rotation achieved and the efforts made to implement the approved programme. I also stressed the importance of having EU support for the efforts now being made to introduce revised arrangements from 1996 onwards.  The mission has not given its conclusions on the visit; instead, it will draw up a report which will be taken into account in considering the provision of funding for the 1995 programme and for later years.</P>
    <P>The £20.3 million current administration costs of the national scheme is comprised of the salary, superannuation and office/laboratory accommodation costs of my Department's administrative, veterinary, technical, research and laboratory staff.  The actual number of staff involved has fallen by 15 per cent over the past seven years.  On putting a new scheme regime in place, I am prepared in the context of the strategic management initiative and reorganisation to have an assessment undertaken by an independent consultancy firm into the staffing levels and other resources required to deliver the agreed programme from 1996 onwards.</P>
    <P>In relation to compensation, my Department operates a scheme of grants which supplement the slaughter value of reactors and is designed to bridge the difference between the slaughter price and the cost of an equivalent average commercial replacement animal.  In addition, herdowners whose herds are depopulated totally or partially in the interests of disease control <Col N="750" /> may also qualify for depopulation grants and income supplement.</P>
    <P>It is now widely recognised from research to date that badgers can play a significant role in the transmission of bovine TB to cattle.  Given the difficulties in adequately preventing TB spread by badgers with currently available methods, substantial resources and efforts have been assigned to the development and delivery of vaccines for use on the badger population.  A submission for funding for a TB vaccine development project in collaboration with other countries was submitted to the European Commission in April of this year.  In addition there are eight separate ongoing research projects quantifying the role of wildlife funded by my Department at a cost of approximately £500,000 per annum.  It is envisaged that this scientific research will continue for the foreseeable future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister outline the position regarding the involvement of the veterinary profession in any scheme he may introduce in the future? There is deep concern about the attempt by the Minister to break the farmer-vet link.  On a television programme earlier this week, he mentioned privatising the scheme.  What would be the up front costs of privatisation?  How will he ensure the testing takes place? What evidence does the Minister have that &ldquo;soft tests&rdquo; have taken place up to now?  All the evidence points to the contrary, based on departmental spot testing carried out this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I intended to consult the veterinary union once we agreed detailed proposals with the funders of the scheme, that is, the Department of Finance, on behalf of the taxpayers and the farm organisations which pay considerable levies through milk and slaughter premia payments.  Those discussions are due to culminate next week and I will be happy to send the Deputy a copy of the proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main focus of the annual round will be to switch from a position where <Col N="751" /> the Department organises the test, commissions it through the DVO and pays for it.  Farmers will be obliged, within phasing arrangements, to carry out the test and pay for it.  However, there will be a substantial reduction in the levies, which will be greater than the cost of doing the text.  The vet-farmer link will be such that the farmer can select his own vet in conjunction with DVO. Those tests will not be rotated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister confirm that the level of rotation testing achieved this year was not higher than 2 or 3 per cent of the national herd?  Was this the basis of the Minister's statement that he sought to convince the Commission of the degree of rotation achieved?  The third and fourth phases represent only 10 per cent of the national herd and even if one took the most optimistic estimate of the Department, that 20 per cent of those phases were rotated, it means that 2 or 3 per cent of the national herd was rotated.  I again ask the Minister to outline the up front costs of the privatisation proposal. How is the Minister seeking to eliminate the administrative costs of the existing scheme, which represents over 34 per cent of its cost?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>The level of rotation in 1995 is primarily related to the third phase which is proceeding.  A number of vets are co-operating and PVPs have been hired to do it.  The decision on whether we will qualify for EU funding, notwithstanding the IVU's effective boycott of the scheme, will depend on an audit by EU officials that is likely to take place next spring.  However, it is our view, despite the IR difficulties we faced, that we deserve EU funding for proceeding unilaterally in 1995.  There is a separate scheme for next year.

I have released phase four and phases five and six could still be rotated.  I have at all times valiantly attempted to implement a scheme I inherited.  I am not entirely critical of the scheme but the IVU decided to boycott it and effectively jeopardise the EU funds.  I have moved on to a different scheme for 1996 but our bona fides have been established by the efforts we made in hiring outside people and persisting with it in the face of a dispute.  The money sought from the EU should be paid.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4, 13, 17, 19, 45 and 74 together.</P>
      <P>The disadvantaged areas appeals panel was appointed in 1991 to examine appeals from groups in areas dissatisfied with the results of the fourth review of disadvantaged areas.  A survey of all farmers in areas under appeal was undertaken early in 1992, and the results were examined by the panel, culminating in a recommendation in respect of certain areas which met the criteria as laid down by the EU Commission.  The panel's recommendations were submitted to the EU Commission in November 1993.</P>
      <P>Due to pressure of work, the Commission services did not complete its examination of the data before the end of 1994.  Indeed, at a meeting in December 1994 between the Department and the Commission, further information was sought in respect of both the extension and reclassification proposals and this was provided in April 1995.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At this time, I had a number of meetings with Commissioner Fischler, at which I impressed on him the urgency of having this matter concluded quickly <Col N="755" /> and he agreed to expedite matters in the hope that both the extension and reclassification submissions could be concluded as soon as possible in 1995.  Since then, work on the reclassification dossier was completed with Commission approval of the newly reclassified areas on 27 October.  Work on the extension has, however, been more difficult with the Commission services looking for further data, which had to be collected during the summer.  More importantly, the Commission indicated that it had a major difficulty with the interpretation of the stocking density criterion which had been given to the appeals panel. This issue has still to be resolved but I am pushing very hard to have this done at a very early date and appropriate Commission proposals made to the Council.</P>
    <P>Following approval by the Commission, the extension proposals then have to be approved by both the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament, so it is not possible to be precise as to when the list of new areas will be released.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister outline in more detail the Commission's queries regarding the stocking density criterion? Will he confirm the criteria for considering the further extension of the scheme in 1991 was agreed with the Commission when the appeals panel was set up?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I could provide details but I do not wish to do anything which would show that I accept the Commission's perspective on this matter. They relate to a legal interpretation of a stocking density and a rounding off, either upwards or downwards, of figures.  Following a meeting in January with Commissioner Flynn and detailed correspondence, I spoke on the telephone to the Commissioner this morning to acknowledge that the position cannot be resolved at a technical level. For a number of reasons I have made a political appeal to have this approved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are essentially two problems, <Col N="756" /> the first of which relates to the non-contiguous elements of island sites about which there has never been much optimism and the other to stocking density. We are considering reaggregation and maximising it.  One of the factors is that sheep headage applications are due in December.  The matter is, therefore, urgent.  We need to move ahead so that those being included for the first time can gain the benefits in 1996.  That was always my intention.  I am trying to secure the right result as quickly as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister confirm that the criteria laid down when the appeals panel was established were agreed with the Commission?  At what stage will we see a result which will ensure that the integrity of the application is respected?  Will the Minister confirm that he will deliver on the commitment to secure a rate of 100 per cent in the same way as it was secured in the case of the application for reclassification?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>To avoid ambiguity and being accused of being disingenuous I am not in a position to give any guarantees, much as I would like to do so, about securing a rate of 100 per cent.  It will be extremely difficult to secure this figure in the case of island areas.  Where someone is unsuccessful in their appeal the area secretary will be notified as to the reasons, be it on tillage, income or stocking density grounds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have trawled through the files relating to the fourth review undertaken in 1991 to try to find the documentation to which the Deputy has referred, but unfortunately clear-cut documentation of that nature does not exist.  If, however, the Deputy can adduce any evidence to that effect, it will prove most helpful in our current arguments. I cannot find any documentation relating to the interpretation of stocking density which would establish beyond doubt, to the satisfaction of the Commission, that clearance was given.  It <Col N="757" /> refutes this.  That is one of the points of difficulty.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister confirm that the criteria applied by the appeals panel were precisely the same as those applied pre-1991 and that that was a fair and honest assumption upon which to proceed?  Will he confirm that Mr. Sheehy, Mr. Donnelly, Mr. McCarthy and others members of the panel were fully <i>au fait</i> with the scheme and that the submission made is on all fours with the criteria previously accepted by the Commission?  Is it not the case that its legal and technical objections are merely a smokescreen to deny those areas which meet the criteria inclusion on appeal?  An attempt is being made to dilute our entitlements.  I expect the Minister to be more aggressive in rejecting and refuting this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I attribute no blame to the appeals panel which applied the criteria laid down by the Department.  I have indicated to the Commission that there is no extra cost involved as the total allocation of Structural Funds in respect of headage payments has already been agreed.  It is not, therefore, a question of money but legal interpretation.  The Commission has stated that the stocking rule is one livestock unit or less per hectare.  In the interpretation the figure of 1.04 was rounded off.  This means that anything above the figure of one livestock unit is excluded.  This is extremely unfair given that the parcel of land involved is very small in the overall context.  Either way, as the total amount of land involved will be in excess of 1.5 per cent the matter will have to be dealt with by the Parliament and Commission.</P>
      <P>On the question of reclassification, we could have signed off earlier, but I insisted that the two be taken together. All that was required was a Commission decision.</P>
      <P>I am not happy with this outcome, and I am still not accepting it.  I have asked Commissioner Flynn to make a special effort within the next week.</P>

      <P>I am glad the Minister acknowledged that this review commenced when Fianna Fáil was in Government.  At least some of the consultants appointed are doing some work.  Will the Minister indicate if an all-island approach will be adopted in the strategic plan for the timber industry and whether it will include a land use policy?  Many farmers are concerned about the type of land becoming available for forestry.  On the one hand, there is a need to develop the timber industry and, on the other, to devise a land use policy to maximise agricultural output of farmers who seek this land in their area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>My colleague, the Minister for the Environment, is obliged under the Programme for Government to devise such a policy, on which the Minister of State, Deputy Deenihan, is working.  A number of aspects include Northern Ireland.  A Northern-based company, Balcas, which accounts for one-quarter of Coillte sales, is integrating and rationalising sawmilling capacity on the whole island.  This is of considerable significance.  On administrative matters, such as environmental considerations, Forbairt grant aid or developments at the wood processing level, we can operate within our jurisdiction only.  I am very anxious to develop forestry on an all-island basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This overall plan, which encompasses site consultations with the Department of Finance, has taken up a huge amount of my time in so far as the Forestry Service of my Department has had to undertake the task which, in my view, the consultants did not do adequately. There were apparent contradictions and errors in their data.  We were very disappointed with their study to the extent that we did not pay the full cost of the <Col N="760" /> study and are disputing it.  This is the principal reason for the delay.  By the end of this month I hope to have completed internal preparations for this plan, after which we will request the observations of other Departments. Deputy Cowen will be familiar with this procedure.  At this point I am involving the Department of Finance because it entails huge investment assumptions to the year 2015, incorporating annual planting levels of 25,000 hectares, European Union-led grant aid, a breakdown of public and private forestry involving Coillte Teoranta, the overall issue of the selling of timber, transparency of sawmilling prices and environmental aspects.  I foresee this being one of the key growth sectors of our economy with the potential to create many thousands of jobs, through group outputs and exports, on which there are no European Union limitations.  I consider this overall area to be extremely important and regret the delays that have occurred to date.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister give me the benefit of his views on two aspects, first in relation to many small sawmills which in any rationalisation drive might be driven out of business. As the Minister will be aware, they have been endeavouring to remain viable. They complain about lack of availability of raw materials from Coillte Teoranta and some discriminatory practices in terms of obtaining raw materials.  Would the Minister agree that many small sawmills have been able to gain access to some niche markets in which larger sawmills are not really interested?  Will the Minister ensure that whatever strategy is adopted will not sound the death knell of many small sawmilling operations, some located in my constituency at places such as Clonaslee and Mountrath, where nothing else exists to provide employment?  Would the Minister agree it is crucial that such companies not be put out of business in the name of rationalisation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Would the Minister also accept the <Col N="761" /> crying need for a labour-intensive maintenance programme in many of our State forests?  Whenever one talks to people who formerly worked in the Forestry Service, they claim much work remains to be done in maintaining and pruning many of these young forests and the fact that we have not been doing so adequately ultimately means we do not reap the type of product required.  Has the Minister any views on obtaining contract labour, if he cannot appoint staff permanently, to address this issue, which is of acute concern to many people in the industry?</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Deputy's first question about sawmills, I have had detailed discussions with the Irish Timber Council, with individual sawmillers and others and am very aware of the difficulty.  The difficulty is that sawmills have the capacity, even on a single shift, to deal with more than twice the amount of timber available.  In other words, there is a mismatch, involving a monopolistic raw material supplier, Coillte Teoranta.  Under whatever system one supplies or sells timber there is not sufficient to go around.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am insisting on a fair, transparent, market-oriented sales system, with a reserve price, in circumstances in which Coillte Teoranta cannot act as judge and jury in the manner in which it sells timber.  It is on that basis only their involvement in equity ownership in the sawmilling sector can be considered.  I am conscious of the employment potential of small sawmills.  While some have market niches, I perceive a specific difficulty with larger sawmills, half a dozen of which are internationally competitive.  They need dual shifts to be viable, whereas a smaller operator can obtain local supplies at niche level.  This must be dealt with on a market-oriented basis.  There are some court cases pending in relation to the sales system.  In negotiations with foresters, Coillte Teoranta and my officials, I am very anxious to move forward on this path so that we obtain a fair return on our forests in <Col N="762" /> addition to having a transparent, market-orientated system of selling timber.</P>
    <P>I do have concerns about the quality of forests in the course of growth, both within Coillte Teoranta and the private sector.  In terms of quality control and premia payments &mdash; afforestation grants stretch over a period of 15 to 20 years &mdash;it is my intention to impose fairly rigorous and tough standards so that the output of trees per acre is as high as possible, involving labour-intensive activity.</P>
    <P>At a technical level, I am happy to support what Deputy Cowen has said. Obviously, Coillte Teoranta is involved in a cost-cutting drive.  It has transformed its financial position and its product is an accruing asset to the taxpayer for which I, as shareholder, have responsibility.  Notwithstanding cost control, I will ensure that the quality control aspects of forestry production are adhered so as to maximise output.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Whenever one travels throughout Europe, one observes many small sawmills.  Would the Minister agree that our sawmills are unable to compete with the larger, foreign counterparts to whom most log timber is supplied and that, despite representations from many Members, this has continued to be the case.  Will the Minister devise a policy that will not only help existing smaller sawmills but create other labour-intensive ones?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Given that tree planting has increased tenfold over the past decade, all this extra output must be exported.  It is a most competitive business involving the United Kingdom and European countries, in particular Scandinavian ones.  Those sawmillers who have invested £3 million or £4 million in sawmilling technology &mdash; the latest scanning technology making maximum use of timber, with fewer shavings, bark and so on &mdash; will readily acknowledge that such technology facilities are necessary.  Therefore I could not devise a system whereby small sawmillers would obtain timber at the expense of others <Col N="763" /> who are internationally competitive.  As the extra production of trees comes on stream, capacity and availability of timber raw material will come into synchronisation.  We need to develop an orderly process, not involving widespread rationalisation but perhaps advancing a case for amalgamations, consolidation and joint ventures.  We need a two-tier approach encompassing small companies that can prosper in particular niches while having three, four or five really large companies, even multinationals, that can compete with the best worldwide, thus forming the basis of a market for all these trees.</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of proposals have recently been put forward in regard to a milk quota-related initiative in the Border areas in the context of the peace process.  I support any initiatives which would secure additional quota in these regions, especially for small scale producers.  The Deputy will appreciate, however, that granting additional quota is a sensitive matter within the EU.  If there is to be any hope of success for this idea it is, therefore, essential that it be fully supported by the UK as well as <Col N="764" /> the Irish authorities and that it be pursued within the EU in a suitable negotiating context.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith" hpid="Mr. B. Smith Mr. B. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister accept that with increasing buoyancy in world markets for butter and milk powders this is an opportune time to seek additional milk quota and that the increased milk supply should not be left entirely to non-European countries? Furthermore, will the Minister accept that the operational programme to promote peace and reconciliation is an obvious mechanism for seeking additional quota, given that two of the stated aims of that programme are to promote rural and urban regeneration and create employment, particularly as the majority of farmers on both sides of the Border depend on dairying which accounts for one third of agricultural output in the entire region?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with the Deputy's first point.  The world price of milk is 56p a gallon.  Ireland's dairy farmers are getting £1.13.  That is because of the quota regime.  High prices are based on restricted production.  Farmers in New Zealand can produce as much milk as they like, but at 56p a gallon.  I am open to the idea of looking at B quotas and so on, but it is nonsensical to think that we can dismantle the quota system and maintain dairy farmers' income.  As to the cross-Border proposal, we have had discussions with the Department of Agriculture in Northern Ireland, and I am very supportive of any measure. However, I have been advised in the strongest, most explicit terms that if this were to go through the normal channels of DG6, the SAC and so on, it would be rejected by the Council.  It has to be parachuted in as a political proposal unrelated to the normal agricultural procedures.  In that regard, Mr. Hogg, the British Minister, is coming to Dublin on Monday.  I will be having discussions with him and this will be high on my agenda.  There are already indications that the Scottish and Welsh Secretaries <Col N="765" /> of State are not prepared to give fulsome support to this proposal because it would trigger similar requests in the UK.  First I have to get the UK on board &mdash; I am working intensively on that &mdash; and then try to handle it in a non-agricultural dimension.  Every country in Europe wants increased milk quota which is not available.  We must, therefore, find a non-dairy argument to advance this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith" hpid="Mr. B. Smith Mr. B. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not suggest that the present quota regime should be dismantled.  I said that the operational programme to promote peace and reconciliation was an obvious mechanism for advancing the proposal.  It is at the political level that the Minister should try to advance this.  A relatively small percentage of quota would be of major benefit to the disadvantaged Border counties which have suffered tremendously over the years due to the political difficulties.  One of the stated aims of this operational programme is to promote rural regeneration.  There is no better way to promote rural regeneration than to have increased agricultural activity.</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I am doing.  It is our best opinion that if we were to submit this proposal to the Agricultural Commission as it stands it would be rejected.  It would be blocked by every other member state, and it might not even have the support of Britain.  The plan is to work up the proposal with the British authorities, to overcome the Welsh and Scottish difficulties, and to make a special case, perhaps through the President of the Commission or <Col N="766" /> through the Anglo-Irish process.  I am fully supportive of the fact that milk quota is the best way to ensure the maximum number of family farms North and South of the Border.  I thought I heard the Deputy say that it is unfair that European farmers are restricted in their production while other farmers in New Zealand and so on are allowed increase production when there are market opportunities.  Let us be in no doubt that in Europe milk production exceeds milk consumption by about 120 per cent.  There could be a temporary benefit in relation to Russian purchases of butter or an abatement of production in New Zealand and Australia which might not be permanent factors. it would be wrong to jeopardise the buoyancy of the milk sector by dismantling the quota system in any way at this time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>At present Teagasc and the Department regard 30,000 gallons as the viability threshold of a dairy farm.  Is the Minister considering the possibility of raising that threshold, given that the economics of milk production are continuously under pressure?  Does the Minister feel there is a need to modify the ring-fencing arrangement to take account of farms with a milk quota that does not reach the magical 30,000 gallon viability threshold and which are just outside the disadvantaged area boundary, having regard to the fact that they have the same soil type and operate similar farm practices as farms inside the disadvantaged area?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>These are general knowledge questions on the dairy sector.  I am quite happy to entertain them, but they are far removed from the Border peace proposal for extra quota.  The quota system is assured until the year 2000.  My best guess is that it will continue for some time after that.  There may be a two-tiered approach, or changes in the butter regime with the possibility of introducing a dairy cow premium, as originally proposed by the then Commissioner Ray MacSharry, which would <Col N="767" /> lower the cost of butter and make it competitive with other yellow fats.</P>
      <P>I have an open mind on the question of the 30,000 gallon quota.  However, the reality is that milk under the restructuring scheme dried up because of the cheque book approach of many people who bought up leases.  For leases under three years I introduced a 10 per cent clawback, and a penalty to prevent overheating.  Certainly, farmers in the 30,000 gallon category or below cannot get enough milk, but increasing the threshold would mean that there would be less milk for those who are eligible.</P>
      <P>Regarding ring-fencing, all I can say is that we have introduced it and I will review it after one year.  If the Deputy has particular concerns of marginal adjustment on the periphery of disadvantaged areas, I will examine that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree there is irrefutable evidence to support special measures for the Border region?  The figures for a co-operative in Monaghan in which I was involved all my life before entering politics indicate that between 1984 and 1992 there was a reduction of 36 per cent; 1,176 people went out of milk production and there were 16 new entrants over that period. Forty-four per cent of farmers in north Monaghan and 30 per cent in south Monaghan gave up dairying.  North Monaghan has suffered most from the reclassification of areas.  Would the Minister also agree that small quotas do not justify the expenditure required to meet quality demands and that farmers cannot secure the funding to do so?  This creates a catch-22 situation with the result that most farmers opt out of dairying, ending up with no income from their farms, and they are not even in the severely handicapped area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>When the quota regime was introduced in 1984 we were given a commitment that in the event of increase quota becoming available Ireland's special case would be looked at in view of the importance of the industry to our economy.  The situation in the Border regions applies equally to all other areas.  Dairying is by far the most popular farming enterprise.  Yet the number of dairy farmers has decreased from 80,000 top 40,000 since the quota regime was introduced, while the technical people estimate that there will be fewer than 30,000 dairy farmers by the end of the decade.  Does the Minister agree that all the evidence points to the necessity for him to make the strongest possible case in Brussels for an improvement in our quota?  Since the quota regime was introduced our quota has been reduced by 8 per cent in national terms while the Italian quota has been increased by 11 per cent and the Greek quota has been increased by 20 per cent.  Given the points made by Border Deputies today, the findings of the <i>Clare Leader</i> study, the trend in the dairy industry and the commitment heralded by the then Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Deasy, in 1984, will the Minister do everything possible to secure an increase in the quota for the many farmers who will go out of business if they do not get a quota? Approximately 50 per cent of quota holders have only 22 per cent of the quota.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be happy to take any measure likely to secure an increase in <Col N="769" /> the national quota.  I have raised with my officials the increases in the quotas for Italy and Greece which were determined when the Deputy's august party was in office.  The best advice available to me is that there was a dispute about the method of calculation of the national quotas for Italy and Greece and this led to the increase.  No country has been given extra quota <i>per se.</i> Rather, there was a suspension of 4.5 per cent of the quota and this was made permanent.  The farm organisations and others took a case to court but lost &mdash; the Commission strongly resisted it.  The Commission has been very firm on the reduction of quota over the years and I have been advised that there is no likelihood of an increased quota.  I will be happy to pursue any means of securing an increased quota.</P>

The likely negative pressures are budgetary commitments, GATT commitments in terms of reducing the volume and value of export refunds which will put pressure on market prices in future years and enlargement.  There is a real prospect of overheating, land and quota prices which might not be sustained in the long-term.  I would be sanguine about that type of projection.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry</askee>
      <Quest>the reason for the difference in the definition of a cow arising from the fact that his Department defines the term for suckler cow premium purposes as an animal that has calved at least once in her life and for the purpose of headage as an animal either in calf or with a calf at foot; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[14836/95]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the EU that defines a cow for the purposes of the EU suckler cow premium schemes.  Council Regulation EEC 2066/92 defines such an animal, as &ldquo;a cow belonging to meat breed or born of a cross with a meat breed, and belonging to a herd intended for rearing calves for meat production&rdquo;&mdash; a definition which makes obvious the fact that the cow must have calved at least once in her lifetime, in other words that she is not a heifer.</P>
      <P>Under the disadvantaged areas schemes, however, my Department has the freedom to define a beef cow for grant payment purposes as there is no prescribed EU definition of a cow under those schemes and as each member state part-finances the schemes.</P>
      <P>For the purposes of the cattle headage and beef cow headage schemes, therefore, cows in beef herds are regarded as beef type suckler cows if they are (a) of a suitable type and standard, (b) in milk and (c) accompanied by a calf of a beef breed, or, if not in milk and not accompanied by a calf, are in-calf to a beef bull and due to calve by 31 December in year of application.  In such herds, in-calf beef type heifers of suitable type and standard, bred to a beef bull may also be regarded as beef type suckler cows for payment purposes if they calve by 31 December.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>However, in mixed enterprise herds an animal will only be regarded as a beef type suckler cow if it is of a suitable type and standard and suckling a calf of a beef breed at application date and at inspection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course, the fact that certain in-calf heifers which calve by the end of the calendar year are paid headage grants equivalent to those paid on cows does <Col N="775" /> not mean that those animals are defined as cows by my Department at the application date &mdash; they are simply heifers which become cows by the end of the year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for that very clear and lucid answer.  The Minister has introduced a charter of farmers' rights but does he consider it discriminatory that one type of cow is worth £20 and another type of cow is only worth £10 in premium payments?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>My understanding of the problem in layman's language is that in-calf heifers are acceptable under the schemes as replacements, should an eligible cow die, but they are not acceptable on the original application form. This difficulty has existed since the scheme began in 1991-92.  This EU rule has been reviewed before unsuccessfully and my officials do not hold out much hope of it being changed but certainly I can discuss it with DGVI if necessary.</P>

      <P>Some of the difficulties which the Minister outlined in a description of the suckler cow scheme will arise in a situation where a small dairy farm enterprise is run side by side with a suckled cow enterprise.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, my Department will be happy to advise anyone in that regard.  In disadvantaged areas there is greater flexibility as indicated in the reply.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason that cows in mixed enterprise herds for whom the farmer has submitted an application for suckling cow grant aid under the disadvantaged area scheme must be seen is that it is the only way of knowing in August or September, which is the inspection period, whether a cow in a herd which calved earlier in the year is a dairy cow or a beef cow; if the former she would have a calf at foot and if the latter she would not have a calf at foot.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>We need to look at the guidelines for the operation of twin enterprises.  I appeal to the Minister to look at them and ascertain from the inspectors throughout the country the day-to-day problems that have arisen during inspection.  A number of farmers with very small dairy enterprises side by side with suckler cow enterprises run into serious difficulties in those circumstances.  In many cases they have been deprived of payment.</P>

      <P>The deseasonalisation slaughter premium is payable in member states where the number of steers slaughtered in the period 1 September to 30 November of the second preceding year exceeds 40 per cent of annual steer slaughterings.  On that basis, the deseasonalisation slaughter premium will be payable in Ireland in 1996.  This scheme is designed to encourage a better seasonal spread of slaughterings in regions with traditional seasonal imbalances in <Col N="777" /> production.  It has been very successful in Ireland in meeting this objective. There is a problem &mdash; emerging in Ireland this autumn &mdash; that that success would jeopardise the continuation of the scheme, i.e. cause slaughterings in the relevant period to fall below the 40 per cent limit, and thus cause a return to the previous seasonality patterns.  In view of this, I have asked the European Commission, as part of a review of the scheme later this year, to propose a reduction in the trigger to 35 per cent in order to guarantee payment of the premium in 1997 and future years.  This request is at present being considered by the Commission services.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>We are still within that period and there are some weeks to go before we know what the actual outcome will be.  A rough guess is somewhere circa 36 per cent, but that is not an official figure.  We await the figures. Anything that meat processors can do to slaughter as much in the last week of November as opposed to the first week of December would be greatly appreciated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is worth come £15 million to Ireland.  I do not think we will make the 40 per cent criteria.  Last year we made it by less than 0.5 per cent, the figure of 40 to 41 per cent secures payment for 1996.  This has been a victim of its own success.  The seasonality pattern of stock coming off grass in the autumn is changing because of the extra £58 a head that farmers get from 1 January to April and tapering out after that.  That has meant that more people have held on to stock and therefore the seasonality problem has been greatly resolved.  Given the <Col N="778" /> success of the scheme, it would be unfair to make it a stop go exercise as we would revert to a seasonality problem once the premium is lost.  I am giving this matter my attention and I hope it will be retained.</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>There is little variation in the pattern of live exports throughout the year.  While we could revise the method of calculation to include the seasonality of live exports, that would not improve the figures.  The percentage that falls in the period in question is irrespective of the total number slaughtered, which is a separate argument.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>Due to the importance of the deseasonalisation premium for winter fatteners and the 5 per cent reduction in boneless rather than carcase beef &mdash; which puts us at a disadvantage with the Germans and others &mdash; and as export refunds have tumbled by 21 per cent for live exports and 13.5 per cent for beef exports, does the Minister agree that the deseasonalisation premium is crucial for farmers with winter fatteners?  Is he optimistic that the premium will be obtained?  If he fails to obtain it on the basis of reducing the threshold to 35 per cent, does he agree that to average the figure over a three or five year period would at least assure us of obtaining it?  Will he confirm that irrespective of whether the figure is 36 per cent or 40 per cent, due to our seasonal cycle in beef production the premium should be paid?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Seasonality in beef production has reduced greatly.  More farmers have cattle wintering facilities and do not sell off the grass.  I agree that we should seek to retain the premium but I cannot say what the outcome will be.  If the figure for slaughterings between 1 September and 30 November is below 35 per cent, I have been advised that the <Col N="779" /> prospect of a satisfactory outcome is bleak.  If the percentage is higher we can argue it is a marginal adjustment.  This should not be a black and white issue in that we get all or none of the premium. The figure should be reduced proportionately.  The scheme has been an outstanding success.  As, essentially, Ireland is the only country that avails of it, other member states do not think highly of it.  When we know the figures at 30 November I will devise the best strategy to ensure maximum payments under the DSP.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>While acknowledging the difficulties facing the Minister in this area, if the premium is not obtained the live trade will become more competitive and profitable for beef producers.  Due to our unique position in Europe as the producer of grass-based beef, would the Minister make a special case to retain the premium at the present level for beef farmers who fatten in the off season?  There should not be a percentage clause.  It is important that we encourage farmers who produce beef off season.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the sentiments expressed by the Deputy but if there is not a quantifiable seasonality problem, compensation cannot be obtained.  I take his point that meat processors have a particular advantage in the period of the DSP because those premiums are not paid on the live cattle trade. However, the recent cuts in refunds on live exports, which are greater than on meat exports, have levelled the playing pitch.  Farmers with winter fatteners paid far too much for store cattle this autumn.  As there is no case to be made for those high prices, I caution farmers against paying them.</P>

      <P>I am not complacent about the cuts in export refunds, I have rigorously expressed my opposition to them. <Col N="780" /> I raised the matter at the last Council meeting.  The commission has repeatedly said that every time there is a cut in refunds, the price of cattle increased. Cattle prices are buoyant at present, but should the market turn around, I will seek to have the refunds restored.  They have not had the effect of reducing prices.</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not have the final figures.  During the deseasonalisation assessment period steer slaughterings fell by 10.5 per cent compared with the same period in 1994.  Steer slaughterings are unlikely to exceed 238,000 during the relevant period this year.  The issue of the figure for live exports is a separate question, but it was approximately 270,000 or 280,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the deseasonalisation premium, will the Minister explain why the reduction in the beef export refunds last Friday relates to boneless processed beef only and not carcase beef?  As that is the type of beef we sell to Iran, Russia and elsewhere, this cut will affect us more than our EU competitors, particularly Germany who have not suffered a similar reduction.  Will the Minister also confirm that it is vital the deseasonalisation premium is paid this year because due to the reduction in export refunds the spring trade will not be as buoyant as the autumn trade?  Given the tight margins under which winter fatteners must work, it is vital that we receive the £15 million.  The figure can be averaged over the previous five years or the threshold can be reduced.  As the Minister stated, this scheme is the result of successful negotiations carried out by his predecessor, Deputy Walsh.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>The DSP for 1996 is assured.  It is the 1997 premium that is in doubt.  I am committed to deploying <Col N="781" /> whatever negotiating strategy is necessary to obtain the premium.  I spoke to Commissioner Fischler about the matter.  We will have to await the figures at the end of November.  It is important that as many animals as possible are slaughtered in the last week of November as opposed to the first week in December.  I appeal to farmers considering selling cattle and to meat processors to bear that in mind.</P>
      <P>The cuts in export refunds introduced last Friday were not put to the beef management committee.  A vote was not taken on the matter.  It was not a correct decision and runs counter to assurances given to me by Commissioner Fischler some weeks previously.  I will table this matter on the agenda for the meeting on 29-30 November.  When I tabled it last month I got considerable support from the French, German and Austrian Ministers.  This stop-go policy on the suspension of prefixed schemes and the cutting of refunds is undermining the beef regime.  The Commission would be well advised to review its <i>modus operandi</i> in this regard.  I am not satisfied that it has taken into account the position of member states, such as Ireland, that export 90 per cent of their beef output.</P>

In relation to the disposal of the various types of plastics used on farms my Department's role is confined to <Col N="782" /> encouraging good environmentally friendly farming practices.  My officials advise farmers to collect and store all plastic on the farm and reuse as much of it as possible.  Some plastic, such as the plastic film used to bale silage, cannot be reused and should be disposed of in approved landfill sites.  In this regard, participants in the rural environment protection scheme operated by my Department are required to dispose of all unusable plastic in this manner.</P>

It established that the heavy contamination of such material when used in agriculture mitigates against successful recycling. The study concluded that under current economic conditions recycling polythene film is not economically viable. The Minister of State, Deputy Deenihan, recently met personnel in a company and I am sure he will meet any company from the Deputy's constituency.

      <P>I wish to advise the House of the following matters in respect of which notice has been given under Standing Order 20 and the name of the Member in each case: (1) Deputy Andrews &mdash; the Government's <Col N="829" /> intentions in relation to the imposition of VAT on golf course green fees in light of the adverse effect this would have on the tourism industry; (2) Deputy O'Rourke &mdash; the current position regarding Irish Steel in light of the fact that the attitude of British Steel and the UK Government has hardened considerably over the last few days against the Irish Government's case.</P>
      <P>The matters raised by Deputies Andrews and O'Rourke have been selected for discussion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this policy. At one time housing policy was determined according to party philosophy. One group in society thought the only way to tackle the issue was to provide local authority housing while others argued that the private market would cater for all housing needs.  The correct approach lies between those two extremes.  I am happy with the Government's approach to housing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Funding is necessary if housing policy is to be implemented.  I welcome the thoughtful approach given to housing policy and the involvement of voluntary groups in this area, in particular Respond, St. Vincent De Paul and the <Col N="830" /> rural resettlement group.  The latter group will make a presentation tomorrow to the Select Committee on Social Affairs.  That group proved we can tackle the problem of rural depopulation and urban sprawl in a new way. We must do what we can to fund such groups.  State funding, effective work by the local authorities and the involvement of local groups bring a new dynamic to this area.</P>
    <P>Extra money was provided in 1995 and I hope the Minister will succeed in giving extra funding to local authorities in 1996.  There is no point in having good ideas or schemes if we do not have sufficient funds to implement them.  I hope the Minister is successful in maintaining the budget for 1996.</P>
    <P>The Minister serves in an important and interesting Department and can choose the areas on which to spend the money allocated to it.  In the Department of Social Welfare, for example, the money must be used to fund priority areas and there is little room for choice. The Minister has indicated a willingness to look at new ways and means of spending money which is having an effect at local level.</P>
    <P>Cork County Council welcomes the increase in funding received in 1995.  For example, it is ironic that many of the projects for which funding was made available this year have not yet started. It is seldom that money made available is not spent and the system in that regard needs to be reviewed.  Local authority management, engineering staff and officials point out that there are delays with the tendering and bonding systems.  It is regrettable that when money is made available for housing programmes it is not possible to start projects immediately.  Difficulties with tendering and issuing insurance bonds must be dealt with to ensure that money made available for a certain year is spent in that year.</P>
    <P>Despite the improvements in terms of policy and finance a genuine housing <Col N="831" /> problem still exists.  Many Members are also a member of a local authority and, like me, I am sure that on a weekly basis they meet a large number of people with housing problems.  When I was first elected to the local authority in 1985 the number of people requiring local authority housing was smaller than at present.  It seemed that only people from a certain sector of society sought local authority housing, but at present people from every walk of life make demands on local authorities in terms of housing.  Perhaps that is the reason for the increase in housing problems.  New policies and an increase in finance are needed to solve these problems.  I look forward to new ideas from the Minister of State, Deputy McManus, during the term of this Government.</P>
    <P>Deputy Quill and others referred to rent subsidies payable through health boards.  A total of £54 million was provided in 1994 for rent and mortgage subsidies.  I accept the money was needed by those people but it would be possible to build up to 1,500 local authority houses with that amount.  There is a genuine fear that the very effective system of mortgage and rent subsidies creates problems instead of solving them.  At one time most people were unaware of the health board rent subsidy.  If rent on a flat or house was beyond a person's means they would dismiss the possibility of obtaining that accommodation, or alternatively the landlord might reduce the rent. However, people can now afford accommodation at £60, £70 or £80 per week because they receive a rent subsidy from the health board.  Landlords are the beneficiaries of this scheme.</P>
    <P>In many cases accommodation is of very poor standard.  There should be close monitoring of the condition of accommodation subsidised by the State and money should not be made available for accommodation that is not fit for human habitation.  In view of the fact <Col N="832" /> that up to £60 million will be spent in 1995 on rent and mortgage subsidies we must ensure that money solves problems, not creates them, as is the case in some instances at present.</P>
    <P>I agree that problems arise for young unemployed people who remain in the home in that they are entitled to a minimal rate of social welfare.  If, however, they leave home and rent a flat they receive not only full social welfare but also a health board subsidy towards the cost of accommodation.  The Minister should discuss this matter with her colleague, the Minister for Social Welfare, because it is unacceptable to almost force young people from the family home to obtain full social welfare entitlement.  The State is not saving one penny from that system because the money saved in social welfare is lost in rent subsidies.  Young unemployed people living at home should be entitled to full social welfare.  That would save anguish and chaos as well as much of the money paid at present on rent subsidies.  The Minister should impress on her colleague that changes must be made in this regard.</P>
    <P>When the shared ownership scheme was introduced some years ago most of us welcomed it as a positive measure that would help thousands of people who otherwise could not purchase a home.  Because it was very difficult for local authority staff and public representatives, who are expected to be experts on all matters, to sell the concept of the shared ownership scheme there was a very slow take-up of the scheme.  In the past 12 months or so there has been an increase in take-up but there is much room for improvement in that regard.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will consider some of the rules and regulations governing that scheme, and ensure that local authority staff are available and adequately briefed to sell the concept of shared ownership loans to clients who call to local authority housing office <Col N="833" /> seeking housing advice.  In many instances constituents who inquired about that scheme visited their local authority and discussed the possibility of a shared ownership loan but generally were advised against taking out that form of loan.  Staff in local authority housing offices are ultra cautious and conservative in that regard perhaps because they recognise that scheme is complicated and believe applicants may not be aware of some of the pitfalls associated with it.  It needs further clarification.  We need to impress upon local authority staff that this scheme is a key element of the Government's housing policy and targets should be set for local authorities regarding its take up.</P>
    <P>I welcome changes to the scheme introduced in the 1995 budget and that applicants can now take out a loan for as little as 40 per cent of the value of a house.  A lower loan for a house could not be offered as it would defeat the purpose of introducing responsible home ownership.</P>
    <P>I mentioned to the Minister that a further change to the scheme would be effective.  A mortgage subsidy is available for those who leave local authority houses and purchase or build their own houses.  Anything that can be done should be done to encourage people to leave local authority houses and purchase or build their own houses, thereby making their local authority houses available for more needy tenants.</P>
    <P>I understand why a person who leaves a local authority house and takes out a shared ownership loan does not qualify for a mortgage subsidy but we should consider making a mortgage subsidy available to shared ownership applicants.  Generaly, such applicants come from the bottom of the housing market. They find it difficult to decide to leave the security of their local authority house with a fixed and modest rent and risk taking out a mortgage, whether a full or a shared ownership mortgage. We should do everything possible to <Col N="834" /> encourage those people and should allow them to qualify for a mortgage subsidy.  Perhaps the mortgage subsidy could be made available to applicants whose portion of a shared ownership loan is 65, 70 or 80 per cent.  That would help improve the take up of the shared ownership loan scheme and it would free up local authority housing.  If possible, we should try to solve those two problems together.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister of State review the new house grant scheme?  The new house grant programme is part of a philosophy of helping people to buy or build their own homes and that should be encouraged in so far as possible.  In an ideal society most people would own their homes and few would depend on the State for housing, but we do not live in an ideal society.  Any progress that can be made should be made to encourage people to provide their own housing.  The new house grant of £3,000 has been effective in that regard.  The grant was approximately £2,000 in 1981 or 1982.  On a value for money basis a new house grant of £2,000 in 1981 and 1982, when housing and house building costs were much lower provided a significantly larger proportion of the cost of building or buying a house than the current new house grant.  I accept that finance is limited but I ask the Minister of State to consider increasing the new house grant.  I take the point made by the Minister of State that it can be argued that the new house grant simply adds to the cost of a house and if it is increased from £3,000 to £5,000 every builder in the country will recognise that there is an extra £2,000 profit available and house prices will rise accordingly. That need not necessarily happen, and while the new house grant of £3,000 provides some assistance it does not encourage a sufficient number of people to buy or build new houses and we should review it.</P>
    <P>For 20 years the motor industry has argued the question of diminishing <Col N="835" /> returns.  It argued that if additional incentives were made available, more cars would be sold and more tax would be collected.  During the past 12 months its argument has been tested and proved correct.  A similar argument applies to the housing industry.  If incentives are increased in terms of the rate of grant aid, more people will leave local authoritiy houses and more people from the lower end of the housing market will build or buy their houses.  That will result in more employment in the building industry, a greater amount of tax collected by the Revenue Commissioners and everybody will be better off.  I hope the Minister of State and her colleagues will consider that matter in the 1996 budget.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have an opportunity to contribute to this debate. Any time issues affecting local authorities are debated in the House there is never a shortage of contributors principally because most Members are current or former members of local authorities.  In most instances they speak from experience and reflect the frustrations and difficulties regarding the various matters dealt with by local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Inevitably housing is always a subject of great debate.  We never seem to have enough houses to settle our population. In terms of the social dynamics in the house building industry in many instances as people's incomes improve, they move up the house value scale.  I am sure the technical personnel in the Department of the Environment and at local authority level regularly apply their minds to the question of flexibility in house design.  In terms of the size of houses it is necessary to be mindful of ongoing social changes within a population to ensure that design policies keep in step with people's needs. However, the bottom line of the matter is the unit cost of building houses.  I am <Col N="836" /> sure that will always be borne in mind in the design of a scheme of houses.  It is difficult to consider population settlement policies in isolation from other physical and economic policies implemented at any given time.  We cannot have a stop-go policy, it is a matter of settling on a broad policy and continuing it.</P>
    <P>Because of the concentration of population in Dublin and along the east coast it can be argued that the unit cost of housing is much higher there than it should be.  I could argue that the unit cost of housing would be cheaper in other parts of the country for some reason which, perhaps, only the house building industry can explain.  In the past there was a policy of building large housing estates but there is unanimous agreement that it has been disastrous in social terms.  Most local authorities accept that moving people from different settings in and around an area where it is planned to build a housing scheme to a large scheme of 50 or 100 houses has been disastrous.  The proposals nowadays from local authorities to the Department reflect a smaller number of houses in the schemes being put forward.  That is how it should be.  It is notable that the standard of houses being built by local authorities is improving and the standard of those being built by my local authority in County Louth is exceptional.  The type of house which was built 20, 25 or 30 years ago would not compare with those being built today.</P>
    <P>I have always been interested in the concept of co-operative housing.  I am a firm believer in the self-help concept in communities.  We should have a housing policy that encourages people on the margins to provide a house for themselves or to put their name on the local authority housing list.  There are people in those circumstances and I have in mind seven, eight or nine young couples who need housing.  If local authorities were in a position to provide serviced <Col N="837" /> sites for them they could, collectively organise building houses.  On the basis of the arithmetic I have seen where that co-operative effort has prevailed, the unit cost of the houses is much cheaper. The couples involved have been eternally grateful to those who helped to organise that co-operative effort.  For some reason, which is difficult to understand, it has not caught on.  It may be that people do not want the hassle and bother of organising the co-operative because it is done on a once off basis and the experience gained is not of any subsequent use to others.  It is a pity that the concept could not be expanded and developed.  Perhaps the Department of the Environment would examine the possibility to providing incentives in that area.  It is a matter of targeting a group who are on the margins between being able to provide a house themselves of putting their name down on the local authority housing list.</P>
    <P>I am concerned also at the maintenance costs of local authority houses to local authorities.  It goes without saying it is a huge burden year in year out.  I will not pretend I have a magic formula to come to terms with it, but it is possible to provide incentives for tenants of local authority houses who are on a differential rent scheme.  At the end of the year a merit award could be provided to those who have a minimum maintenance cost during the previous 12 months.  I have no preconceived ideas about a merit award in those circumstances.  I fully realise there may be a hidden administrative cost which is not obvious to me but I think there are possibilities in that area.</P>
    <P>I have listened to many speakers, some of whom referred to the number of young single people who apply for unemployment assistance or support through their local health board.  They are living away from home because of the problems with the means test when living at home.  This matter needs to be addressed because, in the Dundalk area, <Col N="838" /> rented accommodation is at a premium as students in the local regional college seek accommodation.  Young people who are not in third level education leave home and are applying for unemployment assistance.  The reality is that the supply of accommodation is not sufficient to meet the demand that exists. This has the automatic impact of pushing up rental costs.  There is a need for an examination of this problem by the Departments of the Environment, Social Welfare and Health.  There is a need also to do some arithmetic in that area and to bring it into line with reality.</P>
    <P>Another area to which I wish to refer deals with families on the margins of ability to provide for themselves or to put their names on the housing list. Because of an experience with the previous house improvement grant scheme which cost a considerable amount of money the policy makers in the Department have been arguing against its reintroduction.  I am not sure that is wise and it may be time to re-examine it. There are many secondhand houses throughout the country in need of upgrading and improvement.  If an investment could be made in those houses, it could well bring them into the mainstream housing stock and save the Department a considerable amount of money in the continuing demand for local authority housing.  I appreciate that many of the older houses may be beyond the point of repair.  There is a percentage of houses which, if a house improvement grant scheme were available, the owners would seriously consider investing in and making them available either for sale or rental to people in need of rehousing.</P>
    <P>The new house grant scheme at approximately £2,000 has been static for a number of years.  The possibility of a house improvement grant scheme being paid on the basis of income rather than on a set sum under a certain floor area should be examined.  A new house grant scheme to the value of, say, £8,000 or <Col N="839" /> £10,000 would mean that a person could provide their own house instead of automatically going on the local authority rehousing list.  The conventional three bedroom local local authority house costs in the region of £35,000 or £36,000. Clearly, if the Department is prepared to put up the £8,000 or £10,000 that would tilt the balance in favour of those who want to build their own house.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the population settlement policies and would ask officials in the Department or policymakers generally to examine this area again.  Clearly, it is aligned to industrial development policy.  If there are job opportunities in Dundalk, Drogheda or Dublin those are the areas to which people will gravitate.  I query the wisdom of concentrating large sections of population on the east coast instead of looking to the west, the midlands and the south with a view to having a level playing field.  Our population settlement is much more evenly spread. It may be that the huge housing costs in Dublin could be reduced if the demand was reduced.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on one of the most important issues facing politicians, as Deputy Kirk pointed out. We encounter this problem daily and it forms up to 60 per cent of the cases dealt with at our clinics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I warmly congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy McManus, on her achievement in bringing forward the document, &ldquo;Social Housing &mdash; The Way Ahead&rdquo;.  She has added several new and important aspects to the lamentable document produced in 1991.  She has recast it in a way which renews, in effect, the social housing programme. This started in 1993, under Minister of State, Deputy Stagg, but it was important to bring all the elements of social housing together.  I commend the <Col N="840" /> Minister of State for competently doing this in the document.</P>
    <P>As a result of the document, there is now at last a real housing programme of which the Government parties can stand over and be proud.  I commend the Minister of State for extending the 50:50 shared ownership scheme and for changing some of the limited terms of the ongoing tenant purchase scheme and making it more accessible to many people.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister of State on recognising the huge role of the voluntary bodies, particularly in the past three years, in providing housing for some of the most deprived sections of the community.  That was a major achievement.  The old local authority mortgage limit languished at £25,000 for many years.  It was at this ceiling for most of my representative political career and it was good to bring it slightly more into focus at £33,000, which is the type of price range applicable in Dublin and other major urban centres.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State has been deeply concerned over many years about housing for the travelling community.  She was the first chairperson of the task force on this problem, before my colleague, Senator Kelly, took over when the Minister of State was appointed. The summation of some of the ideas on the provision of accommodation for travellers is most valuable.  The report covers a range of topics and it is commendable.  It provides a good foundation on which to build, but I wish to draw the Minister of State's attention to a number of matters which the document does not address sufficiently and perhaps, these could be examined in greater detail.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned at the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs, the document does not address the special problems in Dublin.  People sometimes say I am like a broken record on this <Col N="841" /> issue but the Dublin region has particular difficulties which the document does not address.  The problem is compounded by the totally unnecessary and largely administrative division of the region into four counties.  This is an absolute disadvantage in terms of housing people on the current housing list, particularly in Dublin City.  The scale of the refurbishment programmes required is vast.  Most Deputies from outside Dublin do not realise the huge problem of bad housing conditions in many areas of the city and county and the massive programme which is still required to deal with it.</P>
    <P>I agree with the remarks of Deputy Kirk and others about design.  It would have been worth devoting a chapter of the report to the design of houses and estates.  An almost model estate design is featured on the cover of the report but I am exasperated at times at the poor design of local authority housing. This particularly arises in the case of small in-fill housing beside older private estates.  We insist on building totally different houses, with tiny windows and doors, which clearly marks them out as local authority houses.  It costs as much to build this type of house as it does to extend the design of the existing estate. This must be done if we want social integration.  I am disappointed by the designs of even some of the NBA houses.</P>
    <P>The biggest weakness in housing policy is that we still have not come to grips with estate management.  There were major social problems over Hallowe'en in part of Dublin City.  Areas of the north and west of the county have been able to deal with such problems through the heroic efforts of local voluntary workers and, at times, politicians. However, only two areas of Dublin City, which houses one seventh of the population, have any type of estate management policy.  Two years ago, Minister of State, Deputy Stagg, and the current <Col N="842" /> Minister of State requested Dublin Corporation to immediately implement a regime of estate management throughout the city.  However, those two years have been wasted and it has not been done.  I was in City Hall earlier, discussing the 1996 estimates.  As usual, money is tight, particularly since there are no service charges, which is what our constituents want.  It is still the case that there is no effective estate management and this issue must be addressed. This probably also applies to other urban areas.  There is a need for real local democracy in that regard.</P>
    <P>Some new approaches are still required.  A previous speaker mentioned one of the document's central themes with regard to social housing, which is encouraging people to own their own homes.  It is almost a moral imperative on Irish people, probably given our history over the previous 200 years to own our property.  Almost 20 years ago, one of my distinguished predecessors in the Labour Party, the late Jimmy Tully implemented a big housing programme.  He put together 7,000 units a year, which is similar to the level this year, of local authority housing.  They were funded directly by Government but in many cases, people had equity in their houses in estates from the first day.</P>
    <P>For example, in my constituency, the entire Donaghmede area was developed by private builders.  However, it was allocated to the housing and transfer lists and people had a type of mortgage arrangement from day one.  Some of the ideas in this and the 1991 document are not entirely new.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will consider these aspects again.  The Department of the Environment is perhaps one of the most bureaucratic Departments.  In the past I have raised the possibility of abolishing the Department of the Environment and perhaps, the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry.  There is certainly a strong case for abolishing the Department of the Environment.  I <Col N="843" /> understand that it replicates much of the work done by 38 to 40 county and borough councils throughout the country.  I do not know why it is necessary to do this.  I sometimes think there is an unholy alliance between the mandarins in the Custom House and some of the bureaucrats at local level.</P>
    <P>I am aware this is not directly related to the Minister of State's brief, but I still hope in policy on housing and all other matters, that we will consider establishing real local democracy.  I felt some of the recent changes were nonsensical whereby the Dublin area was split in four, an attempt was made to prevent Deputies becoming members of local authorities and they would no longer be allowed to be elected chairman, although some of the best councillors happen to be Deputies.</P>
    <P>If members of local authorities are to be given real authority, there is a need for fundamental reform of local government.  I would like to see us reach the stage where the leader of the city council would be the executive mayor with responsibility for the housing department.  It is outrageous that there are still slums in this city having regard to the amounts of money already spent.  Local democratic control is the way forward.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister of State on introducing a housing programme under which 7,000 units will be provided.  This is an enormous achievement.  Dublin City Council, is to provide 600 of the total of 3,900 to be provided in Dublin. In the late 1980s and the early 1990s, under the baleful influence of the Progressive Democrats, Fianna Fáil forgot one of its founding principles with the result that the housing programme was strangled.  There was literally no programme.  This upset and irritated many people.</P>

      <P>Some sections of the community refused to pay their fair share and paid no tax at all with the result that the rest of us had to support the State.  The Government of which the Deputy's party formed part got us into debt, but there was no housing policy.</P>
      <P>About five years ago I was so exasperated at a meeting of the housing committee of the city council in the Mansion House that I led a walk out of members while the then Minister, Deputy Smith, was speaking.  I felt he was expressing platitudes and not addressing the problems I had to deal with day in, day out.  I am grateful this matter is now being addressed by the Minister of State who has doubled the allocation for social housing.  At long last we have a programme we can stand over.</P>
      <P>The shared ownership scheme has been commended and rightly so.  During the past six to eight months I have been struck by the way young couples on small incomes and, at times, single parents have been able to make a new start by taking an equity stake in their own homes.  The new conditions introduced by the Minister of State are very valuable.</P>
      <P>In relation to the tenant purchase scheme, £25,000 covered the cost of a local authority house in the Dublin region.  Unfortunately, this is no longer the case but the position can be restored by increasing the figure to £33,000.</P>

      <P>I am raising this issue <Col N="845" /> on foot of many representations in connection with what I perceive to be an iniquitous tax.  As I am not a golfer, I do not have a special interest in the sport, although I recognise it as an important element of our sporting ethos.  Our golfers have done much for the country by bringing its good name to the attention of the international golfing world.  They have distinguished themselves.</P>
      <P>There are 350 private members' golf clubs and 15 to 20 commercial golf clubs in the country.  I understand this tax of 12.5 per cent is to be introduced as and from 1 January next.  While the commercial clubs are an important element in that they are democratic, if an adjustment has to be made the answer is to levy this tax on these clubs on the basis that there are only between 15 to 20 of them.</P>
      <P>The inequity in this is that the young and the old, various golfing societies, and others, such as holiday makers, will suffer.  The tourism trade will be damaged as a direct result of the introduction of this tax.  The Minister for Finance should, prior to 1 January, consider the Spanish experience.  When a serious additional element was imposed on the golfing fraternity in Spain visitors were no longer attracted to play golf.  I urge the Minister to abolish this tax for private members' clubs and to impose it on the commercial clubs only.</P>

      <P>I sincerely thank my colleague for sharing his time with me on this important issue which is of crucial importance in my constituency where there are over 20 clubs, four of which operate on the basis of &ldquo;pay and play&rdquo;.  I share my colleague's concern about the private members' clubs which are non-profit making and which plough membership and green fees back into the development of facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This iniquitous tax on green fees is being imposed by those who do not understand the system.  In the parish of Donabate where I was born there are <Col N="846" /> six clubs the members of which will now have to pay VAT on green fees whenever they play at other clubs.  The golf tourism trade is a vitally important source of income for the community. For example, 38 people are employed at Beaverstown Golf Club during the summer.  They will be badly hit by the imposition of VAT on green fees.</P>
    <P>One way around the problem might be to exempt from VAT the private members' clubs and not go ahead with the proposal to impose it on the commercial clubs.  This proposal will affect many people who have taken early retirement and play society golf, whether in their local pub society, football society or golf society in clubs around north County Dublin and elsewhere throughout the country.  They will be penalised by the imposition of this VAT.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister of State to maintain some sanity in this area, remembering that it will adversely affect employment, tourism, the membership and income of golf clubs and that the revenue yield will be minimal compared with the incalculable damage that will be done to all golf clubs.  The Government should rethink this proposal and remove this iniquitous taxation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Coveney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Members for raising this issue, affording me an opportunity to explain the rationale behind the proposal.</P>
      <P>The Finance Act, 1995, provides that, as from 1 January 1996, the green-fee type turnover of member-owned golf clubs will be become liable to VAT at the reduced rate of 12.5 per cent provided the organisation's turnover from such sources exceeds, or is likely to exceed, £20,000 in any period of 12 months.  The measure will also apply to local authority golf facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Commercial golf courses have been liable to VAT since 1992.  As they are <Col N="847" /> clearly engaged in the course of furtherance of business, they are taxable in accordance with the provisions of EU and Irish VAT law.  Member-owned golf clubs, on the other hand, are exempt from VAT because they are deemed to be providing services for the benefit of their members on a non-profit making basis.  However, EU VAT law requires that this exemption from VAT shall not apply if the basic purpose of the service being supplied is to obtain additional income for the organisation by carrying out transactions which are in direct competition with those of commercial enterprises which are liable to the tax. For some time, the representatives of the commercial clubs have complained that the present situation, where they had to charge VAT on their facilities but the traditional golf clubs did not, was putting them at a competitive disadvantage.  In the circumstances there was no option but to bring the green-fee type income of the member-owned golf clubs into the tax net.  The initiative was taken on grounds of equity rather than as a revenue-raising measure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>We made the law but we cannot exempt one commercial activity.  We cannot make laws and then make those kinds of exceptions.  Great pains were taken to ensure that the Finance Act requirement was carefully targeted at the area of distortion, that is the green-fee-type turnover for which both categories of club are in direct competition.  In the case of member-owned clubs, turnover from membership fees, bar receipts and so on is not taken into account in calculating the registration threshold.  The £20,000 registration threshold is applied across the broad range of service industries as indicating a scale of activity which, if not taxed, would constitute a distortion of competition to the detriment of taxable providers of similar services.  This threshold level is also appropriate in the case of golf facilities.  The alternative turnover thresholds most frequently proposed in representations received from a number of member-owned clubs &mdash; £175,000 and £200,000 &mdash; only serve to illustrate the substantial scale of activity involved and confirm the obvious competition this represents for commercial operators who are, after all competing for the same visitor and tourist clientele as member-owned clubs.</P>
      <P>I might also make the point that golf was not singled out.  While there are special provisions in the 1995 Finance Act to deal with the particular circumstance arising in the golfing sector, the Act also contains measures enabling the Revenue Commissioners to designate any exempt sports facility liable to VAT where they are satisfied the facility in question is creating, or likely to create. a distortion of competition for a taxable person providing similar services.</P>

      <P>It is fully accepted that green fees constitute an important source of income for many clubs which is used for the development and expansion of their club facilities and, in some cases, to reduce membership fees.  The leading role taken by many of our long established member-owned clubs in promoting Ireland abroad as a holiday destination for international golfing tourists is also well known, on which they are to be commended.  However, it is simply not credible to argue that this type of overseas promotion falls within the context of providing a service for their members on a non profit-making basis. The Government also has a responsibility to the commercial sector to apply the tax in a fair and equitable manner. At present a tourist playing golf in a commercial facility pays VAT but does not do so when playing in a member-owned club.  This position could not be allowed to continue.</P>

      <P>I cannot accept that the measure to be applied next year will have a detrimental effect on tourism.  As regards the possible effect of the initiative on prices, in many instances the effective VAT rate should be less than 12.5 per cent because the organisations <Col N="850" /> concerned will be able to recover the VAT borne on their inputs such as buildings, machinery, greens maintenance and so on in respect of the taxable part of their activities, a facility previously denied them because they were exempt from VAT.  Second, member-owned clubs have had considerable time to prepare for the new circumstance. Third, unlike their competitors in the United Kingdom, France and Spain, where the standard rates of VAT applicable to green fees is 17.5 per cent, 20.6 per cent and 16 per cent respectively, Irish clubs will have the benefit of the reduced rate of 12.5 per cent&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Deputies may be interested to know that the issue could not have been resolved by exempting commercial facilities from VAT.  As they are clearly engaged in the course of or furtherance of business activity, European Union VAT law requires they be liable to tax.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, for having given me permission to raise this matter and the Minister for attending.  Since a Private Notice Question on the subject was tabled last week the overall position has not merely changed but deteriorated. My purpose in raising it again this <Col N="851" /> evening is to seek the up-to-date position and to reiterate that we are all at one on it.</P>
      <P>I asked the Minister for Enterprise and Employment last week whether he would speak to the Taoiseach and request him to speak directly to the British Prime Minister, Mr. John Major, because of the now perilous state of negotiations between British and Irish officials in this matter, with the survival deal daily becoming less sure of implementation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that no progress has been made even though it has emerged that the British Government acted in bad faith at European Union level by claiming that British Steel would close a plant.  The Minister informed us last week, also reported in <i>The Financial Times,</i> that Britain had said that if Ireland went ahead they would close a British steel plant leading to loss of employment within their industry.  It now transpires that the chairman of British Steel, Mr. Brian Moffat, has said there will be no closure of any of their plants despite what may or may not happen in the case of Irish Steel, demonstrating that that pretext has been blown out of the water.  They named the particular plant in Staffordshire, which it appears does not produce the same product as Irish Steel Limited.  That, therefore, is also a flimsy pretext.  The British are being deliberately intransigent.  They are acting in bad faith in the negotiations with the Irish officials, and appear to be playing games with the EU.  When Luxembourg dropped its initial objection, the rest of the Ministers were in agreement with what Ireland was trying to do.  Their attitude was that Ireland and the UK should get together and settle the matter.  British intransigence must be ended.  The Irish Steel workers are going through a very worrying time, and they have already been through stringent retrenchment, particularly in the last 12 months.  They have weathered all sorts of domestic <Col N="852" /> and internal storms during which they made massive readjustments, and now our neighbour across the water will put a spoke in their wheel.  It is imperative for the Taoiseach to take an interest in the matter.</P>
    <P>Before I came into the House I spoke to someone, not from the Irish side, who is very involved in this, who said that just 30,000 tonnes divides the two negotiating teams.  Surely this is a case of a giant British Steel-UK Government, which has done very well having reported a threefold increase in profits in its half-yearly results, taking a sledgehammer to 400 Irish Steel workers in a small country, very committed to Europe, with one steel plant, Irish Steel. That company is prepared to live with the guarantee of a limited output and has found a congenial partner prepared to invest money to enhance the plant while sticking rigidly to the production limits with which the Minister, Deputy Richard Bruton, went to Brussels.  So much for European solidarity.  Will the Minister of State convey to the Taoiseach our solidarity on the issue and, most of all, our wish that by whatever means he can, perhaps during the upcoming summit, he should speak directly to the British Prime Minister, Mr. John Major?  It requires intervention at that level to make sure that the veto is dropped.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mr. Rabbitte)</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate Deputy O'Rourke's raising this issue and I share her disappointment at the attitude of the UK Government on this very important issue.  It is not the case that the circumstances have, as the Deputy put it, not just changed but deteriorated. The circumstances have not deteriorated.  Discussions and contact are ongoing.  It is proving a very difficult problem, but there is no basis for the Deputy's claim that the situation has deteriorated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="853" /> At the Industry Council on 6 and 7 November, 14 member states were prepared to approve the State aid recommended by the EU Commission for Irish Steel.  The only exception was the UK.</P>
    <P>Since the Industry Council on 6 and 7 November, officials of the Department have been in almost constant contact with top representatives of ISPAT International.  Formal meetings have also taken place to discuss the matter. Last Friday, 10 November, the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Richard Bruton, met the UK Minister, Mr. Timothy Eggar, to see if the remaining gap between Ireland and UK could be bridged.  The Minister tabled proposals which went some way towards meeting the UK objections while at the same time ensuring that the viability of Irish Steel would not be threatened.  Unfortunately, it was not possible to reach agreement at the meeting with Mr. Eggar.  Differences clearly existed on issues such as annual production output for Irish Steel and in relation to where the steel from the Cork plant would be sold.  The Minister, Deputy Bruton, was prepared to agree that not all Irish Steel production would be sold in the EU.  Both Ministers agreed that contacts should continue at official level to resolve the problem.  A senior official of the Department subsequently had a meeting last Tuesday with his corresponding number in the UK Department of Trade and Industry, and I understand that a further meeting between officials will take place shortly.</P>
    <P>As Deputy O'Rourke can see, continuing contacts are taking place between the Irish and UK sides and it is still hoped that with goodwill on the part of the UK, they will appreciate the special circumstances of Irish Steel and come to an agreement with us which will not threaten the viability of Irish Steel.  The Minister, Deputy Bruton, is doing everything in his power to ensure <Col N="854" /> that the difficulty with the UK authorities is resolved.  He is disappointed that a deal with the UK has not yet been finalised, but he is still hopeful that, if a reasonable approach is adopted by the UK authorities, a formula can be found which will resolve the matter.</P>
    <P>I do not automatically accept what Deputy O'Rourke said about the attitude of the UK Government and British Steel hardening considerably in the past four days against the Irish Steel case. There has been some comment in the <i>Financial Times</i> in this period about British Steel but the comments have been about the very successful record profits made by British Steel of £550 million sterling for a six month period. There has been no direct comment about the UK attitude towards Irish Steel in the <i>Financial Times</i> in the past four days of which I am aware and no indication of any considerable hardening in attitude as stated by the Deputy.</P>
    <P>It may be that Deputy O'Rourke is referring to statements in the <i>Financial times</i> by the Chairman and Chief Executive of British Steel that British Steel ruled out any plant closures in the UK in the medium term.  It has been speculated in the UK media that if the Irish Steel package was approved it would lead to the closure of a British Steel plant in Shelton, near Stoke-on-Trent. The Minister, Deputy Bruton, made it clear in the past few days that this was not a credible position.  I acknowledge that Deputy O'Rourke corroborates that position.  A small increase in production by Irish Steel could not have a major impact on a plant in the UK which is estimated to have an annual output of 400,000 tonnes.  The idea that approval by the UK of the Irish Steel package would close down production in Shelton is a fallacy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>That was my point. They are persisting in that.  There was an article in a British newspaper today <Col N="855" /> to the same effect, that the plant at Shelton would close if the Irish got their way.  That has a hardening effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>It would not be particularly helpful for me to comment on that except to say that I believe the argument is fallacious, from whatever source it comes.  I assure Deputy O'Rourke that the Government regards the Irish Steel case as of vital importance and will do everything within its power to convince the UK of the desirability of the UK joining an other member states of the European Union in <Col N="856" /> approving the very modest state aid involved in the Irish Steel case.  I accept that is the position of Deputy O'Rourke's party and of all Members, including my colleagues, the Minister of State, Deputy Coveney, and Deputy Lynch.  It is the Government's view that this is a matter of vital national interest and the British Government has been made clearly aware of that view.</P>

      <P>While the turnover in on course betting has been falling in recent years, that trend has been halted this year, in that turnover up to 13 November was marginally up on 1994.  This increase would have been somewhat greater but for the dispute which saw no bookmakers standing at Leopardstown for the past two meetings.</P>
      <P>Turnover on the Tote has been down this year but the Tote will nevertheless return a substantial profit for the year. Tote turnover has been affected by some adverse initial reaction to changes made in its operation aimed at improving the service provided for punters and also by the reduction of about 20 per cent in the average numbers of runners per meeting during the months of August and September due to the hot dry weather.  Tote business is particularly sensitive to reductions in the numbers of runners.</P>

    <P>Total attendances at race meetings <Col N="784" /> have remained at or close to one million for a number of years.</P>

The Irish Horse Racing Authority in the five year strategy document which it is drawing up at present will be dealing with those problems and setting out a development programme aimed at increasing racing's share of the leisure industry over the rest of this decade.  The Authority, which is representative of the various interests in the industry is in the best position to set out and implement such a programme and I am confident that it will do so in a realistic and timely way.</P>

      <P>On my appointment as Minister almost a year ago, a top priority was to improve the quality of services to farmers.  The launch of the charter of rights for farmers last April reflected that priority.</P>
      <P>The charter envisaged a programme of substantially improved services for farmers to be implemented over a two year period.  The targets set for 1995 have been largely met or indeed exceeded.  This is the case especially in relation to headage and premia payments which are, of course, a primary concern of farmers.</P>
      <P>In june an effective service was provided at local marts to help farmers minimise errors in completing application forms.  From 1 September local offices resumed all day opening arrangements for the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="785" /> The programmes to improve facilities in local offices and to upgrade the telephone services in them are in progress and will continue during 1996.</P>
    <P>I am particularly pleased to say that the Appeals Unit promised in the charter is now in operation.</P>
    <P>I will shortly be setting up the review group which will report annually on the operation of the charter.</P>
    <P>In the light of this progress, I am very disappointed that the charter commitment to having an information desk, or &ldquo;one-stop-shop&rdquo;, in local offices from 1 November has not been met because of a lack of co-operation by the Civil and Public Service Union.  Preparations were, in fact, well in train to ensure that this service would be in operation on time.  However, the Union has served notice on my Department of its intention to begin industrial action with effect from Monday next, 20 November. I greatly regret that such action is proposed, especially the action which would close local offices to the public in the afternoons.</P>
    <P>This action is regrettable and I would call on the union not to proceed.  My Department is of course available for discussion on its various claims.</P>

      <P>It is not clear which of the EU Operational Programmes the Deputy intended to refer to in his question.  The Operational Programme for Agriculture, Rural Development and Forestry provides <Col N="786" /> total public funding of over £1,122 million over the period 1994 to 1999 of which the EU will contribute £763.6 million.  This Operational Programme, however, applies to the whole country and full details of the various measures have been published for almost a year.</P>
      <P>Under the Leader Operational Programme six groups in the Border counties have been successful in securing a total of £12.7 million public funding for the period 1994-99.  The selection of projects under Leader is a matter for the individual groups concerned but may include agricultural elements such as alternative farm enterprises and small processing projects.</P>
      <P>EU Operational Programmes which apply specifically in the six southern Border counties are the Joint Interreg Programme for Northern Ireland and Ireland 1994-99 and the EU Special Support Programme for Peace and Reconciliation in Northern Ireland and the Border Counties of Ireland 1995-99.</P>
      <P>While the Interreg Operational Programme contains specific measures aimed at assisting agriculture and forestry (with public funding of £3 million) most of the other measures in this Operational Programme will contribute to the development of agriculture in the broad sense in the Border counties.  The total Border package for this programme in the southern six counties is £115 million of which £72 million is EU funding.</P>
      <P>In the case of the EU Special Programme for Peace and Reconciliation the overall funding that will eventually be committed to agriculture, will depend on the number of proposals related to agriculture which will be approved.  The total public funding under this Operational Programme is £64 million for the period 1995-97 in respect of the six southern Border counties.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>I am not aware of the media reports referred to by the Deputy.  The accurate position is that over 7,700 applicants have already been approved for payment and this figure should be close to 8,500 by the end of the month.  A further 2,000 cases are being examined in local offices, in consultation with the applicants' planners in many cases.  In this connection the pattern is that almost 95 per cent of valid REPS applications are paid within eight weeks of lodgment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 16 and 30 together.</P>
      <P>The EU beef regime has traditionally focused its support, through the intervention system, on male cattle.  Accordingly, when the regime was reformed in 1992 to switch the emphasis away from market support through intervention purchasing towards income support through the premium arrangements, beef producers were compensated for the restrictions introduced on intervention by way of a significant improvement in the existing premium payments and the introduction of new premia, such as the extensification and deseasonalisation slaughter premiums.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new arrangements have in general worked extremely well for the Irish beef sector.  A proposal to extend the existing premia to heifers would have considerable implications for FEOGA expenditure and it is highly unlikely that they could be accommodated other than by a significant reduction in the rates of payment under existing schemes and further major and permanent reductions in market support, especially export <Col N="789" /> refunds, leading to consequential serious price reductions affecting all beef producers, including those specialising in heifer production. However, a number of aspects of the current regime will come up for review in 1996 and I will keep the proposal in mind at that stage.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the recent Teagasc report indicating that half of farmers are living in poverty; his views on whether the net effect of the common agricultural policy has been to preserve and in some cases widen the gap between poorer and better-off farmers; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[16985/95]</QRef>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates) Ivan Yates">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates)</NameTxt>
      <P>The national farm survey, published by Teagasc, measures changes in on-farm income and does not attempt to measure the total household income of farming families, approximately 50 per cent of which is derived from off farm activities.  Therefore, while the survey is a very useful indicator of income from farming, it cannot be used to make inferences on poverty levels within the farming community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I note that the Teagasc survey records an impressive 12 per cent increase in average on-farm income in 1994 &mdash; the third successive year of growth in farm income.  I am very aware that this average figure includes farmers with high incomes and those in disadvantaged areas with less viable enterprises.  I would point out however that on-farm income relativity between disadvantaged areas &mdash; where the bulk of low income farm families are situated &mdash; and the national average had improved over the period that the CAP has applied in this country.  Prior to joining the EU in the mid-1960s, average family farm income in the North and west was 49 per cent of the national average while in recent years average family farm <Col N="790" /> income in the less favoured areas has increased to about two thirds of the national average.  I also note that the Teagasc survey shows that direct payments, and particularly CAP reform compensatory payments, had a significant impact on incomes in the traditionally low-return farming systems such as cattle and sheep.</P>
    <P>I am, however, very conscious that some farm households still have low incomes in absolute terms.  According to the CSO's household budget survey about 23 per cent of farm families had gross household incomes under £5,000 per annum in 1987, the last year for which this data is currently available. Under the Operational Programme for Agriculture, Rural Development and Forestry it is intended that such low income households will benefit from a variety of measures aimed at improving production efficiency, dealing with problems in farm structures, promoting broad rural development and, where necessary, providing direct income support.</P>
    <P>The following are some recent initiatives in this regard.  The reclassification of almost 1 million acres of farmland from less severely handicapped to more severely handicapped will benefit an additional 10,000 farmers through increased headage payments.  The subsidised milk quota restructuring scheme, which is available again in 1995, provides a subsidy for small scale milk producers towards the purchase price of additional quota.  I have also recently made provision for the ring fencing of quota within disadvantaged areas which will prevent loss of milk quota from the less favoured areas.</P>
    <P>The fight against poverty, both urban and rural, is a priority for this Government, and the Deputy can be assured that this will continue to be fully reflected in our policies on agriculture and rural development.</P>

      <P>The draft Animal Remedies Regulations, 1995 were circulated to a wide variety of interested bodies which included the Irish Pharmaceutical Union.  Most of the bodies consulted made submissions and later met with officials of my Department to discuss their concerns.</P>
      <P>The Irish Pharmaceutical Union made a detailed submission which was the subject of extensive consultation between them and officals of my Department, which included a meeting with the Minister of State.</P>
      <P>The Irish Pharmaceutical Union's concerns principally relate to the designation of certain veterinary medicines as prescription only medicines.  It is concerned that because there is not a tradition of prescription writing in the veterinary sector they will not receive prescriptions and the livelihood of those pharmacists who largely depend on the sale of veterinary medicines will be jeopardised.</P>
      <P>I wish to make it clear that veterinary medicines are not placed in a prescription category to regulate market share. Control of access to certain medicines is necessary in order to ensure that these medicines are used responsibly and following proper diagnosis.  These measures are necessary in order to protect public health and ensure our continued access to essential export markets.</P>
      <P>There are also criteria for the designation of certain veterinary medicines as prescription only supply set out in EC directives to which I am obliged to give effect.  The Irish Pharmaceutical Union laid particular emphasis on the prescription controls on antibiotics, which have been in force since 1986, and any substantial relaxation of these provisions cannot be considered at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope to adopt these regulations in <Col N="794" /> the near future.  I consider the measures to be included will address many of the concerns expressed by the Irish Pharmaceutical Union.  As a country we are committed to a policy of quality and wholesome food; we must operate controls on the use of veterinary medicines which give consumers the assurances they require.</P>

      <P>The submission on reclassification of certain areas of the country was lodged with the EU Commission in October 1994.  Following discussions with the Commission at which some additional information was provided and certain points clarified in relation to the submission, the Commission agreed in September 1995 to approve the submission in its entirety.</P>
      <P>The areas to be reclassified were formally approved at the meeting on 27 October 1995 of the Agricultural Structures and Rural Development, STAR, Committee.  Following this, a complete list of all DEDs-townlands was published.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was never envisaged that the reclassification submission would be approved in time to include the new areas in the 1995 headage schemes, given that it was not lodged with the <Col N="795" /> Commission until October 1994, and even if discussions had not been required, the administrative work within the Commission of obtaining approval would have pushed a final decision beyond the date for receipt of applications for the 1995 schemes.</P>

      <P>The position as regards the evaluation carried out on the compensatory allowances scheme is that the consultant has addressed a number of areas where he recommends that changes should be made and he has highlighted a broad range of measures from which a selection will have to be made if the areas targeted by him are to be tackled.  The areas the consultant was asked to examine are as follows: the balance between investment and income support measures under the Operational Programme for Agriculture, Rural Development and Forestry; the extent to which the scheme contributes towards its main objective of maintaining the population in disadvantaged rural areas; the question of better targeting the low income farmer; simplification of the scheme; the extent to which the scheme is contributing to the overgrazing problem in certain sensitive areas; the question of fundamentally improving the collection of data so that it can be more easily analysed and evaluated.</P>

      <P>In the overall investigation into cattle illnesses and deaths in the Askeaton area involving comprehensive actions by a number of State agencies with a co-ordination role being exercised by the Environmental Protection Agency, my Department was assigned responsibility for the veterinary aspects.  The veterinary programme drawn up has been endorsed by toxicologists from both the UK and the USA and is centred on two farms which have suffered serious losses.  One aspect of the programme involves a series of measures to establish the biochemical, haematological and pathological status of cattle and requires the retention of some cattle on the farms, the removal of some others to a State farm and the placement of cattle from outside the area on the farms.  The cattle are to be <Col N="798" /> subject to ongoing and extensive monitoring and testing and their management has to be standardised to ensure the scientific integrity of the investigation.</P>
      <P>In this situation, I was advised that existing legislation did not provide for the effective compulsory taking over of the farms and for their management in a way that would meet the requirements of the veterinary investigation.  Consequently, I considered it advisable to proceed in the manner which I did, with the result that my Department is now in a position to carry out its investigation as planned.</P>
      <P>The Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1992, the Air Pollution Act, 1987 and some other legislation contain provisions which permit the entry of authorised persons onto premises and for limited and prescribed actions to be undertaken; but existing legislation does not authorise in the circumstances obtaining the effective taking over of the running of a farm to a prescribed standard, the compulsory removal of cattle and the compulsory restocking of the farm with other cattle, all of which are essential to ensure the integrity of the veterinary investigation.</P>

      <P>I proposed to take Questions Nos. 34 and 76 together.</P>
      <P>The Council of Agriculture Ministers is scheduled to meet in Brussels on 11 and 12 December.</P>
      <P>Lamb prices to date this year were on average 4 per cent below 1994 levels. Prices were significantly below 1994 levels during the period April to June but have strengthened considerably since then and, over the past few weeks, have been some 6 per cent above 1994 levels. On the basis of current trends, it is estimated that the full ewe premium for 1995 will be between £2 and £3 per head higher than in 1994.</P>
      <P>I have spared no effort to ensure that the income problems of Irish sheep farmers have been fully understood by the EU Commission and my colleagues in the Council of Ministers.  There has already been a speedy response from the Commission in the form of two schemes of aid for private storage and the earliest ever payment of the first two tranches of the ewe premium.  In addition, An Bord Bia has mounted an effective promotion campaign on the domestic and export markets and is in the process of the completion of an in-depth review of the export markets for lamb.</P>
      <P>I intend to maintain contact with the EC Commission and the EU Presidency to ensure that full consideration is given to proposals put to Commissioner Fischler last March to address what was then an emerging problem, especially for early season producers.</P>
      <P>I intend to pursue these proposals with the Commission and the Council until a satisfactory outcome is achieved.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 35 and 39 together.</P>
      <P>The provision of assistance to the food processing sector, to counteract the effects of the depreciation of sterling against the Irish pound would, without approval at EU level, be contrary to EU law.  I gave no commitment to introduce such assistance.</P>
      <P>The appropriate response to the currency situation is that firms should improve their competitiveness and intensify and geographically diversify their marketing efforts.  There is a range of State schemes, under the Structural Funds programme for the food industry, on which thy may draw for these purposes.</P>
      <P>Full details of the action An Bord Bia is taking to develop both new and existing export markets for meat, as well as other food products, are set out in their Market Development Strategy 1995-99 published last June.  These include, in particular, two company grant schemes, the aim of which is to enable individual companies to improve their marketing capability and performance.  In addition, An Bord Bia also provides a full range of information and promotional services.  Their market development strategy constitutes the contribution of An Bord Bia towards the realisation of the estimated targets set for the food industry namely to increase output from £9 billion to £12 billion and exports from £4.3 billion to £7 billion by 1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To enable An Bord Bia intensify its marketing and promotion efforts, I have today announced my intention to provide it with additional funds of £7.5 million, from provisions of the Structural Funds programme for the food industry which were under-utilised because of a delay in approving the programme.  The <Col N="801" /> transfer of these additional funds is subject to agreement under the programme's monitoring committee procedures.</P>

      <P>Under the 1994 deseasonalisation slaughter premium scheme 12,252 applicants out of the 12,378 who applied have been paid £11.909 million.  The only cases unpaid are query cases where invalid tag numbers were quoted by applicants or where cattle identity cards or factory dockets have not been received.

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates) Ivan Yates">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates)</NameTxt>
      <P>In Council Regulation (EEC) No. 2066/92 the EU defined a suckler cow as a &ldquo;cow belonging to a meat breed or born of a cross with a meat breed&rdquo; for the purposes of the suckler cow premium schemes.  EU rules list the breeds that are deemed not to be meat breeds and this list includes all kinds of Friesians.</P>
      <P>Some Friesians were, however, allowed to be included in 1993 and 1994 under transitional EU rules to permit suckler producers with part &mdash; Friesian or mainly &mdash; Friesian suckler herds to change the composition of their herds from Friesian breeds to acceptable meat breeds instead.  In 1995 this transitional period ended and Friesian cows were not longer acceptable for payment under the suckler schemes.</P>
      <P>Where farmers, through a misunderstanding, showed Friesian cows on their 1995 suckler declared them as such, my Department simply deleted these cows from those claims and levied no penalties on the farmers involved as the errors involved were obvious and devoid of any fraudulent intent whatever.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a relatively small number of cases, however, farmers declared animals on their 1995 applications as meat breeds which they had shown in their earlier years' applications as Friesian cows.  In some cases these changes are justified because the cows are, for example, Simmential-Freisian crosses and these are acceptable meat breeds.  In other cases <Col N="805" /> the changes are not acceptable because the animals are straightforward Freisian types and, therefore, the attempt to mis-declare them as meat breeds involves a prescribed EU penalty.</P>
    <P>I have arranged in every such case for an on-farm inspection to be carried out to see whether the changes are or are not justified.  Where they are, the correct breed is now being recorded for the animals involved and they will be paid the premium if the claim is otherwise in order.  Where they are not, however, the applicants involved have to be penalised appropriately under the relevant EU Regulations.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> I would like to assure the Deputy that all emergency cases are dealt with immediately.  In relation to waiting lists for elective surgery, a waiting list initiative to address the problem <Col N="808" /> of excessive waiting lists has been underway since 1993.  Since the waiting list initiative commenced in 1993, £38 million has been provided to tackle the problem of long waiting lists.  This has led to major reductions in waiting times for treatment and has reduced considerably the excessive waiting lists which were allowed to build up during the late 1980s.</P>
      <P>Emphasis has been placed on providing funding to ensure a reduction in waiting lists where waiting times for adults were in excess of 12 months and, for children, in excess of six months. The specialities of ENT, ophthalmology, orthopaedics, plastic surgery, vascular surgery, general surgery, gynaecology and urology were targeted as needing particular attention.</P>
      <P>When the initiative commenced in June 1993 the total in-patient waiting list for all specialities was 40,130.  By 31 December 1994 this figure had been reduced to 23,835 which represents a reduction of 16,295 or 40 per cent over a period of 18 months.</P>
      <P>In 1995 the Government committed a further £8 million to continue to reduce waiting times in a number of target specialities where waiting times are considered excessive and 10,394 additional in-patient procedures will be carried out as a result of this funding.  In addition, the 1995 initiative will also target out-patient waiting lists, where waiting times are excessive and here an additional 6,728 persons at present awaiting an out-patient appointment will be seen.</P>

    <P>Waiting times in particular hospitals can vary considerably between specialities and between individual consultants. It is difficult, therefore, to make direct comparisons between one hospital and another.  However, every effort is made to ensure that waiting times are reduced to the greatest extent possible in all hospitals and to this end more than £3 million in waiting list initiative funding has been provided to Beaumont Hospital since 1993.  In the current year £840,000 has been provided to Beaumont under the waiting list initiative to perform 930 additional procedures <Col N="809" /> which will help to further reduce waiting lists at Beaumont Hospital.</P>

Grant-aid is allocated to organisations and groups for specific projects which seek to address the needs of young people who are disadvantaged.

      <P>However, my Department, through Comhairle le Leas Óige (the youth work sub-committee of the City of Dublin vocational education committee) provided £10,000 in 1995 for the development of a part-time programme for young people at risk in co-operation with the Cherry Orchard Youth Project. In addition, Ballyfermot Youth Federation, also funded by my Department, provides the services of a youth worker in the Cherry Orchard area.</P>

      <P>A closed circuit television (CCTV) monitoring system was launched in the Temple Bar area of Dublin city on 26 October 1995.  This pilot scheme is the first of its kind in this country and was introduced in the Temple Bar area with the co-operation of local interests.  The effectiveness of the pilot scheme will be the subject of a full assessment when it has been running for about four months.</P>
      <P>The installation of closed circuit television cameras offers an opportunity to the Garda to monitor activity in densely populated public thoroughfares and to help to eliminate disorder and other crimes against the community.  The Garda believe that the use of CCTV will have a beneficial effect on crime prevention and crime detection in the area in which it is located and that the quality of life for those living and working in the area will be greatly enhanced.  This has been the experience in other jurisdictions where CCTV cameras are used to assist the law enforcement agencies.</P>
      <P>As the scheme has just recently been introduced it is not possible as yet to comment conclusively on its likely value in reducing crime in this jurisdiction.  I have been informed by the Garda authorities, however, that there has already been a number of arrests following incidents recorded by the cameras in the Temple Bar area.</P>

      <P>The Christmas bonus will amount to 70 per cent of normal weekly payments again this year and there will be a minimum payment of £20.  It will be paid during the first week in December at a cost of almost £40 million.  More than 1.25 million people will benefit i.e. about 755,000 recipients and their 500,000 dependants and will go to people on long-term payments including those receiving old age, retirement, widows, widowers and invalidity pensions, lone parent's allowance, unemployment assistance at the long-term rate, carer's allowance, disabled person's maintenance allowance as well as FÁS and CERT trainees.  All participants on community employment will also receive the bonus this year.</P>
      <P>The bonus was introduced originally in 1980 for elderly and other pensioners. It was subsequently extended to include the long-term unemployed in receipt of long-term Unemployment Assistance. The long-term sick in receipt of Invalidity Pension are covered by the bonus but I have no proposals at present to extend it to other categories.</P>

      <P>The proposal for reclassification of areas to more severely handicapped status, including all remaining areas of south-east Galway, was approved by the EU Commission on 27 October 1995, and a list of all reclassified areas was published.</P>
      <P>This submission was lodged with the Commission in October 1994 and was discussed at various meetings in 1994 and 1995.  The Commission decided in September 1995 to proceed with the approval of the submission, and it was passed at the meeting of the Agricultural Structures and Rural Development (STAR) Committee on 27 October.</P>
      <P>In relation to County Galway, it is estimated that about 500 farmers will benefit from this reclassification, being eligible now for headage payments in respect of beef cows at a higher rate, and also for dairy cows and other cattle. An example would be a farmer with 40 beef cows.  Previously he would be entitled to £2,250, whereas in the future his entitlement will increase to £3,360.</P>

      <P>The transportation of live animals is governed by the Diseases of Animals (Protection of Animals during Transport) Order, 1995 which I introduced earlier this year. This Order lays down standards for the protection of animals during transport and gives effect to Council Directive 91/628/EEC of 19 November 1991.  The Order makes general provision for the welfare or animals during loading and while being transported, prescribes rest periods and feeding and watering intervals during transport by road, rail, sea or air and requires that the persons who are entrusted to transport animals possess the necessary knowledge to care for these animals.  Additional measures, as provided for in amending Directive 95/29/EC, are currently being transposed into national law.</P>
      <P>As announced recently, I will be introducing new measures by way of Statutory Instrument with effect from 1 January 1996 for the transport of cattle to Third Countries.  These further measures which are being introduced following a detailed review of existing arrangements, will complement and augment the welfare provisions of the above-mentioned Order.  The new requirements seek to ensure that the live trade will take place in a way that fully protects the welfare of cattle being transported.</P>

    <P>The current level of live exports is determined partly by market demand, particularly in certain third countries which have a preference for their import requirements to be filled in the form of live cattle.  It is, of course, also influenced&mdash;as are exports of beef&mdash;by the rate of EU export refunds.  It is important that the levels at which refunds are set are balanced between the live and beef trades and, in particular, do not involve any disincentive to process beef in Ireland prior to export. I should point out that, arising from various changes in the level of export refunds in the course of the past year, the export refund on boneless beef is now significantly higher than the refund on live animals.  In addition, the Deseasonalisation Slaughter Premium will be payable on steers slaughtered in the first half of 1996.  These measures will be of considerable assistance to the beef trade in competition with the live export trade next year.</P>
    <P>Finally, it is not legal under EU law to impose a limit on the level of the live export trade or any other trade.</P>

      <P>In 1992-93 my Department part funded a hydrographic study and site investigations adjacent to Bantry pier prior to carrying out dredging works.  In September 1994 tenders for the dredging contract were received but no contract could be awarded because a dumping at sea permit could not be issued for the project.  The level of contamination of the spoil was too high and would have had detrimental implications for the marine environment.</P>
      <P>Officials of my Department are in discussion with Cork County Council with a view to identifying the source of the contamination and seeking an alternative site for disposal.  Until such time as a suitable cost effective site has been found I am not in a position to say if dredging works will commence.</P>
