    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Howlin) Brendan Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Howlin):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3, 5 and 179 together.</P>
      <P>I am deeply concerned at the rise in road casualties which has been recorded over the past few months.  Provisional statistics prepated by the Garda show that, in the six months to the end of June, there was a significant reduction in the number of fatalities, while the number of those injured increased marginally. This represented a continuation of the trend which has been in evidence since 1991.</P>
      <P>The latest returns available from the Garda relate to the period July to September and show a marked increase in road deaths by comparison with the corresponding period in 1994.  As a result, the provisional figures for the first nine months of the year indicate that 315 people died in road accidents, as compared with 294 in the comparable period of 1994.  The early indications are that the provisional figure for October will be approximately the same as that for October 1994.</P>
      <P>I have asked the National Roads Authority, in conjunction with the Garda Síochána, to carry out an urgent examination of the increased number of accidents which occured in recent months and to identify whether any particular factors may be involved.  I expect to receive the results in the near future and will review, at that stage, what additional action may be possible in our continued effort to reverse this trend.  I have already been in touch with the Minister for Justice about the need to give high priority to traffic law enforcement in the coming months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provisional Garda statistics do not give the age profile of victims in 1995 but I expect information on this to emerge from the NRA-Garda examination of the data which I have requested.  A full analysis of the age of victims will be carried out in the preparation of Road Accident Facts 1995 <Col N="1739" /> which will be published by the National Roads Authority as early as possible in 1996.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  In light of the recent significant increase in the number of deaths I am disturbed that the Minister does not have more information available to him from the NRA and the Garda.  I note from a question answered on 11 October that the Minister had already sought that information, and I acknowledge his concern in this regard, but he did not mention in his reply the road surfaces factor which was raised by my colleague, Deputy O'Hanlon.  Has there been any further investigation into the damage done to the roads during the summer due to the very hot weather and the consequent problems that might cause?  Is this seen as a factor in the increase in deaths on the roads during this particular period?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am anxious to find what factors would contribute to the unwelcome increase in road deaths.  The first six months of this year were very satisfactory following the trend of recent years and while we must not be complacent, we are moving in the right direction.  The figures for the summer months, continued into September, were most disappointing.  A number of factors are being examined.  The traffic volumes on the roads in the summer months were much higher than the comparable figures for last year.  The reasonable position put forward by Deputy O'Hanlon during the last Question Time in relation to the effect of the very hot summer weather on the traction of the road surfaces is being examined in the review I have requested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is unsatisfactory that more detailed information is not available at this stage.  Does the Minister accept that it is impossible to frame a suitable response without information on why there is such an unacceptably <Col N="1740" /> high number of deaths on roads and whether these are caused by excessive speed, defective vehicles, poor roadcraft or a combination of these factors?  Is it his information that road accidents are the main cause of death among young people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin:</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously I am concerned about the figures, particularly as they affect young people.  I cannot say whether road traffic accidents are the main cause of death among young people but I would not be surprised if this were the case.  Deputy Quill listed some of the contributing factors but an analysis of accident statistics is difficult in the short-term as a number of factors contribute to individual accidents and it will take some time before a total pattern emerges.  In a total review of the matter I have looked at a number of initiatives I can take to deal with some of the issues referred to by the Deputy and other matters.  I wish to outline for the benefit of the House some of the measures I propose to take between now and next year in an effort to ensure that there is a comprehensive approach to reducing the horrific toll of accidents and deaths on roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have had discussions with relevant bodies on the development of a voluntary register of trained driving instructors to increase the standard and quality of instruction available to new drivers.  I intend to review the driving test, to introduce a more comprehensive theory test next year and to launch a new comprehensive traffic signs manual for the guidance of local authorities so as to ensure simplification and clarity in regard to road signs.  I also intend to launch a manual relating to low cost remedial measures for accident blackspots and my Department has assured me that this will be ready by March next year.  I propose to introduce a comprehensive new set of traffic regulations next year.  I hope that these measures and the significant capital injection into the roads network at county and national level will reduce the horrific <Col N="1741" /> toll of deaths and accidents which are deplored by all Deputies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey:</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the statistics and the report, has the Minister requested a breakdown on the times at which these accidents occured?  Will he request information on the death toll on dual carriageways and national primary and secondary routes as opposed to that on county roads?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin:</NameTxt>
      <P>Those matters will form part of the review and the details will be included in the data which I will make available to Deputies as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill:</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that a number of the national secondary routes are seriously below standard? Does he intend to carry out a survey to establish the compliance of those routes within minimum safety standards?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin:</NameTxt>
      <P>A later question deals specifically with national secondary routes and hopefully we will reach it.  In general, I am anxious to ensure that the highest level of safety prevails on all roads.  This means having adequate surfaces on county, regional, national secondary and national primary roads.  The level of investment in these roads in 1995 is unprecedented in the history of the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill:</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked the Minister if he had carried out a survey.  At one stage such surveys were carried out by An Foras Forbartha and I would like to know what organisation, if any, now carries out surveys on the minimum safety standards which ought to apply on roads.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for the Environment</askee>
      <Quest>his views on the tolling of roads; the consideration, if any, he has given to the effect that such tolling may have; the roads being considered for such tolls; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin:</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4, 59 and 182 together.</P>
      <P>The statutory power to levy tolls on national roads, to make toll by-laws and to enter into toll agreements with private investors is vested in the National Roads Authority under Part V of the Roads Act, 1993.  Road authorities have similar powers in relation to the tolling of non-national roads.</P>
      <P>The initiative in deciding which roads, if any, might be subject to tolls rests with the National Roads Authority or the road authority, as appropriate. However, a number of procedures must be complied with before a toll can be imposed on any road.  These include the making of a toll scheme, the giving of public notice and the submission of the scheme for the approval of the Minister. Where there are objections, a public inquiry must be held before a final decision can be taken on the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister for the Environment I have, therefore, a quasi-judicial function in relation to individual toll <Col N="1743" /> schemes.  It would not be appropriate for me, in these circumstances to comment on possible tolling proposals for individual roads, or categories of roads, or to offer any other comments which might be regarded as prejudicing the future exercise of that statutory function.</P>
    <P>I should add, however, that the <i>National Development Plan, 1994-99,</i> sets out guidelines on the tolling of national roads which are similar to those adopted by successive Governments since 1985.  The guidelines provide that any funding obtained from tolls would be regarded as additional to the planned State investment and used to accelerate the development of the national road network; there would be public competition for each private toll franchise and for the construction of each toll road: all toll roads would be designed, constructed, maintained and operated to agreed standards normally applicable to national roads; all toll roads would be public roads in the ownership of local authorities and subject to normal traffic management and other legislative controls; any private toll franchise would be limited to an agreed period of years and would revert to the National Roads Authority at the end of that period: private investment should generally meet at least 20 per cent of the capital cost of the toll road, with the exact level being determined by negotiation in each individual case; and the assessment of all toll proposals would have regard to the diversion of traffic likely to be caused by tolling and the probable impact on adjacent residential areas.</P>
    <P>I should also point out that these guidelines were endorsed in the Operational Programme for Transport, which was launched this week last year by my predecessor, Deputy Michael Smith. and the former Minister for Transport. Energy and Communications, Deputy Brian Cowen.  That programme indicated it was anticipated that up to £100 million might be raised from tolling national roads and that the NRA had <Col N="1744" /> been asked to conduct a thorough review of the scope for such tolling.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his very full response but my question related specifically to the tolling of ring roads around cities.  Will he confirm that he will have the final say in regard to the roads to be tolled?  Will he respond to the point repeatedly made that tolling ring roads around cities causes immense environmental damage and is not an acceptable practice either here or in any European country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin:</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question of the statutory power, the law is quite clear and I have given the details.  The final decision on whether to approve a scheme ultimately rests with the Minister for the Environment, subject to the various guidelines I have outlined.</P>
      <P>On the question of tolling ring roads, I am loath to get involved in the pros and cons of any particular road scheme which might be submitted to me by the National Roads Authority or any other body for determination.  I have a quasi-judicial role in determining toll schemes and I can assure the Deputy that I will give careful consideration to any proposal submitted to me and ensure that its impact on the environment is assessed and that no decision is arrived at which would have a detrimental environmental impact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey:</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that the National Roads Authority's invitation for the submission of proposals for a toll franchise is based on the assumption that the Minister will grant a toll on this road?  It is clear that the National Roads Authority is operating on the basis that it will get permission.</P>
      <P>All those lovely phrases articulated by the Minister, &ldquo;public inquiries,&rdquo;&ldquo;public objections,&rdquo; etc., mean nothing; the decision has already been taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin:</NameTxt>
      <P>The National Roads Authority knows what the law is and it will have to be complied with by State <Col N="1745" /> agencies.  The NRA will take comfort from the stated Government position outlined in the operational programme launched this week last year by my predecessor that it should raise up to £100 million in tolls.  While it is no doubt considering avenues by which this revenue might be raised the decision will ultimately rest with the Minister following the procedure laid down in law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey:</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister confirm that the document launched by his predecessor does not contain a specific proposal that any ring road should be tolled?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin:</NameTxt>
      <P>It was announced on 9 November 1994&mdash;I can circulate a copy of the statement to the Deputy&mdash;that there would be an income of £100 million from tolls which would be available for reinvestment in the national roads system under the auspices of the NRA.</P>

      <asker>Mr. Dempsey</asker>
      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for the Environment</askee>
      <Quest>the reason the provisions of the Environmental Protection Agency Act were not fully used in the case of the investigations into alleged pollution in Askeaton, County Limerick.</Quest>
      <QRef>[16276/95]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Environmental Protection Agency, Environmental Protection Agency, is co-ordinating a major programme of investigations into the animal health problems on farms in the Askeaton area.  There are four elements to the investigations: a veterinary-animal health study by the veterinary research laboratory of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry; an analysis of soils and plants by Teagasc: an assessment of industrial processes and emissions by the Environmental Protection Agency; and a human health <Col N="1746" /> study by the Mid-Western Health Board.</P>
      <P>As far as its work is concerned, it is a matter for the Environmental Protection Agency to apply, as appropriate, the powers available to it under the Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1992; I am not aware of any difficulty in this regard.</P>
      <P>Environmental Protection Agency work to date has focused on establishing accurate and representative information on the possible contribution of atmospheric pollution to the Askeaton situation.  For this purpose, SO 2 monitors have been installed on both farms and are operating continuously.  Sampling and weekly analysis of local rainfall is being carried out to determine the deposition rate for various substances including sulphur, fluoride, aluminium and other metals which may be attributable to emissions.  Measurement of organic compounds in the air is also ongoing.</P>
      <P>In addition, the Environmental Protection Agency has since April 1995 been undertaking inspections of all major industrial activities in the area and has commenced a related programme of emission measurements. Advice has been obtained from experts in toxicology at the Ministry of Agriculture and Food in the UK and the Environmental Protection Agency in the USA regarding the overall programme of investigations and this advice provides validation for the work which is now continuing.</P>
      <P>The agency has already published, and widely circulated at local level, an information booklet on the background to the investigations.  I understand that it intends shortly to publish a first interim report on the programmes of investigations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, has recently issued a statement which fully explains the reasons for the decision by the State to take over the two farms which are the subject of the investigations.  In brief, he has explained that existing legislation does not provide a basis for the conduct <Col N="1747" /> of the required scientific and credible veterinary investigation in the circumstancess obtaining in the Askeaton area. A practical approach has, therefore, been taken to securing the farms and cattle for participation in this much needed investigation.  It will be in the interests of all concerned that this investigation proceeds on a sound scientific basis and without further delay.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for giving the House a little more information than what was given by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Yates, and I join with him in commending the Environmental Protection Agency on the tests it has been conducting in the Askeaton area.  The question which remains to be answered, however, is why the Government has lashed out almost £1 million taxpayer's money in taking over these farms when section 96 of the Environmental Protection Agency Act and the Protection of Animals Act, 1984 specifically allow authorised personnel to gain entry to farms to carry our inspections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry and I would have a different question to answere if we said that the State would not incur this expense.  We are determined to expend whatever sum is required to discover the causes of the problems on the two farms concerned.  It is in the national interest that we do so expeditiously and effectively.</P>
      <P>The Environmental Protection Agency Act and the Air Pollution Act contain provisions under which authorised persons may enter premises to undertake limited and prescribed actions.  That is the advice we have received from the Attorney General. Neither Act nor any other legislation that I am aware of grants the powers required in these circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will agree that the compulsory take-over of the farms by the State, the compulsory removal of some cattle, the compulsory restocking of the <Col N="1748" /> farms in a prescribed manner and the prescriptive management of the farms and stocks is required to ensure the integrity of the veterinary investigation. It would be unjustifiable for the State to take over the farms in the way required without the payment of proper compensation to the individuals concerned.  My colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry has taken the correct course of action to ensure the four studies I have mentioned are conducted speedily to discover the causes of the problems.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey:</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept what the Minister has said.  Section 8 (1) (e) of the Protection of Animals Kept for Farming Purposes Act, 1984, states clearly that an authorised person may enter&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>As a member of the Government, the Minister participated in the decision to spend unnecessarily £1 million of taxpayers money.  He, therefore, bears some responsibility.  The section I have mentioned clearly states that an inspector may enter premises to carry out inspections and conduct tests,-analysis and so on.  The Environmental Protection Agency Act contains similar powers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin:</NameTxt>
      <P>I have outlined clearly the powers available to the Environmental Protection Agency under the appropriate Act.  It does not provide a basis for the conduct of the investigation <Col N="1749" /> required in this instance.  It is not a question of monitoring, but of removing animals to allow tests to be conducted, controlling the times of feeds and managing the farms.  We considered taking special powers by way of the introduction of special legislation, but in all the circumstances it was thought more appropriate, to be fair to the families concerned, to take the route followed.  This is in the interests of the environment and the agriculture sector.  I would be surprised if anyone did not wholehearthly approve of it.</P>

      <Quest>the number of local authority houses in the Dublin and Cork urban areas and in the remainder of the State which still have outdoor toilets only or exposed non-insulated hot water tanks; and the plans, if any, he has to provide grants to end this unsatisfactory situation.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin:</NameTxt>
      <P>While information in the form requested is not available in my Department, returns made by local authorities indicate that, out of their total of approximately 95,000 rented dwellings, some 2,500 lacked bathroom facilities at 31 December 1994.  Dublin Corporation had 1,079 such dwellings and Cork Corporation had 378.  In the case of 490 dwellings in Dublin and six in Cork, I understand the tenants have indicated they do not wish at this stage to have facilities installed.</P>
      <P>To assist local authorities in providing the necessary facilities, funding is provided by my Department under the bathrooms sub-programme, the provision for which in 1995 is £3 million.  In addition, bathroom facilities can be provided as part of refurbishment projects under my Department's remedial works scheme.</P>
      <P>Local authorities have a legal obligation to provide sanitary facilities in their rented dwellings by 1 January 1998.  I am satisfied that, with the financial assistance available from the Department, they should be able to comply with this deadline.</P>

      <P>The Minister mentioned that his Department pays out £3 million in the bathroom provision programme. My question relates to houses which have only an outdoor toilet.  I am aware his Department gives assistance for bathrooms but Dublin Corporation and other local authorities have requested that the programme be extended to people with outdoor toilets <Col N="1751" /> only, as distinct from the bathroom.  Can he not accede to that request?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin:</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no difficulty facilitating that request, it should be part of the normal upgrading of houses.  We are spending a lot of money under the normal remedial schemes to upgrade and refurbish sub-standard housing and the lack of an indoor toilet would qualify under the generous allocation of moneys available through my Department. Under that programme some £150 million has been allocated to date.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern:</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister approve special funds to be given from the bathroom provision programme towards houses with outdoor toilets only?  There are two categories of houses involved &mdash; those with outdoor toilets and those with outdoor toilets and an indoor bathroom &mdash; but the programme allows for one and not the other.  In this day and age it is not proper to expect people to be satisfied with an outdoor toilet.  I accept there is an overall refurbishment programme but can the Minister not change Department policy to allow grants from the bathroom programme to be made available to local authorities for houses which have an indoor bathroom but an outdoor toilet?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin:</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8, 18, 25, 36, 40, 54, 144 and 146 together.</P>
      <P>As stated in reply to Parliamentary Question No. 117 of 13 June 1995, there is a wide variety of processes, both in use and in course of development, for the treatment or disposal of different kinds of waste.  My Department, the Environmental Protection Agency and other interested public authorities keep themselves generally informed about these processes but are not involved in their development or operation.  The indications are that no other waste disposal technique of general application can reduce solid waste volume at a rate similar to incineration.</P>
      <P>Waste incineration is used extensively within the OECD countries and is regulated by a number of EU Directives. Irish environmental legislation, in particular the Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1992, provides for licensing of waste incineration activities on the basis of best practicable standards; where appropriate, this includes the application of EU standards.</P>
      <P>Only certain hazardous wastes at on-site industrial facilities and hospital wastes are at present incinerated in Ireland.  As regards hazardous waste incineration, it has already been determined, following a full review, that Government assistance will not be provided for a contract incineration facility. On-site incineration of hazardous wastes, subject to strict Environmental Protection Agency licensing, and export of remaining limited quantities of wastes requiring off-site high-temperature incineration, represent satisfactory environmental management options for this waste stream to which minimisation and recovery methods are also increasingly being applied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards hospital waste incinceration, consultations took place between my Department and the Department of Health in relation to the application to hospital incinerators of the licensing provisions of the Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1992.  Integrated pollution control licensing applies to all <Col N="1754" /> new activities for incineration of hospital waste and to existing activities related to hospitals with more than 200 acute in-patient beds.</P>
    <P>As Minister for Health, I took a number of initiatives of which the Deputy may be aware in relation to health care risk waste.  A disposal strategy, based on non-incineration technologies, was proposed to the health agencies and pilot projects involving microwaving of wastes were initiated.  Since then, the policy agreement, <i>A Government of Renewal</i>, affirmed the commitment to replace existing incinerators for the disposal of clinical and hospital waste with new non-incineration technologies and action on foot of this commitment is being pursued by the Minister for Health and the health care agencies involved.  In this connection, I refer to the replies by the Minister for Health to Parliamentary Questions No. 88 of 7 June 1995 and No. 73 of 27 June 1995.</P>
    <P>Incineration of waste with energy recovery is recognised as a valid source of alternative energy.  The Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications has recently announced details of a special initiative to promote the production of electricity from biomass, including forestry, agricultural and other wastes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his detailed reply.  Does he not agree the Government seems to lack direction on the question of hospital waste?  As he knows, an application was recently made for an incinerator in Ringsend which would dispose of hospital waste. It was passed from one Department to the other &mdash; from the Department of the Environment to the Department of Health to the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications &mdash; but the buck did not seem to stop anywhere. People found it difficult to get a clear and final answer as to the Government's position on incineration and perhaps the Minister could clear that up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin:</NameTxt>
      <P>I can only refer the Deputy to the statement by the Minister <Col N="1755" /> for Health, who has issued a policy document on the management of waste in the health services.  The primary aims of the document are to minimise the impact of waste in the environment and to bring about better conditions for those handling waste.  The document goes into some detail; I will not outline it to the House but will circulate it to the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan:</NameTxt>
      <P>That is fine but the frustrating aspect of the matter is that the health boards used to be responsible for getting rid of hospital waste; it is now up to each hospital, but the only body to whom hospitals can give their waste is to an incineration operation, which has subsequently lost its licence and must apply for a new one.  This is a thorny issue politically and many people are opposed to it but, ultimately, each hospital has been given responsibility. They must get rid of hospital waste. How will they do so?  This matter is being passed from Billy to Jack.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin:</NameTxt>
      <P>The strategy in the Programme for Government is to phase out incineration of hospital waste.  From last month, hospitals with over 200 beds need a licence from the Environmental Protection Agency to incinerate waste. The Minister for Health intends to have a health care waste management strategy that envisages four waste treatment centres and suggests new technologies involving non-incineration methods, for example, shredding and disinfecting by microwave.  When I was Minister for Health I introduced that pilot plan to deal with hospital waste in Cork.  It might become the national model and is under discussion with the health agencies involved.  The specific commitments in the Programme for Government will be implemented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey:</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of a submission by a consultant in the Adelaide Hospital to the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs when it discussed the Waste Bill.  He <Col N="1756" /> stated that the only safe way to get rid of some medicines and so on was by incineration.  Is the Minister saying it will not be permissible to incinerate such waste?  Is the Minister satisfied that using microwaves is an effective way of getting rid of dangerous substances? The system was developed in France but is not used extensively there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin:</NameTxt>
      <P>The first priority is to ensure that the method of disposal is safe.  The idea of waste minimisation will apply and there will be streams of waste.  Some medicines may not be suitable for disposal other than through incineration and that will be open to the authorities.  However, the bulk of the waste, for example, syringes and plastic containers which would not pose a threat in themselves, could be disinfected. The method proposed is one of a number.  Another would be to grind them to a powder and disinfect the powder either through an autoclave, which is steam cleaning, disinfectant or microwave. Those options are being examined and best international standards and practice will apply.  There will be a different reaction if we go down the road of incineration <i>per se.</i></P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin:</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9 and 150 together.</P>
      <P>In recognition of the valuable work being done under the aegis of the Task Force on Special Housing Aid for the Elderly, including the installation of water water and sewerage facilities, I arranged for an increase to £3 million in the 1995 provision for this scheme, an increase of £1 million on the provision decided by the former Government on 29 November 1994 when approving the Estimates for 1995.  I cannot indicate as the House will be aware the funding to be provided next year for the Task Force until the final Estimates are published by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is unacceptable for the elderly to be living in houses without the basic facilities of water and sewerage and that grants are not available from the Department.  The only grant available is provided by the health board.  The funding is completely inadequate. The Minister mentioned a figure of £3 million but he must realise that in 1994 Fianna Fáil allocated £2 million. The Minister is talking about £3 million this year but it was £4 million for the previous year.  No matter how one looks at it the figure has been reduced by £1 million.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will use the figures to suit his cause.  The published figure in the 1994 Estimates was £2 million. An additional £2 million became available through the proceeds of the much vaunted tax amnesty.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that £100 million was allocated to the health boards in 1994 from the same source.  That was not reallocated in 1995 because the proceeds of the tax amnesty were not available.  All the 1994 benefits as a result of the tax amnesty were in addition to the allocations published in the Book of Estimates.  That point was reinforced in the Budgetary Statement of the Minister for Finance, Deputy <Col N="1758" /> Ahern.  There was a Fianna Fáil minority Government in power for one month and on 29 November it passed a Book of Estimates which allocated £2 million for 1995.</P>

    <P>Under the capital assistance scheme, <Col N="1759" /> at least 75 per cent of the dwellings in a project must be let to persons approved for local authority housing, homeless persons, or local authority tenants or tenant purchasers surrendering their existing dwellings to the authority.  Voluntary bodies are obliged to consult the local authorities who administer the schemes in relation to the granting of all tenancies.  In the case of projects commenced from 1 May this year, one quarter of the tenancies in any development must be allocated to persons nominated by the local authority.</P>
    <P>Under the rental subsidy scheme, subsidy is payable where the dwellings are let to persons approved for local authority housing whose household income did not exceed £9,000 in the previous tax year, or £11,000 in the case of not more than 25 per cent of houses in a particular project.  The voluntary body is required to obtain the approval of the local authority to the granting of each tenancy in respect of which rental subsidy is sought.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11 and 38 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a matter for the planning authorities to set out policy in their development plans for the location and regulation of development and in the provision of public open space and <Col N="1760" /> other such amenities in new housing areas.  When deciding planning applications, a planning authority must have regard to the policies set out in the plan and may attach conditions to permissions requiring the provision of appropriate facilities.  These are matters best left for decision at local level.  I have no plans, therefore to change existing arrangements.</P>
    <P>The provision of open spaces, playing fields and so on, in local authority housing schemes is a matter for the individual housing authorities in the first instance.  Appropriate facilities of this kind in housing schemes are financed from my Department's capital allocations. Local authorities have been advised, in guidelines issued by the Department, that new housing should comprise smaller well-designed schemes, intergrated as far as possible with housing and other development in the area and resulting in the creation of a good living environment for the residents, convenient to all important services and amenities.</P>
    <P>Funding is available under my Department's remedial works scheme to assist local authorities in carrying out major structural works to &ldquo;low-cost&rdquo; and pre-1940 dwellings and run-down urban estates.  Environmental works, such as the upgrading of existing amenity areas, may be included under such schemes where they are considered necessary to support works undertaken on the particular dwellings.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very disappointed with the Minister's reply.  While accepting that the local planning authority is responsible for providing such facilities, they are not being provided. When the British built Dublin in the last two centuries they provided huge open spaces such as Merrion Square and St. Stephen's Green, within five minutes walk of this House&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin:</NameTxt>
      <P>Not under local authority responsibility, though.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy:</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;whereas now all local <Col N="1761" /> authorities are strapped for cash to the extent that they cannot provide facilities. Will the Minister do something about it since they simply to not have the wherewithal to provide such facilities? Indeed a huge number of housing estates was built in major urban areas in the 1970s without recreational or leisure centres, playing pitches or parks, so that we are now being subjected to vandalism <i>ad nauseam</i> for example in Gallanstown last week, Ronanstown and Neilstown last year, or Knocknaheany in Cork, Ballybeg in Waterford&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle:</NameTxt>
      <P>I must remind the Deputy that this is Question Time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy:</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister ensure there is some structural development other than concrete jungles? While I appreciate his inherited predicament. will he demonstrate some initiative by changing the established counter-productive system?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin:</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Deputy will not accuse me of being inactive or of not having initiative.  I presume he read very carefully the documentation I sent him in April, some four or five months after I assumed office, detailing the new elaborate social housing plan dealing with specific issues including, for the first time, estate management.  A very comprehensive strategy has already been adopted by this Government, launched by me and the Minister of State with specific responsibility for housing, Deputy McManus, details of which have been brought to the attention of members of all local authorities and their officials.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the linchpins of this Government's strategy on local democracy is empowerment of local government.  I do not intend to centralise in the Custom House all decisions on local spaces, where amenities should be located or what is appropriate to a particular housing estate.  That would run counter to our policy and good planning.  Rather I want to empower local authorities to get on with the job.  We have drawn up the <Col N="1762" /> framework, and are providing them with the requisite resources to do just that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan:</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Deasy, that local authorities can take all the decisions they want but, if they do not have the requisite resources, it is impossible to implement them.  Indeed the second question tabled is more relevant in that, within the overall context of inner city renewal there is now greater demand for a more structured approch to the provision of open spaces and small parks; yet, it is very expensive to acquire land for such purposes. While it is fine for the Minister to say he will empower local authorities to provide such facilities, and while they may take such decisions, they do not have the requisite funds to implement them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin:</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a number of things happening simultaneously.  I mentioned the social housing policy initiative, representing a total review of the manner in which we look at housing.  It appears that Deputy Eoin Ryan is talking about some private development. There will be a mix of developments in response to a nationwide desire for more open spaces around our housing estates.  I have answered questions here on open spaces which at night are a hazard to citizens particularly women.  That is also a factor that must be taken into account.  We must remember that some people choose to live in the heart of our cities, where the quality and density of housing will vary.  Not everybody will choose to have a garden, not everybody wants to have an open space but a mix of housing, public and private should be available.  Local authorities being subject to local democracy are best placed to make those determinations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The moneys available under the social housing programme this year are unprecedented, indicating not only a commitment to local authority housing &ldquo;starts&rdquo;, their type and variety, but also a range of other mechanisms from voluntary housing to estate management <Col N="1763" /> being funded by my Department under the new plan.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy:</NameTxt>
      <P>I regard these two questions as extraordinarily important and have been endevouring to raise them by way of debate for some years past. Seldom do I get an opportunity to raise the matter directly with the Minister.  I do not want him to take issue with me on the points I am raising simply because he has been in office such a short time.  He spoke about the initiative implemented in April last, the results of which we shall await; the proof of the pudding is in the eating.  With regard to &ldquo;organised&rdquo; open spaces, as distinct from undeveloped fields&mdash;which, for all the reasons the Minister mentioned, are a danger, along with the problem of stray horses frequently found in them&mdash; a number of huge local authority housing estates have been provided without any open space facilities.  From now on perhaps the Minister will be able to encourage local authorities to provide facilities, perhaps by placing a ceiling on the amount of their grants, specifying or designating a sum for housing and another sum for other facilities.  Will he bear in mind the consequences of those disastrous housing estates built in the 1970's?  I do not want to be at odds with the Minister but I ask him, please, to recognise the problem.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">

      <P>I often feel I come in here to do the job of the Green Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin:</NameTxt>
      <P>I can agree with much of what Deputy Deasy has said, that mistakes were made in the past when the imperative was to build houses and provide shelter for people who were experiencing appalling living conditions. Indeed scant regard was had, say 20 or 30 years ago when houses were built without chimneys or heating systems. We are now spending huge sums of <Col N="1764" /> money to rectify those deficiecies.  We have learned from that experience, to the extent that all the new developments will have the facilities the Deputy requires.  We are looking for &ldquo;infill&rdquo; rather than green field sites and are endeavouring to build &ldquo;communities&rdquo; as well as housing, a phrase I have used when opening housing estates. Indeed I opened two voluntary housing schemes in Deputy Deasy's constituency in the city of Waterford last week. One was built by the Good Shepherd Sisters and one by RESPOND, both with community centres encompassing a synergy and community-built effort.</P>
      <P>An estates management initiative is being implemented but we need to examine the long-term problems in those housing estates about which the Deputy spoke and in respect of which he is quite right.  I have a responsibility in that regard and, ironically, the Minister of State at my Department&mdash;who wears another hat as Minister with responsibility for sport&mdash;also has a responsibility in building up such facilities. It is my hope that, together, we can tackle the real dilemma Deputy Deasy has correctly identified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern:</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Minister's point that matters will not be as bad in the future given the housing plan in operation for the past few years. However, Deputy Deasy has a point. Can anything be done with those schemes built ten or 20 years ago which are a major problem?  While local authorities may have made provision in their development plans for sites, those sites have not been landscaped.  They have been left wild, derelict and dangerous. Can anything be done with the old sites?  Some of the new in-fill sites are adjacent to them.  The plan may work well if it applies from last April or April two years ago, but we cannot try to work for perfection from now on and ignore what happened 20 years ago.  Can anything be done about the existing problems?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin:</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy <Col N="1765" /> and we can do both.  In new housing developments which link into older ones there can be a common facility and under the capital programme we can provide moneys to service both.  I encourage local authorities to incorporate that in their development plans.  In terms of the specific upgrading of low cost or pre-1940 dwellings we can include amenity provision as part of general refurbishment work.  The Deputy's propositions can thus be accommodated. Under the remedial works scheme we have spent a considerable sum of money, including £18.5 million this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">

      <NameTxt>Miss Quill:</NameTxt>
      <P>Despite what the Minister has said and his putting in place a strategy which, if implemented, will bring about a major change, will he accept that there is a major lack of recreational provision for young people in local authority estates?  The result is that instead of learning to play games or kick football, young people break windows, vandalise public and private buildings and are involved in all types of vandalism and hooliganism.  I see no evidence of a Damascus-like conversion on the part of any of the local authorities.</P>
      <P>A scheme exists whereby a local authority can set aside 1 per cent of the overall cost of a scheme for the provision of a work of art.  Will the Minister consider introducing such a scheme whereby a certain percentage of the overall cost of new housing developments would be set aside to provide proper recreational facilities in conjuction with building of the housing estate?  The model exists already with the scheme for works of art.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is going beyond the bounds of the question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin:</NameTxt>
      <P>On taking office I spent some months examining the housing scheme.  After great consultation we <Col N="1766" /> have published a new social housing plan which has been largely accepted. It encompasses a number of initiatives.  I would like it to be allowed settle and operate and we will see a dramatic improvement.  We need enormous resources to rectify all the problems that exist.</P>
      <P>I caution Deputies against thinking that any disturbance in a housing estate is immediately attributable to a lack of facilities and can be solved instantly by providing a playing field.  Some of the social problems are far deeper and require deeper analysis rather than an instant reaction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister referred to the voluntary housing scheme.  Does the Minister agree that the take up of that scheme has been poor in the area north of a line from Dublin to Galway? Does the relevant information on the scheme go to all interested parties?  The take up is disappointing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin:</NameTxt>
      <P>There has not been a uniform pattern of take up of voluntary housing money.  A significant sum is available this year.  If the Deputy is aware of areas where there is a social need he should develop a voluntary group or encourage such a group to contact some of the other well practised groups in the voluntary housing schemes, or contact my Department directly.  I would facilitate any such group in an area that might require it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad Deputy Deasy sympathises with my difficulties in being a lone voice.  I wish to be of assistance in arriving at a deeper analysis of the problems and a solution.  Has the Minister considered visiting areas such as Gallanstown to see the problems for himself?  There is a widespread feeling that there is a lack of concern about these areas due to a lack of visits by public representatives to hear what the residents have to say.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister mentioned value for money in reply to Deputy Leonard. When communities are encouraged to <Col N="1767" /> take responsibility for their open spaces and facilities they can bring great change.  Encouragement may be as important as funds.</P>
    <P>The Minister may carry out a review for the European Nature Conservation Year; it is not entirely in the remit of his Department but is of concern to it.  Will the Minister take on board the change in emphasis from the policy of dealing with the natural environment in isolation, for example in large scale wildlife parks, to dealing with nature conversation in the context of the human environment?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Joe Jacob">

      <P>The question is over long, Deputy</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin:</NameTxt>
      <P>I entertain any invitations I get to visit areas.  Particular responsibility for housing and housing policy rests with Minister of State, Deputy McManus, who is currently in Madrid at a Housing Council meeting.  I will pass that message to her.</P>
      <P>The encouragement of local involvement is an important issue.  Community building involves my Department and many others&mdash;the Department of Enterprise and Employment and the Department of Education, for example. It is a matter we will certainly take on board.</P>
      <P>With regard to the European Nature Conservation Year there are a number of issues not confined to the macro-issue. The particular focus of ENCY has not been the large reserved parks but looking at nature outside the preserved areas.  The natural environment in the urban setting falls therein and has been the subject of many of the projects undertaken this year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin:</NameTxt>
      <P>There is already a substantial array of powers available to local authorities and the Garda Síochána to deal with difficulties associated with the indiscriminate location of temporary dwellings.  These powers are contained in the Local Government (Sanitary Services) Act, 1948; the Road Traffic Act, 1961; the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1992; and the Roads Act, 1993.</P>
      <P>While it is a matter for local authorities and the Garda to use these powers in appropriate cases, my Department has sought information from local authorities as an input to the review of the effectiveness of the existing legislation. However, in so far as the travelling community are concerned, the solution to the existing problems lies in the provision of suitable accommodation, in houses or on halting sites, rather than further legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy:</NameTxt>
      <P>If there are substantial powers available, that is news to me and to many gardaí.  My native town Dungarvan, has been inundated with hordes of itinerants and the nearby seaside resorts have been inundated with convoys of new age travellers.  The gardaí and the health authorities tell me they do not have power to move them on.  I am aware it is part of a greater problem to which the Minister alluded in his reply.  Can he offer hope of relief from this awful disturbance to the hardpressed local authorities and the beleagured residents?</P>
      <P>I appreciate the content of the task force report on itinerants but it could take decades to implement it.  Can meaningful legislation to deal with this problem be implemented urgently?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin:</NameTxt>
      <P>We are talking about two different categories, our own native travellers' needs can be dealt with in the housing policies we have spelled out. There is no shortage of resources for <Col N="1769" /> halting sites, transient sites and local authority or public housing.  I think that is the solution, not legislation.  The itinerants are our citizens who must be looked after and it is time we faced up to this issue.  The good local authorities take on their responsibilities and bear an inordinate share in trying to solve the problem but it is a matter for every local authority to take on the responsibility of providing for its own citizens in a way that meets their need.  Until all local authorities take on that job &mdash; and the new task force report specifies what needs to be done &mdash; the problems will occur in various areas around the country. I strongly urge, as I have done on previous occassions, local authorities to make decisions on the location of halting and transient sites and proper housing provisions for those travellers who wish to settle down.</P>
      <P>The new age traveller is a different category.  I am aware that Deputy Deasy made representations on the issue of trespass.  There is a law to deal with trespass on private property but the individual landowner must take the appropriate legal step and seek an injunction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy:</NameTxt>
      <P>As I found out during the summer the legal ownership of coves, beaches and the foreshore is tricky.  I am not at issue with the Minister on the itinerant problem, however the major difficulty is that it will take years to solve it.  I do not believe that halting sites are the answer.  Until such time as itinerants have the same standard of housing as every other citizen we will have major problems.  In the interim will the Minister not allow travellers to congregate in one location as this causes untold misery for the settled community in the area?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin:</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have indicated to the Deputy there is a body of law extant and it is up to the local authorities and the Garda Síochána to exercise the law. To enumerate, section 31 of the Local Government (Sanitary Services) Act provides that a sanitary authority may <Col N="1770" /> by order prohibit the erection or retention of temporary dwellings on any land or water in their sanitary district if they are of the opinion that such erection or rentention would be prejudicial to public health, or the amenities of the localities or would interfere to an unreasonable extent with traffic on any road.  The making of a prohibition order is a reserved function.  The Maximum fine for illegal camping is £1,000 and a maximum of £200 per day for a continuing offence.  The Road Traffic Act allowas for illegally parked or abandoned cars on a public road to be towed away. The Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1992, provides for the removal of temporary dwellings from certain locations.  Section 69 of the Road Traffic Act, 1993, prohibits the placing of temporary dwellings on national primary routes and section 71 prohibits the unlawful trading on public roads and so on.  There is a body of law extant.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern:</NameTxt>
      <P>The list of legislation the Minister read out sounded impressive but it must not work as the problem still exists.  I understand Deputy Deasy's problem but I view it from a city perspective. Some local authorities accept their responsibilities and provide accommodation and housing for travelling people but in Dublin the problem arises at the boundary line between different local authorities.  Each local authority may have its own plan but acts in isolation and there is no co-ordination. A body such as the Department is required to lay down standards.  I can talk about Finglas or Ballymun where the corporation has provided halting sites but across the road in the green belt, which is the Fingal County Council area, there are illegal settlers.  What is needed is a body that will act impartially and implement the legislation.  The local authorities may accept their own responsibility but if their nearest house <Col N="1771" /> is a mile or two away they ignore illegal sites.  I support Deputy Deasy's viewpoint but I have a slightly different perspective. Will the Minister introduce legislation or regulations because what is in force is not working?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin:</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a body of law that is not effective in every circumstance because we are subject to the overriding decision of the courts.  I still firmly believe that the problem will not be solved until such time as each local authority takes on its responsibilities and makes provision for the travellers in its functional area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin:</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is done, the problem will be resolved.  The Minister of State in my Department is a former chairperson of the task force and he will follow through on its report in so far as it affects housing.  The report considers ways in which the Deputy's objective of a co-ordinated national strategy can be achieved.  The Government has already made the decision that the task force recommendations will be acted on.</P>
      <P>To put the legislation I have outlined in context there is the structure of the Supreme Court case, 1980.  MacDonald <i>v.</i> Dublin County Council regarding the need for the local housing authority to offer alternative accommodation to families that are being displaced prior to any court granting an injunction requiring travellers to move on.  Until we have these facilities and until local authorities face up to their responsibilities to provide facilities for their citizens we will have the problem of a law that people regard as not being enforced.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent:</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Noel Ahern that co-ordination is badly needed, and I know the boundary area to which he refers.  I agree with the Minister also that it is time to act.  It is not all bad.  I taught travelling children. That experience was one of the most <Col N="1772" /> rewarding of my teaching career.  Lack of sanitation for travellers led to grazing land being unusable.  The Minister should consider the electorel legislation which he did not mention.  The people we are discussing are disenfranchised and often feel alienated.  They are underrepresented and misunderstood. Some of the vacancies in the Seanad, caused tragically by the deaths of former colleagues, might provide an opening for remedying the situation, because without representation people cannot partake responsibly in society to the extent the Minister would like.  It might provide an opportunity for us all to improve our understanding of what is ultimately a different culture.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey:</NameTxt>
      <P>I submitted a question today which was disallowed on the basis that is was not the Minister's responsibility to implement the recommendations of the task force report on travellers. Whose responsibility is it?  Will the Minister consider inserting definitions in legislation relating to travellers? I have no objection to what the Minister has said about travellers.  I support him 100 per cent in that.  However, some traders move out of houses in County Limerick and come to County Meath or to Deputy Deasy's constituency in Waterford.  So also do our new friends, namely, the New Age travellers, who have arrived mainly from Great Britain. Definitions would enable us to differentiate between them.  I do not believe the courts would accept that the McDonnell case applies to people who set out in a convoy early in the summer to go to other parts of the country to trade and to annoy and inflict themselves on other people during the summer months. Action should be taken in regard to that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister responsible for implementing the recommendations <Col N="1773" /> of the task force report on travellers is the Minister for Equality and Law Reform.  However, individual components of the strategy will fall, in due course, to be carried out by individual Ministers in carrying out their respective responsibilities.</P>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy regarding the distinction between mobile traders and travellers.  In 1994 when the Deputy's party and mine were closer in our working relationship, the Government established an interdepartmental group on mobile traders, and the Law Reform Commission was asked to review the law of trespass.  That is ongoing.  My Department has issued a circular listing liaison officers designated by local authorities to facilitate co-operation between local authorities and the Garda Síochána in monitoring and controlling the movement of mobile traders.  In addition, the Department has just issued a circular to local authorities seeking reports on the usage and effectiveness of the existing legislation and any specific recommendations for amending and strengthening the law in relation to mobile traders.  We are awaiting the reports of local authorities on that matter which I agree is quite separate from the general issue of travellers.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13, 147 and 148 together.  An application for the Donegal Bay wastewater management scheme, which includes the Bundoran sewerage scheme, was submitted to the European Commission for assistance under the Cohesion Fund in December 1994.  Financial approval of the scheme must await the outcome of this application. My Department has been pressing the Commission for early decisions on this and other pending water and sewerage proposals, and I have taken the matter up with the Commissioner responsible for Regional Development.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin:</NameTxt>
      <P>Earlier this year, I announced significant increases of more than 100 per cent in group water scheme grants, the first such increases since 1985.  This reflects the priority given to water-related works within the group schemes programme.</P>
      <P>While proposals are only infrequently made to my Department for group sewerage schemes, I intend also to review the grant levels for these schemes and, in the light of the outcome, to pursue appropriate proposals with my colleague, the Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's reply.  I believe the reason there are not too many group sewerage scheme applications is the level of the grant which is at about £500.  This matter is urgent particularly in counties which have experienced a huge development boom over the last ten or 15 years. It would be most beneficial, to public health apart from anything else, if the <Col N="1775" /> Minister would expedite that matter, give it his full attention and perhaps announce something early next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin:</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that very shortly after becoming Minister I addressed the issue of water grants and there was a general welcome across the House for the very substantial increase in the provision.  I immediately began to examine the problem of sewerage.  I have to tread a little more carefully here not only because of the volumes but also because of the environmental impact of sewerage schemes, the benefits of which are not as clear-cut as those of group water schemes.  I do not want to do anything that would facilitate the putting in of a sewerage facility that would prove to be an environmental hazard in a couple of years.  I am examining the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey:</NameTxt>
      <P>Initially the Minister might consider increasing the funding for groups that are anxious to connect to existing county council or local authority schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin:</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be difficult to make fish of one and fowl of another.  If I increase the funding, I must increase it for everybody.  I am in discussions with technical people about alternatives to such schemes.  New technology exists to allow for very long distance connections to sewerage schemes with good volume pumps and narrow piping which might be a much more environmentally effective way of dealing with the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard:</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that, although a substantial amount of money has been provided for group water schemes, there is still a very big backlog, especially where treatment works are required in second phase schemes?  There is a need for much more funding than is being provided. Will the Minister agree that in a small village where there is no local authority housing, the cost of sewerage schemes <Col N="1776" /> can be a real problem?  Tydavnet, a village in County Monaghan, will be compelled if it introduces a scheme to pipe it three or four miles to the Monaghan treatment works as it would not be possible to treat it there because of the rivers and lakes in that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am heartily disappointed that an increase of more than 100 per cent could not elicit a good response from Deputy Leonard.</P>

      <P>Regarding the other matter, I am not sure I agree with the Deputy regarding the pumping of sewage. I would be much more inclined, from an environmental perspective, to prefer pumping, if it is technologically possible.  It certainly is possible according to research undertaken in places like Austria and Switzerland where small communities, even small clusters of houses, pump their sewage to a central collection point ten or 15 miles away with individual pumps rather than having septic tanks or small treatment plants.  If we can provide secondary or tertiary treatment at a collection point and an effective and efficient way of pumping sewage to it, we might be moving in a much more environmentally progressive way than by providing individual sewage treatment plants.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent:</NameTxt>
      <P>I respect the Minister's <Col N="1777" /> wish to have in place the most environmentally sound sewerage schemes but I urge him to consider options that are not as yet rooted in the discipline of civil engineering such as reedbed sewage treatment which has proven effective in Wales, producing a raw material and extremely clean water.  I urge the Minister not to be taken by the solution of the civil engineers which does not always represent value for money.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">

    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill:</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister accept that the time has come to regulate and control ribbon development and that in the past there has been reckless proliferation of planning permissions for buildings with septic tanks?  The effect of that on the quality of our water can no longer be ignored.  The time has come to give serious consideration to the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin:</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree to some extent with the Deputy's views and I speak from two perspectives on this matter. We have decided to adopt a national sustainable development strategy, a significant component of which will involve a national land use policy which is being devised in my Department in consultation with the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry and other relevant Departments.  My experience as a member of a local authority in County Wexford is that good planning is hindered by people wishing to live where they want to &mdash; they argue that they own the land and are entitled to build on it.  This is a very tricky matter&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill:</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin:</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but we must have a rational and sustainable strategy that does not burden the environment.  That is the main thrust of what I want to achieve under the national sustainable development strategy which will be replicated in plans at local level.  I hope <Col N="1778" /> local representatives follow through on the general desire not to overburden the environment.</P>

      <Quest>when he intends to make an order implementing section 105 of the Environmental Protection Agency Act to give the Environmental Protection Agency statutory powers, such as the right to subpoena witnesses, to enter premises and to search for or take possession of documents in order that the agency can finally be enabled to carry out its statutory duties effectively.</Quest>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought the Minister might have done this before now.  I am not sure if I agree with Deputy Dempsey that spending money in the Askeaton case was unnecessary, but much more could have been achieved in the investigation if section 105 of the Environmental Protection Agency Act were enacted.  That section empowers persons conducting an inquiry to carry out such an inspection and examination and make such inquiries as appear reasonably necessary.  There is wide scope under the provisions of that section.  Does the Environmental Protection Agency operate under the provisions of section 13 of the Act in respect of power to enter premises for the purpose of making inquiries which is limited to its role in respect of licensing? I disagree with the Minister in that many more farmers may seek his assistance. Does he agree that it would have been more appropriate if he had enacted section 105 before making a decision on this matter?  In that way the Environmental Protection Agency would have been able to carry out a <Col N="1779" /> broader investigation.  It must now wait until the Minister reaches a decision, perhaps, to buy more farms in the area which would not necessarily benefit all concerned.  Will section 105 be enacted before further problems come to light in Askeaton?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin:</NameTxt>
      <P>I was loath to enact section 105 alone.  I wanted to introduce individual sections of the Act in a programmed manner that would fit the ability of the agency which is currently recruiting personnel.  As in the case of the Child Care Act, I do not believe in devolving statutory authority to agencies who are not equipped or ready to deal with such power.  In general I do not agree it would be appropriate to use the provisions of section 105 in the Askeaton case.  What is envisaged under that section is a type of sworn inquiry that would examine major incidents of environmental pollution or matters of major concern relating to environmental protection.  We do not know the cause of the problems in Askeaton.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin:</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a serious issue. The public has a jaundiced view of <Col N="1780" /> inquiries.  I prefer an informal inquiry that allows experts to get to grips with the problem from the four perspectives I outlined in reply to the earlier question on this matter.  The human health dimension is being dealt with by the local health board, an environmental analysis is being carried out by the Environmental Protection Agency, a vegetative analysis by Teagasc and an animal health analysis by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry. Those bodies must be given the necessary resources to get to the bottom of the problem in Askeaton.  I am not qualified or in a position to make a judgment on the matter at this stage.  I anxiously await the interim report which will be published shortly by the Environmental Protection Agency and ultimately the final conclusions.  We do not know what will eventually transpire but the Government is determined to provide the necessary mechanisms and resources to resolve the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent:</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister saying that section 105 would not have been useful in the Askeaton case if it had been enacted?  There is wide scope under the provisions of that section.  It does not deal simply with a sworn inquiry.  The Act allows more widespread entry than section 13.  Does the Minister agree that section 105 would be useful in discovering the more specific causes of the problem?  By saying the problem is environmental, I include human health and the wider implications of that word.  To that extent I do not believe it can be denied that there is a strong environmental dimension to the problem in Askeaton.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin:</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a problem, but we do not know the source of it and we are making every effort to find it.  I support the action of my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, in acquiring the land to carry out exhaustive analysis, including removing some of the animals for testing and placing them on different land to see how they thrive.  That could not be done <Col N="1781" /> unless somebody went on to the land to carry out an investigation.  We are not taking a snapshot view of the problem but are carrying out a long-term analysis of management, the air, soil, grassland and other aspects.  Such analysis will be facilitated by the Government's decision and is a much better way of dealing with the matter than setting up an inquiry as envisaged under section 105 of the Environmental Protection Agency Act.  I repeat I intend bringing that section into force before the end of the year, but had it been in force I would not have envisaged its being of use in this instance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey:</NameTxt>
      <P>In light of the Minister's statement that the Environmental Protection Agency Act is not sufficiently strong in this area, has he any plans to amend that Act to allow people in future cases like the Askeaton case to go onto lands to carry out monitoring? I do not accept the Minister has no power in that regard under the Environmental Protection Agency Act and other Acts, but if he believes the powers are not sufficient has he plans to amend the Act?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin:</NameTxt>
      <P>That is an extension of the question.  Advice available to the Government is that the control required to carry out such an investigation, that is total management of animals and their patterns of feeding, would be so intrusive and prolonged that it could not be encompassed under current legislative powers.  It would be an incredible intrusion into the privacy of families who derive their livelihood from the land.  In those circumstances it was right and proper that we should allow the investigation to be carried out and allow people to get on with their lives.  The correct and wise course of action has been taken in that regard.  I do not envisage other circumstances that would require specific legislation or a specific <Col N="1782" /> amendment, but that matter will be considered when this investigation is concluded.</P>

      <askee>Minister for the Environment</askee>
      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the considerable increase in the number of itinerants; and if his Department, in conjunction with the Departments of Health and Education, has any plans to solve the problems this growth is creating.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin:</NameTxt>
      <P>While it may be unintentional, I am somewhat concerned at the tone of the question.  There has of course been an increase in the number of traveller households, but it is up to the community as a whole to make appropriate provision for this section of the community, as for all others.  In this connection, I should point out that the health strategy which, as Minister for Health, I launched last year contains a number of initiatives to address the particular health needs of the travelling community and to improve mortality and morbidity rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1783" /> As Minister for the Environment, my role in relation to the travelling community relates to the provision of housing and serviced caravan parks for them. Each local authority is responsible, as housing authority, for the planning, initiation and construction of housing and serviced caravan parks for travelling people who are assessed as in need of such accommodation and unable to provide it from their own resources.  My Department provides the necessary funding, as well as a general advisory and supervisory service to ensure that technical standards and cost control procedures are observed.</P>
    <P>The Task Force on the Travelling Community, whose final report was published last July, dealt comprehensively with the full range of matters, including accommodation, health and education, relating to the travelling community.  The Government has decided that implementation of the report should be considered by a group of officials from the relevant Government Departments, under the auspices of the Department of Equality and Law Reform.  The Government will consider further the implementation of the task force recommendations on receipt of a report from these officials.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy:</NameTxt>
      <P>I make no apologies for putting down such a question.  It is a follow-up to a question I put down some months ago in this House which indicated that there has been an absolute explosion in the number of itinerants or travellers; the numbers have multiplied. The task force report does not address this problem in any form or manner and will not contribute one iota to solving it.  We must become involved in matters relating to education and health.  In view of the explosion in the number of travellers, has any attempt been made to counsel travellers on matters such as family planning?  In recent weeks I received figures to the effect that a number of traveller children are educated up to 12 or 13 years of age but thereafter <Col N="1784" /> there is a dramatic fall-off in their attendance at schools.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister adopt a co-ordinated approach in conjunction with the Ministers for Health and Education to ensure the problem is brought under control?  Unlike many local representatives, I sympathise with and stand up for travellers.  By putting down this question I am in no way denigrating them.  I want to see a solution to what has become an enormous problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought the question was put down by Deputy Timmins.  I was concerned at the tone of the question, that it is regarded as a problem or alarming that any group of people should increase in numbers.  If the Deputy put down a question asking what plans the Minister has to deal with the considerable increase in the number of Waterford men, there would be an implication in that which is not helpful.</P>
      <P>I was responsible for drawing up the national health strategy last year, one of the main objectives of which was to improve the health status of vulnerable groups in society &mdash; no group has a more vulnerable health status than travellers, particularly women travellers.  If there is an increase in the number of travelling people, thank God for that. They are living longer and their health status has improved, but there is a long way to go before their standard of health is equal to that of other Irish citizens. I make no apology for targeting in the national health strategy efforts to improve the health and morbidity records of the travelling community who have for so long endured appalling conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My responsibility now relates to housing and accommodation.  I am no longer responsible for health and I am not responsible for education.  The whole area of travellers' welfare is co-ordinated by my colleague, the Minister for Equality and Law Reform.  The task force has reported.

      <P>I am not at all impressed by the sanctimonious tone of the Minister's reply.  There is a considerable problem in this area and the only way it will be solved is by an integrated approach by the Departments referred to in the question.  There is tremendous suffering among all travelling people, particularly the younger children, and it behoves us to ensure that suffering is alleviated, if not eliminated, immediately. A co-ordinated approach must be adopted by the Departments of Health, Education and the Environment.  Such an approach is not being adopted at present and the task force does not even attempt to tackle the problems that exist.</P>

      <P>All of us will have been shocked by the tragedy which rocked the peace process in the Middle East this past weekend, which was the brutal assassination of the Prime Minister of Israel, Yitzhak Rabin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I met Yitzhak Rabin recently on an official visit to the Middle East and I was instantly impressed by him as a man of absolute and unshakeable determination. A life long career in the service of his country combined the arduous tasks of soldier, diplomat and politician. He was almost unique in recent times as a soldier who dedicated his final years to the less tangible but still very considerable risks of peace-making.  He knew, as perhaps only a soldier can, the horror of war at first hand and was as resolved as any man I ever met to make a personal contribution to lasting peace. <Col N="1955" /> He knew the ups and downs of politics and tasted success and failure in that aspect of his career.  He found the process of reconciliation personally difficult, yet did not shirk from the gestures which were necessary to bring a sense of reconciliation about.</P>
    <P>If we can take any comfort from the images and pictures which were broadcast from Prime Minister Rabin's funeral yesterday, we can perhaps hope that his death, brutal and tragic as it was, may have copper-fastened the reconciliation he was determined to secure.  The poignant image of a blood stained piece of paper with the words of a song of peace written on it will long linger in all our memories and will, we all fervently hope, serve as an inspiration to those who follow in his footsteps.</P>
    <P>It will, I know, be the united message of this House in any event that we will do anything we can to help ensure that the process of building a durable peace and a more secure future in the Middle East will not be shaken.  On behalf of the Government, I wish to extend our sympathy to the people of Israel on the loss of a great leader and a great peace maker.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern:</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to join with the Tánaiste in his expression of sympathy on the assassination of Prime Minister Rabin which was a source of deep shock and regret to all of us in the House. Prime Minister Rabin had a long and distinguished record of political and military service to the state of Israel.  He showed great statesmanship in finally making peace with the Palestinians and he recognised that there was no way around the need to fulfil their deepest aspiration &mdash; the creation of an independent Palestinian state.  However difficult this was for many Israelis and Jews around the world to accept and despite the huge pressures on the peace process from extremes on both sides, Prime Minister Rabin held a steady course and in the end paid for it with his life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Middle East process to which <Col N="1956" /> Prime Minister Rabin contributed so much has been an inspiration to Ireland. It was Mr. Rabin who said that it was not with one's friends but with one's enemies that one had to make peace.  A perceptive and experienced correspondent, Ann Leslie, wrote the following in the <i>Independent</i> this morning &ldquo;Doves are never wholly to be trusted to make peace, they are likely to be accused of going soft or being deluded by their enemies.&rdquo;  Instead, it was the former tough war leader Rabin who was able to make peace and who could be trusted by most Israelis to do a deal with the Palestinians without damaging vital interests.  If Israelis and Palestinians could make peace, as well as whites and blacks in South Africa, it should equally be possible for the Unionist and Nationalist traditions here to reach an agreed political settlement which would be the basis for a lasting peace.</P>
    <P>I sincerely hope that the death of Mr. Rabin will not deflect from the Middle East peace process in any way and that, if anything, it will make people more determined to preserve it.  It has to be brought home to people who reject peace that terrorism does not pay and is politically suicidal and profoundly counterproductive.  I very much doubt if the consequences will be anything other than detrimental to the self interests of the settler community from which the assassin came.</P>
    <P>The sympathies of our party go to the family of Mr. Rabin, the state of Israel and the Jewish community in Ireland and their representative, the Ambassador, who is present.  Mr. Rabin's name will be remembered with honour.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): It is my sad duty to express condolences to the Israeli Government and the people on the assassination last Saturday of the Prime Minister of Israel, Yitzhak Rabin.  This was a particularly tragic death for a man who tried to bring peace to his people in the Middle East.  He nurtured the idea of peace in the Middle East and successfully promoted the idea with his <Col N="1957" /> colleagues and, eventually, with the Palestinians and the Arabs.</P>
      <P>As Members will know, as a gesture of Ireland's shock at this savage assassination of a man of peace, the Taoiseach yesterday attended the funeral ceremonies for Mr. Rabin in Jerusalem.  In attending, the Taoiseach wanted to underline Ireland's commitment to the Middle East peace process and to pledge our continuing support to the Government of Israel and the Palestinian authority for the courageous course of action which they embarked on two years ago with the declaration of principles.  This has already borne substantial results, most recently with the signing on 28 September last of the interim agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.  This accord represents a landmark achievement in the Middle East peace process.  It marks an important phase in the effort towards achieving a just, comprehensive and lasting settlement to the problems which have beset the region for generations.</P>
      <P>In the Government's view, this agreement, and the peace treaty signed one year ago between Israel and Jordan, are part of Yitzhak Rabin's legacy.  The peace established by these two agreements opens the way for the building throughout the Middle East of networks of regional co-operation and independence. They hold out the promise of a Middle East characterised by political stability and economic prosperity.  This Government will continue to play its part, both nationally and as a member of the European Union, in building on Yitzhak Rabin's legacy in the Middle East peace process.</P>
      <P>Last Sunday week I met and spoke with Yitzhak Rabin at the Middle East economic conference in Oman.  At that conference, he shared a platform with his fellow Nobel prize winners Yasser Arafat and Shimon Peres.  He was full of hope and confidence and resolute in his pursuit of peace.  Things change a great deal in a week.  Ar dheis lámh Dé go raibh a anam.</P>

      <P>I wish to join with the <Col N="1958" /> Tánaiste, Deputy Ahern and the Minister, Deputy Noonan, in expressing my sympathy, and that of the Progressive Democrats, to the people of Israel, through their Ambassador who is present and to the Jewish community in Ireland.</P>
      <P>The late Yitzhak Rabin was a remarkable man, a world visionary and very courageous.  As Shakespeare would have said, he made the transition from cast'ed to cushion.  One of the defining moments of our time was the famous handshake between him and Yasser Arafat on the lawn of the White House.</P>
      <P>However, there are refreshing things on which we can all look back.  It was refreshing to see such an illustrious group of Arab leaders attend his Funeral.  It was remarkable that King Hussein made his first visit to Israel to attend the funeral of the Jewish head of Government.</P>
      <P>Rabin was a man who fought the military fight until there was a chance of peace and had the courage to grasp it and the vision to recognise it and work for it.  I hope his death will have a unifying effect on the people of Israel.  He was a rare person, a war hero cum peacemaker and an example to all of us. At a time when the peace process on this island is at a sensitive stage, I hope we will learn lessons, that we will not exacerbate a difficult situation and that we will work genuinely for the cause of peace.  That is what we owe visionaries and courageous people like the late Prime Minister Rabin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Proinsias De Rossa):</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with my colleagues in the House in expressing my sense of shock and outrage at the murder of the Prime Minister of Israel, Yitzhak Rabin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Once again we have seen a political leader fall victim to an assassin's bullet and a family robbed of a loved one by terrorist violence.  Yitzhak Rabin was no plaster saint.  For a long time he was a military leader with a formidable reputation. As a political leader he sanctioned activities which sometimes shocked the world, but did so when he <Col N="1959" /> believed they were necessary to defend the State of Israel.</P>
    <P>In recent years he became convinced of and firmly committed to a peaceful resolution of the problems of the region. He died a martyr for the peace process he had done so much to create.  It is sadly ironic that he should have been gunned down by one of his citizens at the end of a rally where many thousands of Israelis had demonstrated their support for that peace process.</P>
    <P>We know from our experience here that terrorist violence cannot provide a resolution to political problems.  It leaves only a trail of death and suffering and a legacy of hatred.  I hope that the people of the region, Palestinians, Israelis and others, will unite in support of the peace process and will reject all kinds of extermism from whatever side it may come.  We can draw hope from the scenes at the funeral of Yitzhak Rabin in Jerusalem yesterday where Arab head-dresses were seen side by side with Jewish skull caps as people from many countries united in genuine grief at the loss of a man who had shown such enormous personal courage and political vision in pursuit of peace.  The most appropriate memorial to Yitzhak Rabin will be to continue to build on the work he has done to create a lasting peace based on political arrangements which are fair to all concerned.</P>
    <P>On behalf of Democratic Left I wish to convey my deep sympathy to the Rabin family and the Israeli people on their tragic loss.</P>

      <P>On behalf of my party and my colleagues in the Technical Group, I wish to extend sympathy to the family of the late Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, the people of Israel and the wider family throughout the world and I acknowledge the presence of the Israeli Ambassador.  The tragic fact that Prime Minister Rabin was killed by an Israeli extremist clearly indicates that he died not only for his country but for peace, something which is sought in many parts of the world.  Hopefully, he <Col N="1960" /> did not die in vain and his death will prove a inspiration to peacemakers everywhere to have courage to reach beyond the confines of their ghettos and to seek to change minds and not to use violence.  That is his legacy and we hope we will not be found wanting when it comes to seeking the peace he sought. Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam.</P>

      <P>I thank the Tánaiste for allowing me to lead in the tributes to the late Deputy Brian Lenihan.</P>
      <P>All of us in this House deeply mourn the passing of Deputy Brian Lenihan, one of the outstanding public figures of the last four decades.  Many deserved tributes have been paid to him from all sides of the House during the past week. I am sure the House will forgive me for paying a slightly extended tribute to him which he deserves.</P>
      <P>Deputy Lenihan was a respected voice in the Government Council Chamber, in the House and the party rooms.  His legal training and his wide reading were great assets.  He became at length an elder statesman, the last member of the House apart from Deputy Blaney to have served in the great reforming administration of Seán Lemass.  Brian Lenihan went on to serve under Jack Lynch and Charles Haughey, in no less than seven Departments. He had a career of great public achievement.  Modern Ireland owes him a great deal.  He was both a liberal and a democratic republican in the best sense of those words.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of his achievements was the reform, at one sitting, of the literary censorship laws which had resulted in the banning of great works of 20th century literature, both Irish and foreign. Works by writers like Seán O Faoláin and Kate O'Brien had been banned.  He changed the law, which was damaging to <Col N="1961" /> the country's reputation and which limited its vision, in a way that caused relatively little controversy at the time and which did not need to be revisited several times afterwards as has been the fate of some other liberalising legislation. He also finalised the enactment of the Succession Act, a milestone with regard to women's inheritance rights and equality.</P>
    <P>As Donogh O'Malley's successor in education, he carried through the scheme for free secondary education, perhaps the single most important modernising measure of the 1960s, with hugely beneficial social repercussions. The free transport scheme went with it. He also oversaw the planning of the two NIHEs, which were transformed in his sister's time as Minister for Education into the University of Limerick and Dublin City University, and the inception of the regional technical colleges, two measures which represented a departure from the more traditional academic education provided by universities.</P>
    <P>Brian Lenihan was well known and respected internationally.  He put visitors instantly at ease and he was always extremely knowledgeable and conversant on international affairs.  He was very well known and popular in American political circles.  He met several Presidents, knew many of the important officials on Capitol Hill and was a close friend of Senator Ted Kennedy and others of the four horsemen.  He was three times Minister for Foreign Affairs, briefly in 1973, from 1979-81 and from 1987 to 1989.  During his period in the Seanad he was also a member of the European Parliament and was one of the architects of the enduring political alliance between Fianna Fáil and the Gaullists.  He had been deeply interested in European affairs from the beginning of his political career.  He also served in the Council of Europe.</P>
    <P>In 1977 it fell to him to complete negotiations on the Common Fisheries Policy.  While it may be said that in the entry negotiations prior to 1973, with <Col N="1962" /> Britain and Ireland missing some opportunities and not giving fisheries the prominence it deserved, nevertheless the EU fisheries regime has enabled the Irish fishing industry to grow, to modernise and to prosper.</P>
    <P>Brian Lenihan between 1979 and 1981 was a Foreign Minister in the best traditions of Ireland's independent foreign policy as established by Eamon de Valera and Frank Aiken.  He expressed a clear Government view on apartheid and sport.  Above all in the Bahrain Declaration of 10 February 1980 he gave a lead to the European Community, even ahead of France.  In it he recognised the role of the PLO in representing the Palestinian people, recognised their right to self-determination, and to the establishment of an independent Palestinian State.  This was a prelude to the Venice Declaration of the EU Heads of Government in June 1980. Despite considerable political criticism at home over what was at that time politically very unorthodox, we have today a Palestinian State, as part of a Middle East peace settlement which Prime Minister Rabin has died trying to defend.</P>
    <P>Brian Lenihan also participated with the then Taoiseach Charles Haughey in creating the Anglo-Irish Inter-governmental Conference.  He was a warm admirer of Lord Carrington, in whom much faith was placed as a source of political progress on Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>In 1982, Brian Lenihan became Minister for Agriculture.  He soon confounded the mockers, by bringing home an exceptionally good farm price deal. Whether negotiating with the Soviets or our EU partners, Brian Lenihan had the ability to stay wide awake later than most, and others tended to succumb before he did.</P>
    <P>In Opposition during the 1980s, Brian Lenihan was a valued member of the New Ireland Forum, where the breadth of his knowledge could be used to good effect.  He had an ability to bridge the two traditions, and he had a breadth of understanding and tolerance for both. Individuals and deputations from a <Col N="1963" /> Unionist background who might approach him initially with hostile pre-conceptions soon found themselves disarmed by his genuine charm, sincerity and deep understanding, and his obvious desire for peace and reconciliation. He was always totally for the civilised settlement of differences, and he strongly supported social partnership and consensus.</P>
    <P>While Minister for Foreign Affairs in March 1987, under Charles Haughey's great Fianna Fáil minority administration, he co-chaired the Inter-governmental Conference with the Northern Secretary Tom King, with whom he developed a good and constructive relationship.  One of the most important things achieved during that time was the passage of fundamental reform of fair employment legislation. Progress was also made towards the establishment of the British-Irish Parliamentary Body.</P>
    <P>In 1989, after overcoming serious illness with great fortitude, he became Tánaiste and Minister for Defence, and he sorted out what had been a bitter dispute over pay in the Defence Forces with his customary skill and powers of conciliation.</P>
    <P>He stood for the Presidency, and received the highest number of votes on the first round.  He was magnanimous in defeat and was always ready to praise the President.  He Continued to serve his country in the Dáil to the best of his ability, and became Chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs.</P>
    <P>Behind the scenes, he played a significant role in the peace process, being the source of certain contacts both loyalist and republican from which he conveyed information to the then Taoiseach, Deputy Albert Reynolds.  He was also in close touch with an important German figure in close contact with the German Government, who organised the Duisburg Talks and later helped broker an unpublicised permanent IRA ceasefire on the continent, over a year before the general IRA ceasefire.  Earlier this year, <Col N="1964" /> as an active member of the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation Brian Lenihan was the first to promote publicly in dialogue with Protestant pastors the restoration of 50 per cent remission to prisoners as a first step, a measure that has since been adopted by the British Government.</P>
    <P>Brian Lenihan came from a great political family.  His father, who served for a long time in local politics, entered the Dáil after him.  He was also joined in 1982 by his sister, our much valued Deputy leader Mary O'Rourke.  Indeed, it was the first time a brother and sister served in Cabinet together.</P>
    <P>Brian Lenihan, as everyone knows, was excellent company.  He could be witty and irreverent.  He could be passionate in his political speeches, and indeed when occasion demanded he was able to develop confusion to a very fine art.  However, as those who worked with him will know, he put his critical faculties to the service of his country, and his opinions and judgments were very much in demand and respected in this House. His influence always weighed on the side of tolerance and civilised standards. He had little time for reactionary or fundamentalist attitudes.  He was part of the new Ireland, not the old.  Modern Ireland, whether it fully realises it or not, owes him a considerable debt.</P>
    <P>I extend to his wife Ann, his childern Brian, Conor, Niall, Paul and Anita, his sister Mary and to Paddy and Ann our deepest condolences.  His presence and contribution to public life will be both greatly missed and long remembered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring):</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to add my words to those of the Leader of the Opposition, Deputy Ahern.  All of us in the House knew and, indeed, loved Brian Lenihan.  Long before I became a Member he was a towering figure who served in many of the great offices of State and adorned them all with wit, work and style.  He was one of that <Col N="1965" /> unique generation of Irish politicians who came into politics at a time of profound economic and social change and for more than 30 years he was a leading contributor to the development of modern Ireland.</P>
      <P>Brian's unique political philosophy, based on a set of rooted values combined with a pragmatic style was offset by a personality that was at once forthcoming and reticent.  One of the things that has been widely referred to in the last number of days in the many tributes paid to him was his deep and wide learning.  Yet he seemed, often, to take pleasure in concealing that erudition behind a hearty exterior.  I had many clashes with him during his political career, but not one of them was ever rancorous or bitter &mdash; he simply was not that kind of man.  Fiercely loyal to his party, he could, nevertheless, be disarmingly honest about mistakes.  A man with the ability to rise to the very top, he was content to play a supporting role in every situation, no matter how harshly some of those situations may have affected him.</P>
      <P>I know from my own experience that he took a deep and abiding interest in the prospects for peace in Ireland and was prepared to take personal risks to facilitate these prospects.  His last few years probably provided all of us with an enduring precedent of one man's courage and spirit. Even today I find it hard to believe that Brian's indomitable spirit has given up the fight.  I will remember as every Member will that he applied his &ldquo;no problem&rdquo; philosophy not just to politics but to the pain of serious illness.  His loss has left a gap on the benches of Dáil Eireann that will be very hard to fill.  On my own behalf and on behalf of the Government and the Labour Party I extend our deep sympathy to Ann Lenihan, their childern, and to our colleague Deputy Mary O'Rourke who will be feeling a special depth of sadness &mdash; and pride also &mdash; on this occasion.

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): Shortly after 3 p.m. last Wednesday Members heard with great <Col N="1966" /> regret of the death of one of our most popular colleagues.  Brian Lenihan. Even though we knew he had been ill for some time there was still a palpable sense of loss on his passing.  All our thoughts and prayers go to his wife. Ann, his sons Conor, Niall, Brian and Paul and his daughter, Anita, his sister Deputy Mary O'Rourker&mdash; who served with him as a Member of this House and in Government &mdash; and to his other sister Ann and his brother, Paddy.</P>
      <P>Brian Lenihan was well versed in public affairs both at national and international level.  He was also a man of great courtesy.  His qualities of integrity, sincerity and good humour earned him the affection and respect not only of Members of the House but of people throughout Ireland and those who came in contact with him on the international scene.</P>
      <P>Brian was dedicated to his party, his constituents and his country.  He was unique in that he did not have enemies, political or otherwise.  He was a classic example of somebody who could walk with kings while retaining the common touch.  Everyone Brian met subsequently regarded himself or herself as a friend of his.  He displayed great courage during his political life and was not afraid to speak out or to take risks.  This courage was even more obvious in his battle with serious illness.</P>
      <P>We all recall him so successfully contesting the 1989 General Election from his hospital bed in the Mayo Clinic in the United States.  The reception by his colleagues on all sides on his return to this House was testimony to the very high regard in which Brian was held. When his party called on him a year later to be its candidate in the Presidential election, Brian, in his customary and unselfish fashion, placed himself before the electorate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Brian Lenihan held many ministerial portfolios over 30 years &mdash; Justice, Education, Transport and Power, Foreign Affairs, Fisheries and Forestry, Agriculture, Defence and as Tánaiste he brought his undoubted talents to the <Col N="1967" /> service of the country.  He was also Parliamentary Secretary on two occasions. In addition he was Leader of the Fianna Fáil Party in the Seanad, chairman of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and joint chairman of the Anglo Irish Intergovernmental Conference.  As an MEP he served as Fianna Fáil Leader in Strasbourg.  He was a member of the New Ireland Forum and the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation and he served also in local government both as a member of the Roscommon and Dublin County Councils.  That is quite a catalogue of achievements and record of service.  Between national and local politics he served his people for almost 40 years in public life.  He had many interests outside politics, notably, football. He was a skilled player in his day and retained his interest in the game throughout his life.  He was also an avid reader and many young people came to know him in later life as a book reviewer where he always indulged in incisive and honest comments.</P>
    <P>Brian Lenihan had an abiding interest in North-South reconciliation and he played a large part in influencing the current peace process.  His stature among Nationalists and Unionists was immense as was shown by the affection of those he met from both sides.  As Minister for Foreign Affairs he had a special interest in the peace process in the Middle East.  On behalf of the Taoiseach, the Fine Gael Party and on my own behalf I ask you, a Cheann Comhairle, to offer our deepest condolences to Brian's wife, Ann, his family, his colleagues in the Fianna Fáil Party, particularly his sister, Mary O'Rourke, and his legion of friends.  He will be sadly missed in this House.  Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam dhílis.</P>

Although we were aware of Brian Lenihan's serious illness, we were all genuinely shocked when we heard of his death.  It was hard to imagine that he would not be with us any longer.</P>
      <P>Brian Lenihan was in many ways a paradox.  He was deeply intelligent, very well read and steeped in learning and knowledge.  He was an outstanding orator, if often a bombastic one.  We all have our own &ldquo;Lenihanisms&rdquo;.  On Sunday I heard Olivia O'Leary refer to Brian's reference to the fact that you had to be negative to be positive.  I remember a debate on foreign policy during which Brian argued that we were neutral.  It was put to him by the inter-viewer that Ireland was not really neutral but pro-western.  He said: &ldquo;Yes, of course, ideologically we are western but militarily we are neutral&rdquo;.  Only somebody like Brian Lenihan could have the skill to come up with an answer like that.</P>
      <P>Brian was a man of enormous experience and achievement.  That achievement took him through seven different ministries over 17 years &mdash; he was 38 years in this House &mdash; but despite that achievement he was never pompous or overbearing.  He never had the puffed up <i>gravitas</i> that often comes with assuming high office.  He was an ordinary, decent man.</P>
      <P>Following the presidential election I was not looking forward to our first meeting but the sense of decency in the man made that encounter very easy for me, and indeed very pleasant.  Brian Lenihan did not have a bad bone in his body.  I never heard him speak ill of anybody. He had a great zest for life.  Erich Fromm, the famous German psychoanalyst, once said, &ldquo;To die is poignantly difficult but to live without dying is unbearable&rdquo;.  Brian Lenihan certainly lived.  He had a zest for life.  He had a camaraderie that was unusual, he had a great sense of fun and good humour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Brian was a true Fianna Fáil person but, despite that fact, he gained his <Col N="1969" /> sporting fame by playing the reviled foreign game which no true Gael was supposed to do; they were supposed to shun it.  That does not surprise me because I always found Brian Lenihan to be progressive and forward looking.  He was part of the Lemass generation that sought to turn Ireland around from an insular, inward looking country to one which was progressive, outward looking and able to take it place among the other nations of the world.</P>
    <P>On social issues I always found Brian Lenihan to be extremely realistic and progressive.  On some of the sensitive social issues we have had to discuss in recent years I found him to be a man who had deeply thought out his position and was not afraid to give leadership on those issues.  He had the qualities to be leader of his party but he always settled for being the supporting act and, on many occasions, had to compromise his own abilities for so doing.</P>
    <P>Brian was a proud practitioner of our profession.  He was a great honour to the profession which he loved dearly. We will all miss him.  Ireland will be the poorer for his passing and Fianna Fáil, in particular, have lost a loyal and dedicated member.  The words that are apt are those from Shakespeare's <i>As You like</i> It because they describe the Brian Lenihan I knew.  Shakespeare said: &ldquo;Thou art not for the fashion of these times where none will sweat but for promotion&rdquo;. Brian Lenihan certainly sweated, but not for promotion.  He sweated in the cause of his party, his country and others.</P>

      <P>I want to join other party colleagues in this House in paying the warmest possible tribute to the memory of Brian Lenihan, one of the best loved and most respected figures, not only in this House but in Irish politics.  I said last week, and I want to repeat it now, that Brian Lenihan was a rare figure in Irish politics, a man who was as highly regarded by his opponents as by his own party colleagues.  His death will be deeply felt, not only by his party colleagues and indeed by his family, but by all of us in this House and anyone who <Col N="1970" /> has ever had occasion to do business with him.</P>
      <P>The courage and determination with which Brian fought his illness, and the manner in which he fought back time and again against all the odds, was characteristic of his whole approach to life.  He was a man who truly loved life and was determined, despite his illness, to live to the maximum degree possible. He was a man who, more than most, experienced the ups and downs of politics and it must be said that the enjoyed the good times and endured the bad in the same irrepressible way.  He had some bruising political experiences which, in a lesser person, might have led to disillusionment or even bitterness but Brian Lenihan was a man without rancour and spite.</P>
      <P>In almost 35 years in the Oireachtas he made an enduring contribution to Irish public life.  He was a shrewd political tactican with a razor sharp mind and he will be particularly remembered as a reforming Minister for Justice, as the leader of the Opposition, Deputy Ahern, has already indicated.  He was a progressive Minister for Education and an outward looking and innovative Minister for Foreign Affairs.  He will be remembered for the passion he felt for politics, and particularly for Fianna Fáil. He will be remembered also for his fiery contributions to debates inside and outside the Dáil and for his many unforgettable sayings.</P>
      <P>The leader of the Opposition, Deputy Ahern, is correct when he says that Brian Lenihan was of the modern Ireland not of the old Ireland.  It will be some time before we fully appreciate the contribution he made to politics and to Irish life.  To his wife, Ann, his family and colleagues in Fianna Fáil I extend my deepest condolences on behalf of Democratic Left.</P>

    <P>I join other speakers in offering my personal condolences to the wife and family of Brian Lenihan and indeed to the extended family.  With the passing of <Col N="1971" /> Brian last week, after more than 40 years of service to the nation, this House lost a skilful and spirited contributor. Brian was a man with a keen, analytical, political brain who spent his whole life working for the advancement of everybody.  His was a distinguished contribution to overall national social and economic development.  He distinguished himself in many ministries and various committees, at home and abroad, and was able to bring his experience to bear in every Cabinet in which he served, and I had the privilege of serving with him in some of those.</P>
    <P>To his party Brian gave it all.  He sacrificed himself on every occasion he was asked to come to the rescue of the party, to steer it through difficult times or indeed to promote the cause at times of extreme difficulty which only Brian, bringing all his talent to bear on a particular debate, could do.  He was one of the most pragmatic, practical practitioners of politics which he always defined as the art of the possible.  As a person his qualities were distinctive.  He was kind and generous and he always had the knack of being able to make people feel special.</P>
    <P>Brian spent his whole life in service to his party and his country but, above all, to his colleagues.  He gave his utmost loyalty to every Taoiseach and Leader of Fianna Fáil with which he served, including myself.  However, the issue nearest and dearest to his heart was Northern Ireland and the desire to find a solution to the problems there.  I had the pleasure of working with him and many others both behind the scenes and in public in this respect.  He gave us the benefit of his experience and of the many discussions he had not only with Nationalist leaders in Northern Ireland but also with Unionist leaders&mdash;he enjoyed the confidence of both sides.</P>
    <P>Many people have memories of Brian and I am no exception.  Many of those memories were exchanged last Thursday and Friday.  Brian enjoyed the big <Col N="1972" /> crowd, and he loved to raise their spirits. His funeral was attended by his colleagues from all political parties.  As someone said, he did not have a bad bone in his body.  I have always said that if Brian Lenihan could not do one a good turn he certainly would not do one a bad turn.</P>
    <P>Brian's death brought to an end a phenomenon in politics, a man with unique qualities who made such a tremendous contribution to national advancement and who spoke with passion and conviction about the onward march of the Irish nation.  Like me Brian started his political career in Longford-Westmeath where he tried to gain a seat.  He was a sweeper then and he was always prepared to be one throughout his political life.  He later moved to Roscommon from where he managed to raise himself to the very top in national politics.  He was so well known on the international stage that those of us who had the opportunity to go abroad picked up traces of his legacy in the United States, the Far East and elsewhere.  He was always magnanimous in victory and never rancorous in defeat.  He never looked back at what might have been and always looked forward, recognising that he might have some influence on what would happen tomorrow but could have no influence on what had gone by.</P>
    <P>I offer my condolences to his wife Ann, his sons Brian, Conor, Paul and Niall, his daughter Anita, his sisters Mary and Ann and brother Paddy.  He left a legacy of which all of us and his family can be justly proud.  His life was a journey for justice and a search for peace.</P>
    <P>I was glad to receive a message from him on one occasion when he was in hospital in which he expressed his desire to serve on the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation, to which he devoted much of his time and energy during his latter days.  His tremendous capacity to overcome adversity and his fight against the odds over the past five-six years is an inspiration to all of us in terms of what can be achieved in political life when one has political courage and is inspired by a &ldquo;never say die&rdquo; attitude. We have lost a good friend, a man who <Col N="1973" /> was loyal to all of us and, in particular, to the Fianna Fáil Party.  As we said last Friday, &ldquo;Farewell Brian, you did a great job and the good will live after you&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>Over the weekend his family and friends talked about past events and times.  While this led to much sadness it also created much warmth.  We also read the articles in the newspapers and listened to the reports on the television. I thank RTE and the media commentators for their generosity in terms of their expressions and their sensitive treatment of the matter since the beginning of his illness.  I could not help but think that Brian would have had a wry chuckle or raised an eyebrow at some of the comments which were made.  Given his generous and warm spirit, he would have looked on these with a gentle irony and nothing else.</P>
      <P>On behalf of Ann, Brian, Conor, Paul, Niall and Anita, the members of my family and the extended family I wish to extend my thanks to all those who have spoken here today and those who have written to me and other members of the family.  Everyone meant what they said and did and this has made a great difference to how I have been able to deal with his passing.</P>

      <P>I wish to express my regret at the sudden death last Saturday week of a former colleague of Members on this side of the House, Tom Bellew, who came from a long established Louth Fianna Fáil family and was active in local politics up to the time of his death.  He was very active in the county council and Dundalk Urban District Council of which he was proud to have been chairman for five years.  He also served on the North Eastern Health Board.</P>
      <P>For a long time he was a very committed member of Fianna Fáil and was a Member of this House during the early 1980s.  When he subsequently left our party he continued to actively serve the people of his area as an Independent in local politics.  He was deeply committed to serving the people of Louth and was very active in this regard during his time as a Member of the House.  I am glad he served as a TD for the Louth constituency and I derive much satisfaction from the fact that he continued to work hard for the people of his constituency. I have spoken to members of his family and they appreciate the fact that he still had the support of his colleagues.</P>
      <P>Tom was a tough political character when he was in the House.  When I was party whip he let me know whether he wanted to pair with another Member. Some Members took it easy but Tom was prepared to argue his point.  He continued to serve up to the time of his sudden death.  On behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party, I extend our deepest sympathy to his wife, Helen, his sons and daughters and his wider family.</P>

He served the people of Louth as a member of the Fianna Fáil Party and, laterally, as an Independent.  I understand that he was decended from <Col N="1975" /> a republican family and that his father had been interned in Ballykinlar.</P>
      <P>In the short time he was a Member of this House Tom Bellew established a number of friendships that lasted until his untimely death last week.  I did not know him well, but I was struck by the tribute paid to him in one of the newspapers last Sunday by Deputy Charlie McCreevy who described him as one of the truest political friends he ever had and as a man who believed in telling the truth and to hell with the consequences. I also remember him as a direct and forthright man.</P>
      <P>As a full-time politician, he and his family suffered hardship when he left this House.  They will be grieving today at the loss of a husband and father.  On behalf of the Government and the Labour Party, I extend our deepest sympathy to his wife, Helen, and all his children.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): On behalf of the Fine Gael Party, I express our sympathy to the wife and children of the late Tom Bellew who was a Fianna Fáil Member for Louth for just nine months, from February to November 1982.  Although he spent a short period in national politics he gave long and extensive service in local politics.  He was a member of Dundalk UDC for 21 years, five as chairman.  He was elected to Louth County Council in 1979 and also served as a member of County Louth vocational education committee, the North Eastern Health Board, Dundalk Harbour Commissioners and County Louth Enterprise Board.  In addition, he was an active member of the joint Dundalk Urban District Council and Mourne District Council committee which reflected his commitment to cross-Border co-operation.</P>
      <P>County Louth and Dundalk in particular have lost an able representative at such an early age.  On behalf of the Taoiseach and the Fine Gael Party, I offer our deepest condolences to his widow, Helen, his children, Michael, Thomas, Francis, Gerard and Helena and his extended family.</P>

Although we had a common interest on that occasion I found him to be in many instances deeply conservative.  On the last occasion we met we discussed the abortion information legislation.</P>
      <P>He was also a Nationalist and a true public representative.  He was forthright, confrontational and controversial. He paid a heavy price for the short time he spent in politics, but he was never compromising and wanted to take a stand.  He certainly made an impact in the nine months he spent in Leinster House.  On behalf of the Progressive Democrats, I extend our deepest sympathy to his wife, Helen, and his family on his sudden and sad death.</P>

    <P>I also wish to extend our sympathy to the wife and family and all who knew and loved a man that I did know, the late Brian Lenihan.  It was a privilege to have served alongside a man who had <Col N="1977" /> become such a legend in his long political career.  It would be a daunting task to consider it in all its complexity, but the photograph of John F. Kennedy in the corridor of Leinster House gives me reason to remember Brian Lenihan's many achievements for visitors to the House.</P>
    <P>He was a tireless worker on behalf of his constituents in Dublin West which borders my own constituency of Dublin North.  With others, Brian and I were trustees of the Mulhuddart anti-dump campaign.  This showed his concern for the interests of those on the margins of society who are all too often forgotten in the greater scheme of things. Members of the Garda Síochána have indicated that they were treated with consideration when he was Minister.</P>
    <P>His death closes a chapter in all our lives.  During his funeral Mass, when grappling with the logistics of serving communion to the vast throng, the initial reaction of one of the officiating clergymen was to remark &ldquo;no problem&rdquo;, but he then had to admit that was not the case.  That was the legacy of Brian Lenihan, a man who was prepared to deal with any difficulty, no matter how big, with dignity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mr. Rabbitte):</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to have the opportunity to address this House on the subject of science, technology and innovation, with particular reference to the report of the Science, Technology and Innovation Advisory Council, known as the Tierney report.  A positive, adoptive attitude to science, technology and innovation is to my mind the single most important force for shaping long-term competitive success in indigenous industry.  Science and technology is now a substantial area of public expenditure, thanks, to a significant degree, to financial transfers from the European Union as part of the present and previous Community Support Frameworks, and it is also becoming one of the most important influences on social and cultural development.  Yet most of our indigenous companies are only dimly aware of the true importance of science and technology.  This House, furthermore, too seldom addresses these topics &mdash; this is one of the rare occasions on which the House has entered into a full- scale debate on the issues of science, technology and innovation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This House and our indigenous firms are not alone in underestimating the importance of STI.  The absence of a public debate on the issues involved and their significance in shaping our society is partly attributable to lack of media interest.  The coverage of science generally by the Irish media is poor by international standards and certainly by the standards, for example, of the &ldquo;quality&rdquo;<Col N="1980" /> British Media.  No Irish newspaper has a science correspondent.  RTE seems to have missed the significance of the publication of the STIAC report &mdash; the first major review of our STI capability conducted from our own resources.</P>
    <P>On almost a weekly basis I have sought, as Minister, to intrude into public debate major issues relating to STI policy, the implications of the information society and the structure and direction of industrial development.  I cannot comment on the extent of the endeavours of my predecessors but they too failed to engage the interest of the media.  However, politicians need not feel too badly about this.  Significant public events varying as widely as the annual North-South innovation lecture, delivered this year by Dr. Frank Car rubba, executive vice-president of Phil ips; to a packed RDS Concert Hall lecture by the British biologist, Dr. Stephen Dawkins; to an internationally prestigious conference in Limerick last week on science and technology parks, attracted virtually no media comment or analysis.  Whether it is in the area of the biological or medical sciences, information technology, science, industry and the environment &mdash; in all of these areas, signs are that the public is interested and knowledgeable.  We should in this House, in industry and the media take note of that.</P>
    <P>If we examine, for example, the Community Support Framework 1994-1999, which outlines the development plan for the economy, as underwritten by EU Structural Funds, over that period we can clearly see that science and technology, or research and technological development, to give it its full European title, can be found across a range of the individual operational programmes. RTD-related activities can be found, as one might expect, in the operational programme for industrial development but are also contained in the operation programmes for agriculture, rural development and forestry, fisheries, environmental services, economic infrastructure and human resources.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1981" /> In financial terms I estimate that at least £625 million will be spent on these activities in the period up to 1999.  This expenditure will be funded on a tripar tite basis by the Exchequer, the EU Commission and the private sector.  By far the largest spend, £406 million will take place in the research and development part of the industry operational programme so it may be worth looking at this in a little more detail.  This programme follows on logically from the original science and technology programme, 1989 to 1993.  This was initially oriented towards the development of an R and D infrastructure, from which firms would be capable of sourcing their technological needs.  This approach prompted increased R and D spend by industry and a consequential demand for R and D assistance at the level of the individual firm.</P>
    <P>This resulted in the launch, towards the end of that programme, of a new measure aimed at providing finance for in-company R and D.  With this addition, the programme as a whole evolved to represent a balanced portfolio of actions capable of responding to broad industry &mdash; economic demand and with the ability to develop the culture of technological innovation upon which much of Ireland's future competitive advantage would depend.</P>
    <P>The 1989 to 1993 science and technology sub-programmes provided the country with the opportunity to invest in and upgrade its R and D capability, and to introduce a new and innovative element into industrial policy.  The influence of the programme has been to ensure this opportunity was grasped and the competitive position of Irish industry was enhanced.</P>
    <P>Although industrial R and D expenditure in Ireland has risen rapidly in recent years, in the international context it is still comparatively low.  Ireland's business expenditure on research and development as a share of national output, known as the BERD-GDP ratio, is well below the EU average and considerably less than countries such as Germany.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1982" /> Many companies are still not fully aware of the pressing need to upgrade existing products and develop new products and processes on an ongoing basis to stay ahead in an increasingly competitive and sophisticated marketplace. This Government, therefore, believes that a sustained effort is needed to make the innovative capability of Irish firms and researchers commensurate with the scale of the competitive pressures facing Ireland in the coming decades.  The new Programme for Research and Development, 1994-1999 is intended to provide the impetus to make this happen.</P>
    <P>The central objective will be to increase the quantity and quality of R &amp; D activity in Ireland.  One of the specific targets set for the programme is to increase Business Expenditure on R &amp; D (BERD) and STIAC has recommended a doubling of BERD by 1999. Other key impact indicators that will be monitored over the life of the programme include the number of researchers employed in industry, the number of R &amp; D performing companies, the number with formal R &amp; D departments and R &amp; D intensity, as measured by the number of researchers per company.</P>
    <P>The proactive, developmental approach of the 1989-93 programme meant that the original structure laid down would inevitably need to be revised in the light of experience.</P>
    <P>Within the new programme, therefore, every activity has been examined and refocused into a new set of measures that are consistent and better align with the overall mission statement, which is: to support the enhancement of competitive advantage in Irish firms through ensuring the appropriate use of technology.  It aims to achieve these goals through a portfolio of infrastructural, financial and skills supports attuned to the expressed and anticipated needs of Irish industry.</P>
    <P>There are four measures, classified as follows: measure 1, Industry R &amp; D Initiative; measure 2, Industry/Third Level Co-operation Services; measure 3, <Col N="1983" /> Human Resources Development; and measure 4, Research Support.</P>
    <P>The industry R &amp; D measure addresses an identified need for demand-led R &amp; D in industry.  The measure beings together under a single heading all financial supports for company-led R &amp; D.  By centralising R &amp; D supports in a single measure, administered by the industrial promotion agencies, it will be possible to provide a unified approach capable of supporting the needs of Irish industry flexibly and efficiently.  The measure is open to all companies regardless of size and ownership who are capable of meeting specified criteria in relation to finance and project quality.</P>
    <P>Measure 2 &mdash; industry/third level co-operation services &mdash; comprises a number of different sub-measures or actions designed to increase the capability of industry, to improve the technological supports provided to industry and to increase third level/industry co-operation. It includes activities such as technology transfer.  Forbairt technology services to industry, support for technology service centres in the regional technical colleges and the programmes in advanced technology, of which some Members will already be aware.</P>
    <P>Measure 3 &mdash; human resource development &mdash; is designed to improve the ability of industry to manage the process of research and technological development, to enhance the interaction between higher education institutions and enterprises and to support high level researchers engaged in projects that are of direct benefit to industry. The enhancement of the capacity of the higher education sector to promote innovation and to support industry is an important policy objective.</P>
    <P>The preceding measures are mainly demand-led and aimed at Irish industry whose competitiveness will improve through the use of technology.  It is important, however, that this necessary process of targeting should not weaken the genuine spirit of innovation and the <Col N="1984" /> more outward looking perspective that has been adopted by progressive researchers within the higher education sector in recent years.  In order, therefore, to continue to tap this vein of enterprise, measure 4 represents a single research support fund that can be flexibly deployed in support of high quality college-based research projects. Members may be aware that I announced, during the summer, a new board to administer this measure as well as extra funding for it in 1995.</P>
    <P>The reason we are having this debate is that the establishment of STIAC, the publication of its report and the expectations surrounding the Government's response have injected new life into an age old debate about the importance of science and technology in our national development.</P>
    <P>It is not a question of &ldquo;should we do&rdquo; science and technology but of &ldquo;how&rdquo; we do it.  I would like to put a summary of the report's key issues on the record so that Deputies can focus their contributions.</P>
    <P>The Tierney report, called after the Chairman of the Council Mr. Dan Tierney, whose enormous contribution I paid tribute to on previous occasions was published last March.  It began by demonstrating the importance of science and technology for international competitiveness and then examined Ireland's position from that perspective.</P>
    <P>The council concluded generally that innovation, based on the application of science and technology, is now the mainspring of international economic competitiveness.</P>
    <P>The most innovative countries are also the world's economic leaders, with strong expert performance, based on high value-added products and services. In countries where STI policy has encouraged development through innovation, investment in R &amp; D has been maintained at a high level.</P>
    <P>For example, business expenditure on R &amp; D in Ireland is just over 1 per cent of GDP: the average in Europe is 2 per cent, it is over 2½ per cent in the US and around 3 per cent in Japan.  If that were <Col N="1985" /> to persist over the long-term, the consequences for our small firms, for our traditional and natural resource-based sectors where R &amp; D has not been a priority and the prospects for our continued export growth would be very discouraging.</P>
    <P>In more specific terms, the report points out that between 1970 and 1989, manufacturing employment in Japan increased by 4 per cent and in the US by 1.5 per cent while within the EU it decreased by 20 per cent.</P>
    <P>This clearly indicated that those who successfully apply technology keep the benefits in jobs.  Since 1970, employment in knowledge-based industry increased by over 20 per cent in OECD, contrary to the general trend in employment, indicating the job creation propensity in this sector.</P>
    <P>The basic message, therefore, is quite clear &mdash; investment in scientific research and technological development, and its successful application into innovative high quality products and services, is vital to sustained economic growth and increased high quality employment. Furthermore, there are no old industries &mdash; only old technologies.</P>
    <P>In looking at our international position the council divided countries into &ldquo;Leaders&rdquo;, those who spend more than 2 per cent of their GDP on R &amp; D, &ldquo;Followers&rdquo;, over 1.5 per cent, &ldquo;Users&rdquo;, 1 per cent and &ldquo;Laggards&rdquo; under 1 per cent.  Ireland just about avoids the &ldquo;Laggards&rdquo; categorisation and only with the assistance of substantial European Structural Fund support.</P>
    <P>From its examination of the international perspective, the council concluded that Ireland is not well positioned at present in respect of the new technological and market dynamics. Many countries are engaged in sustained experimentation with policies and measures to stimulate their national innovation process.  Such experimentation implies a willingness to take risks and presupposes a long-term view.</P>
    <P>The council believes that Ireland has little choice but to engage in the same process.  In particular, according to the <Col N="1986" /> council, there is an undoubted need to increase Ireland's R &amp; D investment, both public and business, if the substantial technology gap that exists in the indigenous sector is to be reduced.</P>
    <P>The report states that the challenges facing all countries, not least Ireland, from the ever-increasing speed of technological development, are that: the national capability in new technologies must be expanded; there must be transfer mechanisms to integrate new technology into less advanced sectors; enterprises must invest to prepare for these changes; and innovation must be an integral part of industrial policy.</P>
    <P>What are the issues facing Ireland if we are to successfully address these challenges?  The report argues that, despite the strong macro-economic performance of the economy, there are still some fundamental weaknesses and, of course, unemployment remains unacceptably high.  At the same time, societal needs and expectations for improvements in education, health care and public services are no less than in other, more wealthy countries.</P>
    <P>In the enterprise sector, overseas companies, which account for three quarters of manufacturing exports, are only weakly linked to the domestic economy.  Indigenous industry is highly fragmented and, in general, of small scale.  In a number of measurements the foreign sector is strikingly superior to its indigenous counterpart.</P>
    <P>It is: more advanced on the path to a globalised market; twice as skilled in terms of technical and administrative personnel; twice as committed to R &amp; D; and twice as productive on average. The unrelenting globalisation of markets, through the EU Single Market, bilateral deals between the superpowers and the new GATT round of trade agreements is an economic fact to which all Irish companies, whether foreignowned or indigenous, must face up.</P>
    <P>The report shows that the globalisation trend is being hastened by developments in information technologies, leading to the information super-highway. Countries with the appropriate <Col N="1987" /> technological infrastructure to participate in such developments will be able to benefit from the globalisation of education, research, commerce, trade, banking and other services.  Ireland needs to be fully supported by the most comprehensive and advanced networking facilities available.</P>
    <P>It is against that background that we must be concerned that some 80 per cent of Irish companies would be regarded as having a &ldquo;nil&rdquo; or &ldquo;minimum&rdquo; technology capability &mdash; that is, perhaps, no specialist technology personnel, perceiving no need for technological capability or requiring support in sourcing technology from external sources.</P>
    <P>This concern for the innovation capability and thus the long-term survival and growth prospects, of Irish firms has been reflected in every major report on industrial development, since the 1960s, including the most recent Culliton report.  The matter has also been treated in specific reports on science and technology policy in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, the latter two carried out by the OECD.</P>
    <P>The report says that some countries and companies have been more successful than others in adapting to and capitalising on the many changes and opportunities arising internationally.</P>
    <P>The key to such success is the acceptance and effectiveness of the national system of innovation.  This is defined as &ldquo;the collection of all institutions and the mechanisms &mdash; public and private&mdash; that interact to stimulate and support innovations in products and systems within the national economy&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The interaction, inter-linkage, policies and incentives that enable these elements to operate coherently are vital. Equally important are the factors that influence the environment for innovation &mdash; education and training, technical culture, public and political awareness, availability of finance and, particularly, international sources of science, research and technological innovation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1988" /> The Council argues that the lack of an integrated national system of innovation and the fluctuations in Government commitment to science and technology over previous decades have been at the heart of the reason there is not a better appreciation of science, technology and innovation and of the culture of technological innovation in Ireland.  The Government must recognise and promote a long-term investment strategy to build up the elements of the system of innovation.</P>
    <P>Looking more closely at the main components of the system of innovation, the Council argues that, within the business sector there is a need to increase industrial involvement in research and development and innovation and to move business expenditure on it towards European average levels.  There remains a negative attitude to entrepreneurship, risk-taking and innovation in many aspects of Irish economic life. There is a low concentration of scientists and engineers in industry.  There is an unsatisfactory level of new company start-ups and an overly strong EU dependency, particularly on the funding side, throughout the national science and technology effort.</P>
    <P>The State's direct role is to provide a balanced programme of applied research and development, strategic R &amp; D in the important generic technologies, such an biotechnology, and to look to the future technology needs of the economy by providing assistance in &ldquo;foresight&rdquo; of emerging critical technologies. The range of public research institutes in Ireland has always been limited by comparison with other countries where such capability is provided by the State.  They must have a critical competence, be it in areas of special national importance and give value for money in terms of contributing to their self-sufficiency, transmitting technology to the workplace etc.</P>
    <P>The Council describes the third level sector as the vital source of people and capability in the generation and transfer of research and innovation skills into society.  Basic research provides the <Col N="1989" /> essential underpinning for applied research and technological development and, according to the Council, we cannot achieve an innovative environment without access to the new knowledge and understanding provided by basic research.  However, we must ensure also that we make maximum use of this knowledge.  The Council goes on to say that the role of such research has not been appreciated in Ireland and that funding has been largely inadequate.</P>
    <P>The Council also points out that there is a need for better interaction between industry and third level colleges to exploit research for the benefit of the country.  Industry must provide a stronger &ldquo;pull&rdquo; effect by making greater use of the expertise in the colleges.  In turn, the third level sector must provide a &ldquo;science push&rdquo; effect and achieve greater application of its knowledge to address industrial and societal needs. The Government must act as broker in creating this greater interaction.  While the Tierney report made many recommendations on individual and specific aspects of our science and technology system, it addressed what I regard as two fundamental pillars which are needed to underpin our long-term strategy in this regard.</P>
    <P>First, it recommended that we organise our national science and technology effort in a way which will allow us to take a comprehensive and long-term view of our needs, priorities and where we should concentrate our money. Second, but no less importantly, it addressed the issue of the understanding and appreciation of science and technology.  In my period so far, as Minister for Commerce, Science and Technology, one fact has impressed itself very strongly on me &mdash; science, technology and innovation, for the public at large with the exception of the truly converted, has a huge capacity to turn people off.</P>
    <P>I believe that the legacy of the Tierney report will be its lasting contribution to the debate on the value of investment in science and technology for a small country such as Ireland.  I <Col N="1990" /> have attended a number of seminars organised by private interest groups and I have participated in debates in both Houses and at the EU Affairs Committee. The debate must continue, the debate must be widened, the debate must be public, the debate must give rise to questions, and it must provide answers.  No interest is immune, whether big or small industry, Heads of Universities or PhD researchers, primary school teachers, newspapers and television, State agencies, civil servants or politicians.  Journalists and the media, of course, have a critical role to play, with the potential for the most direct and immediate influence on the public and, therefore, on our public representatives.</P>
    <P>I do not accept that it is impossible to turn a scientific article into a piece of popular journalism.  I do not believe that we have to write every science article as if it were the most grave and serious matter of earth-shattering importance. It permeates every facet of our daily lives, for example: the application of microwave technology is a fairly recent development; now you can buy a microwave cooker for less than £100; microprocessors, often thought of as the preserve of high tech computer and communication companies, run our domestic washing machines; and laser beams used to be &ldquo;STAR TREK&rdquo; material; now they tell us our weekly supermarket bill.</P>
    <P>On the subject of popularising and &ldquo;demystifying&rdquo; the subject, somebody recently showed me a copy of a magazine distributed free by a number of Dublin pubs, intended to keep the solitary drinker from staring forlornly into his pint.  The magazine contained two pages of science snippets, culled from the international media, on scientific breakthroughs with potential practical application.  They were written in a style which aroused your interest and held your attention.</P>
    <P>Is it too much to ask that Irish scientists, industry, journalists and people in public life should follow that example on local research topics?  It is a feature <Col N="1991" /> of other topics and professions.  The weather forecast is a highly technical subject but, because the man in the street needs to know if it will be wet or dry, the technicalities are expressed in intelligible terms.  Accountancy and medicine are complex professions but the lay person demands to know in simple terms whether his pocket or his health will suffer and the practitioners respond.</P>
    <P>Lest it be thought I am taking an unfair swipe at the scientific community, politicians also stand indicted of forever speaking some kind of parliamentary gobbledegook, and civil servants for long took pride in writing in their own &ldquo;officialese&rdquo; and for ignoring the exhortations in Sir Earnest Gower's <i>Plain Words</i> to write and communicate effectively and simply.  I say this not to cause offence.  The point I wish to make is simple. Scientists do not suffer from a peculiar impediment of communication. Each profession, group, or band of fellow travellers develops its own specialist vocabulary &mdash; jargon to improve precision of ideas exchanges between themselves.</P>
    <P>However, in this age of mass competition for public support we need to be able to broadly convince the general body of people and carry them with us. By and large the groups who can best do this will best succeed in getting what they want.  Most business schools recognise the importance of communication and include modules in &ldquo;executive communications&rdquo;.  Even politicians have been known to take private grinds at the Bunny Carr self-improvement school. There is a role for all of us in promoting the image and status of science and we must tackle this by a variety of means and on a broad front.  Some efforts will of course be more successful than others.  For my part and following the Tierney report, I have asked Forfás to prepare a three year awareness campaign, aimed essentially at policy makers and decision makers in the public and private sectors.  As the Tierney report pointed out, there is an onus on <Col N="1992" /> the many organisations connected with science and technology to play their part in its promotion.  Some already do &mdash; some could do more.</P>
    <P>My office has in the past given modest short-term support to the industry lobby on research and development to help it to get off the ground and in turn to promote the need for more research and development investment in the business sector.  It is vital for researchers at the work bench to have their own independent voice just as the voice of industry must be heard.  To that end I was delighted to be able to announce recently that my office, with Forbairt and Forfás, agreed to sponsor funding for a three year period, to assist the Irish Research Scientists' Association in becoming a full-time association with proper back-up facilities.  A cynic might ask why are we creating a stick with which to beat ourselves.</P>
    <P>However, I stress that, like science and technology generally, promotion and awareness is not a case of throwing large sums of money at the problem.  It is for all involved to ensure a continuous and widening public debate on the issues to bring about a shared appreciation of the role of science and technology as the long-term solution to our economic and social progress.  This idea of a nationally shared appreciation should not be underestimated.</P>
    <P>A significant outcome of the STIAC process was the consensus achieved on the role and contribution of the variety of players and activities in what has become termed the national system of innovation.  Employers and employees, big business and small, high tech and low tech, academic and researcher, public and private came together to form a comprehensive and consensus picture of science and technology and how the pieces fit together.  I do not say this as criticism but simply to reinforce my point that we all have to grasp at every opportunity to strengthen the role of Science and Technology in society and to overcome cultural divisions.  Selling the message is what I want to do today and there are encouraging signs.  The <Col N="1993" /> recently published Forfás survey on business research and development expenditure shows an average growth rate of over 17 per cent per annum between 1989 and 1993.  That is partly because of the expertise and incentives available but it also comes about because of the growing reality in firms that they will only grow and maintain market shares where they are &ldquo;up to speed&rdquo; or leading the field in terms of their technological and innovation abilities.</P>
    <P>The vision put forward by the STIAC report is that we must take the innovation road which will lead to economic prosperity, market leadership, value added exports, high quality jobs and all the economic spin-offs which that implies.  The report of itself, or its vast number of recommendations, may not represent the total solution, but most importantly it defines the direction to that solution.  Nobody pretends that the task will be easy or that we will be showered with instant success.  Most people recognise that to change attitudes towards research &mdash; indeed change and promote the research culture itself &mdash; we must embark on a process of continuous change and advance, rather than think in terms of a &ldquo;big bang&rdquo; approach.</P>
    <P>Where does the Tierney report go from here?  After publication of the report, and with Government support, I appointed a task force to examine the recommendations and to report on their implementability or otherwise.  The Task Force is chaired by Mr. John Travers, Chief Executive of Forfás.  It includes representatives of Departments active in the science and technology field and also includes Dan Tierney and Professor Dervilla Donnelly who were on the original council.  The Tierney report included a large number of recommendations covering a variety of topics some having specific price tags and others dealing with institutional arrangements for ensuring the Government can develop coherent strategies for deploying State funding on science and technology across the range of Government Departments, agencies <Col N="1994" /> and programmes.  Some of these recommendations, which deal with tax breaks for research and development, were included in this year's Finance Act.</P>
    <P>The Travers task force has now, I understand, just completed its examination of the individual recommendations and is in the process of drafting a report on its work.  The task force is overseen and guided by a Cabinet subcommittee which I chaired and which includes my Government colleagues the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry and the Minister for Education.  It is my intention that when the Cabinet Committee has taken its decisions based on the task force report I will bring the matter to Cabinet and I expect to publish the Government response to STIAC early in 1996.  I look forward to the support of all sides of the House in pursuing this work which is of crucial importance to the long-term development of the nation and in that regard I look forward to further debate in this House as we proceed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NedOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. E. O'Keeffe Mr. E. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. O'Keeffe:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is seldom a report such as this is given time for discussion in the Dáil and we welcome this opportunity. I compliment those involved in producing it.  Much has been written about the report in the newspapers and although many of the daily newspapers do not have science and technology correspondents there are developments in that regard.  Science and technology affects our daily lives in many ways.  It is to be found in the kitchen, the office, on transport and on the farm.  The new technology emerging is broad based.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The STIAC report contains a well argued case for the importance of science and technology in a modern economy and why it is necessary for us given our ambition for national economic development to increase the amount of funds we invest in this field.  The report also highlights the neglect of this field to date.  It highlights the neglect of this area and contains useful data on the development of our smaller indigenous <Col N="1995" /> industries.  It makes the valid point that science and technology must be part of our wider industrial policy and not a stand alone activity.  It is very important for the man in the street to understand the relationship between science and technology and the finished product.</P>
    <P>Chapter 7 deals with the perceptions and awareness of science, technology and innovation.  A number of very good points and useful suggestions are made and this is one of the better chapters of the report.  The report is strong on outlining aspirations and makes a number of indisputable statements but there are parts of the report with which I do not agree.  If we lived in a perfect world the recommendations of the STIAC report could be fully implemented at a cost to the Exchequer of £490 million. However, we do not live in a perfect world.  The main problem with the report is the uneven and sometimes bizarre coverage of the various issues involved.  Information and enthusiasm but little wisdom or experience seems to have been brought to bear on the topic. In effect, the report represents a compromise, evidently achieved by the chairman, to include the various interests of the members of the STIAC committee.  This is evident from the uneven coverage, the virtual neglect of various areas of science and technology vital to our economic development and the over-emphasis on unimportant detail, coupled with the complete absence of major structural recommendations and changes that are obviously needed.  For example, little emphasis is placed on information technology and there is a complete over-emphasis on natural resource-based industries.  This, of course, reflects the interest of some members of the committee.  Jobs can certainly be created in natural resource industries but what these industries need is not research and development but more investment.</P>
    <P>In recent years the trend among our large natural resource-based industries has been to invest abroad.  I respect their responsibility to their shareholders <Col N="1996" /> and investors and opportunities to invest in this country are scarce.  That is especially evident in larger food companies which have made significant acquisitions abroad.</P>
    <P>Information technology is one of the largest and fastest growing areas of job creation.  It is ironic that a Deputy from a rural constituency must tell a Minister representing an urban constituency that the potential for job creation does not lie in natural resources but in technology. The Minister's constituents will be travelling to jobs in Intel and Hewlett Packard only down the road from Tallaght via the west link road, which will have to be extended to cope with the traffic.  Jobs will be created in information technology.  That is the trend.</P>
    <P>It surprises me that the Minister approves the recommendation of this report to invest in science and technology for natural resource-based industries when I know from my rural background that relatively few jobs can be created in this area compared with the numbers in information technology.  The Minister is approving more investment in an area where relatively few jobs will be created and investing little or nothing in an area which will create many thousands of jobs.  Job creation in natural resource-based industries is limited. Jobs can be created in the high growth knowledge-based industries.  In spite of the fact that this is acknowledged in the report there is very little emphasis on it. This is a major weakness and illustrates that committee members made recommendations in their areas of vested interest.</P>
    <P>The very low level of innovation in indigenous industries was raised.  Continuous efforts will have to be made to address this problem.  Little or no account is taken of the fact that more and more multinational companies are carrying out research and development and product development on a major scale in Ireland.  Many multinational companies are setting up in this country. To encourage them to remain on a long-term basis we must provide the necessary research and development facilities <Col N="1997" /> which will sustain jobs that can be filled by colleage graduates.</P>
    <P>It is recognised that the high standard of education in our schools, universities and regional technical colleges produces people who are highly skilled in using technology.  We are the envy of many countries in the western world.  We must recognise this important natural resource and help to stem the brain drain we have experienced for many years.</P>
    <P>Eolas, the science and technology agency, is now part of Forbairt, the industrial development agency dealing with indigenous industry.  There is a real danger that Forbairt will focus on science and technology appropriate to indigenous industry.  This would put us at a disadvantage and might cause us to lose opportunities to help multinationals find deeper roots in Ireland by carrying out product development here.</P>
    <P>Worldwide sales of electronic equipment in 1995 amounted to US$800 billion.  This sector has been growing at a 10 per cent compound rate annually and is not only the largest but the fastest growing area.  It is almost totally ignored in this report.  Many of the emerging far eastern nations such as Taiwan, South Korea and Malaysia, nations we used to think of as Third World countries some ten to 15 years ago, are rapidly becoming highly developed in the area of information technology.  How did they achieve this? They did this on the back of investment in information technology industries. The STIAC report tells us to grow more trees and produce more shellfish but the real area of growth is information technology. I cannot emphasise that enough. It is companies such as Analog Devices and Intel that have produced the jobs.</P>
    <P>Another problem I have with this report is the &ldquo;spend, spend, spend&rdquo; approach &mdash; set up a large office to deal with science and technology, have more co-ordination, give it plenty of money and everything will be all right.  That is not the answer to the problem.  Arbitrary increases in various activities are proposed with no justification, for <Col N="1998" /> example, doubling the spending on industrial research and development.  At the same time the report says little on how we could improve the return we get on the large sums of money we spend already on science and technology. There has been no evaluation whatsoever of the money spent in recent years in industry on measure 6.</P>
    <P>All the jobs we mentioned are in multinational companies, but many indigenous companies create jobs in this area and these also have science and technology needs which are neglected in this report.  Examples are Mentec and Cornell in Dublin and the many indigenous software companies springing up.</P>
    <P>Most of Chapter 5 is one long whinge by university people on why they need more money for equipment, research and development, etc.  Realistically, more money needs to be spent on equipment for undergraduate education, but this is a matter for the Department of Education, not the Department of Enterprise and Employment. Basic research and development certainly needs more support.  Again this should more properly fall within the ambit of the Department of Education as it is non-directed research.</P>
    <P>I have little sympathy with calls for more money, equipment etc., for strategic and applied research.  There is currently quite a lot of money, via programmes in advanced technology, EU funds etc., being spent in this area in universities and, even by European standards, groups have emerged with excellent reputations in this area.  A key point that is not alluded to in the report is that not all academics are good at carrying out research.  Some are better than others and, in the current situation with relatively limited funds, a process of natural selection has been in operation. The good groups are able to get funding in the marketplace and grow. Those with little or nothing to contribute to technological development have not been getting funds.  It is very hard to argue with this as the report tries to do. There is no point in sprinkling money <Col N="1999" /> everywhere and hoping that everybody will do a good job.  Not everybody is capable of doing a good job.  We should not forget that the only valid reason for a small country to invest in research and development is to help increase the efficiency of innovation in industry.  This is the only reason the EU invests such money in its framework research and development programmes, and it is the only reason we should invest in science and technology.</P>
    <P>Incidentally, in the context of the overall report, the emphasis on the programmes in advanced technology (PATs) is out of proportion to the money spent on them, approximately £10 million a year.  Ireland is falling fast in the competitive league in the EU.  We have fallen from ninth to 22nd place because of our serious lack of investment. We need only look across the water at our UK neighbours who will this year spend in excess of £6 billion. That is big money, and it is a big economy, but our share is approximately 6 per cent in the whole area of science and technology.  In <i>The Financial Times</i> of 28 March of this year under the headings &ldquo;Technology Foresight programme criticises `hands-off' approach&rdquo; and &ldquo;Ministers to shake up R&amp;D&rdquo;, it is stated that the [British] Government yesterday gave notice to Britain's research and development community that it intends to radically reshape its £6 billion budget.  I accept that Britain has a huge economy of approximately 60 million people, but the spend is enormous compared with our spend of 6 per cent of the total budget which is minimal.</P>
    <P>We can fill the Library of this House with debate after debate and report after report, but we have to address the problem of investing in information and technology which this report has more or less ignored.  We will not even be touching the tip of the iceberg.  This matter needs to be addressed with great urgency.</P>
    <P>Since it has been acknowledged that they have been good at interfacing <Col N="2000" /> effectively with industry and transferring technology, why is it recommended that their budgets stay the same while everything else is arbitrarily increased? It seems quite a contrary recommendation. Furthermore, an unbelievably bureaucratic and unworkable control structure has been proposed for the governance of the PATs, in which the dead hand of the unscientific Civil Service is plainly apparent.</P>
    <P>Another major structural problem which was not addressed is that within the Office of Science and Technology and even on the board of Forbairt, which carried out the policies of the Office of Science and Technology, there is not a single scientist or technologist. Surely such a glaring anomaly ought to have been highlighted and a programme of recruitment of experienced technologists imposed on the Office of Science and Technology.</P>
    <P>An additional structural problem relates to what kind of food research should be carried out in Teagasc as opposed to the universities.  Given the amount of money going into this area, guidance from the committee on this matter would have been particularly useful.  However, as they were both represented on the committee, it is not surprising that they could not agree on this very important issue.  This illustrates the compromised nature of the report and the failure to deal with real problem issues.  I am in no way critical of the individual professionalism of the members and chairperson of the committee.</P>
    <P>Many of the organisational changes proposed in Chapter VIII are quite impractical and have little or no chance of being implemented.  Co-ordinating science and technology across all Government Departments has been tried before and does not work because each Government Department has its own priorities and will resist co-ordination. The report should have stuck to considering only science and technology in the Department of Enterprise and Employment and its reorganisation and <Col N="2001" /> growth could effect industrial development and job creation in manufacturing industry.</P>
    <P>Our membership of the European Space Agency has always been of particular value to indigenous Irish companies. It has allowed them access to advanced technology which, in turn, has enabled them to develop new technology based products.  This &ldquo;technology advantage&rdquo; has been vital to these indigenous firms as it has enabled them to complete and to develop into areas which would otherwise be closed to them.  In spite of this beneficial effect to the indigenous sector, the sector to which the Government says it is giving priority, our membership of the Space Agency is continually threatened by a negative attitude on the part of the Department of Finance.  This is in spite of the fact that the Aerospace Industry Association of Ireland has over the years put forward extremely convincing cases to the Department of Enterprise and Employment quantifying the benefits of our continued membership.  The kinds of companies that benefit from our Space Agency membership fall into three main groups.  First, there are companies in the main aerospace engineering and mechanical components area &mdash; they include MCS (Galway) and BHP (Limerick) on the engineering side; and Hitall (Waterford), Shannon Precision (Clare) and Fenelon Engineering (Longford) on the manufacturing side. The second group are those in the computer software and systems area and two indigenous companies, CAPTEC and Cara Data Processing have been actively developing high technology products as a direct result of our ESA membership.  Finally, there is the whole area of telecommunications and electronics, one of the largest industrial sectors in Ireland, and one in particular for which it is difficult for our indigenous companies to enter.  This makes continued membership of ESA all the more important for companies in this sector. Space Technology Ireland and Betatherm are examples of companies which have benefited under this programme.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2002" /> An interesting feature of these companies is that all of them are small and most of them indigenous.  Consequently they may not have the clout of the larger firms in determining where industrial development goes.  I find it incredible, if it is correct, that in 1993 the Department of Finance refused to pay our subscription to the European Space Agency, consequently jeopardising our membership of an organisation which many other European countries are clamouring to join.  I hope this is not true and I am open to correction regarding it.</P>
    <P>Given the already well documented benefits of membership, rather than trying to avoid paying our subscription and jeopardising our membership we should consider doubling or tripling what we pay to the European Space Agency.  It is obvious that for the amount of money involved we are getting a far better return in terms of job creation, product development and a platform from which to develop indigenous companies than from many other initiatives taken in this line.  If the State were more committed, the potential benefits would be enormous.</P>
    <P>Finland, a country similar to Ireland in its dependency on fishing, forestry and agriculture and with, perhaps, more advanced mining facilities, is about to take up membership of the European Union.  It has also a similar economy and population size and traditionally its industries were based mainly on natural resources.  For example, up to 15 years ago, Nokia, one of its most successful companies, was involved mainly in mining and timber production.  It then invested heavily in research and development in the area of information technology, developed the cellular telephone and is now a world leader in this area.  It produces one of the most advanced mobile telephones which perhaps the Minister uses.</P>

      <P>Twenty years ago that company was almost 100 per cent dependent on a natural resource based industry, but its turnover is now only 10 per cent dependent on that industry.</P>
      <P>It is interesting to note Joseph O'Malley's report in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> entitled &ldquo;Playing politics with computers&rdquo; when there were many other matters about which he could have written. He stated:</P>
      <P>Every 18 months, microprocessors double in speed, and Intel is the pacesetter for much of that change.  In Leixlip, Intel is engineering the next (post-Pentium) phase of the global microchip revolution and has become one of Ireland's largest employers.</P>
      <P>The plant is just half an hour from Government buildings.  Yet, for Ministers and TDs, Intel &mdash; and those other high tech industries dotted round the country &mdash; may as well be on another planet.</P>
      <P>Joseph O'Malley does not appear to think much of us in relation to information technology.  That well written article went on to state:</P>
      <P>In Singapore, by the year 2000, the Government hopes to transform a country of similar size to Ireland into an `intelligent island'.  Every home, office, school and factory will have easy access to a wide range of electronic information and services.  In Ireland, there is no such Government plan.  At least not yet.</P>
      <P>The report further states:</P>
      <P>Here, via Science and Technology Minister, Pat Rabbitte, the Government has just discovered the Internet, years after others have realised the network's potential and turned it to their advantage.  Even Sinn Féin has a presence on the Net, as a shocked Taoiseach recently found out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because of our excellent university and regional technical college standards we should endeavour to become one of the most successful internet industrial nations in the world.  It is well known <Col N="2004" /> that those standards were a major attraction for the German Siemens Corporation deciding to base its most modern European facility in Ireland.  It is regrettable, however, that there was intervention at the highest level from Prime Minister John Major and his Cabinet Minister Michael Heseltine who made it more attractive for Siemens to locate in the UK, possibly because of more money and a larger market to sell their generating and telecommunications systems.</P>
    <P>Science and technology is about creating jobs and it is regrettable that the STIAC report concentrates on natural resource based industry and pure science as there is little prospect of additional jobs in that area.  The report ignores large industries based on information technology.</P>
    <P>A recent report in <i>The Irish Times</i> stated that the last such national review of the policy was undertaken in the 1960s when the original National Science Council first met and the then Minister for Finance, Mr. Charles Haughey, stated that by neglecting fundamental research a country would condemn its own industry to adolescence.</P>
    <P>If we want to give our taxpayer's more value for money we should spend more on job creation and create a future for our young people and for Ireland. Today technology is the engine of economic growth.  If we do not move with it and oil each vital section of that engine it will become sluggish and we will be left behind in the race for information technology and job creation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh:</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not expect to speak on this important issue, but I welcome the opportunity to do so.  While the report of the Science, Technology and Innovation Council is important, we are not scarce on reports on how to sort out the problems of our economy, many of which contain common themes about introducing Government programmes, establishing committees, introducing new tax breaks and increased public spending.  If that were a recipe for success we would have achieved the great <Col N="2005" /> goal of full employment many years ago.  This report appears to be following that well worn path and I groan inwardly when I hear about yet another task force.  I am not taking from the Minister's determination in regard to science and technology, particularly research and development, but it goes against the grain to hear of proposals that often do not facilitate the Minister's objective.</P>
      <P>I am sure all Members would agree we do not devote sufficient resources to research and development and that to a large extent &mdash; as is obvious from the report &mdash; it has been ignored.  However, we must be careful not to compound the problem in our efforts to resolve it. Implementation of the report would require a high level of spending. Increased public spending must be funded from increased taxation but our penal taxation levels are the main barrier to job creation.  In recent years we have established a plethora of agencies, committees and quangoes as part of our economic development strategy.  From my short involvement in business I know that one of the last things business needs is increased bureaucracy.  If we are to increase State spending on research and development it should be funded from savings made elsewhere in the major industrial support budget which I believe is now running at approximately £500 million per annum. We do not need to tinker around with our taxation system.  The report recommends special PRSI relief for those working in the research and development area.  That is the wrong approach. Our party has always said &mdash; and I restate &mdash; that radical and comprehensive reform of our taxation system is required to reduce the burden of tax on all workers and encourage people to take up paid employment.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to be overly-critical of the report.  Mr. Tierney as counsel has produced a very valuable document which presents a clear analysis of the problems in the area of research and development.  Some of the findings did not come as a great shock to many of us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2006" /> The report points out that innovation is the mainspring of international economic competitiveness.  It states that we are not well positioned in respect of the new technological and market dynamics and that is true.</P>
    <P>It is depressing to read that we barely avoid the laggards categorisation, and that is due to the assistance of EU Structural Fund support.  That does not inspire great confidence in our industries in terms of their dedication to research and development.  Irish industry has been lacking in that area for many years.  There should be an increase in investment in research and development and we should consider ways of bringing that about.  Most industries that have invested in research and development are involved in the foreign sector.  The record of our indigenous industries in that regard is depressing and does not augur well for development of those industries.</P>
    <P>I particularly welcome the report's recognition that we lack an enterprise culture.  It states it is essential that we create such a culture and recognises that there is a negative attitude to entrepreneurship, risk taking and innovation in many aspects of Irish economic life. Any society that imposes a marginal tax rate of 56 per cent on average industrial earnings cannot be surprised at the lack of an enterprise culture.  Enterprise is about a willingness to take risks, but people will not take risks if they have to surrender to the Government more than half of the gains resulting from their efforts.  The report highlights the findings of the recent world competitiveness survey for 1994.  Of the 41 countries surveyed Ireland was placed tenth from the bottom in terms of management having a sense of entrepreneurship.  That position will not change unless we put in place a tax system that rewards effort and risk.</P>
    <P>The sections of the report dealing with the food sector make depressing reading.  Food is our most important indigenous manufacturing industry. According to the report, Irish food manufacturers spend only 0.5 per cent <Col N="2007" /> of their net output on research and development.  That is an alarmingly low figure by international standards.  The report describes this sector as one of the least innovative in this Irish economy. That is the case despite the fact that consumer tastes are changing rapidly and a huge variety of new products are launched on the market every year.  Eating patterns today are much different from those when I was growing up but there has not been a great response to that change from the leading companies in the food industry.</P>
    <P>It is not surprising that our exports are largely confined to low value commodity-type products such as butter and skimmed milk powder.  On the other hand we import from other European countries ever-increasing quantities of sophisticated processed food products and ready meals.  Total imports of meat and dairy products amount to almost £250 million per year.  Efforts to make improvements in this regard have not met with great success.  For instance, many experts have singled out cheese as a prospective growth area, yet Irish cheese manufacturers tend to locate their cutting and packing operations in Britain.  These are labour intensive activities and it makes more financial sense to hire people in Britain where lower tax rates mean lower labour costs.</P>
    <P>Research and development cannot be viewed in isolation from other aspects of economic management.  Not only has our nearest neighbour a low tax, proenterprise economy but such an economy exists in another part of this island. No amount of technological sophistication will be of value unless we move urgently to close the gap between personal tax rates in this country and the UK.</P>
    <P>Education also has a part to play in this matter.  Despite improvements in our education system, with regional technical colleges more conscious of developments in science and technology, our school curriculum lacks emphasis on the possibilities in this area.  Our staid, conseravative attitude <Col N="2008" /> to education underpins the negative attitude to research and development in industry.  There is a contrast between lack of investment in research and development in indigenous industry and the attitude of foreign based, multinational companies.  A significant break-through must be made in that regard. I welcome the fact that the Minister is initiating debate and focusing on research and development.</P>
    <P>In recent years I was approached by people in this area who asked me to use my influence &mdash; as if in my position I would have great influence &mdash; to change the attitudes that are endemic in terms of research and development.  The people involved in industry and business must realise that there will be no potential for development of their businesses without the innovation that results from research and development.  This is an intrinsic part of the growth pattern of any of our industries, particularly the indigenous ones.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh:</NameTxt>
      <P>We are lagging very seriously behind in the whole area of information technology, which needs support.  The multinationals provide high levels of employment in that sector which it is important for us to link into <Col N="2009" /> through our indigenous industry.  We should encourage development in that sector.</P>
      <P>I get great pleasure reading publications such as <i>The Motoring Times</i> as I aspire to owning a big car some day.  I read recently about the latest BMW which, it is claimed, has more computer capacity than the Apollo space craft from which men landed on the moon. That points to the whole area of scientific development, in which we are greatly lacking.  For example, I do not see a continuum of investment in awareness in our school system which would lead to the required expertise and involvement and which is very important to encourage.</P>
      <P>We talk about creating an enterprise society but we cannot make people enterprising.  All we can do is create the right climate and give people the rewards they deserve.  This report represents a base from which to start in terms of that encouragement.  We have a corpus of information and a realisation of how much there is to be done. I am not sure that setting up a task force is the right way to approach this and I hope the Minister will focus on what he wants that task force to do.  He should also look again at how research and development is funded.  There should be an onus on industry to realise that investment in research will pay off in terms of company development and future employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanKenny" hpid="Mr. S. Kenny Mr. S. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Kenny:</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  Science and technology play a very important role in our economy.  We must ensure that our schools and businesses have access to the latest technology. Recently, much media attention was given to a number of official publications and economic commentaries which painted a very healthy picture of Ireland's economic performance and prospects.  In a small open economy like ours growth and employment are heavily dependent on competitiveness.  The United States commission on industrial <Col N="2010" /> competitiveness defined competitiveness as the degree to which an economy can, under free, fair and market conditions, produce goods and services which meet the test of international markets, while simultaneously maintaining and expanding the real income of its citizens.</P>
      <P>The National Economic and Social Council recently pointed out that the degree and pace of integration by Ireland into the global economy will intensify.  Employment growth can only be achieved by increasing the competitiveness of Irish firms and labour.  In fact, the competitive strength of our country is reflected in its capacity to promote and sustain innovation.</P>
      <P>Competitiveness is, therefore, related to technological change and the capacity to innovate and adopt new technologies. Science and technology, therefore, have an integral role to play in the development of our economy.  Our recent economic improvements will not be sustained without a fundamental change in our approach to the issue of science, technology and innovation.  As the Tierney report notes, such a change is essential to generate the dynamism necessary to create a highly competitive indigenous sector and to continue to attract and integrate foreign investment into our economy in order to make a significant and lasting impact on the problem of unemployment.</P>
      <P>Innovation based on the application of science and technology is now the mainspring of international economic competitiveness.  Innovation and the promotion of an innovative society in all areas must become paramount objectives in Ireland's economic strategy and the key to sustained national growth. The achievers in today's international marketplace are those who master high technology which enables them to achieve high standards of living. Science, technology and innovation are central to this competitiveness.  As a result, firms and governments must take a long-term view of research and development if they are to be successful in improving competition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2011" /> Despite the awareness of the importance of innovation we in Ireland have, up to now, adopted a passive approach and the pace and volume of technology diffusion across the economy has been insufficient.  We must improve this. Technical change has come about, for the most part, through our attracting foreign companies or importing technology in the form of finished products. The Tierney report notes that we have assumed that, as a small and relatively isolated economy, we do not need to develop our own expertise and can rely on purchasing the innovation of others. While this approach was seen to be the most obvious one given the high amount of foreign investment in Ireland, it has failed us.  The weakness of the Irish national system of innovation is the absence of effective indigenous linkages within the innovation of foreign companies based in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Culliton report also referred to our failure to address the need to develop a strong, indigenous base in manufacturing and natural resource based industries.  The Tierney report asserts that behind this failure is a lack of an innovation culture within Irish enterprise.  The failure to establish a national system of innovation is a significant barrier to the long-run competitiveness of the Irish economy.  There is a glaring need in Ireland to adopt a new vision of innovation which would provide the motivation for enterprises, individuals and the public sector.  The National Economic and Social Council states that it is necessary to identify mechanisms to strengthen the learning process at the level of industry and society as a whole.</P>
    <P>Increased wealth and highly skilled employment will not occur until indigenous enterprise has been significantly transformed.  In order for this transformation to be realised, the level of business expenditure on research and development has to be increased.  At present, Irish businesses spend about half the international average on research and development and this is a <Col N="2012" /> significant factor in the poor performance of indigenous industry.  We must encourage firms to adopt a more open approach to research and development.</P>
    <P>Another important factor in the establishment of a progressive and effective national innovation system will be the third level sector.  Innovation is fundamentally grounded in learning and the third level sector in Ireland plays a central role in providing research expertise, information and skilled individuals at present, problems exist which inhibit the ability of the third level sector to make a maximum contribution to economic development.  In relation to existing research activities in the third level sector, there is a need to improve mechanisms and procedures for the transfer of knowledge from colleges to industry and other users.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister of State for his generous offer.  A great deal could be said on this topic and I regret we do not have more time to debate this important subject.  I congratulate the Minister on bringing the report to fruition.  I thank him for his excellent leadership of the science community. I thank the chairman, Mr. Dan Tierney, for his excellent work and the officials at the office of science and technology for the great work they have been doing in this area for many years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>STIAC was convened because the successful management of the economy, no less than any company, is crucially dependent on the creation, diffusion, transfer and commercialisation of knowledge. Such intellectual capital knowledge is the key determinant in gaining national competitive advantage and is the basis of innovation.  Without such innovation we would not be able to generate necessary jobs and growth.  Our future standard of living, economic <Col N="2013" /> status and capacity to benefit from and contribute to global technology and the technology-driven global economy will depend on the strength of our science and technology base and our capacity to innovate.</P>
    <P>The integration of science and technology in industrial policy is vital.  It can no longer be an add on factor; it is central to the development of our industrial base and our competitiveness.  I commend FORFÁS for bringing a new policy capability to science and technology policy.  I look forward to the forthcoming report of the Travers Task Force regarding the implementation of the STIAC report.  Perhaps at some future date the Minister will indicate which recommendations of the report have been implemented.  I am aware some of them are ongoing.  What are his specific priorities regarding their implementation over the next few months? Will the forthcoming budget make adequate provision for the funding of the recommendations?  I express some disappointment that the Government's reaction to the report will not be available until early 1996.  That will be too late to provide for its recommendations in the 1996 budget.  It appears that budget will not be an exciting one for the science and technology community. The Minister may not wish to await the completion of that report before taking action, and such a decision would be welcome.</P>
    <P>I wish to highlight the role the European Structural Funds have played in this area, but I warn against relying on them in the long term.  That would be a dangerous strategic decision on our part.  However, we should acknowledge the role of the Commission in developing science and technology policy in Ireland.  We should also acknowledge the role played by third level institutions such as Dublin Institute of Technology and regional technical colleges. They are a valuable base.  When I held the post now held by the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, I learned the hard way that the funding of basic science cannot be neglected as that type <Col N="2014" /> of blue sky research investment must be made early on to secure future results.</P>
    <P>When I was Minister for Education I recall closely examining the university structures and their cost units and reached the conclusion that greater coordination between the Department of Education and the office of science and technology would benefit science and technology policy in that, rather than the pursuit of separate agendas, it would achieve greater direction.</P>
    <P>The establishment of a science park is a difficult ministerial decision, but it would be foolish not to consider establishing a science park adjacent to universities where there is a reservoir of resources and abilities.  I question if it would be wise to distance a national science park from such available scientific resources.</P>
    <P>There are many other matters I wish to raise but I do not wish to encroach further on the Minister's time.  I thank the Minister for bringing this report to conclusion and putting his strong stamp on science and technology policy which I had the honour to initiate.  I thank him for bringing forward this report.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte:</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Members of the House who have contributed to the debate which was foreshortened by circumstances none of us could have foreseen. I thank my predecessor, Deputy Brennan, for establishing the STIAC Council and initiating this important review of our STI capability.  It is an important report and in saying that one does not have to agree with its 150 or so recommendations.  It is a timely and important boost to public understanding of a critical issue for our future competitiveness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I acknowledge some of the weaknesses of the report identified by Deputy O'Keeffe.  Any report is bound to be the product of the amalgam of persons that make it up.  It is something of an achievement in this area to be able to secure such a review of our STI policy between two covers given the disparate interests involved.  Deputy Brennan made passing reference to a lesson he <Col N="2015" /> learned about the importance of basic research, one I am being taught at present.  There are different interests involved and it is something of an achievement to produce a report on this area.  It is a matter for Government to decide what the priorities ought to be.</P>
    <P>I note Deputy O'Keeffe's criticism that there is too much spend, spend, spend about the report, but in the same breath he drew my attention to the considerable budget available to my opposite number across the water. There is a conflict between criticising the STIAC report in that it anticipates more funding than will be available and then pointing to the significant expenditure in the bigger economy next door.  I take the Deputy's point in the spirit it was intended.  There is a struggle for resources.  It is fair to say that not every Member of the House, industrialist or journalist is as au fait with this subject as one would like.  Political priorities dictate.  From that point of view there is not much point in my rising to debate matters relating to the Department of Finance.  It is a political decision, not one specific to the Department of Finance. I do not know, but I probably will learn, if it is true that the Department of Finance does not attach the same premium to the question of STI policy as I do.  I am all ears, eager and confident that the Department of Finance will recognise the inherent sagacity of the recommendations made in this report and will fund them.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Brennan said, a number of the recommendations have been implemented.  I am interested in the decisions made in this year's Finance Act in terms of encouraging additional spending in research and development. The effects of those decisions monitored over three years will prove interesting.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Keeffe asked that I specifically reply to the question of the European Space Agency.  There was a hiccup in 1993, but as a result of the recent meeting of scientific Ministers at Toulouse we were successful in surmounting some <Col N="2016" /> of the problems confronting the future of the European Space Agency.  My officials and I have been successful in putting together a creative solution to fund the deficit we inherited.</P>

Last week I was happy to preside over the signing of £7.5 million worth of contracts by one company, Devtec, the kind of company to which Deputy O'Keeffe has referred that has benefited from our membership of the European Space Agency.  I thank the Deputies who contributed to the debate.</P>
      <P>I accept the validity of many of the points Deputy O'Keeffe raised in relation to information technology but it is not a question of either or.  The existence of some of the leading players indicates the importance economic policy or industrial strategy places on attracting these companies.  It is not a question of abandoning the indigenous sector in favour of growing our information technology sector, a point emphasised by Deputy O'Keeffe.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann, acknowledging the crisis in the Irish sheep sector and mindful of the many thousands of jobs on farms and in factories dependent on the industry, condemns the Government and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry for the sustained indifference they have demonstrated to the needs of the industry and thereby calls for urgent steps to be taken to address both the <Col N="2017" /> immediate crisis and the long-term structural problems of the Irish sheep sector.</P>
    <P>We have a serious crisis in the Irish sheep industry which requires urgent remedy.  It is a crisis that will require sustained negotiating on behalf of the Minister at Council level to ensure that the emergency issues are dealt with and that the cash prices which have bedevilled sheep producers throughout the country are addressed.  He should be more pro-active in an area where there have been serious difficulties under his stewardship, an area in which one would have expected he would have shown some flair given that many of his constituents are seriously affected by what has happened, and is happening, in the Irish sheep sector.</P>
    <P>In 1980 Ireland got access to the French market and the ewe premium was introduced.  This was paid on each ewe in Ireland and in the UK it was paid on the lamb.  I have heard that at some public meetings the Minister referred to the fact that perhaps some policy mistake was made when we sought the premium on the ewe rather than on the lamb.  It is important to point out that at that time there were only 1.5 million ewes in the country, many in disadvantaged areas and many not attaining the lambing rates now available as a result of improved husbandry and breeding practices.</P>
    <P>Clearly, if we were to build a sheep industry here the provision of the ewe premium was manifestly the accelerator which allowed for an increased breeding flock.  Throughout the 1980s there was a huge expansion in the breeding flock. From a total of 1.5 million head in 1980 the herd increased to 4.6 million in 1994. The expansion of the herd goes back to the decision by the then Minister for Agriculture, Ray MacSharry, to give us unlimited access to the French market. The ewe premium was the foundation on which a sheep industry could be built.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2018" /> Much work was done on the processing side by providing the infrastructure that would allow us to provide the type of carcass lamb and carcass sheep meat that would give us increased market share in Europe.  Much of this work was done with FEOGA grant aid.  Camolin, Athleague and other areas are testimony to a well organised sheep processing sector from which other sectors, notably the pigmeat sector, have learned in recent years.</P>
    <P>Since 1991 we have seen the reform of the CAP so far as sheep are concerned. At that time we also had the introduction of the quota regime and &mdash; with the full support of everyone concerned &mdash; a ewe premium calculated across the European Union rather than on an island only basis, whereby each member state would do its own calculations. That was introduced in the belief that Irish prices would rise to meet French prices; in other words, there would be convergence in relation to the price and the ewe premium would be the support mechanism which would be uniformly applied at every level throughout the Community.</P>
    <P>Since 1991 our experience has shown that the theory does not work so far as Irish sheep producers are concerned.  In 1992 there was a collapse in lamb prices. In December of that year the then Minister, Deputy Joe Walsh, obtained a top-up premium of over £6 per ewe to meet that situation.  Therefore, the Minister has a precedent if he wishes to look at it as to how it is possible to get recognition for the special status and the vulnerability of the Irish sheep sector in those circumstances.  That precedent was set by his predecessor, Deputy Joe Walsh, in December 1992.  In 1993 and 1994 prices were static.  In 1995 there has been a collapse in early lamb prices due to currency differences, cheap hogget meat and the lower prices in France.</P>
    <P>It is important that the Minister acknowledge that there is a problem of crisis proportion in the Irish sheep industry.  Any comparison of average prices on a penny per pound basis for lamb at export in France for the months <Col N="2019" /> January to October 1994 versus 1995 show that very clearly.  For example, in March 1994 we were getting £1.29p per pound as against £1.17p per pound this year, a 9 per cent drop; in April 1994 we were getting £1.40p per pound as against £1.17p per pound this year, a 16 per cent drop; in May 1994 we were getting £1.43p per pound as against £1.07p per pound this year, a 25 per cent drop; in June 1994 we were getting £1.02p per pound as against 93p per pound, an 8 per cent drop and a 4 per cent drop in both July and August 1995 as against 1994.  There has been an increase in prices in October and all the indications are that prices for this month will be up on last year's prices but the Minister cannot take any credit for that.</P>
    <P>There was a rise on the floor prices at the end of 1992 and 1993 as well as this year.  Clearly lambs are scarce and there is still a lot of grass.  Because of the change in the European regulations from the 50 per cent threshold to the 70 per cent threshold many producers feel they may not have enough females for next year and are buying in.  That is another indication of domestic demand. Certainly no marketing strategy on behalf of the Minister or An Bord Bia or anybody else in the Department is responsible for the favourable fluctuations because nothing was done by the Department or the Minister during the year.  The only initiatives from this Minister were two aids to private storage schemes which took out a minimum number of hoggets from the marketplace but they did nothing for price.</P>
    <P>A study of any of the objective criteria, or any of the sources available for price, will show they did nothing for price.  Any suggestion that things would have been worse but for &ldquo;I did that&rdquo; is seeking to distort the market realities. The reality is that we have 3 million sheep exports to contend with each year, 80 per cent of which goes to the French market.  The Minister can claim no credit whatsoever in that regard.</P>
    <P>When one looks at the magnitude of the crisis in terms of price &mdash; An Bord <Col N="2020" /> Bia being the source of the statistics &mdash; it is quite clear that this year, following on a bad year last year, is much worse. Figures from the Teagasc sheep research unit at Knockbeg show a decline in the price of early lambs between 1994 and 1995.  The average price of early lambs in 1994 was £58.80; the figure for 1995 is £48.80, a decline of 17 per cent.  The weighted average price of early lambs at Knockbeg was 125p per pound in 1995.</P>
    <P>The Minister should know from the people I have met in his constituency and in the south-east generally that there is widespread frustration among farmers because cattle and tillage systems are now far more profitable than sheep.  That is a reverse of the position that obtained in the 1980s.</P>
    <P>A comparison of the gross margin per livestock unit for single suckling or cattle as against mid-season lamb production in the years 1990-92 and 1994 reveals a disturbing trend.  The gross margin per livestock unit for single suckling or cattle was £218 in 1990; it is £329 now.  The figure for mid-season lamb production is static; £242 in 1990 as against £245 in 1994.</P>
    <P>The subsidies per livestock unit in single suckling have increased from £65 to £173 per hectare.  The subsidies per livestock unit for mid-season lamb production were £130 in 1990, £104 in 1992, £98 in 1994 with a further reduction this year because of the method of calculation of the ewe premium.  The gross margin in single suckling and cattle systems has increased by 51 per cent between the years 1990 and 1994.  The gross margin in sheep has remained static but the support payments in single suckling and cattle systems have increased by 166 per cent since 1990. The support payments in sheep have decreased by 25 per cent over the same period.  Overall since 1988, sheep farmers' incomes have declined by 27 per cent, with farmers in non-disadvantaged areas particularly affected.</P>
    <P>The net margin figures for lowland mid-season lambing ewes in disadvantaged areas were £35 in 1988 and £32 in <Col N="2021" /> 1994.  The figures for non-disadvantaged areas decreased from £35 to £26.  That is a national farm survey estimate.  The 1994 figure represents a 27 per cent decrease on the 1988 figure in the non-disadvantaged areas.</P>
    <P>Looking at all the data available and based on all the objective criteria from our advisory services, marketing experts and the Department, it is clear that is a crisis in sheep farming.  What are we going to do about this problem?  It is interesting to look at the ewe premium statistics.  In 1992, almost £126 million was paid in ewe premiums.  In 1994, the last complete year for which figures are available, there was a loss of £45 million to sheep farmers in the ewe premium payments and the reduction in the numbers upon which we are paying is only 300,000 out of a total of over five million. That figure alone proves we are being discriminated against in relation to the calculation of ewe premiums.</P>
    <P>If there is any complacency at official or political level in the Department, its own figures prove that on a per ewe basis, on a total basis, on the basis of gross or net margins, on the basis, of comparative studies of single suckling or on any other basis, the sheep sector is in a serious state of decline because in the past number of years we have seen not only 7,500 leases of ewe quotas but also more than 5,000 transfers in the same period.</P>
    <P>The Minister cannot continue to be a policy taker &mdash; as he has proven himself to be &mdash; rather than a policy maker.  He cannot say he has inherited this problem and there is nothing he can do.  He inherited the benign situation in the milk industry, to which he never adverts when he and his PR people are talking to people around the country; he inherited excellent situations in the cattle and pig industries and he will probably claim credit for the fact that world prices in grain have lifted above EU prices.  The Minister will probably tell us he ensured that the sun shone for three months of the year.</P>
    <P>That will not wash with the people who have ewes and hoggets they cannot <Col N="2022" /> sell and those with mid-season lambs who have had to bear the brunt of the problem.  Early lamb producers are not getting any incentive to become involved in a far more costly operation, in terms of production systems, than the mid-season producer.  Approximately 12 per cent of lambs coming on the market are early lambs and while the position that obtains in April and May is bad, if the premium price is not available for the premium product in the early part of the system, what will happen when that 12 per cent no longer remains in the early lamb production system?  What will happen to the glut?  The Minister will have to have private storage coming out of his ears to deal with the market that will develop if he allows that to happen.  Many of the early lamb producers live in the non-disadvantaged and lowland areas and they are telling me, and anyone who wants to listen, that they will not be able to survive if this position obtains for much longer.</P>
    <P>The Minister's responsibility is to deliver.  We have had charters of rights and PR exercises and we have heard all the promises that were made.  We were told this matter was the top priority, and so it should be for a Minister who is supposed to be in touch with his own constituency. However, the time has come to deliver and what the Minister promised in June would happen in September has not happened.  In September we were told to wait until Christmas &mdash; I am sure Santa Claus will come down all our chimneys on that morning.  Santa Clause will not be coming, however, if the Minister is simply referring to an extension of the rural world premium. If £5.37 per ewe on a million ewes, which is only 20 per cent of the total number of ewes, is the Minister's idea of delivering, that is not the opinion of sheep farmers.  That will not satisfy them and talking down on the payment of the top-up premium will not do because it will not be accepted.  The Minister's predecessor got a top-up premium in 1992 when the floor price was not as sustained as it was this year.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2023" /> Sheep farmers and farm representative bodies have made it plain through public marches and constant lobbying at all levels that, on the basis of the method of calculation, an 8 per cent top-up premium is not only feasible, it is justifiable, fair play and is what is required. That top-up premium, in addition to the extension of the rural world premium, may provide some solace but we all know that is only an emergency measure.  That only gives recognition to an income crisis in sheep farming.  It certainly will not compensate sheep farmers who want to get back to the position that obtained in the late 1980s when they could market their product and make a living.  That is what everybody wants to do but sheep farmers are being discriminated against in the marketplace and the Minister does not seem to be in a position to do anything about the problem.</P>
    <P>Our main competitors in the French market are UK producers.  It is clear they enjoy a competitive advantage because of their location and the availability of the Channel Tunnel.  That is a fact of life with which we must deal to the best of our ability.  In terms of overall fiscal policy, I outlined to the Minister another promise he made in regard to providing a scheme to help those affected by the currency problems that have arisen because of a weak sterling. The Minister has not delivered on that promise.  He has not delivered in terms of doing something for sheep farmers.</P>
    <P>Given the high national reserves, we have advocated a reduction in interest rates to help improve our competitive position <i>vis-à-vis</i> the sterling area.  This would be of crucial significance to sheep farmers next year.  If we do not deal with this issue sheep farmers will continue to be at a 7 per cent disadvantage next year, and this will be in addition to everything else that has gone wrong in that sector.  The Government can achieve this reduction in interest rates if it has the political will to keep its public expenditure programmes under control. If Fianna Fáil was in Government it <Col N="2024" /> would avail of the opportunity to reduce interest rates.  Such a move would be welcomed not only by sheep producers and processors but by all those involved in the indigenous food sector.</P>
    <P>Our sheep meat is regarded as organic but we cannot sell our product if the Minister continues to accept the present method of calculation of the ewe premium.  In 1991 everyone agreed with the theory which was due to be reviewed after five years in 1996.  I call on the Minister to instigate that review now at European level.  An all-embracing committee representative of the sheep sector, producers, processors and others and the Department should be set up to formulate and put our case that there is clear discrimination and active divergence of price which is exacerbated by French preference on the French market.  It is clear that the necessary decisions must be taken now.</P>
    <P>If the Minister and the Government are not prepared to insist that this is done now then our argument will be defeated.  We cannot expect top-up premia if we are not prepared to insist on a review of the methods of calculation. I hope the Minister will confirm that this will happen.  As we know, nothing happened in September and all that happened in June was that a decision was taken to allow increased access to New Zealand lamb.  When the Commissioner was here he said that he was on our side, that everything would be all right and we should continue to make telephone calls.  At long last people have started to realise that nothing is being done.</P>
    <P>Some months ago we were given a promise that a carcase classification scheme would be established for the sheep industry, yet no action has been taken in this regard.  It has been reported on the airwaves and elsewhere that the Minister is considering the establishment of a voluntary scheme under which people can decide whether to co-operate.  We have seen the benefits of quality assurance schemes in the milk sector and other primary production sectors.  We need a mandatory <Col N="2025" /> scheme in the sheep meat sector and the Minister must be prepared to say that he will defend the national interest and will not allow vested interests to say they will not proceed with a certain scheme because it will cause inconvenience, upset a production plant and cause a few problems.  We need a mandatory national quality scheme now.  We have been promised such a scheme for months, yet nothing has been done.</P>
    <P>The Minister must take the necessary action instead of trying to placate all the vested interests he meets.  While this is a great way of postponing the solution to a problem and keeps everyone happy for a while, when it reaches the stage that sheep farmers have no money then the Minister has to show leadership and be prepared to put in place a quality assurance scheme in the long-term interests of whatever remains of the sheep sector after this débâcle.  This will not lift prices tomorrow morning or next week but it will lift them in two or three years' time when customers realise that we have a quality system and are prepared to put a price on quality.  This will provide an incentive to producer groups and early lamb producers who are in the business of providing premium products at a time when the production season does not allow for it in the normal grassland. The Minister must display an ability to discriminate against premium product, next type quality product, hoggets, etc.  If we are not prepared to classify carcases and put a value on them then we cannot berate the French and those who will still pay a common price regardless of what we export to them. The Minister has stood over this fundamental marketing dificiency despite the fact that the sheep problem was his top priority.  If the Minister says he is giving priority to an issue then he should take decisions; otherwise it is all rhetoric and nonsense.</P>
    <P>It is long past time when the Minister should have insisted that a top-up premium be paid.  Over the past three months he said much about the problems in the sector and held interviews in <Col N="2026" /> Brussels which had nothing to do with agriculture but he has not referred to a top-up premium or put a price on it.  He said he would do his best but if he does not deliver on his promises then the exodus from the sheep sector will increase and accelerate.  I want to outline the reasons I believe the Minister should fights hard on this issue.</P>
    <P>Our ewe premium quota is 5.03 million and, all things being equal, the sheep sector is one of the few in which young farmers can become involved.  A young farmer cannot go out and buy 20 cows and unless he can afford a large investment he cannot get involved in any other sector.  Ewes cost £20 each and he can become involved in sheep farming if it is competitive, viable and attractive. However, there is no confidence in the industry.  Unless we restore this confidence through leadership and by delivering on crucial net issues which affect producers then we will deny young farmers the opportunity to become involved in the one enterprise open to them.</P>
    <P>We put down this motion to ensure a proper discussion on this issue.  As can be seen from what I said, using the word &ldquo;crisis&rdquo; to describe the problems in the sheep sector is not an exaggeration.  The Minister can take emergency measures to alleviate this crisis yet the measures taken so far this year have achieved nothing.  The Minister should indicate to the vested interests that he is serious about taking hard decisions regardless of whether he can achieve consensus on them.  He should do something about these problems and ensure that farmers do not have to protest on the streets of Dublin during the winter months because of his inactivity and incompetence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis:</NameTxt>
      <P>We put down this motion not for any political reason but to highlight the financial losses suffered by sheep farmers and the effects of this on their families and future livelihoods. When one looks at the history of the sheep industry one realises that urgent action must be taken along the lines of that taken by the Minister's predecessor who secured a top-up premium some years ago.</P>
      <P>We cannot walk away from the net reduction of 36 per cent in the price of ewes since 1988.  If industrial workers were told their salaries would be reduced by 6 per cent per annum over the next six years the gates of Leinster House would be continually blocked by protesters.  It is only now sheep farmers are realising there is a crisis.  For the past six months they have been living on promises which the Minister has not fulfilled. It appears he is hedging his bets on the question of further action.  The number of farmers leaving sheep production is frightening; it has fallen by 5,200 since 1992 and is expected to rise in the years ahead.</P>
      <P>The undertakings given by the Commission to the Minister's predecessors have been thrown to the wind.  In its recent statement the Commission undertook to take market management measures to alleviate the current difficulties in the sheep market, particularly in Ireland, but the action taken was limited. It also undertook in the light of the result of these measures, to consider if further action was necessary, in particular as regards the possibility of an upward adjustment in the level of ewe premium and an acceleration of its payment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a need for a top-up payment of £8 per ewe to raise the premium to the required level.  The rural world premium to which the Minister has referred is not the solution unless sufficient funds are made available to ensure each farmer receives a supplement of £8 per ewe.  If it forms part of the arrangement for lowland farmers I hope the people I represent will receive £8 by other means.  They have suffered greatly <Col N="2028" /> because the people who traditionally purchased their store lambs are no longer in business due to inadequate margains.  This has proved to be an expensive year for those who concentrated on this type of farm enterprise.</P>
    <P>At the next Council of Ministers meeting the Minister will have to seek a reduction in the figure of 13,500 tonnes of New Zealand lamb.  It was agreed in June that the figure should be raised. New Zealand lamb is now widely available throughout the Union to the detriment of Irish producers.  UK lamb imports have also had an impact on our market share in France.  Perhaps the Minister will draw the attention of his colleague, the Minister for Finance, to the effect his policy of high interest rates-Deputy Cowen mentioned exchange rates&mdash;has had on the cost of our products in Europe.</P>
    <P>We are not seeking a temporary little arrangement.  We expect the Minister to secure agreement in Europe on the need to put a permanent mechanism in place to ensure equal treatment for sheep farmers who have suffered severely. The Minister may sneer but there is a crisis.  Sheep numbers have fallen by 300,000 this year and if they continue to fall our share of the market in France will disappear.</P>
    <P>The farm lobby groups argue that a top-up payment of £8 is necessary to bring sheep farmers back on to an even keel.  I hope that when he attends the Council of Ministers meetings in December the Minister will stress that it gave a commitment last June that the Commission would undertake to take market management measures to alleviate the current difficulties in the sheep meat market, particularly in Ireland, and in the light of the result of these measures to consider if further action was necessary.  This is long overdue and it us up to the Minister to deliver.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MJNolan" hpid="Mr. Nolan Mr. Nolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan:</NameTxt>
      <P>It is unfortunate that we had no option but to table this motion because of the Minister's inactivity.  I wish to draw his attention to the plight <Col N="2029" /> of sheep producers.  While the agriculture industry in general is prospering, sheep farmers face a crisis because of poor returns during the past year.  This matter which the Government has failed to address adequately has been highlighted on a number of occasions by the farming organisations, sheep farmers and the Fianna Fáil spokesperson on Agriculture.</P>
      <P>Sheep farmers are not the only ones calling for the introduction of a top-up payment of £8.  In a report commissioned by the Minister on the sheep industry, An Bord Bia also recommended that the ewe premium should be increased by this amount.  The Minister should now ask the Council of Ministers to honour its commitment given at the farm price talks earlier this year that, in the event of the market management measures failing to adequately lift lamb prices, the Commission would increase ewe premium payments to adequately compensate flock owners.  It is evident to all those involved in the agriculture industry that the market management measures introduced earlier this year are not working.</P>
      <P>Financial hardship has been inflicted on flock owners as the ewe premium is inadequate to compensate them.  This has had a devastating effect on the sheep industry which is worth £300 million. It is clear that lamb prices throughout Europe will not converge as originally anticipated.  In these circumstances Irish sheep farmers, with the lowest lamb prices in the European Union, have a rock solid case to make for the introduction of a permanent top-up payment to guarantee fair competition. Evidence of the validity of the case being made by Irish sheep producers is that the European Farmers' Union has rowed in solidly behind the campaign to secure compensation to resolve the income crisis in the Irish sheep sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister should not wring his hands and say there is nothing he can do.  We ask him to take action immediately as it is clear that the income crisis <Col N="2030" /> in the sheep sector is as deep and more damaging than that which prevailed at the end of 1992 when the then Minister, Deputy Walsh, introduced a top-up payment. As an interim measure the Minister should provide the same level of assistance.</P>
    <P>Over 5,200 flock owners have been forced out of production with a massive reduction of 300,000 in the size of the national flock.  An emergency top-up payment of £8 per ewe is the minimum required to compensate sheep farmers. Teagasc figures show that between 1988 and 1994 their incomes collapsed by a massive 36 per cent.  This would not be accepted in any other sector of industry, be it agriculture or otherwise.  Taken against the background of an increase in farmers' incomes in other sectors of agriculture this is unacceptable.</P>
    <P>During the past ten years sheep farmers have built an industry that is now worth over £300 million.  It provides an essential source of income for 48,000 farmers.  Over 2,500 people are involved in its processing and marketing sector. This was achieved by a huge investment, bank borrowings, hard work and personal sacrifice by all the families involved.  It would be unacceptable if the Minister stood back and allowed the rug to be pulled from under Ireland's third largest farming sector.  We demand that he urgently negotiate a short-term rescue package for the sheep industry and put in place a sustainable long-term plan to ensure it expands and becomes a profitable enterprise.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann endorses the effective measures which have already been taken by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry to address the difficulties which have been experienced by sheep producers this year and commends the intensive efforts by the Minister at the Council <Col N="2031" /> of Agriculture Ministers to secure further support for the sector.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I am delighted to have this opportunity to deal with agricultural matters and with what is a serious concern about sheep.</P>
    <P>I am well aware of the income situation in the Irish sheepmeat sector during 1995.  I wish to put in proper context the exact nature of the problem which exists and needs to be clearly understood. Nineteen ninety five has been a disappointing year for a certain segment of sheep producers.  The essence of the problem is that prices during the prime early season production period failed to reach expected levels.  Producers who concentrated their supply of lambs to the prime market suffered a considerable shortfall in returns.  There are a number of factors which caused this poor market performance.  Among the most important causes were external factors such as currency fluctuations which gave Sterling and British an advantage, supply and demand shifts on the French market, which is by far the most important export outlet, &mdash;over 70 per cent&mdash;and the conflict between the development of sheep production and the diminution of consumer demand in the United Kingdom for the past number of years.  There was one important internal factor, namely, the negative influence of over-fat hoggets during the early part of the year, which was largely a speculative, trade.</P>
    <P>Once the negative impact of the market development began to be apparent early in the spring, I recognised the likely effects which might result for the sector and took immediate steps to obtain redress.  The difficulties of the Irish sheep meat sector have been my number one priority from a political and official point of view and no effort has been spared either by myself, my officials, to whom I pay tribute, or the relevant State agencies to assist sheep producers.  There has been no indifference: the contrary is the case.  The efforts I have made have ensured that <Col N="2032" /> the effects of a poor market, albeit bad, have been softened, the demand for Irish lamb in both home and export markets have been boosted and the direct and practical intervention of the EU Commission has been secured. Action was taken twice during 1995 to restore confidence to the market at a critical time.  I have sought a greater level of income support from the EU and put specific proposals to the Commissioner in regard to the kind of assistance which might be provided.</P>
    <P>It is argued quite strongly and with some justification that the current EU regime has not achieved price convergence. The proposals I have put to the EU Commission are intended to remedy that situation by directing additional support towards member states whose prices are lower by a specified percentage than the EU average.  I have suggested 10 per cent as a reasonable trigger mechanism.  It is worth noting that sheep prices at the moment are quite good and for the past few weeks have been better than not only last year, but the last three years; 1994 was generally accepted as being quite a good year for sheep producers.  As someone who produced lambs as far back as 1978, I accept the overall sheepmeat situation has been depressed for the last several years.  Therefore it is important that we properly define the nature and extent of the problem if I am to convince the EU Commission and my colleagues in the Council of Ministers.</P>
    <P>It is important that the realities are brought to the attention of the House. A number of difficulties combined to depress the lamb market in Ireland in the early part of this year.  The following are the most important and significant: turbulence in the currency markets earlier this year created difficulties for sheep and lamb exported from Ireland, by upsetting the traditional trading patterns in France, which is our main export destination.  The performance of sterling gave exporters from the United Kingdom a significant price advantage over Irish exporters in a volatile market. In addition the traditional French <Col N="2033" /> exports of light lamb to southern Europe were discontinued because of the strong French Franc and this produce was diverted instead to the domestic French market.  The UK will export 100,000 tonnes of sheepmeat to France this year; a second factor was the restriction of exports of live sheep to the Continent from both Ireland and the United Kingdom.  Irish live sheep exports were 16 per cent below corresponding 1994 levels in the first half of 1995.  The very sizeable UK live export trade was almost completely stopped and product was exported in carcase form instead; a third factor was the significant decline in lamb consumption in the United Kingdom over the past three years &mdash; of the order of 20 per cent &mdash; in response to higher retail prices following the termination of the variable premium support system in that market. This demand shift resulted in the release of greater quantities of British lamb on the French market.  Had that decline in consumption not occurred the market position would be much healthier. There is also the reality of strong competition from white meat, particularly poultry; the presence of an exceptionally large quantity of 1994 season hoggets on the Irish market in March and April at the time when prime new season spring lamb became available seriously depressed the going price for the new season product.</P>
    <P>I have taken a series of measures to deal with the situation.  Having consulted the various interest groups involved I submitted a memorandum to EU Commissioner Fischler in March 1995 outlining the serious market situation in Ireland and seeking additional suport by way of the ewe premium for the low market prices which then obtained in Ireland.  My proposal was that where market prices fell significantly below the average EU, an additional top-up compensation should be provided and I also sought extension of the rural world premium to all sheep producers.  Therefore I have put specific solutions to the Commission.</P>
    <P>The Commission responded in the <Col N="2034" /> form of a direct market intervention which was confined to Ireland.  A scheme of aid for private storage, which provided subsidies to lamb processors to buy up and store the equivalent of 11,000 season hoggets, played an important part in controlling the downward trend in prices and allowed the market to recover and provide more realistic prices for 1995 season lamb.</P>

      <P>At the June Council of Ministers I again put the issue before my fellow Ministers and the Commission. Subsequently I secured a commitment from the Council to provide market management measures for a second time and to review the operation and level of the ewe premium.  In the event this was a very important commitment and is the foundation of my current efforts at the Agriculture Council. In July a second scheme of APS took 756 tonnes, the equivalent of 41,000 lambs, off the market both here and in Northern Ireland, and provided quite generous levels of subsidy which cost the EU £800,000.  This second market measure was especially timely and effective in that it not only removed a sizeable quantity of lamb from the market but created conditions which by the end of the summer allowed prices to pick up and rise to levels above those which existed in 1994.  The value of this measure was fully recognised by the industry, particularly the meat processors who had originally poured cold water on it.</P>

      <P>The £80 million paid directly to producers supported their incomes in difficult market circumstances. Comparing the 1995 premium to last year's I hope that £120 million will be paid this year in ewe premium payments.  This will be an additional £20 million in the pockets of Irish sheep producers. The ewe premium overall <Col N="2036" /> should be between £2 and £3 per head higher this year than last and will help cushion the losses suffered through market weakness early in the year.  It is important to emphasise that the main difficulty was in the late spring/early summer period and the main adverse consequences fell on those who produce lamb for that period.  Any solutions must address the real problem.</P>
      <P>I ensured that retention periods for 1996 ewe premium, while complying with the requirements of EU legislation, strike a proper balance in the orderly disposal of lambs.  There has been synchronisation between Northern Ireland and the Republic and there will be a single retention period in Britain. We have had a number of bilateral talks with our colleagues in DANI and MAFF in that regard.  Those changes will help to avoid tensions in the market next year.</P>
      <P>I tackled this issue head on and will continue to do so.  A series of measures specific to Ireland have been taken. They were introduced at critical times and there is evidence to show that they had a positive effect.  This is part of an ongoing process.</P>

I am in no doubt that there is a full understanding of and sympathy for the difficulties experienced by Irish lamb producers this year in the Council of Ministers and the Commission. I am determined that this understanding will be translated into effective action on their behalf.</P>
      <P>I do not need to be convinced of the importance of protecting the future of our sheep sector.  It is operating in an increasingly difficult and competitive market with pressure being exerted not only by exporters in other production countries but also from other meats. The difficulties for the sector are not as a result of a decline in political supports &mdash; there was a cut in export refunds in other areas &mdash; but are due to market difficulty. No Minister can be held responsible for the market price of sheep.</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates:</NameTxt>
      <P>Lamb is a relatively high priced product which tends to be sold at the top end of the market.  Therefore, it is natural that it should be subjected to strong competition.  Our sheep sector has a number of important advantages. It has the ability to produce a top quality produce in a good environment and has the benefit of good consumer perception. We have established a good production base and were able to significantly expand sheep numbers before quotas became a reality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was reference to the decline in the number of sheep producers.  In 1988 there were 48,000 sheep farmers and the number rose to 53,000 in 1993.  The latest figures show there are 48,000 producers. In 1988 the ewe flock was 3.97 million.  It rose to over 5 million by 1993 and is now 4.67 million.  We have the <Col N="2038" /> same number of producers as in 1988 but a much larger national sheep flock.</P>
    <P>We need to remedy the weakness in the industry.  Not all the problems are caused by external factors.  A greater effort needs to be made to achieve quality on a more consistent basis.  For that reason I asked An Bord Bia to carry out an indepth analysis of the different aspects of the sheep industry with particular attention on the export market.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates:</NameTxt>
      <P>The report is in the final stages of completion and I believe it should be the basis for formulating a strategy for the period ahead.  A number of matters are clear.  Irish produce is most vulnerable in its quality and consistency of product.  The French market on which we are so dependent will penalise poor quality production.  If we do not produce exactly what the market demands our competitors are fully prepared to take over our market share.  As a step towards the achievement of the required standards of excellence I have opened discussions with lamb processing plants which aim to introduce an effective and workable lamb carcass classification scheme in all export processing plants with effect from the beginning of next year.  I am determined that this should go ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cowen referred to this matter. I always said it would be introduced in 1996.  It was not my intention to do otherwise.  However, an elaborate classification grid with mandatory independent policing by my Department would have the direct consequence of imposing a significant levy on sheep producers.  Something of the order of 50p per lamb was suggested.  There is no support among sheep producers for this. I have made it clear that the value of the classification system is such that I am insisting that it go ahead.  I want a workable basis on which it will be implemented voluntarily but failing <Col N="2039" /> that, if necessary, I will introduce a compulsory scheme.  My first attempt is to secure the co-operation of producers.</P>

      <P>We need to match our competitors in quality and efficiency.  At producer level there is scope to increase the number of lambs per ewe.  We need to ensure that our breeding policies are correct.  Quality is paramount.  There is an optimum weight at which lambs should be slaughtered.  For instance, does the industry run the risk of creating a hogget problem early next year?  Attention should be paid to the experience of this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I went to the Rungis market I was told by buyers, distributors and so on that it did not matter about the quality of the carcass; once it is over 18 kilos there is no market for the lamb, not to <Col N="2040" /> mention the problems of over fat.  We must be very careful not to create a hogget problem in 1996.</P>
    <P>I recently had discussions with our New Zealand colleagues and the prospects for early 1996 are quite positive.  There are emerging markets which can be exploited.  The German market is widely recognised as having good potential for expansion.  It is a high quality, demanding market.  I know An Board Bia are alive to and working on those possibilities.</P>
    <P>The question of New Zealand lamb imports is an issue which is frequently raised.  Deputy Ellis gave the impression that a decision was made this year which altered the position of New Zealand imports.  This is untrue.  I understand the factual position is that they will not achieve their full quota this year and my efforts have been to work with a legal agreement, a voluntary restraint agreement which I inherited&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Regarding what Deputy Ellis said, the reality is otherwise.  New Zealand has had long-standing rights of access to the European market subject to a 20 per cent duty, for unlimited quantities.  For many years the New Zealanders agreed, through negotiation, to limit the quantity they send to Europe in return for a levy concession.  The GATT deal allocated them a somewhat higher quantity&mdash;&mdash;</P>

That is the GATT deal.  It did not create a new or exceptional right but took account of an historic entitlement and placed on a more formal and permanent basis a form of quantitative limitation. Unfortunately, it has been done and cannot be renegotiated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have had an opportunity to put directly to the New Zealand industry and its Minister for Agriculture Irish producers' concerns at their level of access and at the level of prime cuts that can be put into the marketplace.

It is also the case that there <Col N="2042" /> are technical limitations on the volumes of chilled produce they can import. Indeed some concerns voiced in this area are exaggerated.</P>

I assure the House I will persist in my efforts at the Council of Agriculture Ministers to ensure a satisfactory outcome.  Since there have been many references to it, the position is that, in the commitment I received on the price negotiation in June last, it was always considered it would be within the European Union year 1996 any measure proposed by the Commission would be contemplated. This means it will arise within the context of the conclusion of the Spanish Presidency.  I never said, nor did any of my officials, that the solution would be reached in September.  That would be simply impossible because the method of calculation of the ewe problem, taking market prices into account, runs right up to December.  This means we will not know the normal level of premium, calculated on the basis of market prices, until that calculation has been concluded.</P>

    <P>My difficulty &mdash; obviously that of someone who has the responsibility of negotiating this package; it is not one of the Opposition because they do not have that responsibility &mdash; is that to change the method of calculation of the ewe premium requires the Commission to propose it and that it be accepted by <Col N="2044" /> a qualified majority.  Deputy Cowen as a former Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications will be fully aware of European Union voting procedures. I do not want to mislead anybody on this issue but, frankly, no other member state of the European Union will vote with Ireland on the issue of changing the method of calculation.</P>

      <P>Notwithstanding some of the political undertones in this debate, I regard this as a constructive opportunity for the House to endorse the very strong actions I have taken.  I support anything that can be done by producers, the industry as a whole and the Opposition, in the most constructive spirit, to ensure we can present a united case so that, when we face into this meeting, we shall have a realistic appraisal of the position, put forward the best technical case, based on price convergence, thus ensuring we maintain maximum sheep output.</P>
      <P>I wish to say categorically to sheep farmers that there are cyclical difficulties in that sector but we must take the long-term view.  I want to provide a series of measures, Council measures, market measures through the APS, income measures through the rural community, through the premium itself.  I will continue to pursue all those objectives.  We will deal with the quality issue, with the strategic approach through An Bord Bia.</P>

      <P>This debate is particularly important not only for the large numbers of our farmers involved in sheep production but for our agricultural industry and economy as a whole.</P>
      <P>The importance Fianna Fáil attaches to the need to introduce urgent measures to help the sheep sector is demonstrated by the fact that our party spokesman, Deputy Cowen, tabled this thoughtful, positive motion.  The Fianna Fáil Party decided this issue was of such importance it should devote its limited Private Members' time this week to this issue.</P>
      <P>Serious problems have confronted the sheep sector for some time, but unfortunately the Minister's efforts to address and successfully tackle those issues have been negligible.  Where is the Minister's much trumpeted claim of almost a year ago that the difficulties of this industry would be confronted and overcome? The days of announcing and recycling good news press releases of developments that took place before the Minister took office must come to an end as reality dawns on some commentators and interest groups.</P>
      <P>The Minister's policy for the past ten months has been that good news is the sole prerogative of the current Minister and to address the difficult issues by inferring they were caused by the previous Minister.  That public relations strategy has a short life span, but sadly it is too long for the different sectors which are not being helped by the Minister and his Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil Party realises the contribution the sheep meat sector makes to the economy as it represents 5 per cent of agricultural output. Obviously, the income difficulties of <Col N="2048" /> sheep farmers need to be addressed.  We must not continue to discourage sheep production.  A decline in the numbers involved in sheep production would lead inevitably to fewer applicants to participate in EU schemes, such as the ewe premium scheme, and would constitute a loss of income to the country, income available to us through a transfer of resources from the EU.</P>
    <P>The An Board Bia study launched over a month ago demonstrated clearly the drop in income sheep farmers have experienced during 1995.  Allied to that has been the severe reduction in the ewe breeding flock with the serious follow-on consequences of falling volume and output that will confront us in future.  For some time, farmers in this sector have highlighted the difficulties. Hard working farmers do not take to the streets of Dublin for the fun of it, but only when genuine grievances arise.</P>
    <P>Farmers in my county, particularly north west Cavan, have stressed the difficulties due to the poor prices obtained by producers in the April to July period of this year &mdash; a 15p drop in one week alone.  Under present circumstances those farmers cannot see themselves making up those losses in the short-term. They also indicated to me the severe losses incurred in the spring of 1994 and the spring of 1995 during the lambing season.</P>
    <P>Realistic and attainable proposals have been put forward which, if implemented, would help considerably to alleviate the cash crisis facing many farmers.  There is general agreement the calculation of the ewe premium on an individual country basis would be to our benefit and would constitute fair play.  If this mechanism of calculating the ewe premium is not attainable, a top-up premium mechanism is necessary.  The gap between Irish prices and the EU average justifies an £8 per head ewe premium top-up.  The anticipated convergence of EU lamb prices has not <Col N="2049" /> materialised.  Surely there is every justification for changing this scheme.  If one of the basic aims of any scheme, in this case the ewe pension scheme, is not attained there is an undeniable case to change it.</P>
    <P>Another anomaly that needs to be addressed is the method of calculating the extensification premium with sheep being included for stocking density but excluded for payment purposes.  Deputy Cowen outlined earlier other policy changes which are necessary and attainable. Particular difficulties may face the farmers in lowland areas but we must not ignore the difficulties facing those in the disadvantaged areas.</P>
    <P>In the area I represent the vast majority of farmers involved in sheep production have small holdings and can ill afford to face continuing losses.  The decline in the number of farmers involved in this sector and the drastic drop in ewe numbers will have serious consequences for rural areas.  If the present unsatisfactory situation is allowed to continue the loss of income from the sheep meat sector will be disastrous. We need action from the Minister now.  It cannot be delayed until 1996.</P>

      <P>When I listened to the Minister I thought he was a lovely man, but if that is the attitude he is to take in negotiations he will be eaten up. Platitudes are all very well but not when it comes to making deals.  If the Minister admits there is a problem and cannot face up to it there will be serious repercussions for sheep farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to sheep prices I agree the early lamb producer has been hardest hit.  From speaking to some of the farmers in Donegal &mdash; not all of them are early lamb producers &mdash; I am aware that many of them have not even made the price of the meal they need to feed the lambs.  With a 15 to 20 per cent decrease in sheep prices a serious problem is developing.  I hope the Minister <Col N="2050" /> and his colleague on the back benches are aware of it.</P>
    <P>We are at a competitive disadvantage, being the only country in the EU without a land link to the EU.  We have a unique case to make in the EU with regard to transportation costs and consequent price problems.  I agree with the proposal for an £8 per ewe top-up.  If that is not accepted by the Commission another solution will have to be found. Given the number of solutions the Minister has put forward over the last year I cannot see why the matter has not been resolved.  He told the IFA and many others the matter would be sorted out. I would like to see the Minister coming up trumps now.  The Minister should tell us whether he can sort out the matter. If he does not enter negotiations strongly he will not have a hope.  The Minister asked for our support and I am sure all Members would be supportive if the Minister could produce a deal.</P>
    <P>I have a bee in my bonnet about other issues related to the sheep industry.  The Minister mentioned the farmers' charter which was supposed to make everything rosy.  With the farmers' charter everybody would get their premia in time, there would be no problem with the area aid payments and there would be somebody to answer the telephone day and night.  That is not the reality.</P>

      <P>The problem is that the Minister does not know about it. When we answer the telephone in our offices we get complaints about people not being able to contact the area aid offices, that a mess was made of the area aid scheme this year, that those involved did not know the differences between lowland and hill farmers and, as a consequence, people were not paid in time. The matter has been addressed but to say that everything is rosy in the Department of Agriculture, Food and <Col N="2051" /> Forestry is erroneous.  It is high time the Minister faced reality&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>In my opinion it was wrong to eliminate compulsory sheep dipping.  I know pressure was brought to bear by people who have private dipping baths to remove compulsory sheep dipping, but I can categorically say it has not improved matters and there had been an increase in scab.  We need to look again at this issue.  We used to have disease free status in regard to scab but things have changed and we should consider reintroducing compulsory sheep dipping.</P>
      <P>A wool premium of £4.80 is payable in disadvantaged areas; I think it should be available throughout the country. Will the Minister consider it?  Farmers are in financial difficulties.  I whole-heartedly agree with the introduction of an £8 premium.  The matter needs to be addressed as soon as possible as 1996 may possibly be too late for some farmers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen:</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to support the laudable efforts of my colleagues to draw attention to the serious crisis in the sheep sector.  I compliment them for raising this matter in an effort to ensure that effective action is taken.  The Government amendment is extremely worrying and clearly the Minister and the Government do not realise the extent of the crisis.  If they think they have addressed it, they are very much mistaken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The facts speak for themselves.  Farmers are deserting the sheep sector in droves&mdash;over 5,000 have left sheep <Col N="2052" /> farming since 1992 and the lucky ones left it before this year because 1995 has been truly disastrous.  The appalling drop in lamb prices could destroy many farmers and the Government must not continue to ignore their plight.  Unfortunately, these real individuals face financial ruin because of the price collapse. Farmers must have profitable enterprises if they are to have an income to live on.</P>
    <P>What is all too often dispassionately referred to as farming profits is nothing of the sort for most people but is the pay packet which must feed and clothe the farm family.  It is very difficult for the vast majority engaged in agriculture to rear a family on the level of income available to them.  There are few profitable farming enterprises and in 1995 sheep farming was not one of them.</P>
    <P>For those engaged in sheep farming the expectation of an income to which they quite rightly aspired is barren and unfulfilled.  Some people are under extreme financial pressure.  They have good cause to fear that their reward for hard work and substantial financial outlay will not be the income for which they budget but massive losses and in the worse case scenario, financial ruin. No Government can afford to stand idly by when that is facing a very important sector in Irish agriculture but unfortunately it is what is staring many farmers in the face.</P>
    <P>The real tragedy, as has been pointed out by so many speakers and very eloquently by the IFA, is that action can be taken which will redress the balance in favour of Irish farmers.  The existing ewe premium can readily be topped up to provide a realistic subsidy to make up for losses in the marketplace, and this was its original function.  This was done successfully by the former Minister, Deputy Joe Walsh, in 1992.  In fairness, Deputy Yates went to great pains to outline his own efforts at Council of Ministers level but these efforts must be redoubled to ensure that short-term <Col N="2053" /> measures are introduced to alleviate suffering in the sheep sector.  I believe it can be done and all it requires is the effort and commitment of the Government to advance the case strongly enough.</P>
    <P>The facts are plain to be seen &mdash; it is a matter of selling the case to the other Ministers.  The IFA called for an emergency ewe premium of £8 per ewe to offset the unprecedented lamb price collapse&mdash;that is the IFA description&mdash;and for a standard method of ewe premium calculation in each country or alternatively, and perhaps more easily achieved, a top-up mechanism to be automatically put in place.</P>
    <P>In the longer term it is vital to eliminate the large price gaps between Irish, UK and French lamb prices.  The Irish price seems to trail fairly close to the English level but it trails disastrously behind the French level.  If I understand correctly, the differential in 1995 is of the order of £10 per lamb.  That is a massive price differential.  The Minister made great play of weight and quality. Of course, we must work towards achieving what is required in the marketplace but other factors are at play and while we pretend that weight and quality are the only factors, we cannot adequately address the factors that militate against Irish sheep farmers. Until the Government recognises that, it cannot begin to address the problem.</P>
    <P>We can rightly say that the quality of Irish lamb is extremely high, and the last thing we should be thinking is that it is not, because we are playing into the hands of those who are setting the price of Irish lamb at an artificially low level. Irish lamb producers are being discriminated against and that issue has to be faced up to in this country before it can be dealt with.  The pricing structure must be carefully examined.  We must not be conned into thinking that quality and weight are causing the problem.</P>
    <P>The IFA has called for a co-ordinated approach to selling by Irish exporters to France and increased lamb promotion <Col N="2054" /> by An Bord Bia.  This is within our power but it is something we have not been doing effectively.  We have ducked and weaved away from the price differential between sterling and the punt and have done everything but addressed the issue.  We have advanced every excuse but have taken no action.  The Minister for Tourism and Trade &mdash; whom I sometimes have the opportunity to question &mdash; always transfers the matter to the Minister for Finance &mdash; perhaps he is right because he cannot deal with it &mdash; but it must be dealt with because it is causing hardship.  Besides the farmers and those directly involved in agriculture as sheep farmers there are consequences for butchers and a huge number employed in meat factories.  This has also to be faced up to.  A catastrophe is facing the Irish sheep industry and it will have far-reaching consequences. We need to recognise what these will be and address them.  The Minister has taken some action at European level. He urgently needs to have successes there, and to have the position in regard to New Zealand addressed at European Commission level.</P>

      <P>The Kerry Diabetic Association was formed in 1984 for the purpose of helping diabetics to help themselves and to represent as a group the interests of Kerry diabetics.  It was with this in mind that they started a campaign to have facilities provided for their members at Tralee General Hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no dedicated diabetic clinic in Kerry to cater for an estimated 2,500 diabetics.  While the two general clinics at Tralee General Hospital cater for all types of illness, there is a diabetic clinic in Cork Regional Hospital.  It is the stated policy of the Irish Endocrine <Col N="2055" /> Society to have diabetic clinics set up in general hospitals throughout the country.</P>
    <P>On 15 December 1992 the Kerry Diabetic Association met the management of Tralee General Hospital to discuss the situation.  The idea of a multi-risk factor clinic was proposed by the hospital management who stated that all consultants would have to agree with the proposal.  Although the establishment of a diabetic clinic remained the ultimate objective of the Kerry Diabetic Association they were, nevertheless, willing to agree to the multi-risk clinic as a first step.  In August 1993 correspondence was received from the general hospital in Tralee stating that there was no progress to report on the setting up of a diabetic clinic as the hospital consultants had not agreed.  The matter was again raised in 1994 at a meeting of the Southern Health Board and the reply at that stage seemed to close the door on the matter as far as the diabetic patients in Kerry were concerned.</P>
    <P>For this reason I appeal to the Minister to give this worthy cause his personal attention and make the necessary funds available.  I appeal to the Government to set up, through the Southern Health Board, a diabetic clinic at Tralee General Hospital.</P>

      <P>Diabetic in-patient services are provided in Tralee General Hospital by the two general physicians employed in the hospital.  Diabetics requiring out-patient services attend one of the two medical clinics held weekly in the hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The establishment of a specialist diabetic clinic at the hospital is a matter to be determined by the Southern Health Board in the context of competing priorities for patient service developments. I understand that the board is conscious of the demand for a specialist diabetic clinic in Tralee.  However, it <Col N="2056" /> would require the attendance of a consultant diabetologist and additional support staff such as a dietician, an ophthalmologist and a chiropodist.</P>
    <P>The board has confirmed that a consultant endocrinologist with a specialist interest in diabetes mellitus is to be appointed shortly to Cork University Hospital.  This consultant appointment, which the Department approved on 6 January 1994, will allow the board to expand the number of specialist diabetic clinics which it provides at present in its area.</P>
    <P>The board has indicated that it proposes to discuss the question of the provision of a diabetic clinic in Tralee with the new consultant endocrinologist in the context of planning diabetic service developments for the immediate future.</P>

      <P>The upgrading of the section of the road network between Newry and Dundalk has been sought for some time.  Substantial development of the road network between Rosslare and Larne has taken place and it is one of the key desires of our EU masters that we should put in place a proper road structure between Larne and Rosslare. This has received priority funding.  At the same time £80 million has been allocated to the upgrading of the railway link between Dublin and Belfast.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, we on this side of the Border have been concentrating on the road network from Dublin to the Border. Work on the Balbriggan bypass is about to start, and the Dunleer bypass has been completed.  Later this year, or early next year, work on the continuation of that bypass will commence and bring the motorway to the Border.  On the northern side of the Border there is motorway for a considerable distance, from Larne to Newry.  However, it appears that the powers that be are determined that the road between Newry and Dundalk will remain as a single carriageway.</P>

      <Col N="2057" /> All public representatives and the various bodies North and South have highlighted the need for this to be given priority.

One of the major recommendations of that conference was that priority should be given to the planning of a motorway between the towns of Newry and Dundalk.</P>

Mr. Séamus Mallon said that the Minister responsible in the North, Mr. Malcolm Moss, had said in Newry some time ago that the British authorities were not prepared to upgrade the road between Newry and Dundalk to motorway status, although what is called the Newry bypass is nearing completion. This will not link the motorways north and south of the Border.</P>
    <P>At the penultimate plenary session of the British-Irish Inter-Parliamentary Body in Dublin the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs indicated that officials of the Department of the Environment and their counterparts in Britain had agreed, in the short term, to examine ways of upgrading the existing carriageway and, in the long term, to commission a study on the matter. Neither Séamus Mallon nor I was satisfied with that response; we felt it was another way of putting the matter on the long finger.</P>
    <P>Since then the two Governments have responded to the British-Irish Inter-Parliamentary Body.  The Irish Government more or less reiterated what the Tánaiste stated six months previously and the British response was rather negative, indicating that it was not within their plans to co-ordinate with <Col N="2058" /> the Irish Government to build this short link between a major motorway on the Southern side of the Border and Newry. The British response is disappointing.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister will tell me the matter is to be dealt with by the Anglo-Irish Secretariat, but that is not acceptable. British foot-dragging has been the hallmark of the peace process in the past year; there has also been foot-dragging in what would be a practical way of uniting the people of this country and assisting Border areas which have suffered more than most as a result of the violence.  I urge the Minister to raise this matter at the highest level.  As the building of this link route would not cost a great deal of money, all the necessary avenues for obtaining EU funds should be considered.</P>
    <P>While I welcome the upgrading of the Dublin-Belfast rail link at a cost of £80 million, which will shorten travelling time between Dublin and Belfast by 20 minutes, the upgrading of the road structure between Newry and Dundalk would cost a great deal less.  I ask the Minister to use his good offices and to up the ante to provide this road link.</P>

      <P>On behalf of my colleague the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Howlin, I welcome this opportunity to place on the record details of the progress which has been made in improving cross-Border road infrastructure.</P>
      <P>A little more than 12 months ago, more than 110 cross-Border roads were subject to closure orders and physically impassable, while there had been little or no tangible progress in resolving issues relating to the Dublin-Belfast road.  This position has now been substantially reversed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the Dundalk to Newry road, Minister Howlin met with his Northern Ireland counterpart, Malcolm Moss, MP, in February last, and agreed a two-stage approach.  Short-term measures will be implemented to improve the safety and capacity of the existing road, taking account of the completion both of the New Dundalk <Col N="2059" /> inner relief road and the final section of the Newry by-pass.  A report on measures to meet this commitment will be finalised by the end of this month and the immediate and speedy implementation of its recommendations will be pursued.</P>
    <P>However, this can be only an interim step.  As a consequence, it was agreed at the ministerial meeting last February to commission a study of route options to provide a long-term solution to transportation needs over this section of the Dublin-Belfast road.  This study will take account of environmental factors, the completion of major projects, such as the Dunleer to Dundalk motorway, and investment priorities elsewhere on the route.</P>

      <P>A brief for the study has been agreed and a public notice was placed in the daily papers last week inviting consultants to indicate their interest in undertaking this study.  In parallel with this an application is being finalised jointly with the Northern Ireland authorities seeking assistance towards the cost of the study from the newly created Trans-European Network Financial Instrument.  To develop the terms of reference, select consultants and oversee progress, a joint project board has been established between the two Administrations.  Consultants are expected to be appointed to undertake the study by February next and the report should be available by year end.</P>
      <P>What is being considered here is a major project, some 16 km in length, travelling through two jurisdictions.  It is vital, therefore, that all route options are properly assessed and adequate groundwork laid for the subsequent planning and design stages and public consultation.  This will, of course, take time and that is why short-term measures have also been agreed to address traffic needs in the interim.</P>

      <P>The Dundalk-Newry route is, of course, only one of a number of issues in relation to cross-Border roads where significant progress is being made.</P>
      <P>Another strategic route which is important to cross-Border traffic is the A5-N2 Derry-Omagh-Ballygawley-Monaghan-Ardee road which links Donegal and the western counties of Northern Ireland to Dublin.  While traffic volumes on this road are modest, improvements are necessary to relieve congestion at certain points and to provide overtaking opportunities at others. On the A5, work near major towns such as Omagh and Strabane, and schemes to improve sight lines and provide climbing lanes on a number of inter-urban sections, have been completed. Improvement works on the N2 have been completed at Aclint, south of Carrickmacross, at Broomfield, Castleblayney, and at Corlatt near Monaghan, and are under way at North Road, Finglas.  A link from the N2 to the N1 motorway is planned at Ardee and, in the light of that, future improvement of the N2 will focus on the section north of the Ardee link and particularly on by-passes of towns such as Carrickmacross and Castleblayney.</P>
      <P>A large number of local roads which crossed the Border were closed until late last year due to closure orders.  On foot of the decision of the northern authorities to remove these orders, liaison arrangements were quickly set up to co-ordinate necessary works on both sides of the Border and, as a result, significant progress has been made in reopening these roads.  There are 113 Border crossing points on public roads &mdash; including the N3 which is cut at Aghalane Bridge &mdash; which had been the subject of closure orders.  At this stage, almost all have been fully reopened to traffic on both sides of the Border except for a small number where more extensive works are necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the construction of Aghalane Bridge, the only national road <Col N="2061" /> cut by the troubles, the broad outline of the works and financing for this project have been agreed.  Preliminary design work is now in hand and it is expected that construction will commence in 1996.</P>
    <P>On behalf of Minister Howlin, I assure the House that excellent progress has been and is being made in relation to cross-Border road development, and we can look forward to the continuation of this progress.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom buíochas a ghabháil leatsa an t-ábhair seo a chur os comhair na Dála anocht.</P>
      <P>I refer to the rapidly growing development of Gaelscoil Adhamhnáin in Letterkenny.  It has become increasingly evident that the growth in schools such as this outside the Gaeltacht is the best thing that has happened to the Irish language since the foundation of the State.  The fact that this has not been imposed by the Government is most significant; it originated in communities throughout the country and deserves our wholehearted support.  With all due respect to the Minister present, I regret the Minister for Education is not here to reply to this question.  I trust this is not an indication of her disinterest in Gael-scoileanna.  These schools deserve the wholehearted support, financial and otherwise, of the Department of Education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This phenomenon is not the product of small groups of Gaelic fanatics who <Col N="2062" /> regard the speaking of the Irish language as the ultimate achievement in education. It goes much further.  It has been well established that children who become bilingual at an early age have a marked advantage over those who do not have that opportunity.  Such an advantage generates a much more lively mind, capable of being much more receptive to learning generally.  This includes a greater capacity to absorb other languages.  That is a further important factor in view of the very cosmopolitan world in which we live.</P>
    <P>Letterkenny is a major growth centre in Donegal and continues to attract workers from other parts of the county, including the Gaeltacht areas on the west coast.  It is vital that people from these areas find themselves in a community where their native language is encouraged and their children receive their primary education through that medium.  Parents who are currently queueing up to enrol their children in Gaelscoil Adhamhnáin are to be highly commended.  I say this because of the rather primitive conditions that must be endured by teachers and pupils alike.  If the present position is allowed to continue we will have a generation of children who will be forced to say that they never had the benefit of a proper primary school.</P>
    <P>Gaelscoil Adhamhnáin opened five years ago.  It now has 144 pupils whose accommodation consists of two double prefabs in the carpark of the local vocational education committee offices and one further classroom in the basement of that office building.  The toilet facilities are by no means adequate. Since the carpark is used by the vocational education committee staff the children have no proper playground.</P>
    <P>A few weeks ago the Department made an offer of £80,000 for a site which it regarded as highly suitable for a new school.  The site had been valued at more than £100,000 but the owners were persuaded by the school committee to accept the lower offer so that there would be no excuse for holding up the development.  They promptly accepted <Col N="2063" /> the offer and are awaiting a signed contract. The local contribution has been collected and the local urban district council has assured those concerned, including the Department, that the site will have the necessary services such as water, sewerage and so on.  The Department's architect, Mr. Shepherd, is familiar with the conditions at the school.</P>
    <P>In view of the waiting list, the number of pupils in the school, which has six teachers, is expected to increase rapidly. There is no way next year's class will be provided for under present conditions. I appeal to the Minister to ensure the necessary provision is made in the forthcoming Estimates so that this most important facility becomes a reality with the greatest possible speed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht (Mr. Carey) Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht (Mr. Carey)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht (Mr. Carey):</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Deputy has given the Minister for Education the opportunity of outlining to the House the Department of Education's current position regarding Gaelscoil Adhamhnáin, Leitir Ceanainn.  The school has a current staffing level of principal and five assistant teachers with an enrolment of 144.  In September of this year, an additional teacher was appointed to the school in recognition of its developing status.</P>
      <P>The Department of Education provided temporary recognition as a primary school to Gaelscoil Adhamhnáin on 30 August 1991.  The Deputy will be aware that all primary schools are accorded provisional recognition to allow them time to establish their viability.  This has indeed been proven by Gaelscoil Adhamhnáin.  Accordingly, the Department of Education was pleased to grant permanent recognition to Gaelscoil Adhamhnáin on 24 August 1994.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since its inception the school has been based in temporary accommodation in the grounds of the vocational <Col N="2064" /> education committee.  The Minister is aware that conditions are not ideal. Consequently, the question of providing permanent suitable accommodation is being actively pursued.  The Minister is pleased to say that an acceptable site was identified recently and the Department's offer of £80,000 has been accepted by the vendor.  The contract of sale submitted by the vendor's solicitor has been furnished to the Chief State Solicitor's office for necessary action. The contract is, of course, subject to planning permission being available on the site.</P>
    <P>The Minister would like to assure the Deputy that the procurement of a site for this school is a matter of priority.  In order to meet the immediate accommodation needs of the school, the Department has arranged for the provision of a double prefabricated classroom.  In addition, grant aid was recently sanctioned towards the cost of refurbishing a vacant classroom in the vocational education committee premises to accommodate the increasing enrolment.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that discussions with the Department of Finance in regard to next year's budget are currently in progress and the allocation of funds for the primary buildings capital programme for next year will not be finalised for some time.  Consequently, the Minister is not in a position at present to give any guarantee that a project will go ahead on the proposed site in 1996.  However, the Minister accepts the urgency of the case and fully appreciates the concerns of the school authorities and parents of pupils at Gaelscoil Adhamhnáin and is conscious of the need to resolve the accommodation difficulties at the school as soon as possible.  The Department will communicate with the school board of management when the legal procedure of securing the site has been completed.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 8 November, 1995.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. <Col N="1786" /> Howlin):</NameTxt>
      <P>The essential repairs grants scheme is administered by local authorities in accordance with the Housing (Disabled Persons and Essential Repairs Grants) Regulations, 1993.  Subject to these Regulations, it is a matter for each authority to determine whether a grant can be paid in an individual case.</P>
      <P>The 1993 Regulations redefined the circumstances under which grants were payable.  I understand, however, that the changes made in 1993 may have led some authorities to take an unduly strict interpretation of the terms of the scheme in relation to the location of houses which could benefit.  In the circumstances, my Department has recently written to local authorities clarifying that essential repairs grants may be paid where:</P>
      <P>&mdash;the occupier is approved for local authority housing;</P>
      <P>&mdash;the house cannot be made fit for human habitation in all respects at a reasonable cost, but the repairs proposed will prolong the useful life of the house; and</P>
      <P>&mdash;there would be no continuing demand for local authority housing at the location of the house in respect of which the grant is sought.</P>
      <P>Subject to compliance with these requirements, a local authority may pay an essential repairs grant in respect of a house in any area.  Generally speaking, however, I would expect that only a small number of cases in built-up areas could comply with the regulations.</P>
      <P>In circumstances where an essential repairs grant cannot be paid for a house in a built-up area, it would be open to the local authority to consider the use of the scheme of improvement works in lieu of local authority housing, if the requirements of that scheme are fulfilled.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 33, 46 and 55 together.</P>
      <P>All of the elements of the driving test, which is an integral part of any programme of driver training, are regulated by, and consistent with, EU requirements. I have already indicated that a review of the driving test system is being carried out and that this will, as a minimum, lead to significant changes in the theory element of the test; in accordance with EU requirements, these changes must be in place by July of next year.</P>
      <P>While section 18 of the Road Traffic Act, 1968, gives the necessary statutory power to regulate the business of driving instructors, I have no proposals at this stage to activate this section.  I have, however, met the two national associations representing motor schools and driving instructors who, in association with the Irish Insurance Federation, are developing a scheme of voluntary registration of instructors which will include provision for the training and independent examination of instructors.  The intention is that learner drivers who complete a course of instruction will qualify for a reduction in insurance premiums.</P>
      <P>I have emphasised to the organisations concerned that I am anxious that the voluntary register is put in place as quickly as possible.  At a later stage, in the light of experience of the operation of the voluntary scheme, I will review the necessity for more formal regulation of driving instruction.</P>

      <P>I will take the Deputy's two questions, which are related, together.</P>
      <P>The Government has received copies of the 1993 report of the United Nations Human Rights Committee to the 48th session of the United Nations General Assembly.  The human rights committee is the body charged with considering national reports on measures adopted and progress made in achieving the observance of the rights enshrined in the international covenant on civil and political rights.  Ireland ratified the covenant on 8 December 1989 and presented its first national report at a public hearing in Geneva, 14-16 July 1993.  The human rights committee expressed its satisfaction with the high quality of the report and the constructive dialogue which it had with the high-level Irish delegation led by the then Attorney-General.  The committee raised some concerns about Ireland's implementation of the covenant, as is usual when it considers the report of a state party.</P>
      <P>The comments adopted by the committee at its meeting of 28 July are reflected in a document issued on 3 August 1993.  The committee's consideration of the examination of Ireland's initial report under the convention is contained in the human rights committee's subsequent annual report to the United Nations General Assembly's 48th session.  Neither the Government nor any of its representatives have made approaches to the United Nations Human Rights Committee to discuss the committee's comments.  While the comments have been kept under review by the relevant implementing Departments, it is not the normal practice for states parties to maintain a dialogue with the committee.  The second national report, which is currently under preparation, will take into account the comments of the committee on Ireland's first national report in 1993.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring):</NameTxt>
      <P>When Ireland established diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China in 1979, the <Col N="1802" /> Irish Government recognised the Government of the People's Republic of China as the sole legal Government of China.  The Chinese position at that time was and still is that China included Tibet.</P>
      <P>In relation to Tibet, a central concern of Government policy has been and remains the respect for and protection of the human rights of Tibetans.  In this context, I raised the Tibetan situation with the Chinese Vice Premier and Foreign Minister, Qian Qichen, during our discussions on 6 October on the occasion of his visit to Ireland.  I referred to the strength of public opinion in Ireland and other EU countries about the situation there and raised a number of important points of concern.</P>
      <P>At the UN Commission on Human Rights this year, Ireland, together with our EU partners, co-sponsored a draft resolution on the situation of human rights in China, which indicated concern at &ldquo;the inadequate protection of the distinct cultural, ethinc, linguistic and religious identity of Tibetans and others&rdquo;.  In the event this draft resolution was defeated by the narrowest of margins.</P>
      <P>Through diplomatic channels we have also raised the question of the effect of population transfer of Han Chinese to Tibet with the Chinese authorities.  The Government will continue to monitor closely the situation in Tibet and do what we can to ensure that the human rights of Tibetans are respected.</P>

      <P>Ireland signed the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child during the World Summit on Children in September 1990 and ratified it on 28 September 1992. The convention entered into force for this State on 28 October 1992.</P>
      <P>Ireland's first report on implementation of the convention on the Rights of the Child became due two years after the entry into force of the convention. Because it is the first such report, preparation has involved entensive co-ordination work with all of those Departments which are concerned in any way with the welfare of children.</P>
      <P>In all, 14 Government Departments and Offices have been contacted in relation to the report and have prepared material.  I expect that the report will be finalised, brought before Government and submitted to the Committee on the Rights of the Child in the coming months.</P>
      <P>A consequence of the ratification of a number of UN human rights instruments in recent years is that the State has undertaken a permanent and continuing obligation to submit, at regular intervals, comprehensive reports on the implementation of their provisions.  In relation to the preparation and compilation of the present report, my Department has been in contact with the secretariat of the Committee on the Rights of the Child and has informed it of the progress being made in the matter.</P>
      <P>The Committee on the Rights of the Child encourages Governments to consult non-governmental organisations active on behalf of the child.  In this respect, my Departments, in association with other relevant Departments, has initiated a process of consultation with the NGO community to determine areas of concern to them regarding the implementation of the convention.  The purpose throughout has been to ensure that the preparation of the report benefits from the widest possible range of views on this important topic.</P>

      <P>The special EU support programme for peace and reconciliation in Northern Ireland and the Border counties provides for a new five-year Community Initiative, with funding of 300 MECU or IR£240 million approximately allocated for the first three years, 1995-97, of the initiative. The Initiative is designed to complement existing EU and national programmes and the funding provided is entirely additional.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Northern Ireland and the Border counties will receive respectively, a <Col N="1805" /> maximum of 80 per cent and a minimum of 20 per cent of the total funding.  For the six Border counties of Cavan, Donegal, Leitrim, Louth, Monaghan and Sligo this will amount to EU funding 60 MECU.</P>
    <P>In the overall programme five priority areas were identified for support namely; employment; urban and rural regeneration; cross-Border development; social inclusion and productive investment and industrial development. The allocations in monetary and percentage terms to the priority areas identified are detailed in paragraphs 3.26 and 3.27 of the operational programme adopted by the Commission on 26 July 1995.  The arrangement and procedures for the disbursement of financial assistance are also set out in the above operational programme.</P>
    <P>A copy of the operational programme was sent to all Oireachtas Members in the Border region shortly after its adoption. A copy has also been lodged in the Dáil Library.</P>

      <P>The present arrangements relating to civil servants and political activity are as follows: (a) civil servants are not permitted to stand for election to either House of the Oireachtas or to the European Assembly.  This restriction applies to all categories of staff; (b) civil servants in the industrial categories and in the manipulative, sub-clerical and manual grades are free to engage in political activity, subject to the general restriction in relation to parliamentary elections; (c) members of the clerical grades in the Civil Service and civil servants in non-manipulative grades with salary maxima equal to or below the clerical officer maximum may apply for permission to engage in politics on the same basis as the staff referred to at (b) but officers employed on particular types of work may have their applications refused; (d) all civil servants above clerical level are totally debarred from engaging in politics.  However, at a <Col N="1810" /> meeting of the Government held on 11 July 1985, it was decided (ref. S6177D) that personal assistants and special advisers in Minister's offices are to be exempt from the present arrangements covering State employees and politics.</P>
      <P>On the assumption that the person referred to in the Deputy's question is serving in a grade above clerical level, his or her position is covered by the arrangements at paragraph (d) above.</P>

      <P>The Government's approach to carbon energy taxation is set out in the policy agreement, <i>A Government of Renewal,</i> which states that the Government will <Col N="1812" /> contribute to the preparation of a pan-European taxation policy on carbon and fossil fuel inputs.</P>
      <P>In this regard, the Government has already decided in June 1993 that Ireland should not oppose the principle of the introduction of an EU carbon/energy tax, provided that, <i>inter alia,</i> our concerns regarding the competitiveness of EU industry generally and of energy intensive firms that face competition from non-EU firms that are not subject to similar charges were satisfactorily addressed.  The European Council, meeting in Essen last December, noted the Commission's intention of submitting guidelines to enable each member state to apply a carbon/energy tax on the basis of common parameters if it so desires; the Council of Economic and Finance Ministers was instructed to consider appropriate parameters.  This approach is in contrast to previous efforts to establish a mandatory EU wide regime in this area.</P>
      <P>The Commission has now presented proposals in the matter.  They propose that a framework would be put in place to allow member states who wish to have such tax the opportunity to do so but no member state would have to charge the tax during a transition period up to 2000.  However, at the end of the transition period, the Commission proposals envisage the tax being applied by all member states.  These proposals are now being examined by Ireland, along with other EU member states.</P>

      <P>There is a statutory obligation on persons who receive a taxable inheritance to present a self-assessed tax return to the Revenue Commissioners within four months of receiving the inheritance.  In computing the taxable value of the inheritance, certain expenses attributable to it, including, for example, the beneficiary's proportion of probate tax paid, may be deducted.  The tax is payable on the inheritance only in respect of the excess above a tax-free threshold. In this case, provided that the beneficiary has not received any prior inheritances or gifts from any source, the current threshold is £23,760.  The relevant legislation allows the Commissioners to deal with cases of hardship and such cases are viewed on their individual merits in the light of all the circumstances of the beneficiary.  In that regard, the Commissioners will give full consideration to the case when the tax return is presented to them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn):</NameTxt>
      <P>The budget deficit normally referred to in Ireland is the Exchequer borrowing requirement.  This is a cashflow measurement which identifies the extent to which the Central Fund's current and capital expenditure is not matched by tax revenue or other receipts.  The shortfall is met by borrowing. The table on page 98 of the 1995 Budget Booklet sets out the derivation of the EBR outturn for 1994 and of the forecast for 1995.</P>
      <P>The Maastricht treaty sets out specific budgetary performance criteria for participation in stage 3 of European Monetary Union.  Briefly, the primary tests envisaged are first an annual deficit of no more than 3 per cent of GDP &mdash; except in exceptional circumstances; and second a gross debt/GDP ratio of no more than 60 per cent, unless the ratio is &ldquo;sufficiently diminishing and approaching the reference value at a satisfactory pace&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>To ensure comparability across member states the deficit and debt are defined in a Protocol to the Treaty as relating to `General Government'.  This is further defined in EU Regulation 3605/93/EC as relates to a national accounts conecpt applied by member states under the second edition of the European system of integrated economic accounts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main differences between the general Government deficit and the EBR are that the GGD: includes all local authority, including health agencies and vocational education committees, and non-commercial State body transactions, not just those financed by <Col N="1817" /> the Exchequer; accounts for certain transactions &mdash; where data is available &mdash; on an accruals basis rather than on the cash transactions affecting the EBR eg. Telecom/An Post pension fund liabilities and equal treatment primary benefit payout; excludes loans and share capital transactions with commercial State bodies such as equity transactions, or privatisations; excludes some one-off transactions that can affect the EBR in a particular year, e.g. winding up of the land bond fund; and the GGD is presented as a ratio of GDP, whereas the EBR is usually presented as a ratio of GNP.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): Under the dental health action plan the key aims of the public dental service, as outlined in the national health strategy, are being implemented on a phased basis.  The action plan provides for the phased improvement of primary and secondary care orthodontic treatment through the development of consultant-led orthodontic services.  A total of six consultant orthodontists with support staff have already been appointed to health boards.  In addition a consultant orthodontist has been appointed to the national cleft palate unit at St. James's Hospital.</P>
      <P>In addition to his/her own direct clinical involvement, each consultant orthodontist is required to organise and co-ordinate training for health board dental surgeons in the provision of orthodontic treatment.  This will achieve a high service level at a high standard. Orthodontic treatment for some milder cases can be provided at primary care level by health board dental surgeons who are competent and who have access to consultant advice and cover.</P>
      <P>In 1994, under the initial phase of the action plan, an additional £1 million was provided to health boards for an additional ten dental support teams for the consultant orthodontists.  This year I approved the appointment of an additional two consultant orthodontists and five dental support teams in the Eastern Health Board.  The board has recently advertised the two consultant appointments through the Local Appointments Commission.</P>
      <P>The planned development of the orthodontic service and the availability of more dentists trained in orthodontics will lead to a significant improvement in the availability of services.  However, the Deputy will appreciate that the demand for orthodontics services is very great and while every effort is made to respond quickly to the more severe cases there is a waiting list for less serious cases.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Currie):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 98 and 99 together.</P>
      <P>The standard rate of allowance payable in respect of children by health boards is £44.20 per child per week and £54.80 per week in the case of children over 16 years of age.  Health boards are free to pay higher rates of allowances in particular cases, for example, where a child is disabled or has other special needs.  Health boards also provide a range of additional payments to cover items such as medical, school and clothing expenses.</P>
      <P>Health boards have, in the past, assisted in placing a small number of children with relatives who had not been approved as foster parents where this was considered to be in the best interests of the child.  As no foster care allowance was payable in such cases, the relatives in question received assistance under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.  I understand that the amounts paid in these instances depended on the circumstances of each case.</P>
      <P>This unsatisfactory arrangement is being regularised under the provisions of the Child Care Act.  The Child Care (Placement of Children with Relatives) Regulations, 1995, which came into operation on 31 October last, provide for the payment of allowances to relatives who have children placed with them by health boards in accordance with the regulations.  The standard rate of allowance will be the same as that payable to foster parents and a similar supplement will be payable in respect of children over 16 years.  Health boards may also pay higher allowances to relatives in certain circumstances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): I recognise fully the important role speech therapists play in the provision of services for all people with speech and language difficulties, including children with hearing impairments and am concerned that appropriate and adequate speech therapy services be available.</P>
      <P>The Eastern Health Board has increased its complement of speech therapists from 28 to 61 since 1990 in recognition of the need to develop services in this area, including special services for children.  In regard to St. Joseph's School for Deaf Children in particular, the board has recently initiated a pilot speech therapy service for those children who have received a cochlear implant.  It is intended that this pilot service will help to identify the long-term need of these children and others in similar circumstances.  The board is aware of the special skills speech therapists require to provide an effective service to deaf children and is examining the issue of training speech therapists in dealing effectively with deaf people.</P>
      <P>As I have informed the House on previous occasions, I am concerned about the adequacy of speech and language therapy services generally and regard the expansion of such services as a priority.  Accordingly, I am pleased to report that nearly £300,000 of the £2 million additional revenue funding provided this year for the development of services for people with physical or sensory disabilities was allocated for speech therapy services.  The Deputy will appreciate that in the light of competing demands for development of other services for people with physical and sensory disabilities, improvements in the speech and language therapy services can only come about on a phased basis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> The report of the review group on the ambulance service, which was published in November 1993, made 74 recommendations, addressing in a comprehensive way major policy issues in the ambulance service.</P>
      <P>The review recommended the establishment of the National Ambulance Advisory Council to ensure that uniform standards of service would operate throughout the country so that the development of the Irish Ambulance Service would keep pace with best international practice.  The council was established in July 1994 and since then has played a major role in implementing the recommendations of the review group.</P>
      <P>The council has now recommended improved standards of training for new and existing ambulance personnel, a new specification for emergency ambulances and a standard equipment list for emergency ambulances.  I have accepted the standards recommended by the National Ambulance Advisory Council and these have been published in recent weeks.</P>
      <P>To enable health boards to meet the recommended standards, I have, this year, allocated £2.5 million for ambulance improvements.  The total extra resources committed to the ambulance service since the publication of the report of the review group in 1993 now amounts to £4.5 million.  These funds have enabled health boards to purchase approximately 100 new ambulances nationwide over the past two years as well as making considerable progress towards the recommendation that each emergency ambulance should be staffed by two trained ambulance personnel.  I hope to be able to continue to provide funds to enable the boards to continue this progress in 1996.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1825" /> Particularly significant progress has also been made in implementing the recommendations of the review group in the important area of cardiac care. Public education and training in bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation has commenced and almost all ambulances are now equipped with defibrillators. Pilot projects to evaluate the use of advisory defibrillators in general practice areas where emergency ambulances are not immediately available have also been initiated.  Progress has also been made in centralising ambulance service command and control arrangements in each health board area.</P>
    <P>Overall, very significant progress has been made in the implementation of the report of the review group over the past two years.  I am committed to maintaining progress towards the implementation of all outstanding recommendations over the coming years.</P>

The Midland Health Board received approval for the recruitment of 63 additional staff in 1995.  The 63 additional posts were related to specific prioritised service developments in the board's area.</P>
      <P>The board does not accept that the present nurse staffing difficulties represent a crisis.  Additional nursing staff have already been employed in the acute hospitals this year.  However, it accepts that there is a need to examine staffing levels in the light of an increase in activity in some areas of the acute hospitals.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 112 and 113 together.</P>
      <P>The most important initiative that has been taken to reduce the incidence of child abuse and neglect is the Stay Safe Child Abuse Prevention Programme. The aim of this programme is to prevent all forms of child abuse by equipping parents and teachers with the knowledge and skills necessary to protect the children in their care.  Children are also taught safety skills in the normal classroom context and these skills are reinforced through discussion with their parents.  This approach increases community awareness and makes children less vulnerable to abuse of all kinds.  The Stay Safe Programme is currently being implemented in primary schools throughout the country with the active support of the Departments of Health and Education and the health boards.</P>
      <P>With regard to the promotion of positive parenting a number of community based child care services incorporate elements aimed at improving parenting skills.  The outcome of such programmes has been shown to enhance the overall well-being of child and improve family relationships.  By building self-esteem and developing good patterns of communications within the family, these programmes encourage parents to exercise control over their children without resorting to corporal punishment.</P>

      <P>The Government is firmly committed to the full implementation of the Child Care Act at the earliest possible date. As the House is aware, I recently made an Order bringing 44 sections of the Act into operation on 31 October last.  These form the bulk of the legislation and include key sections dealing with the protection of children in emergencies, care proceedings and the powers and duties of health boards in relation to children in their care.</P>
      <P>These provisions greatly strengthen the powers of the courts, the health boards and the gardaí to intervene to protect children from abuse and neglect. It is my intention to bring the remaining provisions of the Act into operation next year.  These relate to the supervision of pre-school services and the registration of children's residential centres.</P>

The main development <Col N="1830" /> that has occurred in the meantime has been the commencement of the 44 sections of the Child Care Act that I have already mentioned.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of additional resources, I would point out that a sustained programme for investment in child care services has taken place over the last three years.  Since 1993, additional funding of the order of £30 million on an annualised basis has been provided to develop child care and family support services and to strengthen the capacity of the health boards to meet the demands of the new legislation.</P>
    <P>The Child Care Action Plan, 1995, which I launched last July provided for a wide range of service developments including&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash;The creation of some 342 additional posts for the child care services.  This brings to over 850 the total number of new posts created in the child care services since 1993.</P>
    <P>&mdash;The expansion or assessment and therapeutic services for the victims of child abuse.</P>
    <P>&mdash;The provision of additional accommodation and supports for homeless youngsters.</P>
    <P>&mdash;The establishment of new special care units catering for children who are out of control.</P>
    <P>&mdash;The development of locally-based helping services to assist families in difficulty.</P>
    <P>&mdash;Increased financial support for voluntary groups providing services for victims of family violence. </P>
    <P>I am conscious of the fact that much work remains to be done to attain the standard and quality of child care services that we all desire.  I will, with the support of the Minister for Health, be seeking additional resources for child care in the Estimates for 1996.</P>

        <i>Limerick East):</i> Difficulties in the provision of accident and emergency services in Dublin, especially over the winter period, have faced successive Ministers for Health for quite some time.  Up to now these difficulties have been dealt with by providing mainly once-off solutions.  The solution of Dublin's accident and emergency difficulties can only be solved through a series of measures, both short-term and long-term, which must be co-ordinated and integrated.  I propose tackling a number <Col N="1832" /> of areas including services for the elderly, services for the chronically disabled and services provided by the acute hospitals which, when taken together, will provide a comprehensive response.</P>
      <P>I am at present visiting the major Dublin hospitals to discuss with them a number of important policy and operational issues, including their accident and emergency service.  Admission and discharge policies are among the issues being examined by hospitals with a view to better utilisation of available beds.</P>
      <P>As part of the co-ordinated approach to the problem, the Eastern Health Board will undertake a detailed study to examine the functioning of the six major Dublin hospitals with particular regard to bed utilisation, bed management and the relationships with the accident and emergency departments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> I propose to take Questions Nos. 122 and 124 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1836" /> The Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990, assigns responsibility for the inspection of nursing homes to health boards.  Articles 23.1 to 25.3 of the Nursing Homes (Care and Welfare) Regulations, 1993, give health boards power to inspect nursing homes and premises believed to be nursing homes.</P>
    <P>Under the Act all nursing homes are obliged to register with a health board. Before placing a nursing home on the register, the health board must inspect the home to ensure it conforms with the required standard of staffing, accommodation and design.  The regulations require the health boards to inspect all homes at least once every six months. The boards may visit at more frequent intervals where this is felt necessary.  If a nursing home does not comply with the regulations, the health board may attach a condition to the registration that the problem be resolved, may refuse or revoke registration or may prosecute the proprietor.  In certain conditions, the health board may assume the management of the home.  The regulations also introduce, for the first time, a formal complaints procedure whereby a health board must investigate complaints received about a nursing home.</P>
    <P>At 30 September 1995 a total of 344 private and voluntary nursing homes had been registered by the health boards.  Of these a small percentage, namely 3 per cent, has been found to be in breach of the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990, and the Nursing Homes Regulations, 1993.  One nursing home was refused registration by the Eastern Health Board for non-compliance with the Act and its decision was upheld in the District Court.  The Midland Health Board has assumed temporary management of a nursing home in its area.  The Western Health Board has prosecuted two nursing homes which were convicted and fined for breach of the Act and the regulations. The Southern Health Board is currently investigating a nursing home for alleged breaches of the Act.  I do not think it would be appropriate to name particular nursing homes at this stage as <Col N="1837" /> some of the breaches are currently under investigation by the relevant health boards and it would not be proper of me to comment on what are essentially health board functions. However, I assure the Deputy that the health boards view any breach of the Act and Regulations in a very serious light and all complaints are investigated without delay.  The health boards inform me that, where breaches have been identified, the nursing home owners concerned, in general, have co-operated fully in meeting the standards laid down by the Act and regulations.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): With the elderly population set to rise, there is a need to provide some additional health board long-stay places.  While the waiting period for admission to a long-stay unit is quite short in some areas, there are undoubtedly problems in others which need to be addressed now and this is being done.  I announced during the summer my commitment to a capital programme over the next few years which will improve long-stay health board care facilities for the elderly in each of the eight boards.  I perceive this as one of a number of priorities which must be addressed within the capital programme on a sustained basis, until the identified needs for additional and improved accommodation have been met.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In line with the recommendations of the report &mdash;<i>Planning for the Future</i>&mdash;<Col N="1839" /> which has been accepted as policy in mental health by successive Governments, the Eastern Health Board has been developing a comprehensive range of community-based psychiatric services. Prior to discharge each patient is assessed individually to assess his-her psychiatric needs together with his-her personal strengths.  Following assessment, a specially designed programme of rehabilitation is drawn up for each individual patient.</P>
    <P>In 1981, St Brendan's Hospital transferred patients from ward 4 of that hospital to the Weir Home, since then it has been used as a ward of St. Brendan's. The hospital is at present focusing on the rehabilitation of the residents there to prepare them for transfer to community-based living, taking into account individual patient need and personal wishes.</P>
    <P>The premises in Cork Street is being considered by the board as a location of a community drug centre.

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> I am aware that voluntary organisations are concerned at the delay in issuing grants for 1995 for the respite care scheme and the scheme of grants to voluntary organisations. Earlier this year, my colleague, the Minister for Social Welfare, and I reviewed areas where there was an overlap between our two Departments and decided that these grants schemes would be administered in the future by my Department.  The health boards were notified in June 1995 that in future they would be responsible for operating the schemes.  The criteria to be applied by the boards in considering applications under the schemes are the following; grants may be allocated to community-based projects under the headings; mental handicap services, physical disability services, psychiatric services, child care services, women's refuges, personal social services &mdash; including information and counselling services; at least 80 per cent of the block grant should be allocated to local voluntary groups; grants from the block allocation should not be used in substitution for section 65 grants, and particular care should be taken to ensure that grants are made available only to viable schemes which will be completed within a reasonable period and, in determining priority of schemes, an assessment should be made of any on-going revenue implications.  Priority should be given to once-off projects which would have no continuous revenue implications for health boards.</P>

      <Col N="1843" /> Medicinal products are provided free of charge to persons covered by medical cards under the General Medical Services &mdash; GMS &mdash; scheme.

    <P>With regard to Epipen, no application has yet been received by the National Drugs Advisory Board for a product authorisation.

      <P>The recent Ministerial Conference, &ldquo;Environment for Europe&rdquo;, which was held in Sofia, Bulgaria, endorsed the pan-European <Col N="1848" /> biological and landscape diversity startegy which was drafted for it by the Council of Europe.

      <P>The person referred to in the Deputy's question, party &ldquo;A&rdquo;, has claimed compensation for loss of water rights in respect of property forming part of the towpath of the Shannon-Erne Waterway.  I understand that the Commissioners of Public Works have already paid compensation to another party, party &ldquo;B&rdquo;, in respect of this stretch of the canal bank.  In establishing his entitlement to compensation in respect of this part of the canal <Col N="1849" /> bank, party &ldquo;B&rdquo;, through his solicitor who is also acting for party &ldquo;A&rdquo; furnished an affidavit in which he stated, <i>inter alia,</i> that for the past 33 years and upwards he had been in sole and exclusive beneficial occupation and possession of the property and was not aware of any incumbrance affecting the property or part thereof.</P>
      <P>The affidavit appears to be in clear conflict with the claim of party &ldquo;A&rdquo; to have a right of access over the property. The solicitor was requested by the Commissioners of Public Works, by letter dated 22 February 1995, to clarify by what title party &ldquo;A&rdquo; claimed to have had access to water from the canal.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding subsequent exchanges of letters on this matter, the solicitor has not yet produced any licence or other documents in support of the claim by party &ldquo;A&rdquo; to title or rights over the property.  To date, the claim by party &ldquo;A&rdquo; for compensation for loss of access to water from the Shannon-Erne Waterway is based solely on an assertion by him that he has such access across land in respect of which party &ldquo;B&rdquo; has already claimed and been paid compensation. It was on this basis that I replied to Parliamentary Question No. 113 on 20 September 1995.</P>
      <P>The advice of the Chief State Solicitor in relation to the various aspects of this case has now been sought and, on receipt of that advice, further contact will be made with the solicitor acting for the parties.</P>

      <P>Relief for investment in films under section 35 of the Finance Act, 1987, as amended, expires for individuals on 5 April 1996 and for companies on 31 March 1996. The section 35 incentive is currently under review by independent consultants appointed by me in consultation with the Minister for Finance.  Their conclusions will contribute to the decisions on budgetary policy in this area for 1996 and thereafter.  Therefore it is too early yet to anticipate whether any changes will be made to the scheme.</P>
      <P>It would be inappropriate for me to speculate or comment upon any policy measure in this area which might be taken by the British Government.  The Irish film industry is founded on a solid base involving a range of incentives notably our section 35 scheme and I am confident that it will continue to compete successfully in the international marketplace.</P>

      <P>I can assure the Deputy that I share his concern for the protection of Dublin's heritage.</P>
      <P>I have seen newspaper reports of the statement by the national chairperson of An Taisce to which the Deputy refers. It appears that this was made in the context of the allocation of European Union funding.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that local authorities also have responsibilities relating to the built and natural heritage and it may be that the issues he has in mind would be more appropriate to them.  For my part, the protection afforded by the National Monuments Acts and the Wildlife Act is and will continue to be applied as and when required; it is also my policy to promote continued co-operation between the national monuments and historic properties service and the national parks and wildlife service and the local authorities for the protection of the heritage.  The local authorities have a vital role to play in relation to the preservation of all of Dublin's heritage, through their planning and development process, in addition to their powers under the National Monuments Acts.</P>
      <P>The strategies for the protection of the heritage are of course, subject to ongoing review within my Department, in consultation with the Department of the Environment and other relevant bodies.</P>

      <P>The statutory restriction in place regarding the importation of wild animals, including wolves, into the State are set out in (a) the Wildlife Act, 1976 (Control of Importation of Wild Animals and Wild Birds) Regulations, 1989 (S.I. No. 296 of 1989); (b) Council Regulation (EEC) No. 3636/82, as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No. 558/95, on the implementation in the Community of the provisions of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of wild fauna and flora (CITIES); and (c) the Rabies Orders 1972-1976.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The regulations at (a) are designed to regulate the importation of wild species which, if released into the wild, may have an adverse effect on our indigenous wildlife habitat or species.  Importation is prohibited without a licence <Col N="1853" /> from my Department and each case is examined on its merits.</P>
    <P>The regulations at (b) impose restrictions on the international trade in endangered flora, fauna and their products. Listed wild wolf Canis lupus species on which restrictions in relation to international trade operate include the common, grey or timber wolf.  Importation of a listed species requires either an import permit or a certificate, as appropriate.</P>
    <P>The importation of wolves and other wild animals is also subject to the granting of an import licence by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry under the Rabies Orders, 1972-1976.  An appropriate period of quarantine would form part of the licence requirements.</P>

      <P>Works at Blackrock Lock, Drumshanbo, have been completed and Lough Allen will be opened to cruiser traffic early next year.  With careful management of water levels in the lake it will be navigable during the cruising season.  The co-operation of the Electricity Supply Board, which has statutory authority to control water levels in the lake, will be particularly important in this regard.  My officials are seeking an early meeting to discuss the matter.  It is not considered economically justifiable or environmentally desirable to design a scheme to cater for a navigation throughout the complete range of water levels currently pertaining in Lough Allen.</P>

      <P>I understand it is the practice to have weekend voting at elections in all EU states other than Denmark, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and this country.  Under our electoral law, the polling day at each election or referendum is appointed by order made by the Minister for the Environment in accordance with and subject to the constraints specified in the particular electoral code.  It is a matter for decision on each occasion which day of the week should be appointed for taking the poll. While it has been the practice to hold elections and referenda on a Thursday, the poll at the forthcoming referendum will be taken on Friday, 24 November. The question of weekend voting is one of a number of electoral matters which I have referred for consideration to the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs.</P>

      <P>Responsibility for improvement and maintenance works on non-national roads in County Meath is a matter for Meath County Council; such works are financed from the council's own resources, supplemented by State grants.  Total grant allocations to the county council in 1995 for these roads amount to £4.18 million, an increase of £564,000, or 16 per cent, on the corresponding grant payments figure for 1994.  The discretionary grant allocation of £1.958 million to the council this year includes a sum of £400,000 for supplementary improvement works in recognition of the special needs of the county.  I allocated an additional £20 million to county councils last July to initiate the special restoration programme for non-national roads.  Meath <Col N="1857" /> County Council's allocation of £982,000 under this programme included a sum of £425,000 in recognition of the special needs of the county.</P>
      <P>It will be clear from the foregoing that the grant allocations already made have in fact taken account of the special needs and circumstances of counties such as Meath.  I will notify local authorities as soon as possible of their grant allocations for 1996, including the grants under the special restoration programme.</P>

      <P>A draft directive amending the 1985 EU Directive on Environmental Impact Assessment was published by the European commission in May 1994. The European Parliament adopted an opinion on the proposal last month and recommended a number of amendments to the Commission's proposal. The draft Directive was also the subject of a policy debate at the Environment Council meeting held on 6 October last. The Council instructed that work continue on the proposal, in the light of the Council's discussion and the Parliament's opinion, with a view to the adoption of a common position at the Council meeting in December.  When adopted, the Council's position will have to be referred back to the European Parliament.  The draft directive is unlikely, therefore, to be formally adopted before the middle of next year.</P>

      <P>The Local Government Act, 1991 introduced a disqualification for dual local authority/Oireachtas membership in the case of Ministers and Ministers of State.  The Local Government Act, 1994 updated and consolidated the law generally on disqualifications for local authority membership. It extended the range of disqualifications to include, <i>inter alia,</i> members of the European Parliament, the holders of certain senior Oireachtas positions&mdash; Ceann Comhairle, Cathaoirleach of the Seanad and chairpersons of certain committees&mdash;and also excluded Oireachtas Members from the position of local authority cathaoirleach.  Under that Act, these disqualifications come into effect for the purpose of the next local elections in 1998.  At this point, there are no proposals to further extend <Col N="1869" /> the range of disqualifications which apply as regards the dual mandate. However, the matter will be kept under review in the light of the ongoing local government reform programme.</P>

      <P>While the need to tax motor vehicles arises at least once a year, most driving licences are renewable only once in ten years.  It is not feasible under the existing system to issue reminders when licences are expiring.  However, a national computerised licensing file is being developed on a phased basis and will be completed in 1999.  This will facilitate the issuing of notices to licence holders whose licences are due for renewal.</P>

      <P>In October 1995, my Department invited all local authorities to submit applications for funding in 1996 under the EU co-financed scheme of grants for improvement projects on non-national roads which are of economic benefit and which help to generate employment.  On foot of this, it is now open to local authorities, including Kerry County Council, to submit proposals to my Department for specific projects, including projects of benefit to tourism, having regard to the EU eligibility criteria which apply. Apart from these grants, I do not intend to make special grants available for specific non-national road projects in 1996.  Instead, I intend that, as in recent years, the available funds will be made available through block grants, leaving it to the local authorities to decide the specific projects to be undertaken.</P>

      <P>Learning about the European Union is a cross-curricular theme in our schools.  Apart from subjects which have an obvious European dimension &mdash; modern continental languages, civics, history, geography, music, art, economics, business studies &mdash; there <Col N="1871" /> are subjects which can provide further opportunities to reinforce the EU awareness of young people.  Irish and English, for example, are facets of a wider Europen linguistic and cultural organism.  The sciences and mathematics have been enriched and developed by European co-operation.  The home economics programme extends to areas such as consumer affairs, cuisine and fashion; these have a European and, indeed, a wider focus.</P>
      <P>My Department and the Office of the European Commission, Dublin are at present supporting the development of a major project to encourage and assist schools to teach about the EU in the transition year programme.  The significance and substance of the project can be gauged from the initial aim which is to produce a general module on the European Union of 30 hours duration and five extension modules of 15 hours each which schools may choose to use in the transition year programme. Development of the modules is to be supported by a resource pack of work books and video.  In addition, existing material available through the EU will be reviewed and its suitability as support material assessed.  Among the features of the modules will be materials on the origins, development and philosophy of the European Union.  This module will be available for introduction into schools in 1996.</P>
      <P>Léargas &mdash; the Exchange Bureau &mdash; runs various EU Programmes on behalf of my Department and prepares two publications for circulation to schools free of charge:</P>
      <P>(a) <i>Schools Newsflash</i> this publication offers information on all the programmes available to schools, closing dates for applications etc.  It is published three times a year.</P>

The video will be available to schools.  (ii) A major historical research project based on the records of the Poor Law Unions has been initiated.  The publications resulting from this will be available for local research and as material for textbooks.  In addition my Department has decided that an essay competition on famine related topics will be held in 1996 at three levels: (a) senior primary; (b) junior cycle second level and (c) senior cycle second level.

      <P>During the current year, 1995, ten additional psychologists have been recruited by my Department in order to improve access to psychological services in schools.  In assigning these additional psychologists to schools, priority has been given to primary schools serving disadvantaged areas.  In any future development, the needs of schools, and of children, in particular areas, including County Donegal, will be borne in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Data available to my Department from sources such as the report of the Special Education Review Committee (1993) do not enable a conclusion to be reached in respect of the average age of identification of specific disabilities.  The availability of psychological services to schools is one of the factors which need to be taken into account in working towards identification at as early an age as possible.  Others include the provision of in-career development of teachers in areas such as observation and assessment skills, the availability of remedial and other specialist teachers, stronger school-home links and the availability of the school health service, which is a matter for the Department of Health and its agencies.  The report of the Special Education Review Committee, to which I have referred, does suggest <Col N="1879" /> that there is some variation between regions and areas in terms of access to certain services which would assist in the early identification of learning disabilities. Such variation will be kept in mind as services are improved.</P>

      <Quest>the reason a school (details supplied) in Dublin 20 is not included in her Department's programme for the provision of sports halls and gyms in view of the fact that the school was a priority case in 1987 when construction of a sports hall was deferred due to financial constraints; the reason other schools have been given greater priority than this school, which has the same student numbers as in 1987; if she will review the situation; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>Because of limited capital resources, it is not possible to provide PE halls in all schools which have applied for these facilities over the years.  The decision to include certain schools in the 1995-96 capital programme was taken as a result of detailed studies into all the applicants' particular cases, taking account also of educational requirements.</P>
      <P>The question of providing a PE hall at the school referred to by the Deputy can only be considered in the context of the capital available for post-primary building purposes generally.  Because of the huge demand for additional classroom accommodation in schools throughout the country, I am not in a position at this stage to say when a PE hall will be provided in this particular case.</P>
      <P>However, the Deputy can be assured that, should financial circumstances permit, the school will be given every consideration.</P>

The plans are currently being assessed and I expect that this task will be completed within the next fortnight.  My Department will then make contact with the <Col N="1881" /> school authorities.

    <P>Apart from the general costs of operating the primary school system and the salary costs of the special teacher allocation referred to above, my Department also grant-aids the provision of specialised equipment for special needs pupils who are integrated into ordinary primary schools.  In 1995, a sum of £150,000 has been allocated for this purpose.</P>
    <P>Capitation funding is intended to contribute towards a school's operating <Col N="1886" /> costs such as heating, lighting and general maintenance.  The funding is allocated on a per pupil basis.  The level of such costs in the case of a special school are generally similar to those in an ordinary school.  However, as special school classes have lower pupil numbers, it is necessary that the rate of capitation per pupil be correspondingly higher to meet the costs in question.  Where special equipment needs arise, they are met out of the separate special fund referred to above.</P>
    <P>I do not accept that the approach to designated schools set out in the White Paper is in breach of EU and UN Resolutions.</P>
    <P>The White Paper recognises that all students, regardless of their personal circumstances, have a right of access to and participation in the education system, according to their potential and ability.  It is the policy of my Department to seek to facilitate the maximum possible level of integration of special needs children, including children with physical disabilities, into mainstream schools.  However, it has to be recognised that the severity of the disability in some cases may be such as to warrant placement in a dedicated or special facility.</P>
    <P>The objective is to ensure a continuum of provision ranging from occasional help within the ordinary school system, to full-time education in a special school or unit, with students being able to move as necessary between different types of provision.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Deputy that the right of parents to opt for integrated education for their children will be fully respected.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Education</askee>
      <Quest>when she intends to reply to a letter of 21 June 1995, from Deputy Bree seeking information on her Department's major sporting facilities programme; the reason her office has been incapable of responding to the letter in the intervening three month period in view of the fact that she acknowledged receipt of the letter on 6 July 1995, Ref Educ 2634/95S; her views on whether this type of response is acceptable; if she will introduce procedures to ensure that standards are improved and brought up to the level of other Government Departments; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Ms Bhreathnach):</NameTxt>
      <P>The major sports facilities programme, introduced by Government in 1988, now comprises 115 projects and the total grants allocated to <Col N="1890" /> date under this programme amount to £33.426 million.  The present position is that 56 projects have been completed, 24 are under construction and the remainder are at various planning stages.  Total expenditure to the end of 1994 amounted to £23 million with the balance of £10.426 million to be funded in 1995 and in subsequent years.  Grants are paid on foot of architects-engineers certificates as building work proceeds and when the grantee organisations have met the terms and conditions of the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 1995 allocation of £4.1 million for this programme is being expended on these projects as construction work is undertaken.  The projects approved for funding in 1994 and the projects in respect of which grants have been paid to date in 1995, as requested by the Deputy, is outlined in the following tabular statement.  I am arranging to forward to the Deputy a copy of the 1994 annual report <i>Sport in Ireland</i> which <Col N="1891" /> includes details of all grants allocated since 1988 under the major sports facilities programme.</P>
    <P>The delay in furnishing the information sought by the Deputy was due to pressure of work in the sport section <Col N="1892" /> of my Department in administering the capital programmes involving some 650 existing projects and some 1,500 new applications in addition to processing the resultant large volume of representations following the decentralisation of the section to Tullamore.</P>

      <Quest>if her attention has been drawn to the fact that a number of children attending St. Michael's national school, Glenfarne, County Leitrim, are collected by the school transport service each day and dropped at a car park adjacent to the old Rainbow ballroom, Glenfarne; if her attention has further been drawn to the fact that the children are obliged to remain in the car park unsupervised for a period of 20 to 30 minutes before they are again collected by the school transport service and transported to St. Michael's school; if her Department will accept responsibility for the safety of the children for the period when the children are left alone, unsupervised and without shelter in the car park; the proposals, if any, she has to improve this service; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Ms Bhreathnach):</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware there are two feeder services involved in the school transport service to Glenfarne national school.  These are operated by a contractor's minibus from both sides of the mountain to the old Rainbow ballroom, as the roads are too narrow for a large bus.  These services facilitate the children, some of whom live as close as 0.3 miles to the Rainbow ballroom.  The shorter feeder trip of 1.1 miles is operated first every morning and evening, as the waiting time would be greater if the longer trip of 1.4 miles were operated first.</P>
      <P>My Department cannot, of course, accept responsibility for the safety of the children for the period in question.</P>
      <P>There is no viable alternative arrangement within the existing network of vehicles, and because of the narrow roads in question.  Other pupils would be inconvenienced by any alteration to the present system and the standard of service for the children in question would deteriorate.</P>

      <P>The allocation for both primary and second level schools are being used to cover the full year costs of improvements made to the scheme in September 1994 and to reduce the qualifying enrolment with effect from September 1995.  In the case of primary schools the allocation is being used to cover the full year costs of improvements made to the scheme in September 1994 and to reduce the qualifying enrolment for these grants from 350 to 250 pupils with effect from September 1995. Under this latest extension to the scheme an additional 36 primary schools in the Dublin area will receive grant assistance.</P>
      <P>As any expansion of the scheme undertaken in September 1995 at second level would have funding implications for 1996, the full extent of the expansion will not be finalised until the budgetary position for 1996 is known.  I will advise the Deputy of the position as soon as the matter has been decided.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the difficulty to which the Deputy refers.</P>
      <P>The individual in question is attending the Brothers of Charity adult workshop in Lota, Cork.  Overall responsibility for transport arrangements to this facility rests with the Southern Health Board and I have arranged for the matter to be brought to the board's attention.</P>
      <P>For some time now, transport on an incidental basis has been made available to the individual in question on a school transport route.  This arose because there was space on the service in question.</P>
      <P>However, earlier this year this school bus service was reorganised to facilitate pupils attending special schools in Cork. As a result of this, the service no longer passes the home of the individual in question and, in order to avail of transport on an incidental basis, he now has to travel to a pick-up point near his home.</P>
      <P>Also, due to an increase in the number of pupils availing of the reorganised school bus service on Mondays and Fridays, there is no space on the bus for the individual in question on Monday mornings and Friday evenings. However, transport on an incidental basis continues to be available Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday of each week.</P>

      <i>Notes:</i>
    </P>
    <P>The figures show that almost all students entering veterinary Medicine qualify.  Differences in the number of graduates in any one year and the entrants five years previously can be attributed to a number of causes:</P>
    <P>(i) non-completion of courses; this is small in the case of veterinary medicine,</P>
    <P>(ii) taking a &ldquo;year out&rdquo; which would lengthen the time taken to completion,</P>
    <P>(iii) repeating a year, having failed an earlier year.  This would lengthen the time taken to completion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen):</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 241, 242 and 243, which are related, together.</P>
      <P>The legislation for which my Department has responsibility in the area of censorship is the following: the Censorship of Publications Acts, 1929 to 1967 (as amended); the Censorship of Films Acts, 1923 to 1992; and the Video Recordings Act, 1989.</P>
      <P>These Acts provide for censorship of books, magazines, films and video recordings respectively.  The task of censorship is carried out by the Censorship of Publications Board in relation to books and magazines and by the film censor in relation to films and video recordings.  The legislation contains certain rights of appeal against decisions to prohibit the publication of any book, magazine, film or video.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In accordance with the provisions of the relevant legislation, the various boards and the film censor are independent in the exercise of their functions. <Col N="1905" /> They are empowered to carry out their role by the respective Acts governing censorship in that area and I, as Minister for Justice, am not empowered, in any way, to vary any of their decisions in relation to censorship.  I can confirm to the Deputy that I have not introduced any specific changes nor issued any specific instructions on the administration of the relevant legislation to any of the boards or boards of appeal or to the film censor.</P>
    <P>As regards international human rights obligations, the UN Human Rights Committee, in a generally favourable report on Ireland's implementation of the Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, has questioned certain aspects of our censorship laws in the light of the provisions of the convenant.  I have taken note of the issues raised by the Human Rights Committee and these will be addressed in the context of Ireland's second report on the covenant, which is due to be submitted to the UN in 1996.</P>
    <P>As regards the Deputy's reference to obscene libel, the position is that the Law Reform Commission report on The Crime of Libel is under consideration at present with a view to the submission of proposals to Government.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware, it is not the practice for the Minister for Justice to make statements to the House about the progress of specific Garda investigations except in singular instances <Col N="1906" /> where the circumstances of an investigation are so exceptional that such a course is deemed to be appropriate and, accordingly, I do not propose to make any further comment on the matter at this stage.</P>
    <P>With regard to crime in Limerick, I am assured by the Garda authorities that the Garda is taking all reasonable steps to deal with the matter.  With regard to the most serious crime &mdash; murder &mdash; I am informed that five murders have been committed in Limerick city since August 1994 and that charges have been brought in all of these cases.</P>

He is due for release, with remission, on 24 January 1996.  To date he has been approved for one weekend temporary release for re-socialisation purposes, from 20 to 23 October 1995 when he returned on schedule.  This release was granted subject to several conditions, including good behaviour and the stipulation that he report to the gardaí each day.  Until this parliamentary question was put down, neither my Department nor the local Garda authorities were aware of any suggestion that the prisoner had misbehaved during his weekend temporary release.</P>
      <P>I have asked that the matter be further investigated.  No further temporary releases will be considered for this prisoner in the meantime.</P>

    <P>The position in relation to the cleaning of Garda stations is that where cleaners are not employed directly, contract cleaners are used.  I regret that, in the time available and because of the large number of Garda stations involved, it has not been possible to assemble the detailed information requested by the Deputy in relation to this area.  I will, however, convey the information to the Deputy by letter as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>My Department has not initiated contracts with any courier firms this year.</P>

    <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the present deployment of the Force within the Galway West Division is, in their judgment, the best possible in terms of providing an appropriate level of Garda service to the area.  I am further informed by them that the question of filling the remaining vacancies in the division will be fully considered in conjunction with the needs of other divisions throughout the country when additional manpower becomes available.</P>

      <P>I have been informed by the Garda authorities that since 9 October 1995 the station referred to in the question is open from 8 a.m. to 12 midnight daily. A telephone call diversion system and a radio system are in operation at the station whereby persons calling at or telephoning the station when it is unmanned are automatically put through to the district headquarters. Moreover, the district radio system allows for direct radio contact with both the patrol car and members on foot patrol with personal radios in the area referred to in the question.</P>
      <P>The Garda authorities are satisfied that the reduction in opening hours at the station concerned has enhanced, rather than reduced, the effectiveness of operational policing in the area.  The new arrangement ensures that the maximum number of gardaí are available for outdoor policing duties at night in the area instead of being confined to the station on largely administrative duties.</P>

      <P>There are 116 bank accounts held by Garda Síochána with the following banks: AIB Bank, Bank of Ireland, Ulster Bank and National Irish Bank. These are current accounts under the control of the district officers (superintendent rank) and are known officially as public bank accounts.  They facilitate the payment of local day to day expenditure through an imprest account and provide for the receipt of public moneys in respect of firearm certificates, weights and measures etc. Included in the above is a bank account operated by the parking fines office in O'Connell Street, Dublin to facilitate the collection of parking fines.</P>
      <P>All of the above bank accounts are made available for audit.  A total of 56 accounts were audited in 1994 by officers attached to my Department's internal audit unit.  All of the 116 bank accounts held by the Garda Síochána have been audited since 1990.  I am unable to say how many of these accounts have been audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General's office as his office does not come within my area of responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Instructions in relation to bank accounts held by the Garda Síochána are included in the Garda Síochána code which was last revised in 1994.  This is an internal confidential Garda publication and contains very detailed instructions relating to all accounting procedures in the Garda Síochána including the operation of public bank accounts.  These instructions are aimed at ensuring the safe custody and control of public funds in the Garda Síochána and specify that cheque signatories should be the district officer or an officer or inspector acting as a replacement for him.  In all cases the instructions require that the finance officer in my Department is notified of the name of the officer or inspector authorised to operate the public bank account, giving <Col N="1918" /> two specimens of the signature of such officer or inspector.</P>
    <P>I should also maintain that, in addition to the bank accounts already referred to, it is necessary from time to time to open accounts in countries where Garda contingents are serving on United Nations missions.  These accounts are operated by the head of the contingent in accordance with the instructions contained in the Garda Síochána code.  The transactions on these accounts are monitored by my Department's finance division.  At present, there are three such accounts in operation in Cyprus, Western Sahara and Zagreb.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 268 and 269 together.</P>
      <P>Information relating to rent and mortgage supplements on a health board basis prior to 1994 is not available. This type of information was provided for in 1994 following the introduction of a new system for the collection of data relating to the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The system is fully operational in seven health boards and the North-Western Health Board compiles similar statistical data from its own computer <Col N="1922" /> system.  Details of the number of rent and mortage supplement cases payable in each of the health board areas for the year 1994 and for the first six months of 1995 are shown on the attached tabular statement.</P>
    <P>There is a tendency for the total number of cases recorded per annum to be overstated because of the high level of transience among rent supplement recipients in particular.  A person in receipt of supplement who moves to a different district is recorded as a new case.  Accordingly, the average &mdash; mean &mdash; level of supplement calculated on the basis of annual expenditure divided by the total number of cases is not reliable.</P>
    <P>However, specific research on average rent supplement levels was carried out recently in connection with the work of the review group on the role of supplementary welfare allowance in relation to housing.  A special analysis of rent supplement clients for all health board areas, with the exception of the North-Western Health Board, in the month of December 1994 found that, overall, the average rent supplement payable was £34.30 per week.</P>
    <P>Data was obtained on average rent supplements for a range of client types, distinguishing between Dublin and the rest of the country and the following results were obtained:</P>

    <P>Information relating to the median level of rent or mortgage supplement is not available.</P>
    <P>Between 1989 and 1994 total expenditure on rent and mortgage supplements increased from £7 million to £54 million. <Col N="1923" /> In September 1994 the Government established a review group to review the increasing role of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme in housing provision and, in particular, to identify the factors underlying the increase in expenditure on rent and mortgage supplements; to look at future trends; to consider the most cost effective means of assisting people on low incomes in meeting their housing needs and to identify appropriate ways of assisting tenants of voluntary housing schemes who are unable to afford the rents charged.</P>
    <P>The group is comprised of representatives of the Departments of Social Welfare, Health, Environment, Finance and health boards and local authorities.  The review group's report is nearing completion.</P>

      <Quest>the reason a person (details supplied) in County Meath has been called to a medical referee regarding disability benefit before her medical assessment and before the normal recovery period for a hysterectomy operation had passed.</Quest>

      <P>The person concerned claimed disability benefit on 6 September 1995.  The first certificate received did not refer to a hysterectomy. The cause of incapacity on that medical certificate was not such as would be considered incapacitating in the long-term and she was referred in the normal way for examination by a medical referee.</P>
      <P>Subsequent medical certificates indicated that she had undergone a hysterectomy operation and this should have led to a deferral of the medical referee examination.  However, the initial referral was inadvertently allowed to stand and the person concerned was called for an examination earlier than was appropriate in the circumstances. My Department regrets the inconvenience caused to the person concerned.</P>

      <P>It would not be possible for my Department to provide funding to this group as it is ouside the remit of any of our grant schemes.  The Government provided a relief fund of £750,000 which has been distributed by the Irish Red Cross Society on our behalf.  To aid the victims of severe flooding in south Galway and the midlands, the Government has also agreed a relocation package to address the problems of people who are effectively homeless because of the severe flooding.</P>

      <P>This issue involves lands at Choose, Whitegate, Co. Galway, ownership of which is registered in the name of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, since 1936.  My predecessor, in his letter of 15 April, 1994 stated that a detailed investigation in relation to ownership would have to be made.</P>
      <P>Inquiries have since been made with the Land Registry, with the Land Commision, with the Chief State Solicitor's Office and with the Valuation Office.  It has now been established that these lands were acquired for the ESB, in connection with the Ardnacrusha Hydro Electric Scheme.  Given that ownership had been transferred from the Minister for Industry and Commerce many years ago and no files were still on hands in my Department there was considerable delay in resolving this issue.</P>

    <P>All such property, acquired by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, is now vested in the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications <Col N="1930" /> under the relevant Transfer of Departmental Administration and Ministerial Functions Orders.

      <P>As the Deputy is aware the Government recently held a special meeting on Employment and Unemployment.  While welcoming the increase of 49,000 in the numbers at work over the last year, the Government recognised the unacceptably high level of long-term unemployment.  The Government renewed its commitment to ensuring that economic and employment growth also benefit the long-term unemployed.</P>
      <P>Consequently the Government decided to draw up and implement a comprehensive strategy embracing all policy areas with clearly defined objectives to deal with all aspects of the unemployment problem, especially long-term unemployment.</P>
      <P>A new Local Employment Service, which will have as a priority target group the long-term unemployed, is presently in the process of being set up. It is being phased in the beginning in the twelve established <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> Area Partnerships and two other areas, Clare and Kildare.  This new service will provide a specialist career path planning service incorporating guidance, counselling, access to training/education and placement in employment for long-term unemployed people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to Community Employment, this programme has been very significantly expanded over the past two years; 40,000 places are now available on Community Employment.  The programme is already making a major contribution to tackling long-term unemployment by giving practical work <Col N="1932" /> experience and training opportunities to long-term unemployed people.  For the future, a central objective will be to strengthen the progression and job outcomes for as many participants on Community Employment as possible.</P>

      <P>In accordance with the governing Regulations, assistance from the European Social Fund is paid by the European Commission in three instalments: a 50 per cent advance on the annual funding is paid at the commencement of the project; 30 per cent on certification that at least half of the 50 per cent advance has been expended; and the outstanding amount, up to 20 per cent of the total commitment, is applied for in a final claim which must be lodged within six months of the completion of activities.</P>
      <P>The amount of European Social Fund money owing to AONTAS represents the final payment to a pilot project under the NOW (New Opportunities for Women) Initiative.  Final claims in respect of all the 33 projects funded under NOW had to be completed and submitted to my Department before a final claim could be transmitted to the European commission.</P>
      <P>The final claim was submitted to the European Commission several months ago.  My Department has been in regular contact with Commission officials urging the early release of moneys for the NOW Initiative to alleviate the financial difficulties being encountered by project promoters.  Payment is expected in the near future.</P>

      <P>Specific information on the number of school leavers who had not previously held a job prior to participating on FÁS training programmes is not captured.  I would, however, refer the Deputy to the recent ESRI report &mdash;&ldquo;Evaluation of Measures to Assist Young People and the Long Term Unemployed under Objectives 3 and 4 of the 1989/93 Community Support Framework&rdquo;, which found, <i>inter alia</i>, that 89 per cent of 15-19 year olds on FÁS programmes had not held a full-time job during the month immediately prior to participation. Some 14-17 months after completing training, 40 per cent of them were in employment and a further 15 per cent of them were engaging in further training/education opportunities.</P>
      <P>Of the 12,231 school leavers who have completed FÁS training so far this year, just over 6,000 either found employment or returned to full-time education.  Data on their prior employment/other status is not available although, no doubt, the vast majority of them would have been unemployed immediately prior to taking up a training opportunity with FÁS. I should also point out that, obviously, much of the age group in question avail themselves of foundation-type training programmes.  Many would progress to specific skills training from which the placement rate in employment is much higher.  FÁS estimated that 70 per cent of participants on these programmes in 1994 obtained employment.</P>

      <P>The responsibility for the implementation of EU regulations and decisions concerning the processing of EU export refund and intervention claims, including release of securities, rests with the Intervention Agency.  The agreement of the European Commission in such matters is not <Col N="1936" /> required.  In any one year some £500 million in beef guarantees are processed without involving the Commission.  The Commission was aware of these particular guarantees being processed.  All actions of the Intervention Agency are, of course, subject to audit by the Commission Services.</P>

The inspectors' reports gave rise to some concerns, in particular, in regard to the duration of journeys to this destination, potential delays in unloading cattle on arrival, the type of cattle that are suitable for such journeys and the high temperatures and humidity experienced at certain times of the year.  Before reaching a definitive conclusion on this destination, however, I propose to authorise two further trial shipments to Saudi Arabia.  The approval will be confined to boats more <Col N="1942" /> than 90 metres in length, which can reach Saudi Arabia within ten days and which have low stocking densities.

      <P>While I am aware of the growing use of plastic wrap in making silage my Department's role is confined to encouraging good environmentally friendly farming practices.</P>
      <P>My officials advise farmers to collect and store all plastic on the farm and reuse as much of it as possible.  Plastic film used to bale silage cannot be reused and should be disposed of in approved landfill sites.  In this regard, participants in the rural environment protection scheme (REPS) operated by my Department are required to dispose of all unusable plastic in this manner.</P>

Acceptance of a later application can be considered only in a case of <i>force majeure,</i> for example where an applicant suffers illness in the period leading up to the closing date and that illness is certified by a doctor. The mislaying of forms after the closing date would not constitute adequate grounds for <i>force majeure.</i></P>

      <P>Under the Operational Programme for <Col N="1951" /> Environmental Services 1994-99 some £5.1 million is being made available to help address the serious erosion problem around our coast.  In order to achieve a best mix of works to be aided over the period of the programme, all coastal local authorities were invited to submit details of their top four protection priorities.  Projects to be aided will be chosen from the local authorities priority proposals.</P>
      <P>As I am sure the Deputy will appreciate, the total cost of all the proposals submitted far exceeds the funding available. Therefore, all coastal local authorities have been advised that there is no guarantee that any of their proposals will be aided.</P>
      <P>This year over £700,000 is being invested under the programme to aid a number of the priority works identified by the coastal local authorities.  Louth County Council is among a number of local authorities whose proposals have not been aided in 1995.  Unfortunately, there is a limited amount of money available each year and therefore only a few schemes can be aided each year.  I am aware of Louth County Council's priority proposals and I wish to assure the Deputy that there is no question of their proposals or indeed the proposals of other local authorities being ignored. The council's proposals will be considered further for aid over the remaining years of the Environmental Services Operational Programme.</P>

      <P>Dundalk Harbour Commissioners submitted a development plan involving <Col N="1952" /> investment of £5 million seeking EU grant aid from the Operational Programme for Transport.  Dundalk Harbour management were advised that the plan put forward was not considered to have met the criteria for investment set down in the Operational Programme for Transport.</P>

      <P>This proposal will be examined against the criteria for EU aid.  It must also compete for aid with a number of other port projects.  With regard to the future the harbour is of importance to the economy of the local region.  Traffic levels have fallen in the recent past.

      <P>Dundalk Harbour is one of the 12 harbours which have been identified for semi-State status under the Harbours Bill, 1995.  I consider that the new management structure provided for in the Harbours Bill, 1955, with the efforts being made to attract new business to the port, will give Dundalk Harbour the opportunity to retain and develop further its trade and contribute to the development of the economy of the local region.</P>
