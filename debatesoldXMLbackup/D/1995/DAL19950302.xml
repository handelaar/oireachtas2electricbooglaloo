      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill I am bringing before the House today sets out to honour the commitments given to the Irish people in 1992 when they voted in favour of the constitutional amendment on the freedom to give and obtain information about services lawfully available in <Col N="7" /> other states.  It reflects the appropriate balance between the constitutional rights and freedoms bearing on the question of abortion information and I hope that it will, therefore, receive the full support of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>I am conscious that aspects of the Bill have been criticised from several quite different perspectives and one of my main concerns in this morning's address will be to show that the arguments made by those opposed to the Bill are incorrect.  Some are wrong in fact, some are wrong in law and all are inconsistent with the wishes of the people as clearly expressed in 1992.</P>
    <P>It is important to remind ourselves of the background to the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Eighth Amendment to the Constitution in 1983 inserted Article 40.3.3º, which reads</P>
    <P>The State acknowledges the right to life of the unborn and, with due regard to the equal right to life of the mother, guarantees in its laws to respect, and, as far as practicable, by its laws to defend and vindicate that right.</P>
    <P>The Supreme Court decided in 1988 in the Open Door Counselling and the Dublin Well Woman Centre case and again in 1989 in the Grogan case that the dissemination of information on abortion, such as the name, address and telephone number of foreign abortion service and the method of communication with it, was unlawful having regard to Article 40.3.3º.</P>
    <P>The Supreme Court decided in 1988 in the Open Door Counselling and the Dublin Well Woman Centre case and again in 1989 in the Grogan case that the dissemination of information on abortion, such as the name, address and telephone number of foreign abortion service and the method of communication with it, was unlawful having regard to Article 40.3.3º.</P>
    <P>The Supreme Court injunction preventing Open Door Counselling and the Dublin Well Woman Centre from providing information such as names and addresses of abortion services was appealed to the European Commission of Human Rights on the basis that they were in breach of Ireland's obligations under the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.  In October 1992, the European Court of Human Rights held that Ireland was, indeed, in breach of Article 10 of the Convention &mdash; this Article <Col N="8" /> relates to freedom of expression and the right to receive and impart information.</P>
    <P>In the intervening period, as Deputies will clearly recall, the abortion issue came before the Supreme Court again in the context of the X case.  The court found that Article 40.3.3º would, in fact, permit an abortion where there was a real and substantial risk to the life of the mother which could not be avoided by any other means.  I do not propose to retrace the consequencs of that decision except in so far as they have a bearing on the present Bill, but the House is aware that the Government established a Cabinet sub-committee to deal with all the issues arising from it and that the deliberations of that sub-committee led to the three referenda which took place in November 1992.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The referendum on information sought to add the following wording to Article 40.3.3º:</P>
      <P>This subsection shall not limit freedom to obtain or make available, in the State, subject to such conditions as may be laid down by law, information relating to services lawfully available in another state.</P>
      <P>This referendum was passed by a 60:40 majority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I now want to look in detail at what the electorate had been told by the <Col N="9" /> Government about the purpose, implications and intended consequences of this amendment.  This will show clearly that the Bill which I am now proposing is precisely in line with the understanding given to the electorate at that time.</P>
    <P>In advance of the referendum, the Government Information Services issued a pamphlet which was distributed to every household in the country.  As all other Government information leaflets, it was paid for by the taxpayer.  This dealt with the key questions and answers in relation to each of the three referenda.  The details given in the pamphlet as regards the information amendment were based largely on the Heads of a Bill approved by the Government, on the recommendation of the Cabinet sub-committee which, as I have said, included Ministers Flynn, O'Connell and O'Malley.</P>
    <P>The introduction to the pamphlet explains the reason for each of the referenda.  In relation to the information amendment, it says:</P>
    <P>Previous court decisions had laid down that disseminating such information about abortion is unlawful. Following the &ldquo;X&rdquo; case, it would be lawful in cases where there is a real and substantial risk to the life of the expectant mother &mdash; but only in those cases.  The European Court of Human Rights has recently found the present restrictions to be in breach of the European Convention on Human Rights.  This will also be resolved by the amendment.</P>
    <P>The section of the pamphlet about the information amendment is relatively short.  I am going to quote it in full.  It consist of three questions and a supplied answer in each case: what will this amendment do? &mdash; It will enshrine in the Constitution that Article 40.3.3º cannot be used to limit the freedom to receive and impart information, subject to such conditions as may be laid down by law: the second question is what will it permit and not permit?  &mdash; The amendment would permit non-directive counselling but not abortion referral.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="10" /> The third question concerns what conditions will be laid down by law.  The conditions I am about to quote come directly from the Heads of the Bill which emanated from the Cabinet sub-committee of the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government:</P>
    <P>The Government has said that the legislation will permit a doctor or advice agency to give a pregnant woman information on abortion services available elsewhere, provided that counselling is also given on all the alternative options open to her.  It will not be permitted to promote abortion, or to encourage the woman to select it in preference to the other options, or to provide an abortion referral service.</P>
    <P>The legislation will also permit general factual material concerning abortion to be published in the media as long as it does not seek to promote abortion.  However, such material will not be permitted on billboards, wallposters or leaflets delivered to homes.</P>
    <P>As can be seen from what I read out, the pamphlet was crystal clear in relation to the purpose of the referendum and the legislation which would follow if the amendment was passed.</P>
    <P>In particular, it stated explicitly that the purpose of the amendment was to legalise such information as had been found to be illegal by the Irish courts, and which was now restricted in a manner which the European Court of Human Rights had found to be in breach of the convention.  Since the case before the European Court specifically related to information such as names, addresses, 'phone numbers and methods of communication with abortion services, the electorate could not have been in any doubt that the amendment covered that kind of information.</P>
    <P>The pamphlet also stated explicitly that the provision of an abortion referral service would not be permitted.</P>
    <P>The Bill is consistent with all these commitments.  I will return to some of these points later when I deal with the criticisms of the Bill which have been <Col N="11" /> made since its publication.  However, I would like to place the Bill in context and explain how it will support the Government's overall objectives in minimising the circumstances in which women seek to have abortions.</P>
    <P>The Government has decided to take a comprehensive approach to the problem of abortion.  It should be clearly understood that we have an abortion problem, and a significant one.  The last official figures from the Office of Population Censuses and Surveys in the United Kingdom show that 4,399 women who had pregnancy terminations in Britain in 1993 declared themselves to be resident in this jurisdiction. That figure alone is equivalent to almost 9 per cent of our annual live birth rate but the reality is that we do not know how many Irish women have abortions in Britain &mdash; we do not know how many choose to conceal their Irish address, and give instead the address of a friend or relative living in Britain.  The true rate may well be significantly higher than the official figures suggest.</P>
    <P>Whatever the true figure may be the fact of the matter is that each year a very considerable number of Irish women decide for one reason or another that they cannot go through with their pregnancy and travel to Britain to have it terminated.  No matter what one's perspective on abortion may be, it cannot be denied that this represents a serious problem.  I am certain that virtually everyone in the House and in the wider population &mdash; even those who would describe themselves as &ldquo;pro-choice&rdquo; in circumstances where there is an unwanted pregnancy &mdash; agree that it would be preferable to avoid the perceived need for an abortion in the first place.</P>
    <P>For the first time, an Irish Government will take on this problem in a serious way.  The policy agreement between the three parties states that, in tandem with the enactment of the information legislation, the Government will put in place research, education and <Col N="12" /> counselling with the objective of minimising the circumstances in which such high numbers of women seek to have abortions.</P>
    <P>This objective has two obvious components: first, to reduce the incidence of unwanted pregnancies; and second, to reduce the extent to which unwanted pregnancies end in abortion.</P>
    <P>The problem of unwanted pregnancy, ending in abortion, is not particular to any age group, despite the common perception.  The United Kingdom abortion figures for women with Irish addresses show that less than 1 per cent of the women are under 16; about 16 per cent are aged from 16 to 19; and about 36 per cent are in the 20 to 24 age group.  Taking these three categories together, we see that only slightly more than half of the women are under 25.  This undermines the conventional wisdom that the problem of abortion in Ireland is related to young women who, without social support, have to go to the United Kingdom since almost 50 per cent of those included in the official statistics who seek abortion in the United Kingdom are over 25 years of age and a significant number of them are married.</P>
    <P>This suggests that a number of different approaches need to be implemented to deal with different aspects of the problem.  It also suggests that we need to find out a lot more about the factors which lead to the problem.</P>
    <P>Arising from this the Department of Health will commission a major study to indentify the factors which contribute to the incidence of unwanted pregnancy and those which result in the option of abortion.  With a better understanding of these factors we will be in a better position to target preventive policies where they will be most effective.</P>
    <P>The research will not be focused solely on women who have abortions, but will also cover women who have proceeded with crisis pregnancies to full term.  We will be consulting counsellors, doctors and experts in research before finalising the terms of reference of the <Col N="13" /> study.  We will also be talking to a number of research bodies of national standing, such as the Health Research Board, the Economic and Social Research Institute and relevant faculties in the universities, to determine which one would be most suited to carrying out the research.  The co-operation of the various agencies and organisations who assist women with unwanted pregnancies will be very important and I hope it will be forthcoming.</P>
    <P>The results of the research study will be particularly useful as a basis for the development of effective and properly targeted education programmes to help to reduce unwanted pregnancy, and the Health Promotion Unit in the Department of Health will give priority to the development of these.</P>
    <P>It should be recognised as well that the programme of relationships and sexuality education, which is being introduced into schools by my colleague, the Minister for Education, will play an important role in promoting an understanding of sexuality and a knowledge of reproduction in a moral, spiritual and social framework.</P>
    <P>In addition to research and education, the Government's programme recognises the importance of counselling for women with crisis pregnancies &mdash; counselling which is accessible, professional and carried out in a sympathetic way. For most women faced with this situation, their own doctor is ideally placed as the first point of contact.  The Department of Health has been in contact with the Irish College of General Practitioners and has asked them to look immediately at how best to provide pregnancy counselling through family doctors.</P>
    <P>It is not the intention, however, that family doctors only will provide this service.  I appreciate the work which is already being done by voluntary agencies and they will be encouraged to develop their services further.  The Department of Health is already providing funding, through the health boards, for a number of voluntary agencies which offer pregnancy counselling, such <Col N="14" /> as CURA, LIFE and Cherish.  The support provided to these agencies amounts at present to about £70,000.  I am satisfied, however, that we need to give considerably more funding to the wide spectrum of voluntary agencies providing services to women with crisis pregnancies, so that women in all parts of the country will have a choice of accessible services.  The Department of Health is now consulting the health boards to work out the needs in each region. When these requirements have been identified.  I will be making significant funding available to ensure that counselling is available wherever it is needed.  I am setting aside initially a provision of £200,000 for this purpose and want to make it clear that it is an initial provision only.</P>
    <P>I should also mentioned that, as part of the Government's Policy Agreement, the Department of Health will shortly issue guidelines to the health boards for the development of a comprehensive family planning service.  Under these guidelines, the boards will be asked to provide comprehensive services to all those who need them, on a basis which is equitable, accessible and offers a choice between health board and voluntary services.  They will provide the services through health board clinics, maternity hospitals or units, general practitioners, voluntary organisations and pharmacies. Particular emphasis will be placed on providing services to disadvantaged or at-risk groups, and to persons with special needs.  I will be dealing with this in a matter of weeks in a further statement.</P>
    <P>Having looked at the background to this Bill, and the context in which I am proposing it.  I will now explain its objective and its content.  It has five objectives: (i) to clarify the legal entitlements and obligations of persons or agencies who give abortion information; (ii) to ensure that any doctor or advice agency who provides abortion information to pregnant women does so only in the context of full counselling on all of the available options, without any advocacy <Col N="15" /> or promotion of abortion; (iii) to prohibit such a doctor or advice agency form referring women to pregnancy termination services, but without interfering with the ethical obligation on a doctor or counsellor to ensure the safety of the patient; (iv) to ensure that abortion information made available to the general public, for example, in newspapers, books or broadcasts, is factual and does not advocate or promote abortion; and (v) to prohibit the provision of abortion information by means of billboards, public notices or distributing unsolicited leaflets, so that abortion information will not be imposed on the public in a manner which will be offensive to some.</P>
    <P>It is important to bear in mind that the scope of the Bill is confined to a specific type of information, and this is defined as information which is likely to be required by women in availing themselves of pregnancy termination services.  Thus the Bill does not apply to more general information, such as information about the nature of abortion. Such information was not affected by the various court cases I mentioned and there is no need to regulate it over and above the prohibitions on promoting abortion already in the Censorship Acts.</P>
    <P>The Bill uses the term &ldquo;Act information&rdquo; to refer to the type of information covered, and I will do likewise for convenience.</P>
    <P>I have already referred to the emphasis which the Government will place upon pregnancy counselling and the Bill is an important element of this.</P>
    <P>Research has shown that the majority of Irish women travelling to the United Kingdom for abortions have not received any counselling before travelling.  Research has also shown that, where counselling is received, a considerable number of women decide against abortion.  It is very clear, therefore, that we need to ensure that women who are worried about their pregnancies do not feel that their only option is to travel to England to seek an abortion without first obtaining sympathetic <Col N="16" /> advice and counselling as well as whatever information they may need.  In many cases, this may result in the continuation of a pregnancy which might otherwise have been terminated.</P>
    <P>Where this is not the case, the doctor or counsellor will be in a position to ensure the patient's safety by providing information on safe and reputable services, by providing the woman with any medical records or notes which are relevant to her case and care, and by having the woman return for any post-abortion treatment or counselling which my prove necessary.</P>
    <P>The provisions dealing with pregnancy counselling apply to doctors, advice centres or other people or agencies who offer information, advice or counselling to the public on pregnancy. This Bill does not involve any restriction on giving information to a pregnant woman by a private individual such as relative or friend.</P>
    <P>Where such a doctor or agency is asked to give information, advice or counselling to a woman on her pregnancy, &ldquo;Act information&rdquo; can only be given in the context of full, truthful and objective counselling on all of the options open to her, without any advocacy or promotion of abortion.  The &ldquo;Act information&rdquo; must relate to services which are legal where they are provided.</P>
    <P>Nothing in the Bill obliges any individual or agency to provide &ldquo;Act information&rdquo;.  The obligation to give full counselling on all available options applies only where &ldquo;Act information&rdquo; is being given; pregnancy counselling which does not include &ldquo;Act information&rdquo; is not restricted by the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Bill does not preclude a doctor or agency, in the context of giving &ldquo;Act information&rdquo; and information on the other available options, from encouraging the woman concerned not to have an abortion.  Thus, while the Bill permits non-directive counselling, it does not impose an obligation on doctors or agencies to provide this; they are free to provide counselling either in a non-directive manner or in a manner which <Col N="17" /> is directive away from the option of abortion.</P>
    <P>Some agencies regard non-directive counselling as fundamental to their approach; equally, there are doctors and counsellors who will be prepared to give &ldquo;Act information&rdquo; but will also seek to encourage the woman to choose other options.  The Bill does not preclude either approach.</P>
    <P>There are also a number of provisions to prohibit doctors or agencies who are involved in giving &ldquo;Act information&rdquo; from having any financial links with abortion services or from deriving any financial or other benefit arising from the choice of abortion in preference to the other available options.  The purpose of these provisions is to protect the bona fides of those providing counselling and to ensure that they are not only objective but are seen to be so.</P>
    <P>The Bill prohibits any doctor or agency involved in pregnancy counselling from making an appointment or any other arrangement, for or on behalf of a woman, with a pregnancy termination service outside the State.  While this would prohibit sending a letter of referral to a specific service provider, the Bill explicitly permits giving the woman a copy of her medical records or other relevant records or notes.</P>
    <P>The objective is to prohibit the referral of patients to pregnancy termination services, but without interfering with the ethical obligation on a doctor or counsellor to ensure the safety of the patient.  Thus, where a patient, following full counselling, decides to proceed with the option of abortion, it will be permitted to give her such information as she will require to avail herself of a reputable and safe service and to provide her with a copy of her medical records or other records or notes which may be relevant to the treatment she will receive.</P>
    <P>I will return later to the criticism which this provision has received since the publication of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The provisions dealing with &ldquo;Act information&rdquo; given to the general public, by means such as newspapers, books, magazines, broadcasts, public <Col N="18" /> meetings etc., are quite straightforward. The services concerned must be lawful in the jurisdiction in which they are provided and the information must comply with any legal restrictions which apply in the jurisdiction concerned.  It must be truthful and objective, it cannot advocate or promote abortion, and it cannot be accompanied by any such advocacy or promotion.  Such information may not be made available by means of billboards or public notices or by the unsolicited distribution of books, newspapers, leaflets and so on.  These restrictions are in line with those promised in 1992 and appear to be generally accepted as being appropriate.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides that other legislation which could be relevant to abortion information, such as the Censorship Acts, will not apply in any case where the Bill applies so as to avoid confusion as to which legislation is to be enforced in a particular case.</P>
    <P>The Bill includes standard enforcement provisions, which I will discuss in more detail on Committee Stage.  Two matters are worth nothing, however, Prosecutions will be a matter for the Director or Public Prosecutions, not for the Garda Síochána, and the seizure provisions will not apply to any medical records and other records or notes relevant to a patients's care.  I am sure that Deputies will agree that the privacy of such records should be protected.</P>
    <P>It will be clear from the overview of the Bill which I have just given that it very closely reflects the outline given in 1992.  It derives from the heads which were approved by the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrat Government.  It was greatly advanced by my predecessor, now the Minister for the Environment, and the draft as it then stood was accepted by the Fianna Fáil party in the negotiations on the formation of a Government last November.</P>
    <P>Since then a review of the legal position by the Attorney General has enabled me to resolve one difficulty in the earlier draft which involved some potential conflict with the 1992 commitments.  I am now presenting a Bill which <Col N="19" /> has the full support of the three Government parties, which is consistent with what was agreed by Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats when in Government and which should therefore command consensus support in the House.</P>
    <P>I hope that will be the case.  As legislators, we have the difficult responsibility of finding the delicate balance between the different rights and freedoms in this area.  We do not have luxury of those outside the House who can emphasise the rights and freedoms which support their viewpoints and ignore those which do not.  The Irish people, through their decisions in the different referenda, have delineated the boundaries within which we must legislate, and the democratic process demands that we do so.</P>
    <P>I now propose to look at the two main criticisms which have been made of the Bill, each from quite different perspectives, and to show that neither can be sustained.</P>
    <P>The pro-life campaign organisation has based its opposition to the Bill on the argument that the electorate's understanding of &ldquo;information&rdquo; in the 1992 referendum did not include specific details such as names and addresses of abortion services.  It has argued that the information amendment was simply an affirmation of what was already accepted as true &mdash; that there was nothing illegal about discussing abortion in broad general terms.  It thus claims that the amendment, despite the fact that it campaigned against it, was merely declaratory and involved no additionality to what was already legal. If this were so, we might ask why it put such time, energy and money into campaigning against it.</P>
    <P>What is being said now by the pro-life campaign is, of course, simply untrue, and the evidence for this comes, not alone from the literature circulated to the public by the Government at the time from which I quoted but also from that circulated by the pro-life campaign itself.</P>
    <P>The Government's pamphlet, as I <Col N="20" /> stated, said that the amendment would resolve the fact that the European Court of Human Rights had found against the decisions of Irish courts that disseminating information about abortion was in breach of Article 40.3.3º. These cases, of course, related to names and addresses and so on.  The amendment could hardly have resolved this if it did not permit names, addresses and other factual information.</P>
    <P>Let us also turn to the leaflet which the pro-life campaign produced, and which was also distributed throughout the country.  This argued for a &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote on the information amendment, and gave the following reason, which I quote in full:</P>
    <P>The word &ldquo;information&rdquo; means assistance and advice in obtaining abortions, abortion referral and advertising.  At present, all <i>factual</i> information on abortion is legal in Ireland.  All that is forbidden is aiding someone to have an abortion abroad, making a booking in a foreign clinic or supplying the name and address of one.</P>
    <P>This amendment would make it legal in Ireland to assist in the destruction of an unborn child abroad.  It would also eventually legalise the advertising of foreign abortion clinics in the Irish media.</P>
    <P>In other words, the pro-life campaign told the electorate to vote down the information amendment because it would allow the supplying of the names and addresses of abortion clinics.  The people of Ireland weighed up this advice and rejected it by a 60:40 majority.  The response of the pro-life campaign was to attempt to rewrite history and to deny that the information amendment meant what they themselves said it did at the time.</P>
    <P>Finally, the pro-life campaign has also argued that, since the giving of names and addresses was found to be in breach of Article 40.3.3º by the Supreme Court in the 1980s, it cannot now be permitted even after the information amendment. This is a rather strange argument.  As I <Col N="21" /> have shown, the information amendment arose as a result of those Supreme Court judgments, and has the express purpose of precluding Article 40.3.3º from limiting the freedom to obtain or provide information.</P>
    <P>It is, therefore, quite clearly incorrect to suggest, as the pro-life campaign does, that this Bill could be unconstitutional on the basis of the Supreme Court judgment in question, since all the Supreme Court judgments predated the 1992 referendum which was expressly introduced to preclude the scope of Article 40.3.3º from the provision of freedom to provide information.</P>
    <P>The truth of the pro-life campaign's position is very clear.  It does not accept, and has never accepted, the democratic decision of the Irish people in 1992, to allow the freedom to give and receive abortion information within the constraints which the Government promised to put in place.</P>
    <P>The truth of this Bill is even clearer. It respects the democratic decision which the people made in 1992.  It lays down the conditions in law under which information will be provided in accordance with the 1992 amendment.  It totally complies with all relevant provisions of the Constitution, and all commitments made to the people in 1992.  The Government's position is straightforward.  The 1992 information amendment was approved by the electorate on the basis of crystal clear assurances from the Government as to what it entailed.  This included a commitment that abortion referral would not be permitted.  The Bill follows through on this commitment, as it must.</P>
    <P>The same arguments apply equally to those who oppose the Bill from an entirely different perspective.  I cannot claim to be surprised that those who would prefer a different approach to abortion than that reflected in the Constitution are opposed to the Bill. However, I would draw attention to the balanced comments which have been made in the national media over the <Col N="22" /> past week by those who do not have any such agenda.</P>
    <P>For example, eminent legal experts are quite satisfied that the Bill meets the requirements of the constitutional imperative.  Professor David Gwynn Morgan, analysing the Bill for <i>The Irish Times</i> on February 24, argues that the distinction drawn between, on the one hand, the provision of information and, on the other hand, the advocacy of abortion or the making of referral arrangements, seems to be a distinction which fits well with a realistic compromise between the 1983 and 1992 amendments.  Dr. Gerard Hogan has a similar view: and, of course, the Bill would not be before the House at all if the Attorney General, Mr. Dermot Gleeson, did not also share that view.</P>
    <P>The suggestion, made by some critics, that the Bill interferes in any way with the continuity of care provided by the doctor to his or her patient is quite untrue, and has been refuted by doctors. The position will be no different from that which applies to any other medical procedure which involves the patient moving on to a specialist.</P>
    <P>It has been confirmed that, in normal practice, a doctor rarely, if ever, makes an appointment for a patient to see a specialist, be it a physician, a surgeon, a gynaecologist or whatever.  The names, addresses and phone numbers of the relevant specialists are provided, and the patient proceeds to make the appointment.  The position in relation to women who decide to proceed with an abortion will be exactly the same.  The doctor will ensure that the specialist will have all of the medical or other details that would be relevant to the patient's care by giving them directly to the patient in an appropriate form.  Should the specialist require further information, there is nothing in the Bill that would prevent the doctor from responding to a request for this.  As with any other procedure, the patient can and indeed should return to the doctor for any post-abortion treatment or counselling that may be necessary.</P>
    <P>A further point which has been made <Col N="23" /> to me by those with an expertise in the area of counselling in general, is that it is usually beneficial to allow a break between the counselling process and the arrival at a decision.  It is important that the person receiving pregnancy counselling be given time to reflect and to weigh up all of the information and advice that has been received, before arriving at what will be a decision of immense importance.  This important principle would be undermined if a counselling session could conclude with an instant decision and the immediate making of an abortion appointment.</P>
    <P>I am quite certain that any objective analysis shows that what I am proposing is correct not only from a legal and constitutional perspective, but also from the viewpoint of good practice as regards both doctors and counsellors.  I would ask Deputies to reflect carefully on this before the provision is considered in detail on Committee Stage.  In particular, I would ask any Opposition party which is considering tabling an amendment to remove the prohibition on referral, to bear in mind that the provision honours the commitment given to the electorate by the Government in which they themselves participated. Taking all these factors into account, to propose such an amendment would be very illogical.</P>
    <P>I am asking the House to agree that the Bill, as it stands, provides the necessary balance between the different constitutional rights and freedoms, and is fully in keeping with the wishes articulated by the electorate.  We should not allow ourselves to be pulled away from this, in either direction, by the lobby groups outside the House.</P>
    <P>Since I first reflected on how to approach this Bill in the House circumstances have changed with the decision of the main Opposition party last night. Fianna Fáil is now arguing that the Bill should be withheld until the High Court rules on the application by the Dublin Well Woman Centre to have its injunction lifted.  The argument, apparently, is that this case will confirm whether or <Col N="24" /> not the 1992 amendment is to be interpreted as permitting doctors and counsellors to provide the names and addresses of abortion services.  This is hypocrisy of breathtaking dimensions. Lest anyone be deceived into thinking there is any substance in the Fianna Fáil argument, perhaps we should look at exactly what is involved in the High Court case.  In particular, we should realise that both the case and the constitutional amendment share exactly the same background.  The High Court is being asked to lift an injunction which the European Court found to be in breach of the Convention on Human Rights.  The Supreme Court had decided in 1988 in the Open Door and Dublin Well Woman Centre case and again in 1989 in the Grogan case that the dissemination of information on abortion, such as addresses and telephone numbers, of a foreign abortion service and the method of communication with it was unlawful having regard to Article 40.3.3º of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>The Supreme Court injunction preventing Open Door counselling and the Dublin Well Woman Centre from providing information such as names and addresses of abortion services was appealed to the European Court of Human Rights on the basis that they were in breach of Ireland's obligations, under the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.</P>
    <P>In October 1992 the European Court of Human Rights held that Ireland was, indeed, in breach of Article 10 of the Convention.  This Article relates to freedom of expression and the right to receive and impart information.  The case and the judgment related explicitly to the provision of names and addresses and information about methods of communication and abortion services.</P>
    <P>I am going over ground I dealt with earlier in my speech but I am doing so to reply particularly to Fianna Fáil's request for a deferral of the Bill and the grounds on which it seeks that deferral. The sole argument which the Fianna Fáil-led Government put forward in <Col N="25" /> 1992 in seeking support for the information amendment was that it would resolve the conflict between the Constitution and the European Convention; in other words, the Constitution would no longer support the restriction which has been found to be in breach of the Convention.  The only such restriction concerned names, addresses and means of communication.  I want to make this point even clearer.  The Fianna Fáil-led Government put the information amendment forward so as to remove the restriction on giving names and addresses because it breached the European Convention.  It made this position very clear to the electorate in the pamphlet it issued before the referendum which I have cited.</P>
    <P>The electorate took Fianna Fáil's advice and in due course the Dublin Well Woman Centre came before the Supreme Court to have the injunction lifted on the basis of the constitutional amendment.  The then Attorney General, on behalf of the Fianna Fáil-led Government, agreed with their position and did not oppose the request and as we know the Supreme Court decided that the case was appropriate to the High Court.  It is clear from the position taken in 1992 and subsequently by the Attorney General that Fianna Fáil has at all times accepted that the information amendment invalidates the restriction on names, addresses and methods of communication and that that was its stated purpose.  The kindest explanation one can give for Fianna Fáil's decision to suggest otherwise is that the people making the decisions are not aware of what was done in 1992 or by the then Attorney General on behalf of the then Fianna Fáil-led Government.  The unkind explanation is that this is transparent dishonesty for the purposes of political expediency.</P>
    <P>Leaving aside the question of dishonesty on this issue, there are solid reasons it would be wrong to postpone the legislation until the case has been heard.  There is no guarantee that the High Court case will resolve the issue and whatever judgment emerges will <Col N="26" /> again be open to appeal to the Supreme Court.  The High Court may simply look at the circumstances of the amendment and the injunction and decide to raise it. It may cast no light whatsoever on the issue.  Both sides are committed to fight this issue to the absolute end and, of course, it will go to the Supreme Court. We are not speaking about a few months delay; rather we are speaking about a few years delay.  In the meantime further cases could arise from the general lack of clarity about what is permitted, a lack of clarity which stems from the absence of legislation.</P>
    <P>Many general practitioners have told my Department that there is such uncertainty about the law that they do not know where they stand.  It is by no means impossible for the issue to be before the courts for five or ten years if other cases are processed.  In those circumstances I could foresee the Oireachtas receiving a deserved reprimand from the courts for its failure to fulfil its responsibility to legislate on foot of the 1992 amendment.  If one looks at the judgment in the &ldquo;X&rdquo; case one will see that a very eminent judge reprimanded the Oireachtas for not doing its job.  It is our job to legislate and it is the job of the courts to adjudicate on the legislation.  If we have any courage at all we will legislate in accordance with the will of the people, not run and hide.</P>
    <P>An even more interesting point is that one of the legal arguments put forward by SPUC, which is a party to the case and is advocating a deferral, is that the information amendment is not self-executing; in other words it will not come into effect until legislation is passed.  Its supporters are now telling us to leave it until the High Court decides. This is the basis of one of its arguments against the legislation.  It is not possible to predict what the courts will do but I do not agree with that interpretation. We would certainly have a classic Catch 22 situation if we followed Fianna Fáil's advice and the High Court found that the amendment was not self-executing and refused to lift the injunction on the <Col N="27" /> Dublin Well Woman Clinic on the grounds that the legislation was not put in place by this House.  There is a certain level of ridiculousness which we should not even attempt to get into, and that is one area all Members of the House should stay out of.</P>
    <P>The truth is that the case being made by the main Opposition party has no substance and it reflects an approach to opposition which is cynical and opportunistic in the extreme.  Its posturing on this important issue will disappoint many people who believed that the events of three months ago had brought an end to stroke politics, a system which insulted their intelligence.  The other criticisms of the Bill made by Fianna Fáil are equally invalid.  Apparently it wants the Bill to be amended to allow for the conscientious objection by doctors or counsellors who do not wish to give abortion information.  I want to make it clear again that there is nothing in the Bill which requires any person to give abortion information.  The purpose of the Bill is to set down the conditions and restrictions which apply to the giving of such information and it has no relevance whatsoever to a person who does not wish to do so.  The conscientious objection clause is already written into the Bill and it does not have to be written into it a second time.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil Deputies have argued that the Bill should be amended to remove the right to give names and addresses.  I have dealt with this issue to some extent but I want to make it clear that there is no reference to names, addresses or phone numbers in the Bill. As I have repeatedly explained, the freedom to give and obtain names and addresses derives from the 1992 amendment: it is a constitutional right since 1992 and is not a statutory right to be conferred by the Oireachtas.  The Bill simply sets out the conditions which govern the exercise of that freedom and any attempt by this House to prohibit by way of statute the freedom to give and obtain names, addresses and phone <Col N="28" /> numbers will run contrary to the Constitution.  If the Bill contained a provision to ban doctors from giving this information it would be unconstitutional, and all Members of the House, including Fianna Fáil, which was the architect of the 1992 amendment and told people exactly what it meant, knows this.  The commitments given by Fianna Fáil now fall to be honoured by this Government. In attempting to subvert this legislation Fianna Fáil is trying to make a nonsense of the democratic process and the wishes of the people.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal towards the end of my speech with the last two pages of the Minister's speech. It is disingenous of the Minister to accuse people on this side of the House of a lack of courage, of being cynical or of running away from issues.  I appreciate how difficult it is sometimes with political parties and this House to bring forward legislation on social issues which are extremely sensitive and on which all of us have views which may well be in opposition to those of others. Nevertheless we have to be generous enough to recognise that people have different views and they are entitled to make them known.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is neither an easy issue to talk about nor an easy issue to legislate for. It is not an easy issue to talk about because if you describe yourself as pro-life the people who hold the opposing view see you as anti-woman, anti-civil rights or anti-liberty and if you describe yourself as pro-choice the people who hold the opposing view see you as wicked, criminal, sinful and anti-human. There are very few issues which so polarise people, which so completely stop us listening to one another and stop us from making damning judgments about each other.  It is worth pointing out that this polarising of attitudes is not unique to Ireland.  As a nation we tend to find ourselves guilty of not properly addressing this issue but, as we all know, in some other western nations people who hold one of two radically opposed <Col N="29" /> viewpoints have been shot down in the streets for their beliefs and activities. Ireland is not on its own in its inability as a nation to come to an open, honest and productive consensus on this issue.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil Party has a policy on abortion.  We do not wish to see abortion made legal in Ireland.  We do not wish abortion facilities to be made available here.  In discussions with parliamentary party colleagues during the past few days a third strong strand emerged in our thinking, namely, we want the circumstances that lead to crisis pregnancies and abortions examined and if possible influenced so that the numbers of women seeking abortion can be reduced.  We want women in crisis pregnancies to know how to get counselling and to get the very best counselling.  This Bill does not even pretend to address or acknowledge those needs.  I will deal later with what the Minister said in his opening remarks about pregnancy counselling and comprehensive family planning services.</P>
    <P>In the autumn of 1992 when Fianna Fáil was in Government it was decided to tackle the consequences of the X case.  Three referenda were held.  On the information issue an amendment was proposed for insertion in the Constitution to the effect that there would not be a limit on freedom to obtain or indeed make available in the State, subject to whatever conditions may be laid down by law, information relating to services lawfully available in another State.  In an explanatory leaflet which was made available to the electorate the Government &mdash; the Fianna Fáil and Progressive Democrat parties &mdash; explained that this subsection was considered a balanced approach.  We underlined that we understood the sincerity and depth of people's feelings and concerns.  We explained that the referendum on information was held to enshrine in our Constitution that Article 40.3.3º cannot be used to limit the freedom to receive and impart information subject to such conditions as may be laid <Col N="30" /> down by law.  We said that the amendment would permit non-directive counselling but not abortion referral.  Almost 60 per cent of the population accepted the proposals in the referenda on information.</P>
    <P>The clear decision of the electorate in the 1992 referendum provided the framework for a limited Bill.  In effect, it said the people did not want abortion facilities on Irish soil but wanted women to have the freedom to go abroad to avail of services legally available there and wanted those women to be able to access information about those services. The electorate made a decision which could not please either pro-life or pro-choice people.  In the process it handed us, its elected representatives, a task which, if it followed the complex wishes of the electorate, would similarly fail to satisfy either committed pro-life or pro-choice people.</P>
    <P>As a woman with a uniquely liberal legislative track record I am conscious of and sensitive to the views of women who consider the lack of referral as an intrusion into their rights.  I must also be sensitive to another viewpoint, one which is probably the nearest to which this country will get to consensus on any aspect of the abortion issue.  I do not believe there is anybody in Ireland, man or woman, feminist or unreconstructed chauvinist, who considers abortion a good thing.  Those who feel most strongly pro-choice will confirm that it is rarely if ever an easy decision, rarely if ever a decision that a woman makes without paying and rarely if ever a choice made without sadness.  The phrases we have got used to using such as &ldquo;the abortion trail&rdquo; do not reflect the reality which is that for individual women making that journey it is a cold quiet journey made under pressure and most often remembered in isolation.  Nobody wishes to take that journey and none of the women who has taken it should have that part of their lives made retrospectively worse by having to listen to some of the pointless self-righteous judgments which tend to be made on this issue.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="31" /> Without making any judgments we, as legislators, can legitimately seek to reduce the number of abortions involving Irish women.  No decision in a crisis pregnancy should be taken without counsel or information but, above all, no decision should be taken without thought.  There has been much talk during the past week or so of counselling, but while the Minister has been at pains to separate those providing counsel &mdash; whether doctors, clinics or agencies &mdash; from the issue of referral, he has not included in the Bill any reference to counselling.  It is crucial that the best counselling is available to women at every point during such a crisis in their lives because it is too easy to talk simply of &ldquo;crisis pregnancies&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Picking up one's life and moving on after an abortion is difficult and it is to the credit of some of the most anti-abortion organisations that they provide counselling for women <i>post factum.</i> Counselling should be available at every point to such women and it should be State supported.  The State has too often intervened in the matter of abortion from a purely regulatory point of view. It has sought to prevent the Act of abortion as if somehow it happens in avacuum.  It never happens in a vacuum.  It happens in the context of a woman's whole life and in the context of relationships, families, illness and careers and it is surrounded by hopes and fears, by support and betrayal.  It is about time the State began to consider abortion as a human issue in that much wider context.  The State has responsibilities to women in crisis pregnancies and up to now it has been doing a Pontius Pilate job on those responsibilities because the loudest statement it has made has been the washing of hands.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil has given this Bill great consideration.  As the public now know, yesterday we had a very lengthy parliamentary party meeting at which a large number of the members spoke.  Serious reservations were expressed about the Bill.  The party recognises that legislation is required to comply with the <Col N="32" /> 14th amendment to the Constitution dealing with the right to information. Accordingly, work was in progress in the Department of Health since the passing of the referendum in 1992 to bring forward a Bill giving expression to the people's wishes.  A Bill was not brought to Cabinet for approval during Fianna Fáil's term in office.</P>
    <P>Before the publication of this Bill last week there was no indication that the Government intended to bring forward such legislation this session.  If I recall correctly, when a list of legislation to be taken in this session was published by the Government this did not appear.  On the day of the publication of the Framework Document, the Bill was suspiciously rushed out.  I can only assume that there was a grand plan that the Bill would be swallowed up in the events of that and subsequent days and it would not receive critical examination.</P>

      <P>It is our view that the timing of the Bill is particularly unwise as there are cases pending before the courts in which the very issue to be decided is what the 1992 information amendment means.  The cases are part of lengthy and important litigation.  In 1989 the Supreme Court ruled, in what has become known as the Grogan case, that offering information amounted to assisting a woman in destroying the life or her unborn child whose right to life is upheld by the Constitution.  The ruling followed the publication by the Union of Students in Ireland and a number of individual student unions of the names and addresses of British abortion clinics in their student handbooks.  The Society for the Protection of the Unborn Child <Col N="34" /> sought an injunction in the High Court preventing the student unions from publishing the information.  Miss Justice Mella Carroll, in the High Court, decided to refer two questions arising from the case to the European Court of Justice.  She lifted the injunction on publication pending the European Court's decision.  The society for the Protection of the Unborn Child appealed the lifting of her injunction to the Supreme Court and won on the basis that abortion information amounted to assisting a woman in destroying the life of her unborn child whose right to life was upheld by the Constitution.  In his ruling, the Chief Justice, Mr. Finlay, said: &ldquo;This application for an interlocutory injunction therefore consists of an application to restrain an activity which has been clearly declared by this court to be unconstitutional and therefore unlawful, and which could assist and is intended to assist in the destruction of the right to life of an unborn child, a right acknowledged and protected under the Constitution&rdquo;.  Mr. Justice Finlay also said: &ldquo;It is clearly the fact that such information is conveyed to pregnant women and not the method of communication which creates the unconstitutional illegality&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The ruling the European Court has decided that abortion is a service but, as there was no commercial link between those clinics named in the booklet and those publicising their services, the students have no right under EU law. The case then went back to the High Court where the students lost.  It has now been appealed to the Supreme Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Separately, and following the passage of the constitutional amendment on information, there is also a case pending in the High Court with the Well Woman Centre seeking the lifting of an injunction on the provision of names and addresses of abortion clinics in Great Britain.  In that case between the Dublin Well Woman Centre Limited and two named individuals and Ireland and the Attorney General, the claim of the <Col N="35" /> plaintiffs is a declaration that the plaintiffs, their servants or agents may make available within the State information relating to abortion services lawfully available in another member state of the European Community and may inform pregnant women of the identity and location of and the method of communication with a specified clinic or clinics or otherwise.</P>
    <P>It is not for me to interpret the Constitution.  Neither do I think the Minister is claiming that it is for him to interpret the Constitution.  The interpretation of the Constitution is a matter for the Supreme Court.</P>
    <P>On the basis of those outstanding matters Fianna Fáil's view is that the legislation should be deferred until the court's decision has been handed down. We welcomed this very correct procedure when it was announced recently by the Taoiseach on behalf of the Government that consideration, of legislation to provide for a divorce referendum was being deferred pending a decision by the courts on the Judicial Separation Act, 1989.  Fianna Fáil called on the Government, and calls on the Government now, to await the decision of the courts on the central issue relating to this Bill in the interests of ensuring that this legislation is considered in as non-contentious a manner as possible.  I am also calling on the Minister for Health to give the Attorney General's written legal advices on the Bill to the House because I and my party colleagues want to know the basis on which the Attorney General advised the Minister and, in turn, the Government, to proceed in the absence of a court ruling.  That would be helpful in trying to reach a political consensus on this issue.</P>
    <P>If the Government is not willing to defer consideration of the Bill, we will table a series of amendments which will outline our serious reservations.  In particular, we will be seeking the insertion of an opt out clause for doctors who, for reasons of conscience, do not wish to handle the names and addresses of abortion clinics overseas.  I appreciate <Col N="36" /> what the Minister for Health stated in regard to that.  I accept that in the Bill there is no specific obligation on doctors, clinics or any agencies involved in this area to give the list of names and addresses or any information about abortion.  However, when we were discussing the health amendment Act of 1978 on family planning we did, as a Legislature, include a specific section to allow opting out.  We on this side of the House are not trying to be difficult but, in the interests of clarity, so that nobody will be in any doubt that there is no obligation on them to give this information if they do not wish to, we will seek to amend the Bill and one of the amendments in my name will be to that effect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister.  I will be seeking the amendment of section 3 on the conditions governing the giving of information to restrict the broadcasting of abortion clinic details on television and radio. Once again that is like the opt out clause.  It is not specifically mentioned in the Bill but, to remove all possible doubt, and in the interests of achieving political consensus, it would be a good amendment to include in the Bill.  Perhaps the Minister will examine that between now and Committee Stage.  It is important to include such a provision in the Bill because television and radio are not like newspapers and magazines where a member of the public exercises choice over purchase.  Young children and uncounselled women are more likely to be exposed to advertising on television and radio.</P>
      <P>I also plan to seek the extension of the prohibition on giving information under section 6 to include not just those with financial links to pregnancy termination service organisation abroad but also to those who have legal links to such agencies abroad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As none of us sees abortion as a good thing, and as we are all disturbed by the statistic that over 4,000 Irish women <Col N="37" /> obtain abortions each year in Britain, resources for education and counselling must be an urgent priority.  Deputy O'Donnell mentioned yesterday that we do not have accurate statistics on the number of Irish women seeking abortions abroad because some Irish women use an address of convenience in the UK.  The provision of financial resources for research is important and, as called for by Deputy O'Donnell yesterday, we should have a proper system of statistical information on this area.</P>
    <P>On education and counselling, the Minister has not seen fit to make specific provision in the Bill.  We are strongly of the view that statutory expression should be given to the need for caring, compassionate and properly funded counselling services for women in crisis pregnancies.  Unless the Bill is deferred I will be pursuing the Minister for Health on Committee Stage to include specific provisions for resources for agencies providing counselling. Resources must be provided to improve the counselling skills, for example, of family doctors.  There is no doubt &mdash; and I think the Minister accepts this &mdash; that if women are given proper counselling fewer of them opt to have abortions. Counselling is also important at the post-abortion stage.  According to the Irish Family Planning Association, of those who go for an abortion and receive counselling prior to it, over 50 per cent opt to return for a recommended medical check-up.  In rural areas in particular doctors have a vital role to play in the counselling process and family planning services.  However, many general practitioners require additional training to improve their own counselling skills and family planning services.  For those who would like additional training, resources should be made available to facilitate general practitioners, particularly in rural areas where counselling agencies may have patchy representation, if any.</P>
    <P>I will also be pursuing the Government to ensure that there is support for family planning research and sex education programmes at second level.  If <Col N="38" /> the Minister plans more than a minimalist response in this area he will divert funding to and raise standards in the counselling services available for women going through this crisis.  That would be a decent first step.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke at length about pregnancy counselling and comprehensive family planning services.  When we discussed the Health (Family Planning) Act, 1979 in the House, with many others, I was one of the Deputies who might have been out of line with the views of my party on family planning. That is nothing new for me as I often find myself out of step with the views of some of my parliamentary party colleagues.</P>
    <P>While there are comprehensive family planning services available to women in urban areas there is a major problem in rural Ireland.  Like me, the Minister believes in local democracy and in giving as much power as possible to local politicians, members of health boards, local authorities and so on but because very often issues such as family planning are subjective and cause difficulties for so many people when we leave them and issue guidelines to the health boards there is stagnation.  This is not the fault of the administrations of health boards but very often the fault of some of our colleagues who are members of health boards and hold particular views on these issues.  While the issuing of guidelines is welcome we need to go a step further and provide stronger encouragement for the health boards to provide this facility.  We need a comprehensive family planning service and if it is to be comprehensive it has to be widely available throughout the country.</P>
    <P>On the issue of pregnancy counselling I acknowledge that consecutive Governments have provided funding to the organisations outlined by the Minister: Cherish, Life and Cura.  While this is important it is not enough.  Like other parties, my party in Government was guilty of not providing enough but at this stage we should not start apportioning guilt.  We need to provide support and must not adopt a minimalist <Col N="39" /> approach.  If we are serious we have to ensure that the provision is greatly increased.  The Minister suggested a provision of £200,000 for this purpose which is welcome.  This matter is being left to the health boards and I have a minor difficulty with this.  This provision should be strengthened so that the money is given to the agencies to encourage them to provide the counselling services necessary for women facing this crisis in their lives.</P>
    <P>If we are to believe that the Government, as expressed in the Programme for Government, is committed to reducing the number of abortions involving Irish women it will have to go further. Many members of my party must be permitted to doubt this intention because if the Government was serious about reducing the number of Irish women who are forced to opt for an abortion and was of one mind on the matter would there have been precise and pointed leaks during the past few weeks by one of the Minister's partners in Government?  I scarcely think so. What was the purpose other than to point to specific differences between the views of the Minister and his party and those of a colleague on these issues? This shows that the leopard does not change its spots no matter who it is in partnership with.  The Minister should watch his back and I am not referring to Deputy Ahern.</P>
    <P>The Minister indicated that the Cabinet has now achieved a consensus.  Do all members of the Cabinet agree and why are some trying to have it both ways?</P>

      <P>If the Minister's partners in Government hold a different view on this issue how can I and my party or other Members of the House expect the Government to live up to its stated intention to reduce the number of abortions?  That is relevant because we do not have enough information or data on this issue; we have <Col N="40" /> convictions.  We are in the classic position in which we often find ourselves: &ldquo;Do not bother me with the facts because I have already made up my mind&rdquo;.  We need to know the facts and stop operating on the basis of impressions because that prevents us from dealing with the issue in all its complexity.  Impressions are a poor basis for the formulation of policy.</P>
      <P>Until the Government knows what is meant by crisis pregnancy and the factors which most influence women to opt for a termination there is no point in expressing an intention to reduce the numbers who take this option.  Without full information and up-to-date objective research this intention is not worth the paper it is written on.</P>
      <P>I do not think the Minister doubts me when I say Fianna Fáil is genuinely anxious to achieve political consensus on this Bill but I am not sure that the publication of a Bill at this time is the right way to seek or receive it.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Fianna Fáil spokesperson on her speech.  The Progressive Democrats have legitimate and real objections to this Bill in its present from.  It is highly controversial and one on which no party in this House is completely of one mind. Because it is concerned with matters of private morality and personal conscience the members of the Progressive Democrats in this House will, as is their entitlement under party rules, enjoy a free vote.</P>
      <P>As my party's spokesperson in the Dáil on this issue, allowing for the divergent views of my colleagues, I propose to outline the viewpoint which mostly closely reflects the views of the parliamentary party as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The issue on Second Stage is a vote in principle on the major features of the Bill.  It is not a vote on abortion, nor can this legislation affect the substantive rights of persons to life, born or unborn. The Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution does not make regulation mandatory nor can we be certain as to its effect.  However, in the context of the <Col N="41" />&ldquo;X&rdquo; case, the travel and information amendments were undoubtedly intended by the great majority of the people who voted for them to alter the existing law as laid down by the courts to render legal matters which otherwise would have remained unlawful.  The right to receive and impart information, therefore, can only, if it is not a redundant provision in the Constitution, have been intended to allow more people to receive and give information which, under existing court decisions, was seen to be unlawful.  I refer to the case SPUC <i>v.</i> Well Woman and Open Door.  There is no basis for assuming that the people intended a minimalist interpretation of the term &ldquo;information&rdquo; or of the right to travel.</P>
    <P>I will outline as best I can the various aspects of the Bill which we find intellectually dishonest and which will beget further controversy and which should be amended on Committee Stage.  Notwithstanding our grave and sincerely held reservations about the Bill as drafted and certain provisions of it, it must be said that for all its faults it will permit a debate.  Where there was a vacuum, uncertainty and political abdication of responsibility to address a major issue of public policy, we now have a Bill to debate.  The Bill, with its flaws, allows a debate in this House which should take place in a democracy.</P>
    <P>The long and tortuous journey surrounding the family planning laws and the rights of individuals to make decisions on birth control without interference from the State is one which is being continued by the enactment of this Bill.  The history of the evolution of our laws on private morality, particularly as it applies to birth control, has been characterised by legislative timidity, political cowardice and a pathetic one step forward, two steps back process.  It has involved major conflicts between Church and State, between society and women and between extreme absolutist views from the liberal and conservative spectrum.</P>
    <P>Irish people are a compassionate race <Col N="42" /> and it is useful at this stage to recall the collective national sigh of relief when the Supreme Court liberated a 14 year-old girl, who was raped and was suicidal as a result of an injunction imposed by the State to prevent her terminating her pregnancy.  The further the facts of this case slip from our memory, the easier it is for the old absolutes to revive and gain credence.</P>
    <P>It is now 12 years since Article 40.3.3º of the Constitution &mdash; the Article which confers the right to life upon the unborn &mdash; was imported into our Constitution. In those 12 years approximately 60,000 Irish pregnancies &mdash; at the most conservative estimate &mdash; ended in abortion in England.</P>
    <P>Yesterday, the Minister for Health confirmed to me that in the years 1991, 1992 and 1993 a total of 12,805 Irish women resident in Ireland had pregnancy terminations in Britain.  These are not the full figures, neither are they abstract statistics; they are an audit of Irish women who have made sometimes agonised and fraught decisions, many without the benefit the counselling before or after the event.  They travelled primarily in secret, lying to their employers, to their husbands and to their families to justify their short absence from the State.</P>
    <P>They are the silent voices in this debate combined with the many thousands of women who went before them. They do not form a vocal lobby group who telephone elected Members of this House to make their case but they exist and have a right to have their perspective vocalised in this House.</P>
    <P>We now have one of the highest abortion rates in the European Union. Women may be forced to travel abroad to have an abortion but let there be no mistake about it, a pregnancy which was conceived in Ireland, agonised over in Ireland and terminated in England is an Irish abortion.</P>
    <P>This Bill will not do anything to stop the annual exodus of women who leave our shores in search of abortion, just as the amendment did not do anything to stop it.  Nor will this Bill do anything to <Col N="43" /> alleviate the plight of those women who travel that road isolated, frightened and alone.</P>
    <P>During the debate surrounding the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution Bill, 1992, all of the parties who are now in Government made eloquent appeals for proper professional services to be put in place for women in crisis pregnancies.  Even though these proposals were practical and might have actually gone some way towards reducing the Irish abortion rate &mdash; and everybody in this House wants to see a reduction in the abortion rate &mdash; none of them are contained in this Bill.  Nor was there any mention in the then Minister for Health, Deputy Howlin's Health Strategy about addressing the problem of crisis pregnancies for women.  That was a much lauded document on health strategy for the 1990s which contained a large section on women's health but there was not any mention of crisis pregnancies.  This is a matter of which causes me profound personal disappointment and I note the Minister's commitment in his contribution to fund counselling services, which is welcome. The Bill, however, does not contain any such provision and that must be included by way of an amendment.</P>
    <P>If we are honest in our wish to protect the unborn and if we truly wish to protect the health of women and children, the only way to do this is to put in place publicly funded and fully integrated family planning and sex education services, with proper pregnancy counselling facilities and greater support and care services for those women who find themselves in this crisis.  It is worth noting that family planning facilities in this State are very patchy and the only contraceptive available on the GMS scheme is the pill.  The provision of tubal ligation and sterilisation services is also patchy and depends on the ethical committee of the particular hospital.  That whole area must be examined also.</P>
    <P>The Government is ideally placed to do something of real practical benefit for women in crisis pregnancies.  I am <Col N="44" /> glad the Bill is before this House and that we have moved away from having a debate in the newspapers, by the Church and by judges.  It is now in its proper forum where we, as elected Members of this House, can put forward the various perspectives which are reflected in this House as we represent our constituents.</P>
    <P>In the years since Article 40.3.3º was inserted in the Constitution it has not achieved anything.  Instead, it has engendered division, controversy, intolerance and distrust.  This achieved its height at the time of the X case.  The bringing of the X case marked on all-time low in the treatment of women with crisis pregnancies.  It was perhaps the most shameful and disgraceful period in Irish public life since the foundation of the State.  It tore us apart as a nation and, in doing so, exposed us to all of our hypocrisies.  It highlighted the dangers of Catholic fundamentalism as it applies to this issue.</P>
    <P>The X case, and the bitterly divisive controversy that followed it, contained many lessons for us as legislators.  One of the most important lesson of the X case for the legislators was proclaimed by the late Mr. Justice McCarthy when he trounced the legislators for our inexcusable failure to regulate the manner in which the right to life of the unborn, as enshrined in Article 40.3.3º, was to be reconciled with the equal right to life of the mother.</P>
    <P>In that case the court carefully, and with great compassion, interpreted in a harmonious fashion fundamental rights as between the mother and the unborn with concepts of prudence, justice and charity.  The Bill before us is strong on prudence, minimalist on charity and justice and dishonest in many aspects of its provisions.</P>
    <P>For liberals, the Bill is a cowardly measure and for conservatives it will be heralded as courageous.  It contains the seeds of further controversy and many dangers.  For two of the parties in Government it represents a complete U-turn.  The Bill consists largely of a list of prohibitions backed up with criminal <Col N="45" /> sanctions.  I question whether this structure was appropriate.</P>
    <P>The late Mr. Justice McCarthy stated in the X case:</P>
    <P>Legislation may be both negative and positive: negative, in prohibiting absolutely or at a given time, or without meeting stringent tests: positive by requiring positive action.  The State may fulfil its role by providing necessary agencies to help, to counsel, to encourage, to comfort, to plan for the pregnant woman, the pregnant girl or her family.</P>
    <P>In that portion of his judgment, the late Mr. Justice McCarthy was speaking in the context of the obligation of the State to vindicate the right to life of the unborn but I belive his reasoning holds just as good in the context of the right to information.</P>
    <P>In this Bill the Government has confined itself to laying down a string of restrictions on the right to information, backed up by criminal sanctions.  The Bill does not provide for any counselling services.  It does not provide for post-abortion counselling.  As Deputy De Rossa, speaking on Committee Stage of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992, stated: &ldquo;... the mindset that sees the question of information solely on the basis of how it can be restricted rather than how it can be provided is starting from the wrong end of the spectrum&rdquo;.  Deputy De Rossa is now a member of the Government that has brought forward this legislation.</P>
    <P>Much has been made by the Labour Party in private briefings to journalists of the fact that its Bill was more liberal. When Labour was in Government, however, with control of the Department of Health, it did not present any Bill to Government so its protestations do not wash with me and they represent more public displays of the Labour Party wrestling with its conscience after the event.</P>
    <P>The X case was a very clear illustration that there are certain areas of human life and human activity where the law cannot and should not attempt <Col N="46" /> to interfere.  I am not saying the law should not regulate the provision of abortion, or indeed the provision of abortion information, but the law is a blunt instrument, and that is why we have difficulty in processing this Bill through the House.  This Bill provides that people who give abortion information to pregnant women, or in some circumstances, to the public, will be guilty of a criminal offence unless the information they give is truthful and objective.  The House must be very sure of what this means.  People such as doctors, nurses, midwives, counsellers and, under the provisions of section 3, the publishers of books or newspapers, journalists, artists and film-makers may be dragged before the criminal courts and fined and branded as criminals if they are not &ldquo;truthful&rdquo; and &ldquo;objective&rdquo; in the giving of abortion information. By whose standards is truth and objectivity to be measured?  We have all seen how bitterly divisive is the topic of abortion and how passionately the different interest groups in our society adhere to their version of the truth.</P>
    <P>To the pro-choice lobby, a newly-fertilized egg is nothing but a clump of cells. This, they state, is the objective truth. To the pro-life lobby, a newly-fertilized egg is a human being with civil rights equal to those of the mother carrying it. They are equally vehement and equally passionate in their belief that this is the objective truth.  In between those two viewpoints the great majority of Irish people adopt a viewpoint on the spectrum of what I would call common sense.  It is obvious that the issue of abortion is one on which convictions and opinions are so highly polarised that no objective view of the truth can ever be arrived at.  There can never be consensus as to what sort of information about abortion is &ldquo;truthful and objective&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Where are members of the medical professions &mdash; doctors, nurses, midwives &mdash; and other people who counsel pregnant women to turn for guidance on matters?  They get no guidance from this Bill.  How on earth are they supposed to <Col N="47" /> decide what to tell their clients or patients who come to them for advice? How are they supposed to determine how to conduct their counselling sessions?  This requirement that information be &ldquo;truthful and objective&rdquo; is so vague as to completely defy interpretation.  It will constitute an unwarranted intrusion into the doctor-patient relationship &mdash; my party will table an amendment on Committee Stage on this key issue.</P>
    <P>Worse still, it will place intolerable stress on doctors and other persons who offer assistance to women in crisis pregnancies because those people know through experience that there are interest groups at work in our society, powerful, secretive manipulative and extremely well-funded interest groups who will spy on them and perhaps present as <i>agent provocateurs</i> in surgeries to try to trap doctors into making a recommendation which they believe is not truthful and objective.  They could send women into surgeries and clinics to feign pregnancy for the sole purpose of gathering evidence against doctors.  Any deviation from what those interest groups term &ldquo;truth and objectivity&rdquo; will be pounced on by them and exposed.</P>
    <P>In recent years the guardians of our moral consciences reported to the Garda that certain third level educational establishments permitted the installation of condom vending machines on their premises.  Can we now expect doctors to be reported to the Garda for failing to tell their patients that abortion is murder?  The only way in which the truthfulness and objectivity of information can be tested is through the courts.  Unfortunately, this implies that somewhere along the line somebody will be dragged through the criminal courts on foot of this Bill.</P>
    <P>The doctor-patient relationship is crucial.  This Bill fundamentally undermines the position of doctors, not only by inviting the unwelcome attention of the reactionary element.  The provisions of section 8 constitute a completely unprecedented attack on the autonomy. <Col N="48" /> of the medical profession.  The State, having only just removed itself from the bedrooms of Irish people, is about to install itself in doctors' surgeries.  While the Bill permits doctors and pregnancy counsellors to give truthful and objective information about abortion to their patients and clients &mdash; whatever that means &mdash; they are prohibited, where the woman chooses to have an abortion, from making an appointment or any other arrangement with a person providing the services is outside the State.</P>
    <P>This is presumably intended to placate the pro-life lobby by prohibiting what is termed abortion referral, although it ignores the fact that an Irish doctor or pregnancy counsellers cannot, under British law, refer an Irish patient for an abortion in England.  Under English abortion legislation no-one can have an abortion unless two doctors certify that she needs one.  A doctor referring a patient from here does so for assessment by subsequent doctors.  Until the doctors complete the certification processs the woman is not legally entitled to an abortion.  In effect, agencies such as The Irish Family Planning Association, which includes referral in its comprehensive crisis pregnancy service are referring women for assessment by other doctors in Britain.  Doctors are obliged by the Hippocratic oath to at all times act in the best interest of their patients.  This Bill requires that where a woman in possession of all the facts and after counselling, chooses an abortion she must make the necessary arrangements herself.</P>
    <P>The Minister must address himself to a fundamental flaw in this Bill as it applies to women such as Miss X who, if there is a risk to their lives, have a right to terminate the pregnancy.  Surely in the circumstances of the X case or of a 48 year old woman who has been advised by her doctor that another pregnancy poses a risk to her life, or a child who is pregnant as a result of incest and is suicidal and distraught, the doctor must be entitled to make any arrangements to accommodate her specific and subjective needs.  On this key issue there <Col N="49" /> are real constitutional difficulties in this Bill and it is folly and intellectually dishonest for the Minister to ignore that issue.</P>
    <P>It is probable that most women will be perfectly competent and capable of making arrangements for themselves, but there will always be women who, through fear, confusion, physical disability, perhaps deafness or impaired speech, social or intellectual disadvantage or a simple lack of organisational skills, will not be able to make the necessary arrangements for themselves. Nor may they have the benefit of a supportive friend or member of the family to whom they can turn for help.  In a recent survey of a sample of clients referred by the IFPA for terminations &mdash; a sample of 231 women who sought pregnancy counselling, 193 of whom chose abortion &mdash; the isolation of clients is strongly highlighted.  It states:</P>
    <P>The most disturbing and also very sad statistic here is that 69 women, or 30 per cent of those attending the IFPA, had not told anybody at all about their pregnancy...  For these 69 women their experience can only have been one of intense loneliness, isolation and fear.</P>
    <P>That deals only with a sample of 231 out of the average 4,000 women who travel to Britain for termination.  Of those sample clients, half of them were under 24 with 16 per cent being under the age of 19.  For such young, vulnerable women who are physically and psychologically alone, it should be legitimate for a doctor to come to the conclusion that his professional duty to his patient requires him to assist in so far as he can, humanly and professionally, in making the necessary arrangements.  There is no justification for prohibiting a medical practitioner from consulting and communicating with any other medical practitioner.</P>
    <P>Under the provisions of this Bill women will be left to take the final step unsupported and unhelped, in isolation and fear.  Some of them may never have been out of the country and may have <Col N="50" /> to make their first journey on their own. Their medical advisers and pregnancy counsellors will be powerless to assist them for fear of the consequences of the criminal law.  Are doctors to be expected to show a young patient out of the surgery or counselling centre with a bundle of leaflets and telephone numbers, without even a phone card?  Would such a doctor be said to have discharged his duty to his patient?</P>
    <P>In the course of a recent radio programme a psychiatrist stated that to his knowledge some general practitioners in Ireland accompany their patients to the abortion clinic in England in order to provide them with continuing care and support during their journey.  I make no apologies for applauding those doctors for their humanity.  This practice is now to be outlawed.  Are these doctors to be criminalised for taking steps which in their view are necessary in the interest of the physical and mental health of their patients?</P>
    <P>This Bill prohibits doctors from entering into communication with doctors abroad, even where the women is suffering from a physical or mental illness of which the doctors abroad should be aware.  This is an attack on the rights of Irish women to their bodily integrity. Section 8 attempts to overcome this difficulty by permitting the doctor to give to the women a copy of her medical notes or records.  In the vast majority of cases there is no reason this should not be done.</P>
    <P>There may be a small but significant minority of cases in which the doctor, by reason of the woman's youth or some psychiatric, addictive, physical or mental condition, may strongly believe that she should not be forced to bear the burden and isolation of having to transmit crucial medical information to the doctor abroad.  In such cases the doctor may be of the opinion that giving the notes to the women might not be sufficient guarantee that they will be given to the doctor in England and that her life or health would be in danger if he did not communicate the information to the doctor himself.  He might form the <Col N="51" /> view that he had a professional obligation to his patient to communicate with the doctor abroad.  Is the Minister suggesting that such activity should be a criminal act?  The medical profession in Ireland is second to none and our doctors have a long and proud tradition of services to their patients.  It is disgraceful to seek to criminalise doctors who act in the interests of their patients.</P>
    <P>The Bill in many senses is a failure of trust.  This Government does not trust the women of Ireland to make decisions for themselves or to choose their own advisers.  It has demonstrated also that it does not trust doctors.  This Bill flagrantly ignores our international obligations both as a signatory of the European Convention on Human Rights and as a member of the European Union. Members will be aware that although we signed the European Convention on Human Rights and profess adherence to it, we cannot be proud of our record of compliance.  Members will recall that Open Door Counselling and the Well Woman Centre brought a case to the European Court of Human Rights complaining that the injunctions that had been imposed on them violated Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which guarantees freedom of expression.  This guarantee is not absolute.  It may be restricted on a number of grounds, including the interests of protection of health and morals. However, the European Court of Human Rights has repeatedly made it clear in its jurisprudence that any restriction on freedom of expression which a State seeks to justify on the grounds of protection of morals or other interest must be (i) prescribed by law, (ii) necessary in a democratic society, (iii) proportional.  In the event the European Courts of Human Rights held that, having regard to the sweeping nature of the injunctions against the Well Woman Centre as well as their perpetual nature, the restrictions on the applicant's right to freedom of expression was overboard and disproportionate, particularly <Col N="52" /> having regard to the non-directive nature of the counselling and the fact that the information impugned was available from other sources such as telephone directories.  In addition the court noted that the injunction was ineffective because it did not prevent women from travelling abroad to seek abortions.</P>
    <P>In the context of this Bill, the European Convention does not form part of Irish law and is not justifiable in Irish courts, even though any conflict between the Bill and the convention is a violation of our international obligations.  Having said that, I think there are provisions in this Bill which would fall foul of the convention.  The convention gives very strong protection to the expression of convictions and opinions. Section 3 prohibits the publication of &ldquo;Act Information&rdquo; in any form, including books or films and at debates or public meetings unless that information is &ldquo;truthful and objective&rdquo; and does not advocate the termination of pregnancy. In addition doctors and other health workers may be criminalised for making appointments for their patients or for giving information that does not measure up to the standard of truth and objectivity.</P>
    <P>The European Court of Human Rights has reiterated that any restriction on the rights protected in the convention must be prescribed by law in such a way that people can ascertain what is prohibited.  The court frowns on vagueness, uncertainty and arbitrariness.  I think the court would find that it is so difficult to ascertain what constitutes &ldquo;truth and objectivity&rdquo; in the field of abortion information that the restriction contained in section 3 amounts to an illegitimate restriction on freedom of expression.  Does anyone in Government believe that we have to vindicate our international obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights?  Can the Tánaiste look at his fellow Ministers at the Council of Ministers and say with his hand on his heart that the State is complying with the obligations of Article 10 of the convention <Col N="53" /> when it imposes in this Bill such restrictions, backed up with criminal sanctions, on freedom of expression?  It presumably means that books such as <i>Our Bodies and Ourselves</i> which are partisan on the issue of abortion will remain banned in this jurisdiction.  They were removed by Dublin Corporation from the municipal libraries.</P>

      <P>In the Open Door counselling case the court noted &mdash; quoting its judgment in <i>Handyside v. UK</i>&mdash; that freedom of expression extended to &ldquo;information or ideas that offend, shock or disturb the State or any sector of the population. Such are the demands of that pluralism, tolerance and broadmindedness without which there is no democratic society.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This Bill denies our citizens the freedom to hold and express views that are not &ldquo;objective&rdquo;.  Of course, it does not make it illegal for people to express very conservative and fundamentalist opinions.  It means that we will be subjected to a regime of silence, secrecy and censorship.  It may well mean that documentaries that tell the story of women travelling to Britain for abortions who are not contrite or persons advocating a pro-choice view will not be shown on RTE.  This Bill is open to so many dangers that we have to look at the censorship aspects of it.  It is arguable that the provisions of the Bill may fall foul of European Union law.  In the case of <i>SPUC v. Grogan</i> the European Court of Justice ruled on the validity of the injunctions having regard to the provisions of the Treaty of Rome.  The High Court (Carroll J.) had referred the following questions under Article 177 of the Treaty:</P>
      <P> 1.  Whether legal abortion constituted a service within Article 60 of the Treaty, and</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>2.  whether it was lawful for the State to prohibit the distribution of <Col N="54" /> information in relation to persons providing the service of abortion in other member states. </P>
    <P>The court held that legal abortion constituted a service but since the students in question had no economic links with the abortion clinics in England, and the clinics were not involved in the distribution of the information, the Irish prohibition on abortion information was not unlawful.  Also of relevance is Protocol 17 to the Maastricht Treaty which was never debated in the House and which Members will remember provided, broadly&mdash;: &ldquo;Nothing in the treaty on the European Union or in the treaties establishing the European Communities... shall affect the application in Ireland of Article 40.3.3º of the Constitution of Ireland.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Following the X case the Government arranged for the annexation to the Treaty of a solemn declaration which provided broadly that the High Contracting Parties to the Treaty on European Union interpreted Protocol 17 as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>....that the Protocol shall not limit freedom either to travel between member states or, in accordance with conditions which may be laid down in comformity with Community law, by Irish legislation, to obtain or make available in Ireland information relating to services lawfully available in member states.</P>
    <P>The status of this solemn declaration is highly questionable but it does at the very least stress the obligation of the Irish State to legislate for abortion information in a manner that is in conformity with the provision of EU law.</P>
    <P>Section 5 contains provisions which may conflict with EU law.  It provide in effect that no person or body who has an &ldquo;interest&rdquo; in any body which provides abortion services abroad may give abortion information to a woman.  It will be recalled that in the Grogan case the European Court of Justice ruled that the injunctions were lawful since the clinics in question were not involved in <Col N="55" /> the distribution of information or as the court said the information was not distributed on behalf of an economic operator established in another member state.  The logical corollary of that finding is that if the clinics had such an involvement or an economic link with the distributors of the information, the injunction would not have been lawful.</P>
    <P>This Bill specifically prohibits agencies that have links with abortion providers abroad from offering pregnancy counselling.  This would seem to fly in the face of what the European Court of Justice said in the Grogan case and in turn with Article 59 of the Treaty of Rome and solemn declarations.  We will be tabling substantial amendments to protect the inviolability of the doctor-patient relationship and we will also table an amendment to take account of the X case, the hard cases and the rights of women for whom a pregnancy poses a risk to their lives to be provided legally with whatever assistance a doctor deems professionally and humanly necessary.</P>
    <P>We will be calling for comprehensive time for Committee Stage to scrutinise the proposed amendments and we will not facilitate the Minister in his desire to get the Bill through the House as quickly as possible.  I look forward to Committee Stage and to hearing the views of Members who have the courage to express them.  I do not object to anyone expressing their view on either side of the spectrum.  It is those who sit on the fence who should be ashamed of themselves.</P>

I am disappointed to see the Progressive Democrats, who made such a virtue out of political courage, avoid taking a stand on this.</P>
      <P>The Government is facing up to the issue which is a simple one &mdash; do we want Irish women to get information on abortion from student periodicals, British magazines, telephone kiosks or lavatory walls or do we want information and a range of options to be given to them in secure surroundings by doctors and trained counsellors?  In essence, this was the question put to the people two years ago.  They made a clear choice and voted in favour of the following amendment: &ldquo;Subsection 3 of this section shall not limit freedom to obtain or make available in the State, subject to such conditions as may be laid down by law, information relating to services lawfully available in another state.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>It showed that the termination of pregnancy is not the simple black or white affair that the authors of the 1983 amendment made it out to be.  In 1992 many of us were forced to consider the moral and personal dilemma that Irish women with crisis pregnancies are forced to face.  There is widespread recognition that the 1983 amendment served the people, in particular women, badly.  The ramifications of the amendment placed women in a different and lesser category to the rest of the population.  It placed limits on their civil liberties which a modern society should take for granted &mdash; the right to travel and the right to information.  The 1983 amendment and many of its proponents did not recognise women as adults.  The same can be said about the amendment's stepchild.  Protocol 17 of the Maastricht Treaty.  I should refer to the responsibility of the Progressive Democrats in that regard.</P>
      <P>It is ironic that many critics of the Bill, those who would have liked to incorporate in it referral provisions, also refuse to see women as adults.  Women do not need to be taken by the hand and pointed in any direction.  They need to be given the information with which to make an informed decision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill does that.  Let us be clear about the fact that the Bill is not an abortion Bill but an information one and, as such, is likely to reduce the number of terminations.  All the available evidence shows that when provided with full information and counselling, a sizeable number of women decide to opt for an alternative to termination.  This Bill will ensure that women are not <Col N="58" /> press-ganged, through lack of information, into making an ill-considered decision.</P>
      <P>In 1993 it was recorded that 4,400 women left Ireland to terminate their pregnancies in the UK.  The available figures indicate that one in ten pregnancies are terminated.  As far as we know, the likelihood is that over the last few years 10,000 women terminated their pregnancies in the UK.  Rather than focus on an artificial division between those who are pro-choice and pro-life, we should concentrate on the socio-economic and medical issues surrounding these pregnancies.  It is becoming increasingly clear that family plannning services and information have still not reached all women.  The rise in demand for the so-called morning after pill indicates that many people are either unwilling or unable to take full precautions against unwanted pregnancies.  It is vital that we expand family planning services and extend what is available under the medical card scheme.  Even with those advances there will still be crisis pregnancies and the Government must face that reality.</P>
      <P>The facts are well known.  The majority of women who travel to the UK for termination do so without having obtained any form of counselling. Many women who wish to prevent an unwanted pregnancy are unable to get full and adequate information on family planning.  The provisions for family planning, while well improved, still do not fully meet the needs of Irish women. For example, tubal ligation is not fully available across the country for all who need it.  The national health strategy acknowledges shortcomings within the system and the vital role health boards could play in meeting the need.  In the meantime, many voluntary groups try to bridge the gap and get little thanks for their important work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Wicklow, the struggle for control has been embarked on by the local vocational education committee which has forbidden the Blessington womens' group from displaying IFPA leaflets in the group's premises which is owned by <Col N="59" /> the vocational education committee.  I have seen the leaflets concerned and, far from encouraging abortion, they advise women to consider how they would feel if they had a termination and to consult a pregnancy counsellor.  That represents non-directive counselling at its best and is precisely the kind of information provided for in the Bill.  At a time when the number of women travelling to England to obtain a termination is on the increase, women need more, not less, information in a context which respects their rights as adults.</P>
    <P>Women fought hard for that respect over the years.  In the past, pregnancy and childbirth was medicalised to a point where women were the passive participants in the process, 20 years ago a woman could not have somebody with her in the labour ward.  Partners or husbands were banned and could not give support.  Women in childbirth were automatically shaved, given an enema and subjected to an episiotomy.  A generation of women have the scars to prove it.  I do not believe this was done because of a vast male conspiracy on the part of doctors but I believe that the system changed only as a result of a concerted campaign by women who felt alienated by their experience of childbirth in hospital.  Through organisations such as AIMS, women have discovered the capacity to claim back their bodies. It is a lesson that should not be lost in this debate.</P>
    <P>The traditional patient-doctor relationship has changed.  Patients are likely to know more about what is wrong with them and more likely to participate in the cure.  They are better educated and informed and a good thing too.  In such circumstances referral is becoming less relevent.  Increasingly a general practitioner will give a list of 'phone numbers to a patient.  Many doctors of my acquaintance rarely, if ever, make a telephone call to the consultants themselves.  Who makes the telephone call is not important.  What is important is that a woman with a crisis <Col N="60" /> pregnancy receives accurate, appropriate and full information from a medical doctors or counsellor.  She should also be informed of the range of options open to her; this Bill allows for that.  Provision should be made for her own doctor to be able to send to the doctor abroad any necessary medical records; this Bill allows for that.  Lastly, the proper aftercare for the woman must be provided, so that she is advised of the necessity to return to her doctor for a check-up after the termination of pregnancy; this Bill allows for that also.</P>
    <P>A decision to terminate a pregnancy has major implications for the women concerned.  It has a medical, moral and personal dimension which must be considered by a woman in those circumstances.  It cannot be made lightly and should not be made under coercion or in ignorance.  Yet for thousands of women that is exactly how the decision is made.</P>
    <P>Abortion is part of the Irish experience, it is part of what we are.  Whether we like it or not, they are Irish sisters, mothers and daughters who are terminating their pregnancies and the fact that they are doing so abroad does not mitigate that reality.  I look forward to the day when we, as a society, face up fully to that reality.  None of us can take any joy from the fact that so many women choose to terminate their pregnancies. Children have a special place in our society.  Mothers and fathers often make super-human sacrifices for their children.  Nobody can doubt that the decision not to continue with a pregnancy is deeply distressing for the woman.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the first commitment stated in <i>A Government of Renewal</i> is to put in place research, education and counselling with the objective of minimising the circumstances in which such high numbers of women seek to have abortions.  We need to know why women are travelling in such large numbers, how we can enable more of them to choose another option. Keeping them ignorant or confused only makes matters worse.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="61" /> In the meantime, the Irish people have spoken through the ballot box and have clearly stated that women have a right to know.  This Bill constitutes the first step on the way to full social and political maturity.  At some point in the future, as a society, we shall have to confront the reality of crisis pregnancies and will have to revisit in full the 1983 constitutional amendment.  Society and social morals are not static: Ireland has moved on and grown up since 1983.  We are coming to the painful recognition that the comely maidens dancing at the crossroads may well be battered, bruised, abused or neglected.</P>
    <P>As legislators we are under an obligation to legislate for society as we find it, not as we would wish it to be.  We are obliged to legislate for imperfection. Democratic Left believes that, in the long term, termination of pregnancy must be dealt with in Ireland in certain very limited and clearly defined circumstances.  However, we are not a party of illusions &mdash; a revisiting of the substantive issue is some way down the road. We must confront the fact that abortion is an Irish problem and, as such, must be dealt with in an Irish context.  In the long term we cannot continue to export a large number of our crisis pregnancies to Britain.  As a society, we have to face up to this issue.  In the meantime, we must ensure that women are enabled to exercise their right, which right clearly stated by the electorate has not been incorporated into our laws.  The last Government had its opportunity.  The Bill now before us has a long history. There is a thread going back to the Bill produced by Dr. John O'Connell, when Fianna Fáil Minister for Health; there are far more similarities between the two than there are dissimilarities.  We need to be consistent on this.  The Irish people have spoken, women have a right to information, and, as a Government, we have a job of work to do.</P>

It is becoming ever more frequent for Members, particularly Ministers, to read what has been provided for them.  That is not acceptable.</P>
      <P>That being said, let me voice my view. I welcome the fact that, at long last, there is a Bill introduced on this subject even though, as my party colleague said, we find it contains distinct flaws.  The Minister for Health is to be commended on its introduction.  There are certain provisions I welcome but others with which I would find fault and on which I am in agreement with my party colleague.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Within any debate on abortion, information or whatever, it is essential to underline the necessity for counselling and aftercare services for women who take the option to have an abortion.  It has already been said that none of us likes the idea of women having to have an abortion.  One of my first contributions in the Seanad was on the infamous X case when we were confronted by the most extraordinary circumstance, in which a child of 14 years of age was literally imprisoned within this island and not allowed to go and have an abortion.  I have two teenage girls and I find it outrageous that somebody could <Col N="63" /> make a judgment in such circumstances and could say with absolute certainty if my daughter were raped that she would not be allowed to go to England for an abortion.  I could not and would not make that decision on behalf of anybody else.  That signifies my overall attitude to the provision of abortion information.</P>
    <P>What we have done to date is ignore the real position.  We have allowed, and continue to allow, women to travel to another jurisdiction to have an abortion. In a way, we all contribute to that hypocrisy.  I heard a colleague comment last week that this was a male solution to a female problem, which is one of our difficulties with this Bill.  I am not anxious that there should be wholescale referrals for abortion to the United Kingdom &mdash; nobody wants that &mdash; but I find it very difficult to accept that the doctor/patient relationship should be interfered with in any way.  The State really should stand back from that proposal, which is not acceptable.</P>
    <P>Members have made much of the fact that nowadays it is quite usual for a patient to be furnished with a list of doctors or consultants they may consult.  When somebody is advised, say to consult a consultant about a back ailment, the doctor is referring that patient to a particular consultant.  I believe talk about referral is in some way dishonest.  If I had to go to the doctor &mdash; and I certainly do not believe I would ever go to a doctor to seek an abortion &mdash; for treatment for a bad back ailment, I would like my doctor to consult directly with the consultant whom I would attend for treatment of that ailment. Once I had the necessary treatment, perhaps corrective surgery, that consultant should be able to deal directly with my doctor during aftercare.  If that is how I feel about a back ailment, how much stronger would I feel if I went through the awful trauma of deciding to have an abortion for whatever reason, and on returning home found I did not have access to the expert medical care I expected?  The provisions in the Bill <Col N="64" /> fudge this area and that is my main objection to it.  I consider the provisions are an instrusion on the essential relationship between a doctor and patient.</P>
    <P>The statistics quoted by the Minister earlier reveal that of the number of women who travel to England for an abortion more than half are over 25 years of age.  That is similar to saying that the glass is half empty, but it is also half full.  Half of those women are under 25 years of age and 19 per cent are under 17 years of age.  In those circumstances the most vulnerable of those young women need the greatest protection.  To exclude the role of their doctors in this regard means that young girls, in particular, are put at risk.  I do not believe that is something the Minister intended to include in the Bill.  I do not believe that he is being heartless in this regard, but he is trying to adapt to a political reality.  It is unfortunate that we should be framing legislation on what is essentially women's health with an eye to our political opponents or, perhaps, our political enemies.  It is a case of the Minister having to watch his back regarding this issue, but at least he is trying to cope with it.</P>
    <P>We will table amendments on Committee Stage and I hope the Minister will deal with them in the spirit in which they will be put forward.  I believe fervently in this issue as does my colleague, Deputy O'Donnell, who spoke eloquently on it earlier.  I ask the Minister to accept the amendment we will table to address the qualms I have about that aspect of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I am glad I had to step into the breach rather than let this important debate fall.  It has given me an opportunity I did not believe I would have to put on record my views on the Bill.  In debates, such as this, I will always try to avoid the politics surrounding the issues involved.  I do not believe that women's health should be made a political football.  There should not be pussyfooting and positioning by various parties around something as critical to women's health as proper information.  I appreciate <Col N="65" />&mdash; and I would not like people to get the impression that I have right on my side in this &mdash; the deeply held views of people on this issue and I respect them.</P>
    <P>As a woman, I consider I have unique experience which allows me to speak with perhaps more authority on this Bill than male Members.  I am not being sexist about that and speak from my experience as a mother.  I speak as someone who has had children and has never been in the unfortunate circumstances of having to contemplate having an abortion, but who has had the experience of meeting young teenage pregnant girls who have had nowhere to go and no one to talk to about their condition.  Fortunately, I was able to counsel those girls and they were looked after here and did not travel abroad for an abortion.  I am aware of the trauma such girls experience.  It is real and unique and in the case of young vulnerable pregnant females, some of whom are mere children, they must be protected.  I ask the Minister when taking Committee Stage to be humanitarian and accept an amendment in this regard which I will support.</P>
    <P>In regard to legislation such as this, one matter which I find distressing &mdash; Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn put the case very well &mdash; is the polarisation that occurs in our society because issues such as this are so emotive.  I, like I am sure other Members, have received letters and telephone calls about this issue. Obviously, people consider I have a certain view on this and I respect the point of view of others.  People on either side of the divide should consider the impact of the use of emotive language on our society in that it can create deep divisions on issues such as this.</P>

      <P>I am not sharing my time and I do not expect to speak for the full time available to me.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  I assure Deputy Keogh that there are Members on the Government side also anxious to contribute in hopefully a non-party political way to this important debate.  I must respond to a comment by Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn earlier during the course of her thoughtful and provocative speech.  She appeared to suggest that the Labour Party, unlike Fine Gael, could not be relied on in some fashion to seek to reduce the number of Irish women having abortions.  Also, the Minister made a reference to people pursuing a particular agenda, though clearly he was not directing that comment at the Labour Party.  The Labour Party deeply resents any suggestion that it cannot be trusted on this issue. Nobody of the Labour Party believes that abortion is or should be an easy option.  Unlike some other parties in this House, we have been advocating for some decades policies which would have had the effect of reducing the number of Irish women having abortions.  We have advocated comprehensive family planning and sex education in schools, policies which are now being acted on by this Government and by some of its predecessors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure all Members will agree that abortion is a difficult issue and poses ethical and moral questions, not least for people who have to make decisions, be they patients or doctors.  The present position arises from the X case which presented awful dilemmas for Irish people in recent years.  Most Irish people would probably consider they are anti-abortion and abhor the notion <Col N="67" /> of termination of pregnancy.  Nonetheless, the X case exposed a certain ambivalence in our attitude.  It forced us to publicly accept, perhaps for the first time, that there are hard cases and that there were circumstances where we did not feel the State should prohibit abortion.  We were not willing to prevent that young woman from travelling to England to terminate her pregnancy.  It is not difficult to think of other similarly hard cases where Irish people generally would not have felt it appropriate &mdash; or would not now feel it appropriate &mdash; to invoke the criminal law to prevent the termination of a pregnancy.</P>
    <P>The issue relating to information arose from the seizure of <i>The Guardian</i> newspaper and the banning of one or more issues of <i>Cosmopolitan</i> magazine and other such literature because they included advertisements for specific clinics in England, including addresses and telephone numbers.  It is important to bear in mind that was the backdrop to the 1992 referendum.</P>
    <P>I support the broad thrust of the Bill as an appropriate response to the democratic decision of the people in 1992.  I agree with the Minister that the objections of so-called pro-life groups are spurious.  I specifically support the requirement in the Bill that non-directive counselling should be provided to women with crisis pregnancies many of whom are distressed and feel they cannot cope.  It is very much a life crisis. They may not think logically, they may not have told friends or relatives about their position.  Some may even be susceptible to suggestion.  It is right that the Bill should provide, as it does, that non-directive counselling should be given in these circumstances.  It is right that women should be given the opportunity to make up their own minds.  Having said that, I share the concern of Deputy O'Donnell that we should not get into censorship.  We cannot expect every article in every newspaper, magazine or pamphlet that deals with abortion will be perfectly objective.  I would like to <Col N="68" /> see these provisions, if passed into law, interpreted in a reasonable and liberal fashion so that we do not find ourselves with a further layer of censorship which we can do without.  I support the provisions which deal with unsolicited pamphlets and the prohibition of financial gain to people involved in counselling.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister for bringing the Bill before the House so early in his term of office.  It is an issue which is difficult to deal with in Ireland and is one which has bedevilled us for some years and which, no doubt, will be around for many years to come.</P>
    <P>Having said all of that, I do not support some sections such as section 8 which is profoundly wrong and misguided.  I regret the decision of the Minister go try to distinguish between providing &ldquo;Act information&rdquo; and referral. That distinction is not real and I do not find the Minister's argument entirely convincing.  This section seeks to criminalise the relationship between patients and doctors in certain circumstances. Many doctors are opposed to abortion in any circumstance and have problems with the whole notion of terminating a pregnancy.  Many doctors will have problems in providing abortion information if this Bill is passed.  I respect their views.  They are entitled to their ethical viewpoints.  The Legislature cannot and should never attempt to oblige them to act contrary to their ethical beliefs and this Bill does not attempt to do that.  There are doctors &mdash; probably a small minority &mdash; who do not take that view.  There are doctors who, despite holding personal reservations about abortion, are willing to provide information which is requested by a woman and to facilitate the decision taken by a woman in a crisis pregnancy.</P>
    <P>If a woman, who has received counselling along the lines set down in the Bill, makes a decision to terminate a pregnancy and if a doctor is willing to make an appointment, it is wrong to use the criminal law to intervene in the manner set out in the Bill.  Section 8 is <Col N="69" /> an unwarranted intrusion in the doctor-patient relationship.  It is wrong in principle and it is something we will regret if we pass it into law.</P>
    <P>I am concerned also about section 8 (2) which deals with medical records.  It is usual practice here for a doctor to give medical records to a consultant and not to the woman.  A doctor could refuse to hand over records if the provisions, as currently outlined, stand.  I would regret that.  I regret too that it would be illegal to pass on the records to a clinic in England.</P>
    <P>The Minister is seeking to distinguish between providing &ldquo;Act information&rdquo; and referral.  In effect, he is saying that if a woman receives non-directive counselling a doctor can then provide her with a list of addresses, telephone numbers and of people to whom she should speak.  The Bill would also permit a doctor to say: &ldquo;you must or you may ring a particular number or go to a particular clinic&rdquo;.  I suppose it is also possible for a doctor or somebody in an agency to place a telephone in front of a person.  The moment the doctor takes up that receiver to make the phone call he or she is committing a criminal offence.  Frankly, that is absurd.  It is very much an Irish solution to an Irish problem or, as Deputy Keogh said it is very much a man's solution to a woman's problem.</P>
    <P>Some, perhaps not all, women are distressed by decisions of this kind but once the decision is made, a woman is entitled to understanding and assistance from all, not least from her doctor or her medical attendant.  Why must we insist that she make the appointment and the arrangements?  There are agencies and doctors who have experience in dealing with these matters in a professional and sensitive way.  I do not see why the criminal law should intervene to prohibit those agencies and doctors from doing what they see as their professional duty.</P>
    <P>The Minister cites, in support of his argument, a booklet produced by the Government at the time of the 1992 referendum.  It too seeks to distinguish <Col N="70" /> between information and referral.  That distinction is not real; it is in effect, a fudge.  The repetition of a fudge does not make it any less a fudge and in that I agree with the pro-life campaign.</P>
    <P>It is time we dealt with this issue honestly and openly and I fully accept the Minister has gone some distance in that direction.  There is much in the Bill with which I agree but I have some reservations.  I am appalled by the dishonest and opportunistic approach of some people in Fianna Fail.  I can reasonably except those currently sitting on the front bench from that view.</P>
    <P>I am told by Labour Ministers that this is the most honest approach this Government can produce and is all that is politically possible in current circumstances.  Some people on the Government benches &mdash; and this is not surprising &mdash; feel we cannot go any further at this time.  I accept that political judgment and for that reason I will support the Government on Second and Committee Stages.  Nonetheless, I look forward to the day when we can treat this matter honestly, when it will be possible not to pretend we do not have an abortion problem here.  That we do not have abortion in Ireland.  I look forward to the day when we can face reality as so many Irish women are already doing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The overall programme and the Minister's Second Stage speech are very important.  The Minister put his finger on an area where I have no dilemma in regard to this problem.  He stated:</P>
      <P>It should be clearly understood that we have an abortion problem and a significant one.  The latest official figures from the Office of Population Censuses and Surveys in the United Kingdom show that 4,399 women who had pregnancy terminations in Britain in 1993 declared themselves to be resident in this jurisdiction.</P>
      <P>I respectfully suggest this may be a conservative figure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That [&ldquo;official&rdquo;] figure alone is <Col N="71" /> equivalent to almost 9 per cent of our annual live birth rate.  But the reality is that we do not know how many Irish women have abortions in Britain &mdash; we do not know how many choose to conceal their Irish addresses, and give instead the address of a friend or relative living in Britain.  The true rate may well be significantly higher than the official figures suggest.</P>
    <P>I believe the figures are considerably higher.</P>
    <P>This issue is surrounded by hypocrisy and the sooner we face up to reality the better.  As legislators we have to address this problem even in the face of a campaign directed against many Members by organisations which are entitled to express their view.  However, Deputies who give into that sort of pressure are doing both this House and themselves a disservice.  Members of my party have given this matter due consideration and have come to their own conclusions on it.  As in the case of the parties opposite, members of my party have diverse views on this issue.</P>
    <P>During my time in politics I have taken great pride in promoting Ireland as a good place to do business and as a country with a young, dynamic, well educated and forward thinking work-force.  As a nation we can rightly be proud of our achievements in the area of international marketing.  As a member of the European Union, Ireland plays its role in the development of Europe as the most powerful trading force in the world.  In common with other members of the European Union, Ireland has its share of economic problems, for example, unemployment, which is the most damaging.</P>
    <P>We also have social problems such as marital breakdown, juvenile crime, drug abuse and poverty.  We cannot as an island nation expect to escape the tragic consequences of materialism and modern living.  Irish women seek the right to have abortions and people whose marriages have broken down seek the right of divorce, a right we have not given <Col N="72" /> them.  A divorce referendum will be held in September or October and I will address that issue then.  A cloud of sanctity does not hang over Ireland which was once known as the island of saints and scholars.  We have developed solutions for many of the problems with which we have to deal, an Irish solution to an Irish problem.  The export of our goods and services is essential to the continued development of our economy and there is a constant need to ensure that our exports are of the highest quality so that we are seen as a producer of top quality goods and services.</P>
    <P>All right thinking members of society regard the export of our social problems as a national scheme and disgrace.  During the last century thousands of our citizens were deported to Australia, Tasmania and New Zealand because it was felt there was no place for them in this country.  It was decided to deport these people rather than deal with the problems of a society deeply divided by barriers of class, religion and heritage. Today society is deeply divided about the way in which legislators should reflect in law its views on issues such as divorce and abortion.  We have a dismal reluctance to take responsibility for our problems and prefer to dump them on the doorsteps of other countries.  Solitary and pathetic boat trips to unfamiliar cities and conveyor belt abortion services are hardly reasons for celebrating our 73 years of independence from Britain.  In the case of abortion, independence from Britain is a gross misnomer.</P>
    <P>For many years thousands of Irish girls and women, often frightened, ignorant, alone and confused and always in emotional and physical turmoil and distress, have gone to England and other countries for abortions because they felt unable to see their pregnancy through to birth.  I cannot see into their hearts or hope to understand their pain and suffering and while my convictions tell me that abortion is wrong, as a parent I feel an abiding sorrow for any woman who has to deal with a pregnancy which she did not anticipate and <Col N="73" /> cannot face alone without the comfort of her family and the support of her doctor.  I felt a particular sorrow for those women who for a variety of reasons cannot share their worries and feel they have no option but to take the boat to England.  I am strongly opposed to abortion and thought that the Bill would provide for proper counselling services for women in advance of an abortion and the provision of funding for organisations which provide these services.</P>
    <P>It is very hard to legislate on moral issues.  In recent years we have seen the worst examples of the age old maxim, that hard cases make bad law.  The X case was a dreadful example of the difficulty in balancing the freedom of the individual with the rights of society as a whole.  This Bill further illustrates the difficulty in balancing the rights of an individual to live her life in accordance with the free will we all have with the need for a set of rules and obligations which enables society to function in an orderly manner.</P>
    <P>The electorate determined in the referendum which led to the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution that there is a right to obtain or make available information about pregnancy termination services outside the State. This Bill seeks to specify the conditions under which this information may be made available.  The measures in this Bill are the very least this House can take to comply with the limited expression of the people on this subject. It is a very small step in acknowledging the seriousness of the problem with which we have to deal.  It will not solve the problem &mdash; I do not know if there is a solution to it in the conventional sense &mdash; but it will offer some degree of comfort to pregnant women who may wish to terminate their pregnancies.</P>
    <P>No person could be happy at a woman's decision to have an abortion and any system designed to promote or advocate abortion has no place in society.  As in Iran and other societies, there are fundamentalists in our society.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="74" /> I hope they are clear on what I am saying and that they will not attempt to twist my words &mdash; I do not wish to be misquoted.  Abortion is illegal in Ireland and will remain so until the electorate decides otherwise.  This is not to say that legislators have the sole duty to marshal the forces of law against what is often referred to as the evil of abortion.  There is also a heavy onus on parents, teachers and religious leaders to deal with this problem.  I am glad the Catholic Church has expressed its opinion on the legislation.  I do not agree with this opinion but as part of the fabric of society it is as entitled as everyone else to express its view.  There are other religions in society and the Catholic Bishop has expressed an opinion on behalf of his flock, of whom I happen to be one.  I find myself in a very difficult position and do not know if God will forgive me but it is a chance I have to take.</P>
    <P>I see no reason a doctor or counsellor should not be able to advise a pregnant woman on the options available to her. To take this a step further, I see no reason a woman who, having been advised on all the options open to her, decides to have an abortion cannot expect her doctor or counsellor to write a letter of referral of a &ldquo;to whom it may concern&rdquo; nature setting out such pertinent facts as may be necessary from a medical point of view which she can give to the abortion clinic she attends. Surely this is the least a caring society should have to offer its members, but even that slight extension is not acceptable.  I look forward to the day when as a nation our self-sufficiency extends to all areas of social and economic life.</P>
    <P>Since our accession to the European Union in 1973 a wave of legislative measures from Brussels has radically altered the rights and responsibilities of our citizens.  Our membership of the European Union has resulted in significant improvements in the rights and freedoms of Irish people to live and work.  Successive Governments have made genuine attempts &mdash; often not very successfully &mdash; to enact laws to reflect the wishes of the people and a <Col N="75" /> mature and democratic society must, by the way it treats its citizens, have the courage to admit mistakes and rectify them quickly and decisively.</P>
    <P>We are in favour of a Bill to give effect to the result of the 1992 referendum and the will of the people.  The only surprise I wish to express about this Bill is that it has been introduced in advance of the outcome of the various court decisions on the matter.  While I am not deeply concerned about that, perhaps the Bill should be deferred for that reason.  Like the previous campaign on the referendum on abortion information, the forthcoming referendum on the issue of divorce will expose extreme reactions both for and against whatever proposals the Government makes.  At a time when we are asking all the people on the island of Ireland to look into their hearts and weigh up the future and the interests of Ireland as an island, the people must be trusted.  As we ask the Unionists in Northern Ireland to judge the Framework Document by its content, is it not reasonable to ask our citizens to apply similar criteria to their assessment of social and other issues?</P>
    <P>The issue of divorce is straightforward.  The law provides for divorce, called &ldquo;judicial separation&rdquo;.  The only difference in Irish law from divorce law in other countries is that once divorced here there is no legal mechanism to remarry.  It is absurd and inhuman to deny people whose marriages have terminated the right to try again.  In other words, why not give people an opportunity to enter a second marriage or, if necessary, a third?</P>
    <P>I accept that the people are entitled to make a decision in that regard, but it is absurd that people are not entitled to remarry.  However, sin ceist eile.  I will be supporting the proposals to allow people to remarry following divorce and it is regrettable that the Government does not propose to hold the referendum sooner rather than later.  I have a terrible suspicion &mdash; I hope I am proved wrong &mdash; that there will not be a referendum on divorce during the currency <Col N="76" /> of this Dáil.  That would be tragic.  There are thousands of people waiting for an opportunity to vote &ldquo;yes&rdquo; in a referendum on divorce.  I am not sure a referendum would be successful and for that reason perhaps it should not be held because, like the last occassion, it may be seen as a lost opportunity.  However, I hope the Government adheres to its promise to put that issue to the people quickly, clearly and decisively.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms F. Fitzgerald Ms F. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms F. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister for Health on bringing this Bill to the House and giving us an opportunity to discuss the issue in detail. Much of the coverage given to this issue has been of an extreme and fundamentalist nature.  I hope the tone and range of contributions here will provide for wider coverage and debate.  As Deputy Andrews stated, there is a problem in our society in regard to abortion and we must face up to it and talk about it in this House.</P>
      <P>I wish to say a few words about democracy.  The appeal of democracy comes from the idea that ordinary people rule.  The original word &ldquo;democracia&rdquo; literally means people power.  In a modern democracy people do not rule directly but through a representative system in which they have a say.  If that system is to keep the promises to the people it must satisfy two basic principles, namely, ensure that there is genuine popular control over the political process and that there is equality within it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1992 the people voted on three issues, travel, information and abortion. The decisions were clear with &ldquo;yes&rdquo; votes on the first two and a rejection of the amendment dealing with abortion.  It was very clear during the campaigns leading to polling day that the amendment on information was concerned with detailed information on the names, addresses and telephone numbers of clinics providing lawful abortion services in other jurisdictions.  Both sides in the campaign knew that this was at issue and many of those advocating a &ldquo;no&rdquo;<Col N="77" /> vote were at pains to point out in campaign literature and in media comment that a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote would bring about the provision of such details.</P>
    <P>In 1992 the Irish people considered for the first time the issue of abortion, and the circumstances of women and girls facing crisis pregnancies, in real rather than hypothetical terms.  Prior to that our thoughts could not imagine that whatever decisions were made would affect real people &mdash; women of all ages and from all backgrounds, who would face this most serious situation.  Gone were the myths which had enabled so many people to distance their thinking from reality, allowing the dismissal of all women who opted for termination of a pregnancy as singularly selfish and irresponsible chosen only for some flippant social reason.  This is very far from the truth.</P>
    <P>In 1992 we began to listen to Irish women who experienced crisis pregnancies.  The stories of those who have picked up the pieces from yet another Irish solution over the past decade or so are chiling.  A study carried out by people who worked with such women states:</P>
    <P>We have heard stories of loneliness, isolation and fear.  We have also heard countless stories of rape, sexual abuse and battering.  Although Irish society has preferred to ignore the experiences of these women, they are our mothers, our sisters, our daughters, women who have had to make difficult decisions in an atmosphere of fear and silence.  Women have called our telephone numbers from the corners of Kerry and Donegal because they felt they had no one else to talk to.  By and large they were right.  Most of the time they got our telephone numbers secretly &mdash; a sympathetic doctor, a students' union, a public toilet, a piece of graffiti or even a televised news report showing footage of campaign demonstrations.</P>
    <P>That has been the experience of many women.</P>
    <P>This report goes on to say that by the <Col N="78" /> time calls came through many women had already made up their minds about an abortion and were seeking important information about the implications of abortion for their health and the levels of care available at various British clinics.  Sometimes women would seek advice about further counselling and other options available to them.  It is very clear that there has been and continues to be great silence around the issue of abortion here.  We get our statistics from England on the numbers of abortions which Irish women have there.  The latest figure for 1993 is 4,399 women.  There is no doubt these statistics under-represent the actual numbers of those seeking abortions because it is clear that many women do not identify themselves, or give their Irish addresses, when they go to England.  Irish women are acutely aware of the rush to judgment on this issue and their decisions taken alone reflect this.</P>
    <P>It is not good enough that we get our statistics from England.  It is critical that any woman facing a crisis pregnancy gets the best possible support.  It is important to bear in mind the mental turmoil that a crisis brings about and the nature of the crisis.  The issues facing a woman in such a crisis are major &mdash; who to tell, who to trust, what to do, how to think the crisis through, where to get support, the implications for the future; the list is endless.  I worked as a social worker for many years, working with people in crisis and it is clear that in a crisis it is important that the person has the time and the space to think clearly and without pressure.  I know from that experience that the principle of self determination, of making the decision as to how best to resolve the crisis oneself, is fundamental in determining the best course of action.  Force, manipulation, or direction from a third party, no matter how well meaning, is not the answer.  The best decision will be the one reached freely and with the benefit of all the information available.</P>
    <P>We have a long history of trying to deal with this complex, legal, ethical, personal and moral decision through <Col N="79" /> constitutional means, and the Constitution has proved a dismal failure in reflecting this issue adequately.  It fails almost as dismally as it fails to reflect the real position of women in Irish society in the 1990s.  On either side of the debate there is genuine commitment to reducing the level of abortion, but the anti-abortion and pro-choice movements are tackling the issue from such different perspectives that there is little dialogue.  In 1992 we saw the vast middle ground.  The instinctive and sincerely held views of people all over the country began to emerge.  Essentially, people began to distinguish between aspirations and State interference in deeply intimate individual decisions.  It became clear that widespread opposition to abortion is far from absolute and that there are circumstances where many people believe the option should be available and that, most certainly, women have the right to travel and to know about services in other countries. The people decided that the implications of an absolutist stance on abortion were unacceptable and we, the legislators, must reflect the will of the people and face up to what that means in practical terms.  It is our job, as legislators, to make our laws respond to the views of the public as expressed in 1992, not to the canvassed views of highly motivated minorities.  The majority of people in this country want information to be available to women who may be planning or thinking about abortion. The Bill sets out to respond precisely to those views.</P>
    <P>I am sure many Deputies in this House have come under pressure not to speak.  I welcome the fact that people are contributing.  However, the public need to know about the intensity of the lobbying campaign that has been carried on, the intensive phone calls and the strong language used.  This puts pressure on and that intense pressure cannot be underestimated.</P>
    <P>The Bill attempts to deal with some <Col N="80" /> of the social realities surrounding abortion.  I particularly welcome the Minister's commitment to research.  I remember trying to get research on this issue on a political agenda just four or five years ago but it was impossible. One could not even speak about it. There was no support for it and no commitment to putting money into researching the issue and beginning to understand it in more detail.  That commitment is in the programme for Government, and it has been made again here this morning.  That is important because we need to base legislation on good information, and research will ensure that the information we have gets better and better. The announcements the Minister made in connection with the Bill take a more holistic approach towards addressing the high rate of abortion among Irish women.</P>
    <P>Many people want to respect individual women's different situations and at the same time would like to encourage a moral standard that would reduce the number of abortions.  However, in the 'phone calls I have been getting, I have been struck by the lack of reference to individual women and the extreme difficulties they face as opposed to a generalised deeply-held view against abortion, which I respect.  It is the difficulties that individual women face that we must examine and understand and try to cater for.  Most women are going without counselling, without information.  The Bill addresses this.  It ensures that medical information will be available and that post-abortion care can also be available.</P>
    <P>I have spoken in the House on many occassions on the need to move forward to ensure that equality for women becomes a fact and that the necessary supports for the family are in place.  The framework within which we must work to reduce the level of termination of pregnancy among Irish women includes education, employment, access to training, more flexible work arrangements, financial support for families, effective family planning services and a more <Col N="81" /> open approach to issues of sexuality and responsibility with our young people.</P>
    <P>Even as I speak there are many women in Ireland coping with a crisis pregnancy.  I want to comment on the effect on them of the tone of some of the discussions and coverage outside this House.  I believe that the approaches taken by some groups mean that these women are more likely to be frightened, to distrust Irish society, and to go in secret for an abortion in England.  The tone of some of the comments on abortion in this country is more likely to induce panic and fear in women already in crisis.  That is why it is important to have a comprehensive discussion in this House.</P>
    <P>The assumptions underlying the Bill that information and counselling are important are likely to be more helpful to women facing a crisis pregnancy. That is true.  The assumption that more information necessarily leads to more women deciding to go to England must be questioned.</P>
    <P>Powerful energy has gone into the abortion debate over the past 13 years and it is time that the same energy went into the creation of a more equitable society which fully respects women and accords them their rights and sets out to support families, not pay lip service to them.  We are making some progress, but more would be possible if the many interests which are concerned with the abortion issue could focus their attention on and contribute their ideas to the empowerment of women.</P>
    <P>Abortion is not solely about women and the choice they might make.  There is the question of men's role in all this, their share of the responsibility for conception and their attitudes to family and children.  Men would be wise to give some thought to these matters, to the degree to which their behaviour and attitudes contribute to both the level of crisis pregnancy and the numbers of Irish women who make the choice to terminate their pregnancy.  In this House, and in the party rooms where this was discussed, there were many men and few women.  Because of the <Col N="82" /> nature of our democracy, which is an unfinished one, there are far too few women in this House.</P>
    <P>A study, entitled &ldquo;If You Ever Go Across the Sea to England&rdquo;, of 200 Irish women who travelled to England for an abortion in July 1991, found that only 11 per cent of the mothers and 4 per cent of the fathers of single women knew about the pregnancy.  One of those interviewed, a 26-year-old receptionist, said: &ldquo;I feel this questionnaire may be of some benefit in helping to establish counselling in Ireland both for young girls afraid to ask and people like myself who know of nowhere else to turn&rdquo;.  Of these 200 women studied in detail who had abortions in England, 151 were single, 32 were married and 17 were separated.  The three groups of women faced different kinds of social pressure.</P>
    <P>The study showed the lack of discussion on sexuality within families, that sexuality is a taboo subject in the Irish community between Irish parents and children and that the abortion rate could be reduced if the women used birth control more regularly and if more efficient methods were used.  A 44 year old married women, pregnant because she thought she was sterile commented: &ldquo;To leave someone pregnant, desperate, mentally exhausted with no one to turn to for advice or help, and just told to get on with it, is criminal&rdquo;.  The isolation of these women is clear.  Another women said that the British people and their medical service saved her from suicide.  A 20 year old apprentice solicitor told of her humiliating experience of driving around Dublin trying to find a telephone number on a poster.  All these examples are cited in the study.  These women are desperate for support, have nobody to talk to and no place to get information.</P>
    <P>The Bill attempts to deal with a complex situation which has been evolving since 1983 when the people, in agreeing to a constitutional amendment which it seems reflected the aspirations of most people, did not anticipate the consequences of what occurred in 1992. <Col N="83" /> One of the consequences was that question marks were placed against the right of women to travel and receive factual information.  This was an appalling infringement of basic human rights and not in keeping with the intention of a great many of those who supported the 1983 amendment.</P>
    <P>Many aspects of the Bill should be considered carefully.  On the issue of ring-fencing counselling whereby the doctor or counsellor is not involved in making an appointment or in the provision of a letter of referral, I place great value on non-directive counselling and empowering those in crisis to make their own decisions and to act on them.  There is an element of affirmation when an individual is able to take complete control and implement a decision.  I look forward to further discussions on this issue on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Deputy McDowell mentioned that he had concerns about doctors.  In a letter to <i>The Irish Times</i> Dr. Leonard Condren stated:</P>
    <P>This prohibition [on referral] is not of central importance to those of us who have been providing non-directive counselling and abortion information for many years.  I rarely, if ever, make an appointment for a patient to see a specialist colleague.  One simply provides names and addresses and the patient is regarded as being sufficiently adult to make the telephone call him or herself... This Bill reverses the inappropriate intrusion into the doctor/patient relationship advocated by the Pro-Life Movement. Should it be passed these difficult dilemmas will be solved in the confidential consultation between the patient and the General Practitioner without fear of State intrusion.  I can now look forward to practising comprehensive informed patient care in an atmosphere devoid of censorship.</P>
    <P>That is the view of one general practitioner dealing with women who face crisis pregnancies.</P>
    <P>We should examine the question of <Col N="84" /> access, standards in counselling and whether women can choose the support service they determine they need.  No woman should leave these shores without being counselled and I hope the standard of the services available to women will be high.  The Bill does not deal with this issue, it refers only to enforcement.  We have a responsibility to ensure that a framework is put in place to ensure that the services are delivered properly and meet the needs of women.</P>
    <P>The research programme the Minister intends to implement will be helpful in planning for the future and will assist us in moving towards the much needed discussion on reproductive rights and freedoms and to dismantle some of the underlying thinking and attitudes which do not accord women the respect they deserve as full and equal human beings, moral agents, competent and responsible.  If we trusted Irish women how would we respond to this issue?</P>
    <P>Unlike many of my colleagues, I have worked with women and explored the issues surrounding abortion.  I have listened to the experiences of women who have made the journey to England.  I want to see women's rights and freedoms respected in Irish law.  As a legislator, I want to contribute to creating a situation where women can make their own decisions and where crisis pregnancies become the exception.  I hope that we are taking the first, albeit, tentative steps from a censorial and penalising approach to women with crisis pregnancies to one where we begin to work with honesty and openness.  For that reason I welcome this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not happy with this Bill and resent the charge that I am engaging in stroke politics or hypocrisy or that I am being dishonest.  I am sincere and deeply concerned about this matter.  I did not become concerned only on the day Fianna Fáil went into Opposition.  Last October I raised this issue at a parliamentary party meeting after the draft on which the previous Government was working was leaked to <Col N="85" /> the newspapers.  It is clear that members of Deputy McDowell's party do not fully support the Bill.  It was rumoured that the original draft was much stronger and I acknowledge and accept that it has been watered down and the wilder excesses deleted.</P>
      <P>I was amused by comments from a Labour Party source, as reported in the newspapers today, expressing concern about the fortunes of Fianna Fáil.  It was suggested Fianna Fáil might lose some middle class voters if it pursued its objections to the Bill.  I am touched deeply by his concern.</P>
      <P>At a political level, why has this Bill been introduced now? There was no mention of it a few weeks ago.  The divorce referendum was pencilled in for late May but because that matter is the subject of a challenge in the courts it has been deferred for the moment.  It seems therefore that this Bill has been presented to show that the Government is pursuing its liberal agenda.  In the parties that comprise the rainbow Coalition there are differing views and it seems the Government had to do something during this session to appease the loony Left or the loony liberals.</P>
      <P>It has been suggested that the Bill was slipped out last week to take advantage of the publication of the Framework Document.  I recall that Members of this House accused the previous Government of issuing the report of the beef tribunal at the same time as the announcement of the ceasefire in Northern Ireland for that reason.  Why does Fine Gael always engage in aimless flag waving? It adopted the same approach when it was last in Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On this and all other social legislation there are differing views and a reasonable effort should be made to bring people on board.  Aimless flag waving does not constitute good political leadership; rather one should lead by example and bring the pack along.  One could draw a good sporting analogy with the peloton in a cycle race.  It tends to be nicely bunched and have a nice configuration.  The cyclist who shoots ahead <Col N="86" /> achieves nothing, he tends to be hauled back after a few miles.  If he gets away, he tends to lose everyone else.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>No one saw that Bill. In the peloton the leader tends to suck the others along in his slipstream.  A greater effort should be made to bring people on board and meet their objections.  The Minister and Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn were reasoned in their contributions and adopted a calm tone. Some people might say we have been having this debate for the past 13 years. I have not been a Member of this House for that length of time but I have been living in the real world and have not been totally immune from the issue.  I am a democrat and I accept what was approved by the people in the 1992 referendum but what did the people approve? The booklet issued at that time to every household laid down what would and would not happen and we cannot ignore that.  Whether one is conservative or liberal, one cannot change the rules after the people have decided on an issue.  That is dishonest and we must be honest with the people.</P>
      <P>We must make a distinction between promotion and assistance of abortion and referral.  Providing the names and addresses of abortion clinics is unacceptable.  It is promoting and assisting abortion and is an abdication by the State of its obligation to protect unborn life.  It is in total conflict with the commitments given in 1992 and with what is contained in the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On reading the Bill last week I thought the Minister had steered a middle course on this issue and that there would be less objection to it, but having seen the Minister on television over the weekend he heightened rather than allayed my fears in this regard because he implied that referral did not mean the writing of a letter by a doctor. I understood that referral meant the <Col N="87" /> doctor would write a letter but the Minister made it clear that in most cases the doctor does not write a letter.  He admitted that providing the names and addresses of clinics was referral.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot agree with the Minister on the difference between referral and promotion and assistance of abortion.</P>
      <P>The effect of this Bill would mean that while our laws upheld the right to life of the unborn, the State would provide all the necessary facilities for someone wishing to travel outside the State for an abortion.</P>
      <P>There have been various arguments about the interpretation of the 1992 referendum.  I recall disputes arising at meetings of Dublin City Council at the time &mdash; Deputy Flaherty would be familiar with this &mdash; because some books had been removed from libraries.  I accept that action was ridiculous, that we have moved on from that and that we cannot go back beyond November 1992.  I wonder what were the various interpretations of the 1992 referendum. Perhaps we were all a little confused by the fact that a general election was being held on the same day.  If there had not been a general election that day all these matters might have been teased out to everybody's satisfaction.  My understanding of what we were doing in 1992 was that we were allowing general non-directive information to be provided without giving specific information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If a doctor gives names and addresses of abortion clinics to a pregnant woman seeking counselling who is considering abortion, that act flies in the face of the spirit and the letter of the Constitution. I accept there are different interpretations of the 1992 referendum but it must be considered in conjunction with the <Col N="88" /> 1983 amendment to the Constitution. Whether we like it or not the 1983 amendment upholds the right to life of the unborn.</P>
    <P>The only purpose in providing names and addresses of abortion clinics to a woman is to facilitate an abortion.  It is wrong to argue that if one gives such information to a woman in those circumstances it should be regarded as non-directive counselling.  A women in such circumstances is seeking such counselling for a specific purpose.</P>
    <P>A comparison has been made with giving the names and addresses of drug dealers.  That may not be a fair comparison but it raises certain questions.  The Bill treats an unborn baby as a non-person.  How does that conform with Article 40.3.3º of the Constitution which upholds the right to life of the unborn? Giving the names and addresses of these clinics is fundamental to the whole argument and I do not see how we can get away from that.</P>
    <P>This Bill is unacceptable to me.  It endangers the lives of unborn children and it does not conform with what was put to the people in 1992.  It goes far beyond what was required by the passage of that amendment and I believe it will promote and encourage abortion. which is in conflict with the Constitution.  I accept women will travel abroad for abortions but the State should not make statutory provision for that, having regard to the 1983 amendment.  This Bill will help create an abortion culture and give abortion a cloak of respectability.</P>
    <P>Under EU law everybody has a right to services that are available and legal outside the State.  The laws on drugs may be far more lax in other countries of the EU &mdash; euthanasia is legal in Holland.  I suppose Ireland will go down that road in regard to such information being available.  Reference was made this morning to the need for an amendment allowing doctors to have an opt out clause.  The Minister commented to the effect that that did not seem necessary, which was surprising.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the argument has been made in the UK that a person from the age of 15 upwards can avail of these services without parental approval.  Under a certain age young girls should have the approval of their parents and I strongly object to any demands that information be given to young people without the approval of their parents.  I wish to comment on the question of lobbying as referred to by some speakers this morning.  We are all lobbied on various items.  I received a few 'phone calls and letters this week, as I do every week on issues, and it is unfair of politicians to object to lobbying when we do not agree with the other person's viewpoint.</P>
      <P>The Minister devoted a couple of pages of his speech to counselling, which is very important.  At our parliamentary party meeting yesterday many people spoke about the need to greatly improve the counselling services available to women, and I agree with them. I support the increased allocation of funding to groups such as Cura, Life Pregnancy Care Service and Cherish, although it is a small amount compared with the funding allocated to the Rape Crisis Centre.  I am not suggesting that the allocation to that organisation should be watered down, but there is an imbalance in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister referred to the provision of a comprehensive family planning service to people with medical cards.  In future if a woman finds that the only option open to her is to go to the UK for an abortion, will demands be made <Col N="90" /> that her bill be paid? If that happens people may suggest that since it is costing so much to pay for people to go to the UK it may be cheaper to provide the service here.  My concern is that there could be ongoing demands in this regard.</P>
    <P>The problem in this area relates to the substantive issue and I hope that is addressed in the legislation.  Various court cases refer back to 1983 and the substantive issue should not be left up in the air; it must be dealt with.  There are many groups trawling the countryside for a case to bring to the courts which would again have the country in hysterics.  It is better to deal with these matters in a calm, reasoned fashion.  I hope in the coming months the Minister addresses the substantive issue, even if it means holding another referendum and letting the people reiterate or change their 1983 decision.  The court decision in the X case was not in accordance with what the people voted for in 1983.  The whole matter needs to be reconsidered.  Many people believe that agreement was given in the 1992 referendum to the provision of information, but that referendum must be taken in the context of Article 40 of the Consitution.</P>

This morning's debate has been very calm and reasoned but perhaps if there had been public debate for a few weeks some people might have taken a different point of view.  There are certainly extremists in all battles but it is possible to change people's minds if debate is conducted in a reasonable manner.  I hope the Minister will reconsider this <Col N="91" /> matter and that in the event that the Bill goes to Committee Stage he will be open to change.  Some people believe the Bill is beyond amendment but that is a matter for discussion.  If greater notice was given of the Bill and there was more public debate inside and outside the House the fears of some people may have been allayed and a different approach taken to the matter.</P>

      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to make a few brief remarks on this legislation.  I am aware of the sincerity of my constituency colleague who just spoke and I know he is consistent in these matters.  I hope he listened to the whole of this morning's debate.  If he listened to a few more such debates he might not be deluded into thinking that this is a problem to which there is a simple solution.  I agree that many of our concerns relate to the 1983 referendum and indeed beyond.  That referendum tried to address the issues simplistically, but in the years since then we have learned it is sometimes impossible to reconcile two competing rights: the right to life of the child and the right to life of the mother.  A unique relationship exists between a mother and a child in her womb, and it cannot be treated simplistically.  The two lives are interlinked and the issues of life and death are more complex than in other areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the contributions of my colleague, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, Deputy O'Donnell and others who tried to address broadly and frankly many of the issues involved and I will not go over that ground.  This legislation is a response to the 1983 referendum as amended by the three 1992 referenda. We are dealing with just one of the issues in this Bill.  I agree with my colleague that the substantive issue must be addressed but it will take a number of years to respond to all the matters that arise, including the interpretation by the courts of the 1983 amendment. We are constrained by the terms of the the amendment to the Constitution passed by the Irish people.  We are also <Col N="92" /> constrained by commitments in European law, which the Irish people freely accepted and acknowledged by way of referendum.  The finding of the European courts were known to the Irish people at the time they voted on the information issue.  The Minister instead of neglecting the matter and letting the current position of legal limbo continue, decided to clarify the position by putting forward a conservative proposal that is consistent with the commitments given publicly during the course of the last referendum.</P>
    <P>There are constraints involved in providing information on services legally available elsewhere and providing general information on abortion.  People were offended by the tearing out of pages from magazines and the withdrawal of books from libraries, and they wished to see that problem resolved, but that is not the only problem that existed, as suggested by Deputy Ahern.  There was also the issue of the right to information and services legally available and the right to travel, which does not need to be further defined.  Perhaps if there was room for further interpretation of the right to travel, certain sections of society would suggest that people should be stopped in that regard.</P>
    <P>I share the concerns expressed by Members on the question of referrals. There are those who see referrals as an act of involvement in encouraging abortion but on the other hand women in their thousands who decide to have an abortion are left to make their own arrangements.  I have reservations about the obligations we are placing on doctors who having counselled young pregnant 11 and 14-year olds, presumably under the care of their parents, have to leave that child and her parents to fend for themselves on the basis of the information they may have given them.  I am sure we will come back to this issue on Committee Stage and I think we will benefit from the discussion on it.  Deputy Ahern and others may not have read <i>The Cork Examiner</i> this morning which reports on the front page <Col N="93" /> the case of an 11-year old who is pregnant as a result of a sexual attack by a 54-year old man.  We know there have been many other critical cases similar to the X case, it is not a simple issue that will go away, it will recur and it will be up to Members to resolve it.</P>
    <P>One of the very welcome elements in the Bill is the substantial commitment to counselling and research.  Some of my colleagues have reflected on how times have changed &mdash; it would have been unacceptable even to discuss this subject 20 years ago and women who went abroad for abortions were treated almost like criminals, not legally or technically but in the way the issue was hidden.  It has been proven that counselling and research are successful in reducing the numbers of abortions and I believe this will be a contribution to achieving the shared objective that as few as possible should ever choose this means of resolving a crisis.  I would have considered these issues during my college days when my experience would have been of friends and colleagues in college and post-college facing a disruption in their life when they found themselves with a crisis pregnancy and had to make choices and now I am in the category of the 40-year old mother of four for whom another pregnancy may present grave problems.  To some degree that is treating it lightly but there are very serious issues behind it.  As Deputy Frances Fitzgerald said it is important to put faces on it if we want to understand what women need at certain times to cope and make a different choice.  Therefore, I very much welcome the provision of counselling.</P>
    <P>A critical element is the question of family planning.  The Minister made a commitment to a comprehensive family planning service.  This is very welcome as the present service is very patchy. The cost of the service is an issue that needs to be resolved.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill in so far as it tries to deal honestly with the situation.  I believe that on the question of referral the Minister was, on balance, right to <Col N="94" /> decide to honour the public commitment made by the previous Government that there would be no direct referral allowed and he has set the boundary.  As I said I am in two minds on that because I am concerned about the real situations of women and children who are in a vulnerable position and are left to fend for themselves and to travel abroad for an abortion.  I look forward to having the opportunity to consider this more carefully on Committee Stage.  I understand that the Minister was constrained by the public commitment given at the time the people voted on the referendum for detailed information but made a specific separation between providing information and making a referral.  I think the Minister had to make a difficult decision as a result of that public commitment.</P>

Party Members expressed their view in a very frank and open way, all opinions were represented but everyone in the party is opposed to abortion being legalised in this country. I think it is wrong for an anonymous Government spokesperson to try to rubbish a decision made by the only party in this House that has a representative in every single constituency in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="95" /> I support the case made by my colleague.  Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, that we should await the court decision.  The Government has decided that the divorce referendum cannot be held until such time as a court decision has been made.  Having regard to the length of time the case has been before the court it is reasonable to await its outcome, I think everybody accepts this.  While people voted in the referendum for information the problem hinges on the question of referral for an abortion in another state.  If one were to look at the decision of the Supreme Court in the case of SPUC <i>v.</i> Open Door and Well Woman Clinic delivered by Mr. Justice Finlay:</P>
    <P>...no right could constitutionally arise to obtain information the purpose of the obtaining of which was to defeat the constitutional right to life of the unborn...</P>
    <P>The Court both declare that the activities of the defendants, their servants or agents in assisting pregnant women within the jurisdiction to travel abroad to obtain abortions by referral to a clinic; by the making of their travel arrangements, or by informing them of the identity and location and method of communication with a specified clinic or clinics are unlawful, having regard to the provisions of Article 40.3.0º of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>Subsequently Mr. Justice Walsh in his concurring judgment in the case of SPUC <i>v.</i> Grogan stated:</P>
    <P>...the fourth option put forward by the defendants though admittedly in a non-directive and non-judgmental manner is the option of the death of the unborn life.  This is beyond question in open conflict with the eighth amendment ... the intentional destruction of unborn life is not a permissible option.</P>
    <P>As regards names and addresses, the Minister rightly stated that this does not <Col N="96" /> appear in the Bill before the House. However, the memorandum which was circulated to us states:</P>
    <P>This Bill applies only to information which is likely to be required by a woman in availing herself of pregnancy termination services, for example, the names and addresses of such services and the methods of contacting them.  Throughout the Bill such information is referred to as &ldquo;Act information&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It is dishonest for the Minister to come into the House and say that names and addresses do not appear in the Bill when that is not what he has in mind.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;since there was no reference to names and addresses in the Bill, the matter did not arise.  The amendment to Article 40.3.3º was put clearly before the people:</P>
      <P>This subsection shall not limit freedom to obtain or make available in the State, subject to such conditions as may be laid down by law, information relating to services lawfully available in another state.</P>
      <P>It stated clearly it would permit non-directive counselling of pregnant women but not abortion referral.</P>
      <P>We all want to reduce the number of abortions.  A woman with a crisis pregnancy is entitled to the care, concern and compassion one would expect from members of the health care service.  As a doctor, when a woman in that position comes to see me I have two patients to consider &mdash; the mother and the child and both are entitled to the best level of service I can provide.</P>
      <P>The Minister said the issue of a conscience clause was catered for in the Bill. I am not satisfied with that as there is no conscience clause in the Bill and I appeal to the Minister to insert it.  Deputy Fitzgerald referred to a letter written by Dr. Leonard Condren to <i>The Irish Times</i> in support of the legislation.  Yesterday morning I received a letter from a young lady doctor who is not associated with any pro-life organisation.  She was writing as a general practitioner in this country and referred to an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> last week written by Kieran Conway headed &ldquo;Lack of Medical Legislation Criticised&rdquo; who stated that in the continuing absence of legislation, if a doctor declined a termination in circumstances analagous to the X case, he or she could well be liable for any ill-effects arising from the pregnancy.  That concerned the doctor who wrote to me.  She stated in her letter:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Enclosed is a cutting from <i>The Irish</i><Col N="98" /><i>Times.</i> I do not know how true the highlighted statement is but it is horrific that it has come to this in this country.  One of the reasons I did not want to be a GP in Britain was because of the casual way GPs treated abortion referral like a referral for anything else.  Despite directives from the British Medical Association, the Royal College of General Practitioners and the family planning associations stating they should explain alternatives in the course of the initial consultation, this does not happen.  In one case I heard a family planning doctor say to her patient: &ldquo;of course if you are pregnant you will have to have an abortion&rdquo; because the lady had a mild psychiatric problem... You can imagine how widespread this attitude is among doctors.  There is also an opt out clause in Britain which, in my case, was always respected and I hope this would be incorporated into Irish law so that GPs would not be coerced into information referral.</P>
    <P>That is significant and represents the views of Irish doctors generally.  It is important to refer to the Family Planning Bill, 1978 in which the then Minister for Health, former Deputy Haughey, inserted a conscience clause in section 11.  Anyone involved, an employee of a health board or the health care services could opt out of providing services under that section if they so wished.  In the British Abortion Act, 1967, section 4 is devoted to a conscience clause so that conscientious objectors do not have to participate one way or the other.  It states:</P>
    <P>...no person shall be under any duty, whether by contract or by any statutory or other legal requirement, to participate in any treatment authorised by this Act to which he has a conscientious objection.</P>
    <P>It further states that the obligation of proof for the objection lies with the person claiming to rely on it.  It is a substantial conscience clause and I ask the Minister to write such a clause into this <Col N="99" /> legislation so that there will be no ambiguity and doctors will not be concerned that they may find themselves in court as a result of this legislation.</P>
    <P>A referendum was held on the substantive issue of abortion in 1983.  The people decided by a majority of 4:1 that they did not want abortion in this country.  Their decision was clear to everyone.  The Supreme Court interpreted that decision in a way which is legally correct but differed from the views expressed by the people.  Perhaps it was wrong to hold the referendum in 1983, perhaps it was correct to do so but, the point is, we must move on from where we are.  The Supreme Court decision left us in a legal limbo.  I agree with Deputy Noel Ahern that the people would be given another opportunity to decide on the issue.  As legislators, we do not have the right to legislate for an issue on which we know the people made a decision in 1983 by a ratio of 4:1.  The electorate should be afforded another opportunity to express its view on the substantive issue before we are confronted with some other court case, the result of which will be referred to this Legislature when, in a knee-jerk-type reaction, we shall have to introduce legislation.  Very often such speedily prepared legislation is bad.</P>
    <P>I might point out that practically all local authorities, supported by Members from all sides of the House, passed resolutions requesting that the electorate be given another opportunity to decide on the substantive issue.</P>
    <P>Debate adjourned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht (Mr. M. Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the National Monuments (Amendment) Act, 1994, anyone in possession of an unreported archaeological object discovered since 1930 must report it to the National Museum of Ireland no later than 21 February 1995.</P>
      <P>The National Museum has informed me that many hundreds of items have been handed in to the museum, that more have been reported by telephone but not yet fully processed.  The museum is not in a position to give a precise figure at this stage as the statutory deadline for reporting has just expired.  From the assessments carried out to date the museum reports that while many of the objects reported or returned are of minor significance, some comprise important antiquities.</P>
      <P>While it is too early to come to firm conclusions, it would seem that section 5 of the 1994 Act has been quite successful in meeting its objective.  When assessment of the reports received is completed, the National Museum will have a more comprehensive picture of archaeological objects in circulation, including when and where they were discovered or acquired, than heretofore. This information, when assimilated, combined with the other provisions in the 1994 Act, will make illegal trade in archaeological objects of national significance more difficult for those who view our national heritage simply as objects to be bought and sold.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Like the Minister, I am delighted there was such a good response to the provisions of the 1994 Act given that we all acknowledge the need to protect all our archaeological objects and that, in order to achieve that objective, there is need for a system of reporting, of which this will be the beginning.  I am sure the Minister would also accept that it is appropriate to acknowledge the work done by the <Col N="101" /> National Museum, by local museums, by historical and archaeological societies, libraries and other outlets in disseminating information, particularly the brochure made available by the National Museum.</P>
      <P>Considering that this proposal will entail a much greater workload for the National Museum of Ireland, will the Minister agree that greater emphasis should be placed on the need for staffing so that further work on the museum could be undertaken?  Furthermore, will he acknowledge that, in response to this new development &mdash; which has been so encouraging &mdash; greater emphasis should be placed on the need for regional museums and a structure for each put in place?  Will he say whether such will be considered within the context of the legislation in the offing on museums?</P>

      <P>I agree with Deputy de Valera that the excellent information brochure produced, called.  Protecting our past &mdash; a Short Guide to the National Monuments (Amendment) Act, 1994 &mdash; was of great assistance in encouraging people to comply with the provisions of that Act.  When that Bill was introduced there was agreement on all sides of the House that our heritage was our common property and we should do everything possible and/or necessary to protect it, which is the intention of the relevant legislation.</P>
      <P>In answer to the Deputy's second question on staffing resources of the National Museum, these are kept under continuous review.  In any event, we shall have to review them when the interim report on the future of the National Museum is delivered to me. Certainly, the future of museums generally, and how they might meet the requirements of curatorial security, conservation, safe transport, or whatever, is a matter to which we can return when discussing the forthcoming cultural institutions Bill which will deal with museums and libraries.</P>

    <P>My commitment to publish a Green Paper on broadcasting is reiterated in <Col N="103" /> the policy agreement, <i>A Government of Renewal.</i> I circulated a draft of the Green Paper to my Cabinet colleagues for their observations recently.  I hope to formally present it to government shortly, prior to publication.  The purpose of the document will be to stimulate debate on the relevance and adequacy of the current broadcasting legislation and structures in today's highly competitive broadcasting environment so as to ensure that Irish broadcasting services remain the preferred choice of Irish viewers and listeners into the next century.  The funding of commerical and community radio services and the role of the Independent Radio and Television Commission will be issues addressed in the Green Paper. Chomh maith leis sin, díreofar ar na struchtúir buan is cuí do Theilifís na Gaeilge.  Following the consultative period &mdash; which will follow publication of the Green Paper &mdash; I will develop appropriate legislative proposals.</P>

      <P>De réir an eolais atá tugtha don Teach ag an Aire, ó thaobh clódóireachta agus dearaidh de, tá costas £8,500 ar an leabhar seo <i>FÍS,</i> gan a chur san áireamh cá mhéad a chosnaíonn an páipéar agus an cháipéis a scaipeadh-d'fhéadfá a rá go bhfuil, b'fhéidir, suas go dtí £10,000 i gceist ar fad.  Ba mhaith liom a fhiafraí den Aire, an fiú an méid sin airgid a chaitheamh ar fhoilseachán den sórt seo.  Nuair a léann tú é feiceann tú go bhfuil a lán pictiúr ann &mdash; an raibh sé riachtanach 17 bpictiúr den Aire féin a fhoilsiú sa leabhar seo&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>B'fhéidir go bhfuil an ceart agat, a Cheann Comhairle, nach bhfuil sé ceadaithe taispeántas a dhéanamh i leith eagráin thábhachtaigh mar seo, ach tá se léirithe ag an Teachta Ó Maoilia &mdash; agus tá mé buíoch de &mdash; go bhfuil an t-eagrán ar fáil i mBéarla agus <Col N="107" /> i nGaeilge.  Níl a fhios agam conas is féidir grianghraf a thógáil i nGaeilge agus ceann eile a thógáil ar bhealach eile i mBéarla, ach tá mé ag súil leis an eolas sin.  Chun freagra a thabhairt maidir leis an eolas a bhí sé á lorg uaim, bhíomar tar éis Roinn nua a bhunú agus a lán nithe nua a dhéanamh.  Mar shampla, cuireadh tús le cúrsaí scannánaíochta agus físe agus bhí baint agam féin lena lán de na gníomhartha sin.  Ar ndóigh, maidir leis na heagráin a fhoilseofar amach anseo, beidh siad ag plé le oifigigh eile i mo Roinn agus, má bhíonn suim ag an Teachta beith páirteach linn chun na haidhmeanna atá fúinn a bhaint amach, beidh spás ann dó féin sna grainghraif.  Maidir leis an méid a dúirt sé faoi na grianghraif den fhoireann tá tábhacht ag baint leo.  Tá sé ceart go mbeadh aithne ag an bpobal, ní amháin ar ainmneacha, ach ar na daoine a mbíonn siad ag plé leo agus atá i gceannas ar na foranna i mo Roinn.  Is beartas maith é agus tá mé lánsásta go bhfuil an t-éileamh chomh mór sin ar an eagrán.</P>

Mar fhreagra ar an gceist a thóg sé féin, ní gá pictiúr a fhoilsiú le Béarla agus ansin an ceann céanna arís le Gaeilge.  Is é an pictiúr céanna é agus ar chostas £10,000, d'fhéadfaí tithe a dheisiú sa Ghaeltacht agus a lán rudaí eile.  Cén fáth, a Aire, nach raibh aon tagairt do thograí sa Ghaeltacht nó dul chun cinn sa Ghaeltacht, seachas Teilifís na Gaeilge.</P>

    <P>Tá an deontas tógála i bhfeidhm ó mhí Feabhra 1993 agus an deontas feabhsúcháin ó mhí Lúnasa 1987.  Tá an deon <Col N="112" /> tas breise díon tuí bhfeidhm ó mhí Aibreán 1990.</P>

    <P>Go deimhin, cuireann sé iontas orm an méid imní atá a léiriú ag an oiread sin Teachtaí de chuid Fhianna Fáil faoi na deontais sin ag an bpointe seo, agus gan ach roinnt míonna imithe ó ghearr a gcomhleachaithe a bhí ag gníomhú mar Rialtas ag an am na putóga as na meastacháin tithíochta céanna ar 29 Samhain 1994.  B'fhéidir nach gcreidfeadh daoine go mbaineann na Teachtaí seo leis an bpáirtí céanna a ghearr £800,000 &mdash; breis agus 63 faoin cead &mdash; as na meastacháin tithíochta Gaeltachta a bhí aontaithe do 1995, rud a chiallódh go mbeadh deireadh leis na deontais feabhsúcháin tithe.  Bhí ormsa, mar thoradh ar sin, cuid mhór ama agus oibre a chaitheamh ó d'fhill mé ar an Roinn roimh Nollaig ag iarraidh an t-airgead sin a fháil ar ais, i dtreo is go mbeadh dóthain airgid ar fáil do na deontais tithíochta Gaeltachta i 1995.</P>

An nglacfadh sé leis go bhfuil arduithe móra tagtha ar chostais tógála sa tréimhse sin agus go bhfuil costas de beagnach 50 faoin gcéad sa bhreis ar theach a thógáil ar oileán ná ar an mhórthír agus go bhfuil sé riachtanach go mbeadh deontas sásúil ar fáil chun cabhrú le daoine tithe a thógáil.

      <P>Mar a dúirt mé, an chéad jab a bhí agam ná an scéim féin a chosaint agus tuigfidh an Teachta ón am a bhí sé féin sa Rialtas go ndéantar ionsaí gach bliain, beagnach, ar an scéim mar nach bhfuil sé ar fáil taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht.  Ag glacadh leis an méid <Col N="113" /> a bhí le rá ag an Teachta Molloy, is fíor nár tháinig méadú ar an deontas le deich mbliana beagnach ach caithfidh mé é sin a chur i gcóthéacs chosaint agus leathnú na scéime.  Is féidir liom a rá ag an bpointe seo chomh maith go bhfuilim ag déanamh coimriú ar an scéal iomlán agus b'fhéidir agus é sin á dhéanamh agam go mbeadh am agam féachaint ar na costais atá ag baint leis.  An rud atá tábhachtach mar a dúirt mé ná go bhfuil an scéim ghinearálta faoin dtír imithe. Tá scéim mhaith ann agus ba chóir é a choimeád sa Ghaeltacht áit a bhfuil go leor seandaoine.  Chomh maith leis sin ar na hoileáin tá costais speisialta i gceist maidir le hobair thógála agus fheabhsúcháin.</P>
      <P>I gcóthéacs na scéime agus an choimriú a bheidh á dhéanamh air, beidh mé sásta féachaint air go ginearálta ach ní féidir liom agus nílim ag tabhairt geallúintí ag an bpointe seo.</P>

An gciallaíonn sé sin ná go raibh sé socraithe aga an Rialtas sin deireadh a chur leis na deontais tithíchta agus deontais fheabhsúcháin Ghaeltacht?  An é sin a bhí i gceist nó an bhféadfadh an tAire barúil a thabhairt dúinn faoi sin? Tá sé thar a bheith tábhachtach go mbeadh a fhios againn cad a tharla.</P>

      <P>Níl Clárach ann <i>per se</i> don Ghaeilge agus don Ghaeltacht maidir le cúnamh ón Aontas Eorpach ná níor lorgaíodh cúnamh ar an dóigh sin ón Aontas. Baineann na limistéir Ghaeltachta tairbhe as Cláracha agus as Scéimeanna an Aontais Eorpaigh don tír i gcoitinne de réir mar a bhaineann siad léi &mdash; mar shampla. Scéimeanna an Roinne Talmhaíochta, Foraoiseachta agus Bia le haghaidh tionscal na feirmeoireachta, an Clár Feidhme d'Fhorbairt Rionscail, an Clár Feidhme Iascaigh, etc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Thug mé eolas ar 31 Eanáir 1995 mar fhreagra ar Cheist Dála Uimh.  98 ón Teachta Ó Maoildhia maidir leis na Cláracha aus na Scéimeanna a mbaintear feidhm astu go príomha ag mo <Col N="115" /> Roinnse, Údarás na Gaeltachta, Pobal na Gaeltachta aus comhlachtaí Gaeltachta i dtaca le forbairt na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>Go sonrach faoin bhFo-Chlár don Ghaeltacht, atá mar chuid den Chlár Feidhme d'Fhorbairt Tionscail 1994-1999, tuaraítear go mbeidh caitechas de £119 milliún sa sé bhliain i gceist agus go mbeidh £38 milliún den tsuim sin le fáil ón Aontas Eorpach ar mhaithe le forbairt tionscail sa Ghaeltacht agus Údarás na Gaeltachta.

Má tá sé sin fíor tagann sé trasna ar an méid a dúirt a Roinn le ANOIS i mí Feabhra 1993 nuair a dúradar go raibh sé socraithe go raghadh ionadaithe ón Roinn go dtí an Bhruiséal chun cás na Gaeilge a chur os comhair an Choimisiúin.  B'shin an rud a bhí mé ag iarraidh a fháil amach.  Ar tháinig aon toradh as an trip sin nó ar tharla an trip sin ar chor ar bith?  Tá fhios agam faoin chaladh mór in Árainn agus mar sin de.</P>

      <P>Tá freagra simplí ar cheist an Teachta.  Nuair a thosaigh mé mar Aire Ealaíon, Cultúir agus Gaeltachta i mí Eanáir 1993 cheap mé féin, chun a bheith an-oscailte leis an Teachta, gurb é an bealach ba éasca ná go mbeadh mo Chlár Feidhme féin agam don réimse nua a bhí faoi mo chúram.  Sé sin mo Programme Headings féin.  Ní raibh sin ar fáil dom toisc go raibh na cainteanna ag pointe áirithe i gcomhchainteanna leis an Choimisiún. <Col N="116" /> Bhí clár socraithe ag an am ag fo-scéim do Roinn na Gaeltachta.  Tógadh an t-ullmhuchán sin agus cuireadh é i gcomhthéacs an phlean don Oidhreacht a bhi curtha ar aghaidh go dtí an Coimisiún. Sin mar a tharla sé agus ag an bpointe seo, mar a luaigh mé, tá airgead uile do chúrsaí Gaeltachta scaipthe ar chláracha éagsúla &mdash; mar a dúirt mé, ceann i leith cúrsaí tionscail agus fostaíochta ar leibhéal amháin agus ceann atá ag plé le cúrsaí mara ar leibhéal eile agus mar sin de.  Tá na suimeanna aimsithe.  Ach ní bheadh sé ceart a rá agus níl sé á rá nár ghlacadh aon seans chun cás na Gaeilge a dhéanamh.  Tá an t-ullmhúchán go léir a bhí déanta don Ghaeltacht roimhe seo taobh istigh de na moltaí a cuireadh ar aghaidh i leith cúrsaí oidhreachta agus tá gach cás déanta ina leith sin.</P>

Bhí sé mar aidhm agamsa Teilifís na Gaeilge a bhunú.  Bhí an gealltanas sin tugtha.

That enabled me to place a heritage order on the site of the <i>Lusitania</i> and will ensure that dives near the wreck cannot take place without a licence.  Legislation on the salvage of wrecks is also in place requiring that objects discovered must be reported and the advice of the Director of the National Museum sought.</P>
      <P>The recent media reports about an unauthorised dive after I placed the heritage order on the site are being investigated by the gardaí.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister comment on the reports in the newspapers on 4 February about an unauthorised dive?  Is he aware that an out of court settlement was recently made in the United States between Mrs. Light and Mr. Bemis over the ownership of the wreck?  Where does that leave the Irish nation in regard to ownership of the artefacts?  What does the Government propose to do about <Col N="122" /> this?  I understand the Minister has instigated legal proceedings in the United States.</P>

      <P>I gave the House as much information as I can.  Media coverage of the <i>Lusitania</i> is couched mainly in terms of valuable objects.  A total of 1,095 people lost their lives in the tragedy and I put a heritage order in place not only to protect the artefacts on the wreck but to protect the site as a grave.  I understand that an out of court settlement was recently made in the United States in the Bemis and Light case.  One of their claims was based on ownership of the vessel and the other on salvage rights.  The Irish interest would arise if a person inflated that judgement to make a claim for objects left on board the wreck.  The passengers' next-of-kin are entitled to property rights and the Irish State is the beneficiary of the Sir Hugh Lane's will.</P>
      <P>A specific interest would arise in regard to the codicil to the will if the paintings referred to were, for example, impressionists.  In his main will Sir Hugh Lane left all the remaining paintings to the National Gallery.  I sought the advice of the Solicitor General in this matter and we are having our interests represented in the United States.</P>
      <P>On the other matter that was raised it would be important, at an appropriate stage, to assess the present state of objects there.  In that regard a senior member of my Department has worked to establish what was carried on board, what is there and what reports are available to us on people who have died.  At an appropriate stage I will have discussions with my colleague, the Minister for Defence and for the Marine, to decide on the most appropriate measures.</P>

I have been sharing with the House such information as we had.

      <P>A report was made by a very serious-minded, Irish-based diver that an unauthorised landing has been made on the site of that wreck by British divers since the underwater heritage order was made.  How far has the investigation into that incident gone?  Will these British divers be apprehended and charged?  What action does the Minister propose to take, and how seriously is he taking that report?</P>
      <P>Is the Minister satisfied that the Irish Naval Service, with all the demands made upon it, have the resources to police the wreck in the manner in which it ought to be policed if the underwater heritage order is to have any effect and act as a deterrent to unauthorised diving?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="124" /> The second part of the Deputy's question relates to vigilance on the site.  The Minister for Defence, who has had discussions with me, has responded positively to my request for the use of the Naval Service in aid of the civil power. In addition we have been offered co-operation from fishing vessels.  Also on his suggestion, we are preparing notice of our order for the Hydrographer of the Department of Defence in Britain which means that the existence of the order will be brought to the attention of all people likely to use our waters.</P>

      <P>Like Deputy Quill I am worried about the enforcement of the underwater heritage order.  When this question was raised before we were assured that the Departments of the Marine and Defence would do all they could to police the area.  I asked then, and I ask now, whether they have the personnel and the back-up to do that and, if not, what will the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht do to implement such underwater heritage protection?  When will the Minister publish the report of the investigation into the unauthorised dive which is supposed to have taken place on 4 February?</P>

      <P>As to its publication. obviously the Garda Síochána will liaise with the Minister for Justice.  When I read the report I will decide what action is appropriate.  It would be well for Deputies to bear in mind that I had no doubt in placing this underwater heritage order; it was the right thing to do. If an issue of resources to implement it arises, I will address that.  The important thing at the moment is that I will examine the report of the Garda Síochána or its breach and take such action as is appropriate to vindicate the order.  That is the right thing to do at this stage.  I have also sought the co-operation of <Col N="125" /> others in ensuring that the order is respected.  That is as far as we can go now and I will be delighted to bring further information to the House as matters proceed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanMcGahon" hpid="Mr. McGahon Mr. McGahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGahon</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that, 80 years having elapsed since that tragic occurrence, it is time significant efforts were made to retrieve whatever treasures are on the <i>Lusitania</i>?  It is easy to place an underwater heritage order.  Nevertheless, does the Minister agree that, if we are to eventually derive any benefit from it, the State should take steps to retrieve whatever can be salvaged?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I had no doubt about the propriety of placing the heritage order.  It is the first time a heritage order was made in relation to the high seas and it was the fact that previous Governments asserted their right to maritime jurisdiction that made the order possible.  To be fair to those with responsibility for this in the past, diving technology has advanced in recent years, making it possible to do things with more safety now than was possible before.  It is also important to have discipline in relation to the site.  Then one should seek to assess what is there.  One of the worst aspects of pillage is that property of people who lost their lives has already been removed from the <i>Lusitania</i> and put on the market and the idea that there would be indiscriminate dives with the removal of objects, some of which are the property of those who have succeeded people who lost their lives and some of which would rightly benefit the Irish people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I applaud the Minister's responsible approach to this problem.  Is the Minister aware of newspaper reports that there may be valuable Rubens and Titian paintings on the wreck? I understood the Minister to say earlier in that context, and in the context of Sir Hugh Lane's will, the Irish Government would take part in court proceedings in the United States to secure, if that is <Col N="126" /> appropriate, ownership of those valuable paintings which newspaper reports suggest could be worth £20 million or more?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Without prejudice to any such legal actions as may be taken by the Department.  I can say that a senior member of my Department has sought information and has made considerable progress in establishing that the paintings were in the possession of Sir Hugh Lane as he embarked on the <i>Lusitania.</i> It is also clear that there are two references to paintings in the will of Sir Hugh Lane.  One is in the codicil which refers to impressionist paintings. Most people concentrate their arguments on that, and that is the matter which was the subject of agreement between the British Government and ours.  I renegotiated that agreement during the period of the last Government.</P>
      <P>In regard to the general parts of the will, there is an unequivocal statement in the will of Sir Hugh Lane, the part of it that has been witnessed and administered, that all his other paintings were left for the benefit of the Gallery.  I have sought legal opinion and it is my intention to assert the rights of the Irish people as beneficiaries of any possessions to which they are entitled if a claim is made following the completion of proceedings in the United States. One can then move to discuss the complex legal issues involved such as who has the right to dive and if they need permission.  It would also be appropriate to begin thinking about what exactly remains and the condition of the vessel after such a long period.  It appears it is true that special arrangements were made at the time involving the use of lead and sealant.  That is the approach we are taking.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the action the Minister has taken so far on this issue. Given that there has been a number of unauthorised dives has he considered authorising an organised dive on behalf of the State to retrieve whatever <Col N="127" /> national treasures remain notwithstanding the other issues involved to which he alluded correctly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I have and it is a matter to which I will return.  The issue of what the Deputy and I and others would wish to do has to be resolved in the context of the property issues which are complex.  These were the subject of contention in the courts in the United States less than two weeks ago.  I will have to take this into account in making a decision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>The time has come to bring the speculation to an end.  There are strong claims on both sides of the argument.  Some experts allege that all the treasure/trove has been removed and that nothing remains apart from a corroded mass of tangled metal.  There is no good reason the Minister on behalf of the State could not authorise an official inspection of the wreck since it lies within our jurisdiction.  Why is the Minister not proceeding along those lines to bring the speculation to an end? There is a danger that unauthorised divers will exploit the wreck in the hope that there is something they can plunder which can be converted into cash.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I have answered that question already.  Without doubt the heritage protection order stands.  We have to proceed with prudence and caution in the resolution of the property issues involved.  I have to respect those just as I expect others to respect the rights of the State.  The matter will be investigated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister can inspect the wreck.  In recent weeks he has repeatedly asserted that it is the site of a mass grave and that this justifies the granting of an underwater heritage order.  If that is the case, it follows logically that there is an obligation on the Minister to grant an underwater heritage order in respect of every wreck around our coast, including those of the <Col N="128" /> Armada.  That makes nonsense of the concept.  There is only one justification for granting an underwater heritage order in respect of this wreck and that is that we, as a nation, have rights to whatever remains.  I urge the Minister to expedite the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9, 26, 31, 44 and 68 together.</P>
      <P>The Deputies will be pleased to know that the policy agreement for Government, <i>A Government of Renewal,</i> contains a commitment to improving the protection for listed buildings, including placing the system of listed buildings on a statutory basis and introducing incentives for the proper upkeep and maintenance of such buildings.</P>
      <P>A preliminary meeting to discuss the issues involved has been held between officials of my Department and officials of the Department of the Environment, and a working group made up of those officials and officials of the Office of Public Works is being set up to examine those issues further and to report back with recommendations to myself and to the Minister for the Environment.  In consultation with the Minister for the Environment, I will give careful consideration to this report and to the introduction of any necessary new policy initiatives in this area.</P>
      <P>I am very aware of the problem posed to owners of historic houses which are open to the public by the high costs of public liability insurance and I have asked that this matter be included in the remit of the working group.</P>
      <P>The existing provision for tax relief in this area is section 19 of the Finance Act, 1982, as amended by section 18 of the Finance Act, 1994.  This provides for full relief from income tax or corporation tax to the owner or occupier of a building of significant historical, architectural or aesthetic interest in respect of expenditure incurred in the repair, maintenance, or restoration of such a building, subject to the provision of public access to the building.  This relief also extends to any garden or grounds of an ornamental nature occupied or enjoyed with such a building.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the urban renewal schemes, the full construction costs incurred in <Col N="130" /> the refurbishment of an existing building in a designated area for residential purpose can be offset against the owner-occupier's and/or lessor's tax liability over a period of ten years.  In the case of existing buildings which are refurbished for certain approved commercial uses, excluding offices, half of the construction costs can be offset against the owner-occupier's and/or lessor's tax liability over a period of ten years. These incentives apply to listed buildings in the same way as to other buildings.  In general, the urban renewal tax incentives schemes favour refurbishment over new construction.</P>
    <P>In addition to these tax relief provisions, the National Heritage Council, which comes under the aegis of my Department, provides grants for heritage projects, including projects for repair and restoration of buildings, subject to my approval.  The Heritage Bill, 1994, which has recently been passed by this House, and which will now be returning to the Seanad, provides <i>inter alia</i> for the establishment of the council on a statutory basis.  One of the functions of the council will be to propose policies and priorities for the protection of our physical heritage, including the built heritage.  Section 10 of the Bill will provide for increased protection for heritage buildings owned by public authorities.</P>
    <P>The conservation and restoration of urban architecture and heritage buildings has also been addressed by my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Howlin, in the context of the urban and village renewal sub-programme of the operational programme for local and rural development which was launched on 2 February 1995 by the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>This sub-programme will <i>inter alia</i> provide support to civic trusts, conservation groups and local authorities to promote various urban conservation measures in towns throughout the country.  The scheme will involve giving grant aid to local authorities and other bodies on the basis of matching funds from local sources.  The objective will be to <Col N="131" /> rehabilitate the built environment, in city-town centre areas, through the conservation and restoration of urban architecture and heritage buildings.</P>
    <P>Following receipt of a report from the interdepartmental working group previously mentioned, I will be reviewing the existing provisions for the protection and preservation of buildings of architectural or historical interest and taking steps to improve the existing situation where weaknesses are identified.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister indicated that a working group comprising officials of a number of Departments is being established.  I hope that officials of the Department of Equality and Law Reform will also be included, given that the owners of many of our heritage houses are encountering difficulties in obtaining insurance cover.</P>
      <P>As Second Stage of the Occupiers' Liability Bill is before the House and may reach Committee Stage in two weeks' time, I hope the Minister takes a proactive role in this regard.  What will be his approach to solving this difficult problem for those people who own heritage homes and wish to make them available to the public but who are afraid to do so because of the legal situation?</P>

      <P>I want to be positive in my response to the Deputy.  I agree that the public liability issue is an important one.  In relation to the requirement, I am in favour of usages being allowed other than for visitors and perhaps we should think in terms of architectural students, historians or people who might be of assistance in sustaining these houses.

Will he agree that the standards of excellence pursued by the Office of Public Works should be commended by everyone in this House? I accept the Minister has advanced many areas of the artistic life of the country, particularly the film industry, but as he has so many responsibilities within his own Department, the taking on of additional responsibilities may not be wise.  Will the Minister clarify the position?</P>

      <P>I do not find the new responsibilities that have been given to me an intolerable burden.  In accordance with the Government programme, responsibilities in relation to wildlife and whales have been transferred to me by a previous order.  The Government has taken a decision today which concludes the transferring of other functions previously held by the Minister for Finance in relation to parks, monuments, etc.  I agree with the Deputy that the Office of Public Works has carried out excellent work over a very long period.  The standard of that work will continue and my admiration for those in the Office of Public Works who deliver such a high level of excellence remains as it was when I paid tribute to them over 20 years ago as a young Senator.</P>

      <P>On Question No. 9, will the Minister concede that effective conservation legislation is lacking?  Will he admit that many of the buildings recently built under the urban renewal schemes have done little more than replace old buildings that had a certain charm with buildings that are not any better, in some cases, than modern slums?  Is the Minister concerned that much of the money spent on urban renewal schemes has done little to enhance the architectural landscape of our cities and towns?  What would the Minister recommend should be done to rectify that?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not interfere with any of the bodies which are at an <Col N="133" /> autonomous distance from me.  The new Heritage Council, which will be established on a statutory basis, will give much more effective protection and will have an educational role.  The corpus of heritage legislation dealing with national monuments, libraries and museums and the amendments to the Wildlife Act will give us a set of instruments which will provide for a very good heritage regime in Ireland.  To legislate is one thing but to change public attitudes is another and the best way of approaching the heritage responsibility is by building, as much as possible, on a partnership with local authorities, individuals and the State to achieve our objectives.  I find it difficult to disagree with the Deputy that mistakes have been made which have been destructive of heritage but it would be equally wrong to say that those who sought to breathe new life into areas where it had been quenched were perpetrators of a generalised philistinism.</P>

I understand that it will be presented to me very soon and I will be taking decisions following consideration of the advice which I receive. As the Deputy will be aware, one of the tasks of the interim board is to advise me on the housing of appropriate elements of the museum's collections, including the national folklife collection at venues outside Dublin, having regard to the Collins Barracks development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new facilities at Collins Barracks will provide the opportunity to tell the <Col N="135" /> story of Ireland in a comprehensive way, using elements of all the museum's relevant collections including the folklife collection.</P>
    <P>Against this background the Deputy will appreciate that the statement of the director of the museum in the calender indicating that 1995 witnesses the beginning of the transfer of the museum's folklife collection to Collins Barracks is premature.  I have taken no decisions regarding the permanent location of the national folklife collection in its entirety.</P>

The Minister will accept that funding for the Collins Barracks museum was provided by the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Bertie Ahern.  We have a particular interest in this and we would like to support the Minister with regard to Collins Barracks.  Has the decision been made that the national folklife collection should be in the Collins Barracks or will it be housed elsewhere?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>This morning I asked the Minister about his statement that names and addresses are not dealt with in the Bill.  In the document circulated to us he states that one section deals with names and addresses of services and the methods of contacting them. The Minister said that is a constitutional right.  On what does he base that information?  There are conflicting views in that regard.  Why, if it is a constitutional right, is it included in the Bill?  My colleague, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, requested that the Bill be left aside until appeals before the court are heard.  The point about the constitutional right to names and addresses shows the difficulty that exists in legislation.  What will happen if the courts decide the opposite to what the Government is asking us to legislate for?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recognise the need for legislation.  It will give effect to the decision of the people in the referendum, that information should be available to women. The difficulty arises in intepretation of what constitutes referral.  That is the kernel of the issue.  I accept there is a very thin dividing line in this regard. <Col N="169" /> The Minister referred to the relationship between a patient, a general practitioner and consultant.  He said that in many cases when a patient visits a general practitioner the general practitioner will give the patient a note with the telephone numbers of a consultant, and the patient then contacts the consultant.  I think it is accepted by all doctors that that constitutes referral.  I have no problem with the provision of medical records, patients are entitled to them.</P>
    <P>The most important point is the need for support for pregnant women.  It is very important that a good support system is put in place for these people and a very caring approach must be adopted.  Education and counselling on the alternatives to abortion are also very important.  That area should be developed by the health boards and voluntary organisations involved.  A very caring approach must be adopted in terms of the woman who has an abortion and counselling services should be readily available.  Why does the Minister believe Ireland has the highest abortion rate in Europe?  As I understand it, the figure is about 8.2 per cent while it is about 28 per cent in a number of European Union countries.</P>
    <P>Financial support is important for voluntary organisations such as Cura and the Life Pregnancy Care Service.  We must provide the finance for health boards to develop proper counselling services.  It is important to recognise, as has been recognised by UNICEF, that Ireland is the safest place in the world to have a baby.  With proper support and a high standard of health care &mdash; we are fortunate to have a high standard of health care &mdash; I hope through counselling we will reduce the number going abroad for abortions and will arrive at the point where abortion will not be seen as an option.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ColmMHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1981 the then Taoiseach, Dr. Garret FitzGerald, gave a clear commitment to the people of Ireland when he pledged his support for an anti-abortion amendment to the <Col N="170" /> Constitution.  As a result, Article 40.3.3º was inserted in our Constitution in 1993. It states:</P>
      <P>The State acknowledges the right to life of the unborn and, with due regard to the equal right to life of the mother, guarantees in its laws to respect, and, as far as practicable, by its laws to defend and vindicate that right.</P>
      <P>The word &ldquo;abortion&rdquo; was not mentioned in any shape or nature.</P>
      <P>In 1986 the High Court ruled that abortion referral was unconstitutional but this Bill could be classified as abortion referral.  In 1988 the Supreme Court handed down a similar ruling and in 1989 the Supreme Court again ruled that publishing the names and addresses of abortion clinics was assisting people to procure an abortion and, therefore, was unconstitutional.  In 1991 the European Court of Justice gave a similar decision and the High Court did likewise.  The X case was heard in February 1992 and the Supreme Court ruled that abortion was illegal where the life of the mother was in danger.  In November 1992 there was a referendum to amend the Constitution.  Three questions were put to the people.  The part of the amendment permitting abortion where the life of the mother was in danger was defeated, however, the amendments on the right to travel and to information were passed.</P>
      <P>In 1994 the Well Woman Centre sought a ruling under the 1992 amendment that it could publish a list of abortion services legally available abroad. As we know, this case has not been decided upon, but now we are discussing the Regulation of Information (Services outside State for Termination of Pregnancies) Bill, 1995.  I made those comments because it is important to relate the background to this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The overwhelming majority of people here do not agree with the deliberate killing of the unborn child.  Most people are aware of the many women who go abroad to have an abortion but our Constitution makes quite clear what the <Col N="171" /> wishes of the people are.  It is clear, therefore, that the Government must make available counselling and information for these women to advise them why they should not go ahead with the abortion or killing of their child.  People must be fully informed of the various options open to them.  This Bill in my opinion includes abortion as an option together with the other options for not having an abortion.  In my opinion, this is contrary to Article 40.3.3º.  The Supreme Court has ruled that issuing the names and addresses of abortion clinics abroad is contrary to Article 40.3.3º of the Constitution.  The Well Woman Clinic has again brought a case before the Supreme Court, which has adjourned the case for the time being.  I appeal to the Minister not to go ahead with this Bill until the Supreme Court gives its ruling.  The Minister has said the decision may not be handed down for another year or two and, therefore, the situation regarding the right to travel and information must wait, specifically the second part, information.  I find it very difficult to understand this statement.  The legislation is in place and it is a matter for the Supreme Court to interpret its meaning&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I appeal to the High Court and to the Supreme Court, as the case may be, to make this decision as soon as possible so that the Government can carry out its responsibilities in a proper way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister is saying that Fianna Fáil lacks courage on this matter, let me tell him that it is not lacking courage.  It is wrong of him to say so as a defence for his Bill.  The Fianna Fáil Party is looking for political consensus on this <Col N="172" /> issue and that is the way it should be but it would appear that the speedy introduction of this Bill is not giving us that opportunity.  That is reason enough not to proceed with this Bill.  I accept that new legislation has to be introduced, but it would be better to wait and make sure it is proper legislation as there is no sense in rushing such an important matter through the House.</P>
    <P>I understand there are no other Government speakers.  It is obvious the Government is trying to rush the Bill through and bring the debate to a speedy conclusion.  Will the Minister explain why Government speakers do not want to speak on the Bill?  There are many Deputies on the Government side who would like to say what we are saying but perhaps they have been restricted from doing so.</P>
    <P>Before the referendum in 1992 Fianna Fáil issued a leaflet to the public which clearly stated that a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote would not mean giving the right to issue the names and addresses of abortion clinics outside the State.</P>

I do not understand how the information provided for under this Bill can be justified when it is clear the people decided they were anti-abortion in the 1992 referendum.  The only reference to information in the wording before the people was the word &ldquo;information&rdquo;.  Therefore, the wording in this Bill is open to misinterpretation and the people should have the right to decide the wording used by way of another referendum.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is to give effect to the wishes of the majority of the people following the 1992 referendum. The majority decided against abortion, even for women in danger, in other words, Article 40.3.2 would remain unchanged.  However, there was also a decision in that referendum to give women the right to travel and to information.  Information about what?  I assume it is information which would comply with the first part of the amendment.  It is difficult to accept that one section was against abortion and the <Col N="174" /> other was for abortion referral.  No-one could interpret the wishes of the people to mean that.</P>
      <P>This Bill will not stop women having abortions.  Informative counselling on the risks attaching to abortion would lead to a reduction in the number of abortions.  I would have been pleased if the Minister had given greater emphasis to that section.  Such services should be State financed.</P>
      <P>If an agency does not comply with the provisions of the Bill it will incur a fine not exceeding £1,500.  That is a paltry fine for breaking the law in such circumstances.</P>

      <P>Is dócha gur ceist fíor-thromchúiseach, bhrónach í, ceist an ghinmhillte in Éirinn.  Abortion is one of the most serious issues to come before us.  Those who speak in the debate will feel nothing but sympathy for women who feel they must have an abortion.  It upsets me deeply to hear people use terms such as &ldquo;fundamentalists&rdquo; about those who are opposed to abortion.  It seems to indicate that they lack heart or feeling when nothing could be further from the truth.</P>
      <P>As politicians, people come to us in all kinds of trouble.  We show nothing but sympathy for people with problems irrespective of how they arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must look at the law as it is and must legislate in cold print.  It is <Col N="175" /> important to remember that people's actions are judged in court with full knowledge and understanding of the dilemmas in which people find themselves.  Within the overall context of this Bill it is important to point out that some people's main concern would be with those who might seek to promote abortion place it on an equal status with other moral issues, and put it to the electorate in traumatic circumstances.</P>
    <P>I have huge sympathy for the Minister in this matter, I have no doubt where his heart lies, I understand his dilemma, but the timing of the introduction of this Bill &mdash; the day after publication of the Framework Document &mdash; annoyed me enormously.  I understand the original intention was to have this passed by the House within a week.</P>
    <P>We must accept, and I always have done, that there are those who have no conscientious difficulty with abortion and that there are those who have but who feel it is all right to refer for abortion women who want to terminate a pregnancy.  Equally, there are those who feel that neither of those two options is right.  I accept that the full spectrum of those opinions is represented in society. It would indeed be regrettable if, at any time, this House became a place in which that full diversity of opinion could not be expressed.  Equally it would be regrettable if we reached the stage at which the manner in which we disposed of difficult questions, on which we knew there to be a huge difference in public opinion, was to reach a cosy consensus, pushing any relevant legislation speedily through, washing our hands of any such problems.</P>
    <P>I am glad that there will be a full debate affording each and every Member, irrespective of his or her views, an opportunity to voice them and explain the basis on which they have been formed.  I cannot, and never would claim, to argue on equal grounds the constitutional ramifications of various amendments to our Constitution because I am not a constitutional lawyer; I am just an ordinary citizen who has the privilege to <Col N="176" /> be a Member of this House but, in discussing this whole issue, it must be remembered that ordinary citizens &mdash; or their representatives &mdash; passed the various enactments.</P>
    <P>Article 40.3.1º of our Constitution reads:</P>
    <P>The State guarantees in its laws to respect, and, as far as practicable, by its laws to defend and vindicate the personal rights of the citizen.</P>
    <P>&mdash;which is the right to life of the unborn.  Perhaps I do not understand English but my interpretation of that Article is that, in any law we pass, we are obliged to vindicate, as far as practicable, the right to life of the unborn, while totally accepting that there are people who disagree with me, the vast majority of the electorate believe that unborn human life is human life and that, when we talk about abortion, we are talking about the taking of the most innocent human life.</P>
    <P>I know a referendum was passed to provide for amendment of our Constitution, to make information on services available in another jurisdiction but, in that amendment, it was said there would be no referral.  That amendment has caused great confusion and it was unfortunate it was held at the time of a general election.  Looking at that amendment, I, with my limited understanding observe that it says:</P>
    <P>This subsection shall not limit freedom to obtain or make available in this State, subject to such conditions as may be laid down by law, information relating to services lawfully available in another State.</P>
    <P>To an ordinary layman &mdash; and remember we are talking about ordinary, lay people &mdash; that does not specify any limit to the restrictions in law that may be laid down.  I think many ordinary people would join me in saying they did not realise there was any limit to the restrictions in law.  That there are limits in the law is clearly indicated in the Minister's Bill, in which he clearly differentiates, for example, between paid magazines <Col N="177" /> and freebies handed into households. This would appear to indicate to me &mdash; and here I stress I am talking about ordinary people, the non-constitutional lawyers, people who do not have expertise at their back &mdash; that if those limitations can be inserted, additional ones could also be inserted.  I am not clear, and I think half the electorate is not clear, on the demarcation line, about which everybody on the other side is talking, between what we can and cannot limit but it is not clear from this amendment that there is any such demarcation line.</P>
    <P>It can rightly be asked if this is referral.  Again, I can take only a layman's view but, if somebody enters my clinic looking for a local authority house, and I hand them an application form, a telephone number, address &mdash; and perhaps even the use of the telephone &mdash; I would feel I was referring them to the relevant local authority.</P>
    <P>It was made quite clear by a doctor in a letter to <i>The Irish Times</i> this week, that, nowadays, most doctors refer patients to specialists, giving them names, addresses, telephone numbers and a letter of reference, very few pick up the telephone and make an appointment for a patient.  Whether we like to or not, the lay perception of this is that it constitutes referral, which is where one of the great difficulties arises with this Bill because it was made quite clear in the Government leaflet there would be no referral under the provisions of this legislation.</P>
    <P>I have always felt we must create a caring society, that our efforts in this direction should create the social circumstances in which no person would think of an abortion.  Unfortunately, in many European countries where abortion is freely available, it has not become a serious issue for many people but one of social convenience.  I would very much regret if we ever created circumstances in which abortion&mdash;because I believe it involves the destruction of human life &mdash; would become a matter of social convenience.  Of all the fundamental rights we possess, I believe in the <Col N="178" /> fundamental right to life.  If the Minister introduced a Bill to reintroduce capital punishment no whip would make me vote for it.  I am proud to have been one of the few Senators who at the time of the Iraqi war &mdash; which I perceived to be a resource war &mdash; who opposed it and the taking of innocent, human life then also.  Life is one of our most fundamental gifts and I do not believe anybody has the right to take it away.  Therefore, we must always be very careful never to give the impression that we are making human life any cheaper or in any way devaluing it.  There are people whose stated aim is easy access to legalised abortion.  They have a salami type approach and push for the introduction of legislation slice by slice.</P>
    <P>The mission statement in <i>The Agenda For Choice &mdash; Achieving Reproductive Rights in Ireland &mdash; Goals For The Year 2000</i>, a publication by the Irish Family Planning Association, presents the association's clear view on abortion.  It states that the association gives a special emphasis to maternal and child health through information and access to family planning and safe abortion services. Their goal is: &ldquo;To promote an environment in which decisions can be freely made by women who have unplanned or unexpected pregnancy&rdquo;.  The publication goes on to state:</P>
    <P>In the context of abortion in Britain: inform women of their legal rights to safe abortions, provide confidential information and counselling on how to obtain a safe abortion; provide access to safe abortion services; continually improve access to these services; and condemn incidents of any political, administrative or social barriers curtailing this right.</P>
    <P>Wherever possible, enter into a dialogue with political, religious and cultural opinion leaders to liberalise their attitudes towards safe abortion.</P>
    <P>I accept the bona fides of the Minister when he says that under no circumstances would he ever vote for the legislation of abortion in Ireland, but I do not believe that is how it will happen. <Col N="179" /> Information on abortion legislation will be introduced and in a few years' time we will be told we are hypocrites because we allow doctors to do everything except make the telephone call to refer patients for an abortion.  We will then be asked to take another step and let doctors make such telephone calls.  A few years later we will be told once again that we are hypocrites because we have taken two steps towards providing access to abortion services.  Pro-abortion groups will call us hypocrites because we facilitate access to abortion services in whatever way we can and the only thing we object to is the provision of those services in the Republic.  If we go down that road what answer will we give when those groups use that argument?  That will be the day we will be exposed.</P>
    <P>Limiting access to information is not the solution to the abortion problem, but liberalising access to such information, making it commonplace and thereby providing a social convenience is something my conscience will not allow.  At the end of the day we all have to answer for our position.  I do not believe it is right to create a culture that devalues human life.  I would much rather be speaking about housing provisions for single parents, support services for those with crisis pregnancies and how this Legislature can best support those who find themselves with unplanned pregnancies.</P>
    <P>I wish to reply to a comment made by a Government Deputy about the large number of men speaking on this Bill.  I am a husband and a father and more than half of my constituents are women. I represent more women than I do men and I do not find a significant difference between the number of women and men who approach me on this issue.</P>

      <P>This matter arises from an incursion into the north Louth area at approximately 2 p.m. yesterday when two British Army helicopters, accompanied by RUC personnel, made their way three or four miles over the Border.  Incursions along the Louth-Armagh Border have not been uncommon in the past, in fact they took place on a regular basis in previous times. This incursion is the first we know of since the announcement of the ceasefire in August 1994.  The psychological significance of the incursion cannot be underestimated.  It caused considerable anger and irritation to the people in the Ravensdale area where two British Army helicopters hovered for over half an hour.  The people in the area are angry and demand that the Minister for Foreign Affairs raise the matter at the Anglo-Irish Secretariat and lodge a protest.  The important thing is that incidents such as this do not happen again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I sincerely hope the incident does not have a detrimental impact on the ceasefire.  The activities of British Army helicopters in the Border area in the past are well recorded and chronicled.  Many of us felt the era of their presence had passed but this incursion is a reminder that while we are six months into a ceasefire, they are still in the North.  I ask the Minister of State who is replying to the debate to protest to the British <Col N="185" /> Army authorities and to ensure it does not happen again.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my colleague for allowing me the opportunity to add my comments on this subject.  When speaking on the Adjournment last night about the Garda Divisional Headquarters in Dundalk I referred to this incident because I had received some 'phone calls.  This morning I received more 'phone calls from people in the Ravensdale area about the matter.  I agree with the remarks made by my constituency colleague as some people have not experienced this type of incident previously.</P>
      <P>In certain areas incursions take place frequently, people are used to them and probably know the identity of the soldiers and RUC personnel.  This incursion was in an area which is difficult for RUC personnel to get to.  The helicopters tracked them into the Republic, into an area where it is not usual to make a map reading error.  I exhort the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs to make the strongest possible protest through the Anglo-Irish Secretariat in relation to this incident.</P>
      <P>The reality of the peace process is very different for people in Dublin. There is still a significant British Army presence in Border areas.  Two weeks ago while driving to Armagh to attend the investiture of Seán Brady I was stopped by the British Army on three occasions.  This had nothing to do with the event in Armagh; when I was stopped I was still quite a distance from my destination.</P>
      <P>Even though the British authorities have said that they will withdraw the Army from the streets there is now a stronger Army presence in some Border areas.  I do not understand why members of the British Army should be allowed to come into the Republic.  We have our own security services which are more than able to deal with any criminal activity.  In future the RUC should contact the Garda and ask them to apprehend an offender.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. G. Mitchell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputies for raising this matter.  Unauthorised incursions into this jurisdiction by British security personnel and members of the RUC have always been viewed by Irish Governments as very serious matters.  This is more than ever the case now that the violence in the North has ceased.  Every care must be taken by the authorities on both sides to ensure that everything is done to maintain public confidence in the ceasefire.  Incidents such as this can have disturbing effects on local Border communities.</P>
      <P>On the basis of Garda reports to hand, I can confirm that the incursions took place shortly after 2 p.m. yesterday afternoon.  The Garda in Dundalk received a telephone call from the RUC in Newry to say that an RUC patrol car was in pursuit of a vehicle which was headed towards the Drumadd area of County Louth.  Shortly afterwards, telephone calls were received by the Garda from local residents saying that a British Army helicopter and an RUC patrol vehicle were seen in the Ravensdale area.  A Garda patrol vehicle arrived shortly afterwards and observed the British Army helicopter hovering over the Ravendale area.  It did not land and sometime after the Garda arrived at the scene it departed in the direction of the Border.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Garda did not observe the RUC patrol vehicle but, according to reports, it was seen by several local people in the Ravensdale area.  One report indicated that the vehicle stopped at one point and the occupants, two uniformed RUC officers, spoke to local people who informed them that they were in this jurisdiction.  Reports to hand indicate that the helicopter was two to three miles inside this jurisdiction while the RUC vehicle was one and a half to two miles inside.  The Garda subsequently accosted the two occupants of the vehicle which the RUC patrol had been pursuing in connection with a suspected offence in their jurisdiction which was not paramilitary related.  They agreed to <Col N="187" /> accompany the Garda to Dundalk Garda station where they made voluntary statements.  Both are understood to have addresses in Newry, County Down.  The gardaí are continuing their inquiries.</P>
    <P>As soon as we received the first reports on the incursions we immediately raised the matter with the British authorities through the Joint Secretariat.  When we received more substantial reports from the local Garda, the Department of Foreign Affairs sought a full explanation of the incidents from the Northern authorities.  I agree with the Deputies that these were worrying incursions and the concerns expressed by them on behalf of the local residents in the area are understandable.  The British authorities have indicated that on the basis of their inquiries to date both incursions were inadvertent and as soon as this was realised the RUC vehicle and the Army helicopter returned to Northern Ireland. The matter is being pursued further and we expect to receive a fuller explanation from the British authorities in due course.  It will take some time to complete inquiries and I am anxious to ensure that we receive a full response and explanation.</P>
    <P>This account is based on Garda reports to date, and it will make a fuller report in due course.  While awaiting an explanation of the incidents from the British authorities, I reiterate that unauthorised crossings of the Border, including accidental or inadvertent crossings whether in the air or at surface level, have been viewed by Irish Governments as very serious matters. That is why we have asked the British authorities for a full explanation of the incidents and an assurance that the greatest care will be taken to avoid such incidents in the future.</P>

During two days last week protesters blocked the entrance to the tiphead.

Management seem to be in favour of extending the tiphead to fields which were designated in 1984 for amenity purposes.  In recent days the manager of the council has been quoted in the newspapers as saying he could not locate a halting site in Howth because he had given a personal commitment to the people of the area.  The commitment given to the people of Finglas means nothing compared to the commitment given to the people of Howth on a different issue.</P>
      <P>The lobby groups are looking for definite information on the wind down procedures for the tiphead, the closing date and the plans to rehabilitate the area. Even though they are entitled to this information under EU directives the promised report has been continuously delayed.  Reference has been made to a possible closing date in June-July 1996 and people want this commitment to be put in writing.  They are afraid that a further demand will be made to keep the Dunsink tiphead, which is 80 feet high in some places, open for another few years.  For some years local authorities operated on the basis that a tiphead would be opened in Kill but many people think this tiphead will never be opened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not enough to tell people that the Dunsink tiphead will be closed in 1996 when there is no obvious alternative. People want a definite commitment and information on the alternatives.  Having failed to get proper information from the local authorities the local people reported the matter to the EU which informed them that despite repeated requests by the Petitions Committee the <Col N="189" /> Government had not supplied any information.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to give the full details of the proposed closing date for this tiphead and the rehabilitation plans. The problem in the past was that the person who gave the commitments retired and the person who took over said that things had changed and it was a new ball game.  This problem is likely to recur as the official dealing with this matter is near retirement age.  The people want a definite commitment in regard to the closure of this tiphead.  I ask the Minister to outline the plans so that we can monitor whether he implements them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Ahern for raising this matter.  Responsibility for the management and operation of local authority landfills within their functional areas rests with the local authorities concerned.  In the case of Dunsink landfill, this responsibility is vested in Fingal County Council.  Only exceptionally could the Minister for the Environment appropriately accept responsibility before this House for operational matters concerning local authority landfills.  I am responding to Deputy Ahern's motion this evening not because of any involvement by my Department with the operation of Dunsink or other local authority landfills, but because of my Department's responsibility, on behalf of the Irish Government, for co-ordinating and transmitting replies on environmental queries, complaints and legal proceedings to the European Commission.</P>
      <P>The European Commission notified my Department on 31 May 1994 of a complaint received in relation to Dunsink landfill.  The grounds for the complaint relate to the site's location and a claim that the design, engineering and technical precautions adopted at the site and its management are not adequate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The operation of this facility is the responsibility of Fingal County Council and their detailed complaint was forwarded to the manager for a full reply <Col N="190" /> on 13 June 1994.  A reply was received from the council on 23 August 1994. While that reply addressed the majority of the issues raised in the complaint, clarification of a number of matters was sought from the council on 4 October 1994.  Pending receipt of that information, a letter was issued to the Commission on 16 September 1994 outlining the new local government structure in the Dublin area and how that had impacted on the management of the Dunsink facility.</P>
    <P>My Department has now provided a full reply to the Commission on the issues raised by them in this correspondence.  Given that this correspondence arises from a private complaint registered with the Commission, it would not be the practice to release it publicly or to go into its details at this stage.  We await the Commission's response to our correspondence.</P>
    <P>In terms of my general responsibilities for waste management, I am most anxious to co-operate with all local authorities in the development of better waste management planning, practice and facilities, with particular emphasis on recycling and waste minimisation.</P>
    <P>The environment services operational programme contains a sub-programme on waste management to support this approach.  I hope to communicate the detailed implementation of this sub-programme to local authorities and other interests very shortly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenneally</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this matter on the Adjournment, but I am disappointed the Minister has not come into the House to reply to the debate. She seems to be continuing the practice she followed in the last Government of not considering it worth her while to come into the House to reply to Adjournment debates.  She came into the House earlier when a quorum was called.  In saying that, I am not casting a reflection on the Minister of State who <Col N="191" /> I thank for taking the trouble to come in to reply.</P>
      <P>I am very familiar with Ballygunner national school because my son is a pupil there and it is located in my parish.  It is located in a part of Waterford city that has experienced a huge population growth in recent years and, having regard to the number of houses planned for the area in the next few years, that population growth will continue in that vein for many years.  There are many green fields in the area and hundreds of houses are planned.  Therefore, the number of pupils wishing to attend Ballygunner school will escalate in the next few years.</P>
      <P>The Department is probably considering providing two additional classrooms at the school, but that will not be enough.  When the school was commissioned planning permission was sought for a 16 classroom school.  Eight were built initially and two later.  The school has ten classrooms with 11 classes that double up at junior infants, first and sixth classes, but they should be doubling up at every level.  Ultimately the school will need two classes from junior infants to sixth class and even that will not be adequate.  A second school will be needed in the area at some stage in the future.  The school has ten assistant teacher posts and sanction was recently given for an additional one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A total of 95 applicants have applied for a place in the school in September 1995 but the school can cater for only 38, the other 57 will be disappointed. The school has a policy of taking brothers and sisters of pupils already attending the school.  As there are 29 in that category, only nine new families will be catered for.  The school has received 67 applications for 1996, 60 for 1997 and 54 for 1998 which is three and a half years away.  They have even received 18 applications for 1999.  I spoke to a woman recently who put her son's name on a waiting list for a place in the school when he was only three or four months old.  He is due to go to <Col N="192" /> school next September but she cannot secure a place for him in Ballygunner.  It has almost reached the stage that once a child is conceived his or her name will have to be placed on the waiting list for this school.  I hope this information provides the Minister with an idea of the school's requirements.  It is pointless telling us that two additional classrooms will be provided.  The school needs six additional classrooms and it would be much more cost effective to carry out all the work at once rather than piecemeal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Allen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Deputy has given me the opportunity of outlining my Department's intention on the need for additional accommodation at Ballygunner national school, Waterford city.  This problem has not arisen overnight.</P>
      <P>My Department has been aware of developments in the Ballygunner area for some time and has made every effort over recent years to ensure that this school's accommodation needs are being met.</P>
      <P>In 1985 my Department grant aided the provision of an eight classroom school on a new site to replace the old Ballygunner national school which was located on a restricted site.  Due to the local population growth and the increase in the need for extra school places it was necessary to provide an extension of two new classrooms in 1992.</P>
      <P>Currently the school's 396 pupils are housed in a modern ten classroom building with a general purpose room and other ancillaries.  While facilities are generally good at the school, the increase in enrolments has meant that the schools' eleventh assistant must use the remedial room as a teaching space. The current staffing of principal and 11 assistants will be augmented by the addition of another teaching assistant warranted from September 1994.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On foot of a request for extra accommodation from the school authorities, my Department requested the local schools' inspector to conduct a study of <Col N="193" /> projected enrolments at the school over the coming years.  The inspector's report has indicated that numbers at this school and other schools in the vicinity are likely to increase in the foreseeable future as this is a developing area in the city.</P>
    <P>My Department has examined these reports and has agreed in principle to the provision of two extra classrooms at Ballygunner national school.  This project is being considered for inclusion in the 1995 capital programme for national schools.</P>
    <P>Each year a large number of school building projects are considered for inclusion in the annual capital building programme, but due to the limited financial resources available, it is not possible for all such projects to be included in the final programme.</P>
    <P>However, each project to be considered for inclusion in the programme is assessed on its merits and every effort is made to ensure that the funds available are disbursed equitably on the basis of need.</P>
    <P>My Department is aware of the need for additional accommodation at Ballygunner national school and, as I said, a project is being considered for inclusion in the 1995 capital programme.</P>
    <P>Details of the programme are being finalised at present and my Department will be in touch with the school authorities in the near future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnEllis" hpid="Mr. Ellis Mr. Ellis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate being allowed to raise this question on the Adjournment.  I have no objection to the Minister of State, Deputy Allen, taking this question on behalf of his colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry whom I believe is outside doing a launch to which, perhaps, he should also have invited the Opposition spokesperson.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="194" /> The question of access to the offices of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry at Cranmore in Sligo has been of major concern to the farming community in Sligo and Leitrim for the past few years.  The offices are situated on the fourth floor of a building which has a lift which is not available for use by the public.  Members of the public most go to the fourth floor to receive service from relevant officials, and to do this they must climb between 50 and 60 steps.  This is not acceptable.  The fact that when this building was designed it was meant for use by the public shows grave lack of planning when interview facilities were not provided on the ground floor.</P>
    <P>Interview conditions within the office itself are terrible with business being discussed in an open room where people can hear everybody else's business and it is hard for officials and the public to give proper consideration to the problems raised.  For old people the problems are very serious.  Nobody should expect the aged or disabled to climb 59 steps to an office.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to make accommodation on the ground floor available to facilitate interviews by officials or, failing that, to provide a designated lift which would facilitate people who want to go to the fourth floor and provide proper interview accommodation there. I am aware that the Minister is committed to providing better service to the public and has made this one of his major planks with regard to reform of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry.  Here is an opportunity to take positive action.  The need for proper accommodation with privacy for the officials and the people who use the office is urgent and of paramount importance.  The staff who work under the present conditions deserve the highest praise for doing their utmost on all occasions to facilitate people.  Where necessary they have come down to interview physically disabled people in the hallway.</P>
    <P>We would like to see such problem alleviated and I appeal to the Ministe <Col N="195" /> of State, who will reply on behalf of the Minister, to ask him to take immediate action to provide proper facilities and access for everybody who has to use the services of the Department at Cranmore.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Agriculture asked me to apologise for his absence.</P>
      <P>The Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, first occupied space in Cranmore Road, Sligo in 1986 and from that time local offices have been sited on the fourth floor and the difficulties of access cited by the Deputy have existed since that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Shortly after he became Minister, Deputy Yates arranged that a survey of the Department's main local offices be carried out to ascertain what improvements were necessary to implement the charter of rights for farmers.  In relation to Sligo, the difficulties which were brought to the Minister's attention were shortage of space, poor reception facilities and difficulty of access for the farming community.  As soon as he became aware of these problems, he ensured that discussions took place between officials of his Department and the <Col N="196" /> Office of Public Works to rectify the situation as this body has primary responsibility for ensuring that adequate and suitable accommodation is provided for Departments.</P>
    <P>As a result of these discussions, the Office of Public Works has been given a detailed accommodation brief.  If the suggestions are acted upon, additional space in the building will be provided for the livestock, veterinary and farm development services.  Furthermore, there is a lift in the building but access to it was restricted.  The Department has recently suggested modifications to it.  If these modifications are feasible, and I understand they are, the access for the public to the offices will be improved considerably.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the Minister has written to the Office of Public Works setting out the Department's requirements in relation to accommodation generally and expects to meet the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Higgins on this issue shortly.</P>
    <P>Serious points were raised by Deputy Ellis and need to be addressed.  I will certainly bring them to the Minister's attention.</P>
    <P>Debate adjourned.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5.15 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 7 March 1995.</P>

      <P>The question of providing third level courses is primarily one for my colleague, the Minister for Education.  However, I can inform the Deputy that under the auspices of STATCOM, the special committee on the film industry, FÁS is finalising an in-depth study of the unmet training needs of the industry.  I await the conclusions of the FÁS study with great interest.  The report will, I am sure, have an important part to play in informing Government policy in this key area and, if the conclusions indentify an inadequacy in the resources for courses in film at third level, I will refer those conclusions to the Minister for Education for consideration and whatever action is appropriate.</P>
      <P>While the Deputy will appreciate that my Department has no direct role in the provision of third level courses relating to film, I am aware of the existence of a number of such courses at various colleges and institutions, including Dún Laoghaire College of Art and Design &mdash; courses in film; University College Dublin &mdash; an MA in film studies and some extra-mural studies; Dublin City University &mdash; a communication course and an MA course in film studies; and Galway Regional Technical College &mdash; post-graduate course in video production.</P>

      <P>The promotion of Ireland as a film production location has been a cornerstone of my policy to promote and develop our indigenous film industry.  To this end I have set in place a series of incentives and initiatives which have been enthusiastically taken up by film producers worldwide, including those working in the European sphere.  The measures include: the tax incentives available under section 35 of the Finance Act, 1987 as amended which have been a major catalyst in bringing co-production projects between Irish and international producers to this country; the involvement of Ireland in European filmrelated initiatives; notable in this context is the EU MEDIA Programme 1991-1995 which has been a major significance in developing Irish film projects from the very early stages and in promoting a strategic alliance between Irish producers and their European counterparts; as well as Eurimages &mdash; the Council of Europe co-production film fund which has assisted several Irish films to date and which requires that Irish producers secure two European partners; and through An Bord Tráchtála and Bord Scannán na <Col N="144" /> hÉireann's representation at prestigious film festivals, such as Cannes and Berlin, where the merits and advantages of co-production arrangements with Irish producers and of film making in Ireland are advertised to the European and wider international film-making industry.</P>
      <P>In addition to these initiatives the Deputy will be aware that I propose establishing a screen commission which will function as a &ldquo;one stop shop&rdquo; and a facilitator for the film industry.  This is fully in line with the commitment given by this Government in its Programme &mdash;<i>A Government of Renewal</i>&mdash; which states that &ldquo;A Screen Commission will be established so as to maximise Ireland's attractiveness as a location for film&rdquo;.  It is my intention that this commission will be a very active and energetic player on the international scene both in marketing the many advantages Ireland enjoys as a location for films and also to smooth out potential problems or difficulties on the ground so as to develop a &ldquo;film friendly&rdquo; environment here.  I will soon be bringing forward specific proposals regarding the development of a screen commission to Government.</P>
      <P>The Deputy can be assured that I am keen to consolidate the progress already made and to continue the development of this very important cultural industry.</P>

As I have indicated previously, it is my intention to introduce legislative proposals to establish autonomous boards for the National Museum and the National Library who will have the responsibility, inter alia, to develop policies with regard to the collection, cataloguing, research, conservation and display of artifacts which are part of our national movable heritage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to local authority and private museums, the situation is more complex as, in general, such museums are not directly funded through my <Col N="149" /> Department.  There is a view that there is an absence of a nationally co-ordinated policy in this area.  On the other hand, one would not wish to see local initiatives stifled by rigid national policies and I am not in favour of centralised direction except where it can be clearly justified.  Accordingly, while detailed policies on every aspect of the operation of such museums need not be laid down rigidly, there may be a need for a standardised approach to the care, management and display of artifacts of national importance, wherever they are held.</P>
    <P>My Department has engaged in initial, largely informal, consultations with some interested parties on how such matters might be addressed and what role my Department might play. Such consultations are ongoing.</P>
    <P>The Heritage Council, which on the enactment of the Heritage Bill, will be established on a statutory basis will also have a function in developing policies on the identification, protection, preservation and enhancement of, <i>inter alia,</i> archaeological and heritage objects and to promote interest, knowledge and pride in and facilitate appreciation and enjoyment of the national heritage.</P>

      <P>I assume that the Deputy is referring to a recent article in a Sunday newspaper which stated that the numbers visiting Office of Public Works visitor centres are falling.  The figures quoted in that article for 1994 were those for the period up until the end of September which have since been adjusted to take account of the full year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The actual position is that, while all <Col N="150" /> these visitor centres experience fluctuations in visitor numbers on a yearly basis, there was an increase of 5.6 per cent in the overall number of paying visitors to these centres in 1994 as compared with 1993.  The figure for 1994 was 1,957,000 compared with 1,854,000 for 1993.  Seven new sites were opened to the public in 1994 and accounted for around 50,000 visitors.</P>

      <P>I share the Deputy's view of the potential of this project, but due to the many competing demands on the limited financial resources available to me it has not been possible to include the extension of the Erne navigation southwards from Belturbet to Killeshandra and Killykeen, County Cavan on the list of projects for completion under the Tourism Operational Programme.  However, this is a project which should be carried out subject to the availability of funds.  I can assure the Deputy that should additional funding become available to me this project will be a high priority.</P>

      <P>I am aware that at present there are 86,000 refugees or asylum seekers from Bhutan in refugee camps in south east Nepal.  We support international efforts through the European Union and the United Nations to improve the situation and have also given some direct assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since 1992, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has managed an emergency relief programme for refugees and asylum seekers who have come from Britain to the camps in Nepal.  In 1994, 1.5 million ECUs was provided by the European Union to the United Nations High Commission for Refugees for their relief programme in the refugee camps. Irish Government funding has been <Col N="153" /> made available, via the Agency for Personal Service Overseas, to assist five Irish aid workers who are working with the UNHCR to provide primary education to the large number of refugee children in the camps.  The UNHCR intends to expand its relief assistance to the refugees and is working to find more permanent solutions to the problems of shelter and sanitation in the camps.</P>
    <P>Bilateral negotiations between Bhutan and Nepal regarding the refugees have been in progress since 1993 and a mechanism has been agreed whereby a joint vertication mission will categorise the refugees in the camps with a view to the eventual repatriation of certain categories.</P>
    <P>The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Mr. Jose Ayala Lasso, visited Bhutan and Nepal in 1994 and the refugee issue was discussed during his visit.  Mr. Lasso expressed his support for the bilateral negotiations taking place between Bhutan and Nepal.</P>
    <P>The UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention also visited Bhutan in 1994, to investigate, amongst other matters, the detention of people of Nepalese origin.  The report of the Working Group noted the sincere efforts of the Bhutanese authorities to remedy the situation of those prosecuted under the National Security Act, 1992, which would include various persons of Nepalese origin.</P>
    <P>The UNHCR has a key role to play in ensuring that the eventual repatriation meets the highest international standards and that the safety and dignity of all returning refugees are safeguarded.</P>
    <P>The European Union is closely monitoring the negotiations between Bhutan and Nepal on the refugee issue and, whenever a suitable opportunity arises, will urge that the voluntary repatriation of refugees to Bhutan should soon begin.</P>

    <P>Supplementary welfare allowance is normally paid only to people receiving social welfare or health board payments; however, there are provisions in the legislation which allow boards to respond to the urgent needs of those who are specifically excluded in legislation from receiving supplementary welfare allowance, for example those in full-time employment.  Guidance issued to boards over the years by the Department of Social Welfare gives flooding as <Col N="163" /> an example where boards may assist persons who are normally excluded. The Mid-Western Health Board and the Western Health Board have advised my Department that applications for assistance as a result of flooding are being processed expeditiously, and a number of people have by now been helped under the exceptional needs provision. The two health boards further advised that in many cases, insurance companies are accepting and processing flood damage claims speedily.</P>

Invitations were issued in January to seven consultancy firms to tender for this assignment.  The terms of reference issued to the consultants were to: enter into discussions with potential purchasers, as identified by Irish Steel, for the purchase of all or a majority part of the shares in Irish Steel and clarify the nature and extent of their interest and the terms on offer; provide any additional information required to <Col N="165" /> enable potential purchasers to formulate offers for Irish Steel; review and assess the offers received and make a formal recommendation to the Minister for Enterprise and Employment for the acceptance of an offer and the negotiation of a formal letter of intent; and instruct the legal advisers to the sale and manage the negotiation process through to completion.</P>
      <P>All of the companies written to have now submitted tenders.  The tenders are currently being evaluated and I expect to be in a position to make an early decision on them.

      <P>EEC Council Directive No. 75/129/EEC, which relates to collective redundancies, was transposed into national legislation by the Protection of Employment Act, 1977.  This directive has now been amended by Council Directive No. 92/56/EEC and this necessitates an amendment to the 1977 Act.  A memorandum on the transposition is at an advanced stage of preparation and I will be seeking the authority of the Government for the drafting of a Bill in the very near future.</P>
