    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I visited Moscow from 8-10 May at the invitation of the Russian Government to attend ceremonies to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the end of World War II. I met President Yeltsin on a number of occasions but these encounters did not allow for a discussion on substantive issues. I also met the Russian Foreign Minister, Mr. Kozyrev, and voiced to him my deep concern at the continuing conflict in Chechnya. I urged that Russia cease its military activities there and, with the active assistance of the OSCE, begin constructive negotiations towards a political solution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also took the opportunity to have bilateral meetings with President Havel of the Czech Republic, President Ahtisaari of Finland, Prime Minister Major of the UK and Prime Minister Kok of the Netherlands. My discussion with Mr. Major on Northern Ireland is the subject of separate questions. We touched on European Affairs in our discussion, notably the preparations for and the <Col N="1687" /> agenda of the Intergovernmental Conference which will be in session during the Irish Presidency of the EU next year. I found the British Prime Minister strongly supportive of my view that action at EU level has a critical role to play in the war against drugs. I believe such action is essential in convincing the public throughout Europe that the EU is relevant to the issues they see as important in their lives.</P>
    <P>This Government is deeply concerned also about the situation at Sellafield. It believes that Sellafield poses a serious and continuing threat to the health and safety of the Irish people. However, it is not the only such hazard &mdash; the ever increasing traffic on the Irish sea, the number of ageing nuclear reactors on the west coast of Britain and substandard reactors in eastern Europe, add to the threat.</P>
    <P>The Government is preparing a blueprint for action on the various matters covered in its joint programme in respect of these nuclear-related issues. The blueprint is being prepared by a committee comprising the Minister for the Environment and certain Ministers of State. I decided that it would not be appropriate to raise this matter in my meeting with the British Prime Minister until such time as the Committee of Ministers here had reported to the Cabinet and the Cabinet had made a decision on the issues contained in its report. Raising the matter prematurely before all the necessary work had been done would have been counterproductive.</P>
    <P>My discussions in Moscow with Prime Minister Kok of the Netherlands and President Ahtisaari of Finland also dealt with the Intergovernmental Conference. In addition to bilateral issues affecting our States the follow-up to the European Commission's White Paper on Employment was also discussed. I had an exchange of views with President Havel on the Intergovernmental Conference and on the enlargement of the European Union to include the countries of central and eastern Europe. We <Col N="1688" /> also discussed bilateral relations between Ireland and the Czech Republic. In all my bilateral meetings European security was also discussed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Why did the Taoiseach not raise the plight of the Chechnya people with President Yeltsin? Why was it raised only with the Foreign Minister?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said in my original reply, there was no opportunity for substantive discussion of any issue in detail in my encounters with President Yeltsin. There was such an opportunity in my encounter &mdash; which was quite lengthy &mdash; with Foreign Minister Kozyrev and, therefore, I decided that was the appropriate way to raise the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>During the Taoiseach's discussions with Foreign Minister Kozyrev, did he have an opportunity of raising some of the issues pertinent to economic co-operation, of which there are a number? The issue of Aer Rianta is one that has been outstanding for some time. Has progress been made on any of those issues?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I confined my discussions with the Foreign Minister, Mr. Kozyrev, to the Chechen situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the Russian policy on Chechnya and did the Taoiseach get a feel for the policy the Russian Government was voicing to international leaders on the crisis? I am sure the Taoiseach pointed out that the Russian Government has changed its policy position many times since Christmas. Can he tell the House what policy objective the Russian Government is working to?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Foreign Minister, Mr. Kozyrev, gave me to believe that his hope at that stage was for an extension <Col N="1689" /> of the ceasefire. He adverted to the difficulty that exists in regard to talks from their point of view, arising from the fact that the Russians do not recognise the legitimacy of the Dudayev government and therefore there was difficulty in establishing an appropriate interlocutor for talks. The primary point he made was his hope for the extension of the ceasefire. As the Deputy is well aware, the forces of the Russian Federation went on the offensive on 14 May in Chechnya, shortly after the end of the commemorative activities in Moscow, and this is a matter about which I wish to express my considerable concern.</P>
      <P>I do not believe that this issue can be settled by the methods now being applied and certainly any insights we can draw from our history would suggest that military methods alone do not solve the problems of conflicts of identity and loyalty of the kind that exist in Chechnya and in other parts of the world. That is why I believe the government of the Russian Federation is making a mistake in the course of action it is following. The fact that an OSCE mission was admitted to Chechnya and to the Russian Federation at this stage afforded the opportunity for a more constructive approach to the issue, with the possibility of the OSCE delegation led by Hungary providing some form of mediation and engaging in discussions in which the Russians themselves might not wish to become involved directly. I regret deeply that the opportunity for a non-violent settlement of this issue was not availed of. It is a matter of regret that while I, along with so many other leaders of western European countries, raised this issue, none of these representations appears to have been successful in persuading the Russian Government to change its approach to the resolution of this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for his detailed reply. I asked the question because it seemed peculiar in the extreme that the Russians waited until the end of the international conference to move in the direction they did.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1690" /> I understand from international papers that an effort will be made at the European Council next month to put further pressure on the Russian Government. Is it the Taoiseach's intention to join with those putting pressure on them? Clearly the Russian Government has no interest in listening to international opinion if, having listened to so many leaders at international meetings, it moved in this direction hours after the leaders had left.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I indicated our position on the Chechen situation in general on the previous occasion this matter was raised and indicated clearly that the Irish Government supports the view that the European Union should not finalise the interim agreement that has been drawn up with the Russian Federation until the four conditions set out in the Council communiqué on this issue have been met. To date only one of those four conditions has been met, that is the admission of the OSCE delegation.  The other conditions have not been met. The Irish Government will continue to adhere to that position and in Cannes and elsewhere we will continue to exercise the maximum pressure. I believe the maximum pressure we can exert is in the form of refusal to conclude the interim agreement until a different policy is adopted by the government of the Russian Federation.</P>

      <P>When the Taoiseach answered some weeks ago questions on his proposed visit to Moscow he indicated that he intended raising this matter with President Yeltsin. Was he aware in advance of his trip to Moscow that he would not have an opportunity of raising these matters with the President?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not aware at the <Col N="1691" /> time I was answering those questions of the precise arrangement that would apply and of the duration of the various meetings I would have with President Yeltsin. I had been given to believe at the time I answered those questions that there would be a form of general meeting at which the President would meet a number of Prime Ministers and Presidents of the various visiting countries and this would have allowed this to happen. Such provisions were not made, although I had anticipated that they would be.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is in that context I gave the answer I gave. I did, however, decide it was essential that I should comply with the undertakings I gave this House in regard to raising the Chechen situation in the most effective fashion possible and I therefore availed of the opportunity of quite lengthy access to the Foreign Minister, Mr. Kozyrev, to raise the matter which I have just reported on to this House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach reply to the part of my question which refers to his meeting in London with Tory backbenchers? Did he raise in his discussions with them the issue of Sellafield?  Out of neighbourliness, will he raise with the British Prime Minister the possibility, per the commitment in the programme, <i>A Government of Renewal,</i> that he would request under the Paris Convention arbitration of the dispute between the two countries? In view of the fact that he has given us a dissertation on the Government's plans on Sellafield, how does he reconcile that with voting down our Private Members' motion on the non-proliferation treaty where we were exhorting the Government to carry out a five year review which is, in fact, writtin into the Government's programme, <i>A Government of Renewal.</i>?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy asked if I raised the matter of Sellafield with the British MPs I met in London. The same considerations applied as applied to my decision not to raise the matter with the British Prime Minister. I regarded it as premature until the working group of Ministers referred to in my reply has reported and we have established the scope and nature of the actions we will take. On our own side I felt it would be counterproductive to raise the matter prematurely either with British MPs or the Prime Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The final sentence of the Taoiseach's initial reply stated that he discussed the overall European security question with all the leaders he <Col N="1693" /> spoke to. Did he inform the European leaders of the strong attachment of the Irish people to a policy of military neutrality and their concern that such policy be continued?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the Taoiseach wants to put together a blueprint.  What timescale is envisaged for doing so? Following the non-proliferation treaty conference, will the Taoiseach consider if Ireland will join in the <Col N="1695" /> call for an international ban on the production of civilian plutonium to match the military ban? Now is a good time to look at that as a policy issue. The matter of weapons grade plutonium is being looked at by a team of experts. They have moved to ban it and it would be significant if we moved in that direction. If the Taoiseach feels he can do so, will the Government consider sponsoring a resolution on civilian plutonium at the autumn session of the UN?</P>

      <P>Given the disinterested response the Taoiseach received in Moscow regarding the war in Chechnya and the failure to raise the matter with President Yeltsin, does he accept that a <Col N="1696" /> better form of protest, if the Government were serious about its attitude towards that war, would have been not to attend the ceremonies in Moscow?

      <P>I do not agree with the conclusions drawn by the Deputy. The Russian Federation is a major influence and will remain so in European and world affairs. It is very important that Ireland enjoys good bilateral relations with Russia. In view of the fact that previous attempts to establish bilateral contact between my predecessor and the Russian President did not work out as planned, it was important that I avail of the opportunity when specifically invited by the President of the Russian Federation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

This was particularly important since in terms of absolute numbers no country lost more people than did the Russian Federation and its associated states. At least 20 million people in Russia lost their lives during that war which occurred within the lifetime of many in this House. It was important that Ireland, along with others, should show its concern and sympathy for the Russian people on that loss. It is also important to show our collective determination to ensure that such events never occur again in our lifetime.</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates) Ivan Yates">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13, 32, 47, 69, 72 and 214 together.</P>
      <P>I have been most anxious to ensure the continuation of our live exports to other EU member states and it has been of concern to me that two companies ceased to carry livestock in October 1994. This is a legitimate trade in the context of the Single Market, it is of national importance and it contributes to providing a balance in the market. However, the trade must be carried out in a way that protects the welfare of the animals being transported.</P>
      <P>I have fully supported the Presidency of the EU Agriculture Council in its efforts to have strengthened welfare rules for animal transport adopted by the Council. These additional measures give sufficient guarantees to the ferry companies concerned to continue or, where appropriate, to resume the transport of animals. In the event, agreement was not reached at the last Council and I decided to introduce the measures unilaterally with a view to ensuring the continuation of trade. This was done by order dated 26 April 1995.</P>
      <P>My Department and I have had discussions and meetings with senior representatives of all the companies involved on an ongoing basis and these were intensified following the signing of the order. Arising from these, I am adamant that the order gives sufficient grounds for the two ferry operators to lift their bans. I am confident that before the end of the month agreement will be reached on the resumption of trade from Rosslare to both the UK and the Continent. The freight company will continue to transport breeding animals. I am continuing to press the companies to resume transport of all animals. Further meetings at the highest level are likely to take place soon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The transport issue is likely to come before the Agriculture Council again on 29-30 May on the basis of proposals being suggested by Commissioner Fischler. In this regard the Commissioner will visit Dublin next Tuesday <Col N="1702" /> and I will discuss the matter further with him then. I have undertaken to amend my order of 26 April to take account of any new developments which may result from that initiative. In conclusion, I wish to thank Irish Ferries Limited for continuing to transport livestock from Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>My question specifically asked the Minister when the live export ban imposed by these companies would be lifted. The Minister said that the ban has not yet been lifted and has given an assurance that it will be lifted before the end of the month. Did the Minister not get this assurance from the ferry companies when this issue first arose and when he moved unilaterally to introduce even higher standards of animal transport regulations to alleviate any unfounded problems which people perceived might exist? Given that this ban on all animals is still in place, where stands his previous assurances and what confidence can we have that his present assurances will stand up?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>

      <P>I will reply to the questions <i>seriatim.</i> In relation to Stena Sealink, my officials and I agreed the wording of a statement on the position at the end of the month and I remain confident that it will be fully honoured. The details of the assurances are being worked out. In relation to Pandoro, I have not received a similar assurance but I am working on the possibility of receiving it. I very much welcome the tone of the recent discussions I had with them. A further meeting at the highest level is awaited between them and me. I want to ensure at all stages that I treat all the shipping companies equally so <Col N="1703" /> that there is a uniform approach whereby the principal ban will be lifted, the new tight welfare rules which secure the safety of animals will be implemented and the trade can resume.</P>

I want to move away from the tone of the discussions.  Last week on the streets of Dublin thousands of farmers showed how fed up they were with assurances based on the tone of the discussions. These farmers are looking for action. What assurance can the Minister give the House today that by the end of the month&mdash; the goal posts have been moved yet again&mdash; the ban will be lifted and we will be back at the pre-October situation whereby all livestock can be exported through our ports?

I have progressed the matter to the stage where I have unilaterally proceeded with new regulations which the companies accept meet all the welfare needs of animals from a technical point of view. The shipping companies are sensitive to the publicity which this matter has attracted and they do not want to attract counter demonstrations by other welfare groups. I am anxious to assist them in this regard and I am confident that the existing commitments will be honoured and that we can reach a satisfactory outcome in our discussions.  I have received tremendous support from the farming organisations for the initiatives I have taken.</P>

      <P>The rural environment protection scheme was approved by the <Col N="1705" /> Commission in May 1994. Participants joining the scheme undertake to follow an approved agri-environmental plan for a minimum of five years. A specific allocation has been agreed for Ireland up to 1997. Further allocations to meet any commitments entered into beyond that date will be decided when the budgets for 1998 and beyond are being decided.</P>

I understand that for all countries &mdash; the ESA scheme in Britain, the French scheme and so on &mdash; funding is only available up to 1997. I also understand that a commitment has been made that where contractual undertakings have been entered into, because the REPS is a five-year scheme, they will be honoured.

That being the case, how are farmers to benefit from the £0.5 billion available under the REPS scheme when the Minister has suspended the control of farmyard pollution scheme? Is it not the case that since January the Minister has been aware that he does not have sufficient <Col N="1706" /> funding for the control of farmyard pollution scheme? He has arbitrarily suspended the scheme and there are over 9,000 people who will not be paid.

      <QRef>[8795/95]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 15 and 61 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the recent case in the Dublin Circuit Criminal Court. No blame was attached by the court to any Department official and nobody from the Department has been on trial.</P>
      <P>These matters were also referred to in the beef tribunal report and the tribunal indicated that having heard the evidence it was satisfied that there was no agreement between the Department staff and the representatives of the company with regard to the irregular activities which occurred there.</P>
      <P>The tribunal did comment on the inadequacy of the number of staff employed by the Department in the various meat processing plants throughout the country, mainly at peak periods, and suggested this as a reason for failure to prevent or discover irregularities. However, chapter 25 of the tribunal report sets out the measures taken by the Department to prevent a recurrence of events such as these mentioned in the court case. The tribunal expressed itself as generally satisfied with the measures taken to streamline and improve the control systems. I would like to add that, following the completion of the criminal case, a review of all matters relating to the Department's staff at this meat plant is already under way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the precise steps taken to streamline and improve controls at meat plants, I would refer the Deputy to chapter 25 of the beef tribunal report to which I have already referred. This sets <Col N="1708" /> out the control changes in considerable detail.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that in this case there is no question of inadequacy of numbers or anything such as that? There is no question of Departmental staff having been on trial or anything of that nature. What is at issue here is the sworn testimony of an employee of this factory, which was not contradicted in the course of the trial, that in the full view of three named officials of the Department there was consistent diversion of beef from the intervention line into a separate line for commercial contracts and that, in that way, the company concerned &mdash; not the individuals &mdash; made very large sums of money illegally. Why has the Minister failed to condemn that today? Why is it that there is no question of inadequate supervision? If this was supervised, it was allowed to happen and tacit &mdash; one might almost say explicit &mdash; consent was given to this illegal practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>

I am quite happy for my Department to facilitate the Garda and the Director of Public Prosecutions in every way in any matter relating to Rathkeale that they wish to pursue. Separate from that, I have announced here that there will be a review in my Department of the staffing arrangements and the control procedures that were in place in Rathkeale. I will be happy to come back to the House when that review is completed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not asking the Minister, who announces yet another task force or interdepartmental committee or whatever it is that is supposed to <Col N="1709" /> solve all problems, about what he proposes to do in the future. I am asking him what he has to say about the fact that there was sworn and uncontradicted evidence that three named officials of his Department saw meat being illegally removed from the intervention line and put into a section for commercial contracts where it was sold at a high price for the benefit of the company. Why did the three officials condone that? By his actions today is the Minister condoning what they did?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly, that is my point. None of these people had an opportunity to speak for themselves. The same allegations made by representatives of the meat plant were also made at the beef tribunal against the Department's officials. The tribunal found against that and stated: &ldquo;The tribunal is satisfied that there was no agreement between them and the representatives of the company with regard to the irregular activities which occurred there&rdquo;. So far as I am concerned, the tribunal had investigated the position in Rathkeale and the matter was handed over to the Garda and the Director of Public Prosecutions. It would not have been appropriate for me as Minister or the Department to take action, be it disciplinary or other action, until the court proceedings were over. They are now over and we are trying to find the appropriate measures to deal with it and a review is taking place in that regard. This will not be done by a task force but by the assistant secretary in charge of that division.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I to take it that the Minister now proposes to take action? Why did he, his predecessors and the Department wait four and a half years since this event happened? Will he agree there is no question of the three officials having been charged and that, therefore, they could not be found guilty, and that the evidence given on oath, which was not contradicted either at the tribunal or in the court, was that fraudulent activity went on under the eyes of three named officials who did nothing about it? There was no question of their having entered into an agreement to do nothing about it, but it is not good enough that this should have happened openly and continuously and that the Department should have done nothing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not my decision. It was open to the Garda Síochána and the Director of Public Prosecutions on the available evidence to press charges against the officials and they did not do so. That was the context of the point I made.</P>
      <P>The reason for the four year delay is that it would have been appropriate to determine the question of internal action only after the determination of the legal process to which the question refers. I condemn what happened in Rathkeale but I could not accept what officials from AIBP said without hearing both sides of the story. All Deputy O'Malley's comments are based on statements from employees of AIBP and somebody might say &ldquo;they would say that, wouldn't they?&rdquo;. I have to balance this in the interests of natural justice and, in fairness, I am acting as speedily as possible to ensure that the matter is put on a footing that is beyond reproach.</P>

      <P>In the context of the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference and the Department's input to the Government position, will the CAP have to be further reformed to facilitate enlargement, which will be a central issue in the 1996 debate?

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of enlargement is not a fundamental aspect of the Intergovernmental Conference. The Intergovernmental Conference will deal with common, foreign and security policy.  The decision-making powers of the European Parliament, the size of the Commission, the Union's legislative procedures and the structural treaties are some examples.</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I am dealing with the Intergovernmental Conference first. In regard to foreign policy, the lead <Col N="1712" /> Department is the Department of Foreign Affairs. As a former member of Government the Deputy will know that, in the nature of the structuring of memoranda, we have not reached the stage of bilateral contacts. As to my Department's policy, about which I am happy to be explicit, enlargement, which is inevitable but still some way down the road, does pose threats to the Irish agricultural sector and to the CAP budget, and I have a great fear that CAP prices would become world prices. That would be unacceptable to us because of our dependence on agriculture. My policy, therefore, is to ensure a transitional period before any enlargement for central and eastern European countries and separation of the agricultural issues from the political issues. This happened in regard to GATT in the context of the Blair House agreement whereby the peculiar and distinctive needs of the agricultural sector in Europe were regarded as requiring special and separate consideration.</P>

I am trying to be helpful in setting out the parameters. Negotiations are at a formative stage, and I support the Nalletvon Stolk report whereby we would provide technical and financial assistance to those countries whose production is falling to build them up to a level where they can participate in the CAP.

      <P>If extra staff are needed for this, so be it. In terms of the economic situation, there is no doubt that shortage of staff was one of the reasons we faced such difficulty on the EU fine for disallowance. At present my Department gives £750 million to farmers through premia and headage schemes. I do not want my successor to be faced with horrendous fines because we have inadequate staffing to deal with the <Col N="1715" /> administration of premia and headage payments, which is always a possibility. I am striving to achieve the appropriate level of staff, technology and office accommodation and to give the best value for money from those resources.</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 18 and 43 together.</P>
      <P>The Commission Service notified my Department in March of their proposal to disallow £74.5 million arising from an inquiry into the operation of beef intervention in 1990 and 1991. This inquiry also covered a number of other member states and the Commission Services have proposed disallowances for France, Italy and the UK. The disallowances are proposed in the context of the clearance of accounts for 1992.</P>
      <P>My Department disputes the proposed disallowance on a number of technical grounds and on the basis that the disallowance is disproportionate. I have outlined the basis for our disagreement with the proposal made by the Commission Services to Commissioner Fischler and the Secretary and other senior officials of my Department have also delivered the same message to their equivalent Commission officials.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next stage of the process is to <Col N="1716" /> submit the case to the conciliation process which is now an established part of the procedure for clearance of accounts. This process involves presenting in detail to the conciliation body the grounds on which the Irish authorities disagree with the basis upon which the Commission Services have made their proposal for disallowances. The preparation of the case to be made to the conciliation body is well advanced and is being overseen by a committee of senior officials of my Department.</P>
    <P>The Attorney General has nominated an officer from his office to work on this dossier and there will be close co-operation between my Department and this senior officer in the preparation of the case to be presented to the conciliation body. Should it be necessary then or at a later stage to seek further legal or other professional assistance, including the instruction of counsel at the appropriate time, this will be done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that the European Commission might be more impressed if those responsible for the irregularities in question in respect of which disallowances have been made were made liable to reimburse either the Commission or the State? In that context, is he aware that I have written to the Taoiseach, the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Bruton, the Attorney General and the Director of Public Prosecutions asking whether proceedings are to be brought in the High Court to disqualify any of the directors named on page 336 of the beef tribunal report as having been responsible for the tax fraud from having any part in the management of any company in the foreseeable future? Does the Minister not think it strange that he welcomed the resumption of autonomy in respect of one of the companies involved in this matter without at any stage requiring those responsible for the decisions which have cost this country so much to make some contribution to pay back the cost?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>On the principle of <Col N="1717" /> recoverability of whatever fines may be involved, it is my policy, and the Government's view, that those responsible for any general disallowance should be held culpable and that the issues of recoverability and culpability should be integrated. Once we have negotiated and made representations to secure the lowest possible fine, I envisage that the group which has been established to work on this matter will be focused in that direction.</P>
      <P>I have also taken steps to ensure that FEOGA grant-aid to companies which may have contributed to the fines will be suspended pending the outcome of this process. Both matters show my clear determination to ensure that the taxpayer will not be held responsible. It would be premature to say what point those issues have reached, in terms of recoverability, other than to indicate my determination to pursue them.</P>
      <P>In relation to the formation of Irish Food Processors, the situation is very simple. I am not involved in the business of personalities. If six new investors invest in the largest beef processing capacity in the country and remove the uncertainty which exists for farmers, customers and everyone else connected with the beef industry, not to speak of jobs, this is something I have to welcome. I was very surprised at the coverage it received in so far as that the real story is that the previous main incumbent has been spancilled and is very much a minority shareholder. There will be no favouritism or special relationship while I am Minister. If there was major investment from an outside source in the beef processing industry, which is worth billions of pounds to this country, I should be seen to act fairly and properly and in a developmental way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>In terms of the level of fine and so on, I hope by the end of this year. There are five fines involved. <Col N="1718" /> Therefore there will be different time-scales.  The clearance of accounts for 1992 will have to be completed by the end of this year. I therefore expect this issue to be brought to a conclusion some time between September and December.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that I do not want to get involved in the business of personalities either? This House established an expensive tribunal which cost £30 million. One of its major findings is set out in chapter 9 of its report&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that. One of the findings was that the companies in question engaged in major tax fraud and that top management &mdash; the phrase used in the tribunal's report &mdash; was aware of and organised this. Is the Minister willing to say that the Government will use its legal powers to apply to the courts to ensure that directors and managers of a company which engaged in the largest single fraud in the State will be disqualified from acting as directors and managers? Will the Minister indicate whether this will happen?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy knows full well that that issue does not come within my area of responsibility. If there is a particular delay in obtaining a reply from my colleagues with whom he corresponded I can assist in that regard. I have no function in relation to the Companies Act in this regard. It would be improper of me to state anything other than that the Government is anxious to implement the recommendations of the beef tribunal report, some of which are being discussed in another fora at present. This is causing the Deputy difficulty.  The Government wants to apply the highest standards of integrity, accountability and transparency.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 19, 26, 31, 35, 41, 46, 53, 74, 79, 81, 194, 195, 196, 202, 205 and 206 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because of the unprecedented demand from farmers for aid under the control of farm pollution &mdash; CFP &mdash; scheme and in the light of the funding set aside for the scheme under the <Col N="1722" /> Structural Funds, my Department was forced to suspend the scheme on 27 April. From that date no further CFP applications will be accepted until further notice. Similarly, formal approval of existing applicants also ceased on that date.</P>
    <P>Under the on-farm investment section of the Operational Programme for Agriculture, Rural Development and Forestry, an allocation of £195 million in Structural Funds was provided for the period 1994-99. Approximately half this amount was earmarked for the control of farm pollution scheme. My analysis of the on-farm investment schemes shows an under-funding of at least £60 million. This was of course legislated for by the previous Government and the shortfall is clearly the cause of the current problem. It was anticipated under the national plan authorised by the previous Government that £245 million would be allocated.</P>
    <P>From the launch of the scheme last September until its suspension on 27 April about 18,600 applications were received. This demand was driven by the fact that a CFP scheme had not been in operation since April 1992, the need for some participants in the rural environment protection scheme to have pollution work done under the CFP, the fear that funds would run out and pressures from local authorities and fisheries boards to address pollution problems.</P>
    <P>By 27 April about 6,000 of the CFP applications received had been approved to commence work. To make the payments which would flow from these approvals and to make some inroads into the backlog described above requires bringing forward into 1996 some of the moneys previously earmarked for later years. This will need European Commission and Department of Finance approval. I am actively pursuing this matter. I am confident that such approval will be forthcoming.</P>
    <P>As well as endeavouring to have Structural Funds brought forward from later years, I will also be making a strong case for additional funding under <Col N="1723" /> the review of the Community Support Framework which will be carried out by the Commission in the latter half of next year. If additional funding is secured, it will be possible to reopen the scheme to new applicants.</P>
    <P>I am very concerned about the impact the suspension of the scheme will have on my efforts to build a modern, environment-friendly agricultural industry. I am, therefore, anxious to establish procedures which would enable as many as possible of the 12,600 unapproved applications currently on hands to proceed with essential work. To deal with unapproved applications my intention is to grant &ldquo;conditional approval&rdquo; to facilitate farmers proceeding with their works on the understanding that payment is guaranteed but will be deferred.</P>
    <P>I recently set up a consultative group involving officials of my Department, farm organisations and other interested parties with a view to establishing priority categories for conditional approval. The group reported to me late last night. I am considering the group's recommendations and I expect to be in a position to make a full statement very shortly.</P>
    <P>I am very concerned to ensure that the suspension of the scheme will have minimal impact on the participation in <Col N="1724" /> rural environmental protection scheme. REPS participants approved on or before 27 April who have applied for grant-aid under CFP will have my highest priority. I will be making stringent efforts with the European Commission in the coming months with a view to relaxing the provision that all pollution control works must be completed within 12 months of entering REPS. Many farmers are already substantially in compliance with the pollution control requirements for REPS and more than 30,000 farmers have been grant-aided for pollution control works under previous schemes.</P>
    <P>I am circulating two tables setting out on a county by county basis, the number of applications received and approvals issued under the control of farm pollution scheme and the rural environment protection scheme. More detailed information on REPS applicants is not readily available. The timescale for the payment of REPS applications is of the order of five-six weeks.</P>
    <P>The staffing levels for the operation of this scheme are adequate at present but the situation will be kept under review.</P>
    <P>Under the CFP the total amount paid to date is £3.7 million. The remaining 12,600 unapproved applications would involve grant commitment of about £100 million.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has been in office since 15 December 1994. He stated that 18,600 applications have been made since last September &mdash; an average of 3,000 per month &mdash; 10,000 to 12,000 of which have been made since he came to office. He also stated he is supervising the scheme but that 12,000 people who applied under it will not get any money. That is the Minister's responsibility. Will he agree that although he has overseen the management of this scheme since 15 December <Col N="1727" /> last it has become patently obvious to everybody in the Department that money was not available for it? Is it not at the discretion of any Government at any time to provide extra funds for schemes should it so decide? Why is the Minister hiding behind Structural Funds? If he has the political will, he can provide the funds to meet the demands of thousands of farmers who are anxious to obtain grant-aid under this scheme and to qualify for the rural environment protection scheme? As I said in an earlier question, the Minister will put more than £500 million at risk over the next seven or eight years because of the mess he has made since 15 December. He should put his own house in order.</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy to take any number of supplementaries on this matter, but I should be permitted to give answers. As I said, 6,000 applications have been approved and 12,400 are on file awaiting approval. Of the total amount provided under the scheme only £3.7 million has been paid. We intend to pay everybody who has applied. The reason I suspended the scheme is that I did not want to do what Deputy Cowen thinks has happened, to invite applications without having money to pay them. We are satisfied we <Col N="1728" /> suspended the scheme at a point where those who applied can be paid. The difficulty is that the 6,000 applications approved will draw down all the money earmarked for this year as well as the maximum amount I could get for the next year. The remaining applicants will be paid but it will be in 1997, 1998 or 1999, which is the time frame for the provision of Structural Funds.</P>
      <P>In terms of extra funding, the money for the total scheme, as is the case with all schemes, is signed off by Dublin and Brussels. As Deputies are aware, the previous Government had considerable difficulties as it had less money than it thought. The shortfall in the CFP scheme was £30 million and the shortfall on the entire on-farm investment was £60 million. I regret as much as anyone that the previous Government was not able to secure adequate funding.</P>

      <P>I have tried to bring some order to a chaotic situation. The chaos has resulted in the Government having to tailor the scheme. This matter will be debated in the Seanad tomorrow. Because I received the report only last night I cannot give definitive answers. My intention is to start issuing conditional approvals for the 12,400 applicants whereby they will be allowed go ahead with their work on a deferred basis of payment. That will adequately deal with the position, which is clearly most unsatisfactory.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister seriously suggesting that if he is in a position to find the money within the national resources the Commission will preclude him from putting more money into the scheme? There is great demand from Irish farmers to deal with this issue and great interest by the Commission in the control of farmyard pollution scheme. Therefore, the Minister should not put out the idea that he is confined by the <Col N="1729" /> level of funding available. Is the Minister telling me that if he had the political will to get the money from national resources &mdash; he had no problem increasing the funding by more than 12 per cent in the first three months of his tenure &mdash; the Commission will preclude him from providing more Irish money to grant-aid the thousands of farmers who applied under the scheme? That would not happen.</P>
      <P>Is the Minister seriously suggesting that farmers can take his word that they will be paid some time, in the same way as exporters were told they could export their cattle some time? People cannot start work without grant approval, and the Minister knows that. Is it not the case that out of the total applications received, conditional grant approval applies to only 220 farmers who have been paid the first instalment of the rural environment protection scheme, 100 farmers who have county council section 12 notices and 3,000 farmers who had lodged their applications prior to 31 December? Is it, therefore, the case that a third of the approvals will be conditional and that the other 9,000 can wait and, as it were, live to eat grass another day because neither the Minister nor his Government has the political ability to come up with the categories and priorities for money for this scheme? Thousands of farmers are waiting for the Minister to stop delaying and to provide the money.</P>

      <P>The position on funding is clear. A sum of £5.8 million has been signed off between Dublin and Brussels. If Spain, Portugal or Greece do not draw down their moneys, there is a prospect of securing extra funds at the mid-term review, but that will not be known until the end of next year. I would not hold out too many hopes on that, but I will press the case as best I can. As regards the lateral movement of money, I do not know what suggestions the Deputy has, but I believe it would give rise to some difficulty. Regarding conditional approvals, I am intrigued by the figures the Deputy gave of the 220 cases under REPs and so on. The Deputy seems to be better informed about what is happening in my Department than I am as I was only able to extract that information at lunchtime.

      <P>I do not want the Deputy to make a fool of himself because there is a danger he will. There are priority categories such as people who have been approved under REPs and are in receipt of payments whom I am anxious to facilitate. I am also anxious to deal with regional inequalities, where applications submitted last September in one county have not been approved because of a shortage of staff while those submitted up to last February in another country in which there is adequate staff have been approved. I hope to make an announcement in the Seanad tomorrow night on this matter. The Deputy's party has tabled a motion on it. I do not want any further delay on this matter.</P>
      <P>I have tried to consult farming groups so that everyone concerned can have a fair and reasonable input to this matter. The 6,000 whose applications have been approved can go ahead and draw money in the normal way, another tranche of urgent cases will be given conditional approval fairly quickly and the rest will be given conditional approval fairly quickly after that. I will deal with the small group of 3,500 as a matter of urgency and give them conditional approval. It is important for farmers who borrow money to carry out capital works to know when they will be paid and the earliest that will happen is 1997. I did not negotiate this round of funding.</P>

I do not know of any bank that will respond to the Minister's vote of confidence. It is ridiculous for the Minister to suggest that farmers should be asked to put in place expensive slatted sheds and so on and wait for his Department to pay for them. As the Minister does not appear to be able to see the wood for the trees, does he accept that farmyard pollution has had a detrimental effect on the environment and, if so, why did he abandon a scheme which, I am sure he agrees, was making a significant impact on our environment?

      <P>To say the least, the Minister is misleading and extremely creative. As he stated the operational programme provides for an expected 30,000 applications under this scheme.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>It is open to the Minister to seek increased funding from the Government. Does he agree it is also open to him to provide money on the basis that the object of such schemes is to achieve success? It was obvious this scheme would be successful. It is up to the Minister to let Brussells know that this scheme has been successful and that the Irish Government is willing to provide additional funding in the next few years to ensure farmers are not disadvantaged.  The Minister need not have cut off the number of applications at 18,000 when the figure anticipated was 30,000. To suggest that further applications will not qualify for the scheme makes a lie of the operational programme which anticipates 30,000 applicants.</P>

      <P>Having shown a total absence of any ideas on how to deal with this catastrophe, may I put forward two options to the Minister which will ensure that farmers get money to do this essential work? First, if he has a problem about reallocating Structural Funds, he can make this the top priority in his Department and begin a national scheme to cover that situation. That is one option open to him. Many national on-farm investment schemes were put forward in the past when we were in more difficult financial straits than this. The second option concerns an amendment I put down to the Finance Bill, about which the Minister, Deputy Yates, undertook to speak to the Minister for Finance. I was disappointed to hear that the Minister knew nothing about it and I would like to know if the Minister intends to speak to the Minister for Finance before Report Stage on Thursday next so that the Government might agree to sponsor an amendment for a scheme of accelerated capital allowances, in relation to this specific scheme, with 50 per cent repayments in year 1. In that way, the Minister would get over his problem of not having the money for grant aid and would be sending out a direct signal that, through the tax system, people would be able to get a tax break on this specific investment. They would be able to go ahead and do the work and the money could then be diverted to people with fewer than 80 livestock units who are not in the tax net. There is a number of ways he can get over this hump, which has become an Everest for the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Minister give consideration to supporting an amendment by the <Col N="1745" /> Minister for Finance on Thursday next for an accelerated capital allowances scheme which will allow people to carry out this essential work? Also, will the Minister give consideration to an augmented national control of farmyard pollution scheme based on a memo he would be prepared to bring to Government as a matter of urgency?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I have come from a meeting of the Joint Committee on European Affairs, of which I am a member, where we had an interesting discussion with our Danish counterparts. Denmark has had a European affairs committee for a considerable time. They have been in this country for two days <Col N="1896" /> and we acquired considerable information from them during our discussions in the committee. They indicated to us the work which they, as a European affairs committee, have been doing. I place on record my appreciation of the fact that we met with them and had an important discussion with them from the point of view of our neophyte committee.</P>
      <P>As I understand it, under the Bill it is intended to transfer European secondary legislation from the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs to the Joint Committee on European Affairs. I indicated that it was not good to place the additional burden of this aspect of the workings of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs onto a new committee. The Joint Committee on European Affairs met with the Minister for Justice on 5 May. In anticipation of that meeting we received a wheelbarrow full of paper. That was not a good precedent. Together with what I would describe as the hospital pass from the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs to the Joint Committee on European Affairs it does not auger well for the efficient working of the Joint Committee on European Affairs. It may be an ill omen. I do not suggest that members of the committee are not able to handle secondary legislation, quite the contrary. However, we are dealing with the matter <i>post hoc.</i> Most of the legislation we received in committee has been in existence for some time. I would like to think the committee would anticipate legislation rather than receive it.</P>
      <P>The committee has an important additional role to play. I pay tribute to the Chairman, Deputy Ferris, who has made a good effort to ensure its efficient running. Ireland will hold the European Presidency in the second half of next year and there is an upcoming governmental conference in which we will play an important role. I do not imagine that conference will begin and end with the Irish Presidency. It may begin before Ireland holds the Presidency and continue after that period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the past five years we have <Col N="1897" /> held the Presidency on three or four occasions and the Government Departments, more specifically the Department of Foreign Affairs, have shown tremendous leadership. They did the country proud. I wish the Government well, or whatever Government will be in power in the second half of 1996. It is good for national morale that we are seen to run the Presidency efficiently. We have a good record and the officials in the Department of Foreign Affairs have been second to none in that regard. They are of great assistance to whatever figurehead is in the Department.  I suspect Deputy Spring may be the Minister in 1996. The Joint Committee on European Affairs will have an important and fundamental role to play together with the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs.</P>
    <P>The committee will have other fundamental matters to consider such as the ongoing obscenity of the distribution of arms by certain countries within the EU. As a small country with a non-colonial past, we have a very important moral role to play in leading on issues such as the obscene ongoing arms race and the distribution of arms to counties in Africa and elsewhere. When one thinks of the conflicts of Rwanda, Zaire, Bosnia and Croatia, one must ask where the arms are coming from. In addition to what is expected from it in the context of this Bill, the European Affairs Committee must deal with these issues.</P>
    <P>We must consider the possibility of the European Union being given a place within the Security Council of the United Nations. Given the way in which the world has developed in the past ten to 15 years, it is a nonsense that only a certain number of countries are members of the UN Security Council. For example, it is a nonsense to exclude China, which has a quarter of the world's population, from membership of the Security Council. Consideration must also be given to membership by India and the countries of the Far East. I would like to think that the European Affairs Committee will consider these matters and humanitarian aid, an issue <Col N="1898" /> which has not been fully developed within the European Union.</P>
    <P>The committee must also consider enlargement of the European Union and membership by Eastern European counties such as Hungary and Poland. This is a very interesting and exciting time for the committee and I welcome the prospect of having an opportunity to discuss these issues. The Government has set up 18 committees and I am concerned that some of the more important of them might break down due to an inadequate backup service and a lack of official input. I am not in any way criticising the officials on the committees. On the contrary, we do not have sufficient officials to operate the committee system and if additional officials are required they should be appointed. In addition we should have adequate research and backup services.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>This extremely important Bill has very far reaching consequences. As I have repeatedly stated in the House, we do not fully appreciate the importance of the future of Europe. We in this House have been extraordinarily negligent in not planning our future in Europe or attempting to deduce what will happen in Europe at the end of the century and thereafter.</P>
      <P>Ireland has been a member of the EU since 1973. Yesterday I read in the papers that this was the 25th anniversary of our participation in meaningful negotiations on becoming a member of the EU. While there have been considerable changes to date these have been gradual and anticipated and have not been unduly upsetting for us. However, by 1999 the changes in so far as Ireland's membership of the EU is concerned will be dramatic. We have not made any adequate preparation for these changes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the establishment of the European Affairs Committee which hopefully will be relevant. If the committee is a talking shop then it will not serve any particular purpose. The time has come for definite questions to be asked about our future in Europe and <Col N="1899" /> for definite answers to be given. Initially we were the main beneficiaries from the European Union and it is extraordinary to think that the time when we will be net contributors is not that far away &mdash; it may be as soon as four or five years. People are not prepared for a financial or cultural shock of that magnitude. In future when people visit Hungary, Poland and Romania they will see signs which say that certain roads and bridges have been built with the aid of money from the European Union. Some of that money will have been provided by the Irish taxpayer. To date we have been recipients of this funding. We are moving from being huge net beneficiaries to being net contributors to the EU. To date no attempt has been made to indicate what our contribution will be and how it will vary as the countries from Central and Eastern Europe join the EU. The public is entitled to be informed about these matters. We should also inform school children, the people who will have to live with the decisions which will be made in the next four or five years, about the relevance of these decisions.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I am not opposed to enlargement of the European Union; anyone who is opposed to it is guilty of selfishness. We have received much from the EU and we have been given the opportunity to compete with all the other economically strong countries in Western Europe. We have been given funding, markets and opportunities and if our house is not in order that is our fault. I wonder if we will be able to face up to the fact that we will not be net beneficiaries from the EU in four or five years time. Will we be able to take this on board or will it be too much for us to absorb? If we are not capable of facing up to this fact it will be because we were not informed in time and did not debate it in this House in good time. I have been asking for such a debate for the past three or four years and all I have heard from successive Ministers for Foreign Affairs is that we must do something about it. The formation of <Col N="1900" /> this committee would seem a good starting point. I hope the Minister for Foreign Affairs will attend all meetings of this committee and, perhaps, other members of the Government, including the Ministers for Finance, Agriculture, Food and Forestry and others will become directly involved.</P>
    <P>The admission of countries such as Poland, Romania, Bulgaria and Turkey to the European Union will result in a massive drain on Community funds. The integration of East Germany into West Germany to form the present State of Germany caused such reverberations financially for West Germany that the institutions of the Community were shaky for some time. East Germany, a country of less than 20 million people, was supposed to be the flagship of the Communist world. Whenever one went to East Berlin or East Germany under the Communist regime, East Germany, and East Berlin in particular, were held up as models of Communism. We were led to believe there was no place else in the Communist world which was on a par with East Germany economically or aesthetically. When it amalgamated with West Germany the reverberations were tremendous, it caused huge financial problems. The run down state of its industry, the need to modernise its social welfare system to cater for the huge numbers who had been unemployed because of the change from a communist dominated system to a free enterprise one caused huge repercussions.</P>
    <P>What will it be like when we get 40 million Poles, 13 million Hungarians, 23 million Romanians and 15 million Bulgarians into the European Union? None of those countries has an infrastructure which is anything approaching the state of the economy that pertained in Eastern Germany. It will mean that the finances of the Community will be under considerable pressure. I do not believe we in Ireland quite realise that. The sooner the debate gets underway and the sooner the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, together with <Col N="1901" /> officials from the Department of Foreign Affairs appear before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Affairs to participate in a question and answer session the better. People will than be in a position to assess the country's future.</P>
    <P>On enlargement, Hungary is reasonably well situated to face up to the trauma of joining a free enterprise economy which is represented by the European Union. That country has been trying to come to terms with it for some years and is the most advanced in that regard. Poland, which has made an attempt, would not be as far advanced. Romania and Bulgaria have a great need for huge investment to bring their economies into line with those of western Europe. The Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic also anticipate membership and their needs will not be as considerable as those of Romania and Bulgaria. Nevertheless, they will be daunting.</P>
    <P>I understand Switzerland has expressed an interest in joining the Community but how strong that interest is remains to be seen. That will not be a problem, they will probably be net contributors.  Lesser countries such as Cyprus and Malta have also expressed an interest in joining but their economic situation is reasonably good. The political situation in Cyprus would be the greatest problem although the Maltese connection with some of the more militant Arab states gives rise to certain security anxieties.</P>
    <P>The biggest difficulty arises with Turkey.  That country is problematic for a number of reasons. First, its population and the poverty of most of its people would cause tremendous financial problems.  Second, the human rights record in Turkey is anything but satisfactory. Their treatment of the Kurds, even in more recent times, leaves much to be desired. Their military intervention in Cyprus 25 years ago also gives rise to considerable anxieties. There is a considerable problem with regard to Turkey which has been an applicant for membership of the European Union <Col N="1902" /> longer than any of the other countries I mentioned. That application has been put on the back burner and for very good reason.</P>
    <P>There are numerous problems to be overcome, not least the huge financial strain it will put on the Community. As a member of the Council of Europe for many years past I noticed that not alone these countries but a number of other central and eastern European countries have joined the Council of Europe. Each of them has an ambition to join the European Union. That is exclusive of those I mentioned. If we take into account the Baltic republics such as Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia, countries which have a considerable economic deficit <i>vis-à-vis</i> the European Union, and Albania, it is easy to see how the whole Community will come under considerable strain.</P>
    <P>There is a time factor involved. We are led to believe from the media that Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic expect to be full members of the European Union within two years. The problem is considerable and the financial effect on our economy will be tremendous. I have not met any person who has contradicted me on that point because nobody has analysed the situation in sufficient depth to know what the cost of the membership of these countries will be and the consequences for the budget of the European Union.</P>
    <P>Ireland is one of the countries which will be affected by any deficiency in the budget of the European Union because we go from being net benefactors to net contributors. The sooner we have an open debate in this House and in the Joint Committee on European Affairs the better. In regard to our economy it will mean that our biggest industry, agriculture, will lose export refunds, guaranteed minimum prices for our farm products put into intervention; in other words we will lose the guaranteed minimum price for beef, milk products and cereals which are our basic commodities.  I do not know whether the <Col N="1903" /> farming community realise that although it has been explained to them.</P>
    <P>The grim scenario of the GATT agreement has not yet filtered through but it will in the years ahead. That will mean open competition with every country in the world. Prices in many countries are one third or less of what pertains here. The difficulties for the farming community will be enormous. If our economy is not capable of standing on its own we will be in trouble. What we hope is that the money we have been receiving for a number of years through supports for the farming community and the Structural and Cohesion Funds will put us on a par with all the developed countries in Western Europe. However, that is doubtful.</P>
    <P>We should be given an assessment of how we stand <i>vis-à-vis</i> countries with whom we will be expected to complete on a level playing pitch, because there will be no preferential treatment for Ireland once these other countries have joined; the preferential treatment will go to the countries of Central and Eastern Europe and we will be expected to be net contributors, not net beneficiaries.  A debate is badly needed because there are many questions that need to be answered, and the sooner we have such a debate the better.</P>
    <P>How will the cohesion of the Community stand up under the additional strain of new members? The number of countries in the Community went from six to nine, to 12, to 15. It may rise to 20 in the not too distant future and, perhaps to 25 or 26. There is a daunting future in store for us. It will not be too long before large countries like the Ukraine will be looking for membership.  They have already indicated that they wish to become a member of the Council of Europe. It is likely also that the Russian Confederation will seek to become a member of the European Union. They have already applied for membership of the Council of Europe. The Russian Conferderation is an enormous bloc consisting of 78 different nationalities, many of which we have <Col N="1904" /> never heard. Were it not for the war in Chechnya in the past year we would not have known that country existed. Nor have we heard of the adjoining countries mentioned in news bulletins. We are talking in terms of a vast European Union. For practical purposes the Russian Confederation is now being accepted as part of Europe, although the bulk of its physical land mass, including Vladivostok the major port on the Japanese Sea, is thousands of miles away from Europe. I would like us to have an in-depth debate in this House and in the Joint Committee on European Affairs as soon as possible, to include a question and answer session with the Minister for Foreign Affairs and his officials, because we are illinformed and ill-equipped to deal with the problems which face us in the years ahead.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be brief. I agree with Deputy Deasy's overall perspective with regard to the future development of the European Union. Undoubtedly counties in Central and Eastern Europe, in the Balkans, on the Baltic, plus Turkey, Malta and Cyprus are in line for membership of the Community. There is the further complication of the position with regard to the Russian Confederation and the Ukraine. All of this was dealt with in the last report produced by the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs before responsibility for this was handed over to the Joint Committee on European Affairs. This report dealt with many of the issues raised by Deputy Deasy. It also dealt with an enlargement of the Union in the context not just of the recent applicant countries but of future developments in the Central and Eastern European sphere. That document which analysed all the information, is available to everybody and should form the basis of a discussion within the Joint Committee on European Afairs in due course because there will be major problems in the development of the European Union in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1905" /> Apart from the economic implications for this country in terms of the common agricultural policy and Structural Funds, there are the questions of how an enlarged Union is to be governed, and how the decision-making process, which is basic to running any institution, will be effective in an enlarged Union. All the necessary analyses are contained in the report which is a basis for further constructive discussion of the major problems facing not just Ireland but the European Union in the future, including the question of making financial resources available to cope with the present policies of the Union.</P>
    <P>However, that is not what I intended to speak on today. I proposed to speak on an area that comes within the ambit of both the Joint Committee on European Affairs and the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, that is, the development of a common foreign and security policy. We must have a position on that between now and the meeting of the Intergovernmental Conference scheduled for the second half of 1996. Ireland will chair that conference at which the European Union will have to come to conclusions as to the future of a common foreign and security policy.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil has always maintained and favoured a policy of military neutrality.  Side by side with that, since the 1930s, it has also as a party in Government favoured collective security under the auspices of international organisations such as the United Nations and the Organisation of Security and Cooperation in Europe. We have an attachment to military neutrality but this does not preclude us from becoming involved in international security work under the auspices of the UN or the OSCE. We have, over the past 30 years, made substantial contributions, particularly to peace-keeping with the UN. For that reason I wish to make it clear that Ireland should contribute positively to the development of the common foreign and security policy in the Union as envisaged in the Maastricht Treaty. Under that policy our party &mdash; I hope <Col N="1906" /> the Government will follow this lead &mdash; would be glad to make our defence forces available to the European Union for the purpose of crisis management, of preventive diplomacy where peace-keeping skills and resources would be required. Already our Garda Síochána in Namibia and our Army personnel in other countries made a substantial contribution in this respect. There is no reason we cannot do such work under the auspices of the European Union acting directly or in conjunction with the OSCE. This matter is being discussed at present.</P>
    <P>Given our expertise in peacekeeping, crisis management, preventive diplomacy, humanitarian relief and the protection of those engaged in the provision of this relief, we could make a positive contribution under a common foreign and security policy with a defence component in the way we have heretofore contributed to the United Nations and the OSCE. There is no reason we should not evolve such a policy without going to one extreme or the other.</P>
    <P>In the deliberations in the run up to and during the intergovernmental conference we should not encourage the adoption of a uniform approach towards framing a common defence policy. Each country has something to offer. This is not a large country and while we do not have infantry battalions, tanks, artillery, missiles or planes to offer&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>We will have less according to the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;we can make a contribution within certain niche areas which we should identify. A positive example is the transport company sent to Somalia. Under a common policy we could provide help when there is conflict by providing policing and peace-keeping personnel, humanitarian relief and medical assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In framing a common defence policy member states should be allowed to play different roles. They will do this in any case. France, the United Kingdom <Col N="1907" /> and Germany will always play their own roles. We also have a role to play along the lines I have suggested. It is a question of how we work out the contribution each country can make and the role it can play without adopting a uniform approach or imposing a blanket common defence policy. We need to address this question in the run up to and during the intergovernmental conference.</P>
    <P>This approach has also been adopted to some extent by Austria, Finland, Sweden and Denmark in regard to the contribution they would like to make under a common defence policy which forms an integral part of a common foreign and security policy. We should monitor the thinking of the foreign ministers of these countries and help to co-ordinate the policies of the smaller European states in the run up to the intergovernmental conference which is to be held next year.</P>
    <P>No political party in this House should adopt a divisive approach to this matter based on slogans which are no longer relevant in the new Europe. Since the end of the Cold War there have been no divisions between the Warsaw Pact countries and NATO and there is no military alliance threatening any country. There is, however, uncertainty and insecurity in countries on the fringe of the European Union. In the months ahead we should think along the lines of formulating a common foreign and security policy with a defence component based on preventive diplomacy under which we can make a contribution along the lines I have suggested rather than engage in sterile debate on this matter.</P>
    <P>It is a good idea to set up this committee which was a sub-committee of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs of which I was chairman as there is an enormous amount of work to be done. It is important that its work and that of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs be co-ordinated, particularly where there is an overlap as in the case of the common foreign and security policy. We <Col N="1908" /> must become more involved in the European Union as it will expand and develop policies which will be of importance to this country. We should ensure that we make a positive contribution.</P>

      <P>The debate in the Dáil on 9 May on the Second Stage of the European Communities (Amendment) Bill, 1995 has demonstrated three things. First, it has demonstrated the important role which can and should be played by the Oireachtas in the formulation of Irish policy towards the European Union. It is because of this role, this essential democratic input, that the Government originally proposed the setting up of the new Joint Committee on European Affairs to complement the work of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs. I wish Deputy Ferris well in his chairmanship of the new committee. We very much look forward both to the contribution of the committee, with the statutory functions being conferred on it by the present Bill, and of the Houses of the Oireachtas to our ongoing consideration of European issues, especially in the run-up to the Irish Presidency in the second half of next year. During the debate several references were made to the importance of contributions by Ministers and civil servants to the work of the committee and that of other committees, and appreciation was expressed about participation to date. I assure the House of the continued constructive participation by members of the Government and officials.</P>
      <P>Next year's intergovernmental conference will consider the role of national parliaments in relation to the business of the European Union and it is vital that views of national parliaments themselves be formulated and taken into account.</P>
      <P>Second, the debate has illustrated the vast importance of the European Union to Ireland. The wide array of issues dealt with in the debate is evidence of how the European Union touches upon so many facets of Irish life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1909" /> Third, the debate has highlighted once again the complexity of the issues facing the Union, and the importance of greater openness and transparency so that these issues are easily understood by ordinary citizens. In explaining the workings of the European Union to ordinary citizens much can be done at European and national level by all concerned, including by the Commission, by politicians, officials, and the media.</P>
    <P>I welcome the widespread recognition of the Government's efforts in this regard. The process of public consultation leading to the publication of the White Paper on Irish foreign policy as well as the Communicating Europe initiative reflect the priority which the Government attaches to securing greater public understanding of European issues.</P>
    <P>Next year Ireland will hold the Presidency of the European Union, and as the Tánaiste mentioned in his opening address in the debate on 9 May, the 1996 Presidency will pose a stiffer challenge for the country than on previous occasions. However, we look forward to meeting that challenge and the Presidency will afford many opportunities for the conduct of everyday EU business to be brought closer to the ordinary citizen in Ireland. The people will be able to an extent, as it were, to see the decision-making processes at first hand.</P>
    <P>I should now like to turn to a number of the specific points which arose during the debate. The Government welcomes the support for the Bill from all sides of this House and the Seanad.</P>
    <P>Let me also clarify straight away the title of the Bill. It was suggested by one Deputy that the Bill should be called the European Union (Amendment) Bill rather than the European Communities (Amendment) Bill. I will explain why this would be incorrect. Technically, the purpose of the Bill is to amend an existing Act entitled the European Communities Act. Clearly, therefore, the Bill is properly entitled the &ldquo;European Communities (Amendment) Bill&rdquo; because it seeks to amend the Act of that name. More importantly, it should <Col N="1910" /> be borne in mind that the European Union consists of three pillars. Under the first pillar there are in law three Communities which continue to subsist: (i) the European Community, (ii) the European Coal and Steel Community, and (iii) the European Atomic Energy Community. The European Communities Act, as amended, gives the force of law in Ireland to those three Treaties, but not to all the provisions of the European Union Treaty. Thus, the title of the Bill as proposed is correct.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies referred to several instances of what they considered to be unnecessary or excessively detailed regulation at European Union level. I readily agree that there have been such cases, although I think the number of instances is often exaggerated by the popular press, particularly in Britain. It must be borne in mind that what may seem like very technical provisions may be necessary to transform the Single Market into a reality for exporters. Without many of these measures it would not be possible to reap the full benefits of the Single Market but I stress that the amount of new legislation being brought forward at Union level has declined in recent years, and this trend is likely to continue. The fall-off in the amount of new legislation reflects on the one hand the good progress which has been made towards the completion of the Single Market, and on the other the new emphasis on subsidiarity, that is the principle whereby the Union should not get involved in areas which are better dealt with at national level.</P>
    <P>In response to Deputies who referred to the question of a referendum on any outcome of the intergovernmental conference negotiations that would involve Ireland's participation in a common defence policy, I assure the House that the commitment in the Government's Programme for Renewal to hold such a referendum is clear and unambiguous. This commitment will ensure that Ireland's policy of military neutrality will remain unchanged unless the people decide otherwise.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1911" /> As regards the provision of adequate staffing for the different Oireachtas committees referred to during the debate, it is clearly important that all the committees should function effectively, and this means having adequate back-up. The Bill, of course, does not deal with this aspect, being concerned only with the transfer from one committee to another of certain functions in relation to the supervision of EC secondary legislation. The Houses of the Oireachtas are, I understand, in ongoing discussions with the Department of Finance on staffing, and additional staff have already been allocated to the committee secretariat.</P>
    <P>In the course of the debate there was a reference to a recent suggestion which queried the authenticity of certain Irish national statistics. It is true, as indeed is the case for most countries that the quality of our national statistics needs to be improved. However, the problem must not be exaggerated. The positive trends in the Irish economy are clear and beyond question. Ireland is fully on course to move to the final stage of European Monetary Union.</P>
    <P>As regards next year's Intergovernmental Conference, the question was raised of preserving the balance between the Union's institutions. I assure the House that this will be one of the top priorities of the Government at the negotiations. It is particularly important to ensure that the prerogatives of the Commission are fully preserved.</P>
    <P>In response to Deputy Andrews's contribution this afternoon, I wish to make a couple of points. Now that there is a separate Joint Committee on European Affairs it is obvious that that committee, rather than the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, should exercise the statutory function in regard to secondary legislation. I agree with Deputy Andrews that the important role of the Joint Committee on European Affairs extends beyond the statutory functions conferred on it by the present Bill. I thank Deputy Andrews for his best <Col N="1912" /> wishes for the Presidency and I note his comments on the content of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I listened with interest to Deputy Lenihan's views on the development of a defence dimension to the Union. I thank him for his considered contribution in which his expertise in this area was obvious. The Tánaiste has set out certain options which are open to Ireland in terms of the development of a security dimension of the Common Foreign and Security Policy. He also set out principles that should apply to the development of that policy. He indicated that Ireland will participate constructively in discussions and that there will be a referendum on any outcome of the intergovernmental conference negotiations that would involve Ireland's participation in a common defence policy, and I underline that as beyond doubt.</P>
    <P>I assume my colleague, Deputy Deasy, that the Government is ensuring and will continue to ensure that Ireland is fully prepared to address all the challenges facing the Union: the Irish Presidency next year, the 1996 Intergovernmental Conference and future enlargement. The implications of these challenges are being fully explored. The Programme of Government recognises that Ireland will face a more complex relationship with Europe in the years ahead. As the Tánaiste emphasised earlier in the debate on this Bill, the Government is determined to encourage public debate on European issues. I accept fully the point made by Deputy Deasy in this regard. We have not perhaps given this matter sufficient air time, as it were, in these Houses. As leaders in our communities and Oireachtas Members in the various parties we should bring the debate to the people in our constituencies and ensure the cry of democratic deficit no longer has the validity it may well have had to date. We must encourage the people to participate in the debate and make them aware of the issues so that they feel it is their Union rather than just our Union as national politicians.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1913" /> The forthcoming White Paper will play an important role in this regard. The question was raised on the Order of Business on when the White Paper would be published. I understand it is expected to be published by the end of June. The Tánaiste indicated that he looks forward to working closely with the Joint Committee on European Affairs. I agree with Deputy Deasy on the importance of the issues which must be addressed in the context of further enlargement. The countries of central and Eastern Europe legitimately aspire to European Union membership and that aspiration must be met. Enlargement must at the same time preserve the Union's essential achievements and policies to date and permit the continued process of integration. It is far too early to assess if and at what point Ireland will become a net contributor to the Union budget. I hope we can continue to derive enormous benefits from the Common Agricultural Policy and the policy of cohesion for a long time to come.</P>
    <P>This debate has been useful and stimulating and augurs well for the work of the new Joint Committee. The Bill puts in place a small but important piece of the jigsaw of an appropriate and enhanced committee structure in the Oireachtas for dealing with European issues.</P>
    <P>On a personal basis I wish Deputy Ferris and the members of the committee well in their most important deliberations in the days and months ahead.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Howlin) Brendan Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The basic purpose of this Bill is to introduce new requirements relating to <Col N="1914" /> consequential disqualification orders for persons convicted of certain road traffic offences, particularly drink driving offences.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes to amend some of the minimum periods of disqualification which were provided for in the Road Traffic Act, 1994. It also deleted the requirement &mdash; introduced in the 1994 Act &mdash; that persons convicted of drink driving offences and therefore disqualified must pass a driving test before a driving licence can be reissued. The Bill also contains transitional provisions applying to people who have been convicted of certain offences committed in the period between 2 December 1994 and the enactment of this measure.</P>
    <P>Before the Road Traffic Act, 1994 was enacted, there was a maximum blood alcohol limit of 100 milligrammes of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood. Any person convicted of an offence of exceeding that limit was automatically disqualified from driving for a minimum period of one year. In addition, the courts had the power to impose a fine of up to £1,000 and to impose a term of imprisonment of up to six months. That law had the support of the vast majority of motorists who accepted that drink driving was a serious offence justifying stringent penalties.</P>
    <P>The Road Traffic Act, 1994 introduced a number of important changes to our road traffic legislation, including a general updating of the law as it applied to drinking and driving. The new 1994 Act generated significant media and public interest. The debate which followed its commencement focused on three elements of the new law: the reduction in the maximum permissible blood alcohol level from 100 milligrammes to 80 milligrammes of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood; the doubling of the minimum period of disqualification &mdash; from one year to two years &mdash; for persons convicted of drink driving offences; and the new requirement that a convicted person must pass a driving test before the disqualification is removed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1915" /> This Bill arises from a review of those three elements of the 1994 Act. Before dealing with the specific provisions in the Bill, I propose to outline briefly the developments which gave rise to these new proposals.</P>
    <P>The reduced alcohol limit and the new disqualification provisions were introduced in conjunction with the annual Christmas road safety campaign. Because of the added risks associated with motoring during the festive season, the Christmas campaign normally concentrates on drinking and driving and it includes intensified enforcement measures.</P>
    <P>The combination of the new more stringent laws and the extra publicity and enforcement had an immediate impact on driving habits and there was a noticeable drop in the number of road deaths and injuries in the month of December. In that month, 28 people were killed on the roads and 729 were injured, compared with 41 deaths and 965 injuries in December 1993.</P>
    <P>The significant improvement in road accidents statistics, compared with the same period in recent years, cannot, however, be attributed to a single factor. The new legislation, with its stringent penalties and intensified enforcement, had a major impact, but I believe that the ongoing educational and publicity campaigns also contributed. Public attitudes have changed and I think the House will agree that, in recent years, the motoring public has shown a more mature and responsible attitude in so far as drinking and driving are concerned.</P>
    <P>The Road Traffic Act, 1994 proved to be controversial and there was a strong demand for change. This demand came from a variety of sources: from vested interest groups, from media commentators, private motorists, and a range of organisations including groups representing motorists. The most persistent criticism of the new laws was that the penalties were excessive and, in particular, that the single minimum period of mandatory disqualification, irrespective of the level of alcohol found in drivers <Col N="1916" /> in individual cases, resulted in penalties being imposed which took no account of the severity of the offence committed.</P>
    <P>In January last, I announced that the new drink driving laws would be reviewed and that I intended to consult with a wide variety of interest groups before deciding whether to propose changes. I met with representatives of the drinks industry, including vintners, restaurateurs and hoteliers. This group was naturally very critical of the 1994 Act and was most vocal in demanding change. I also met with representatives of the insurance industry which has a direct interest in road safety matters and meetings were also held with Mothers against Drink Driving and the Campaign against Drunken and Dangerous Driving. I received written submissions from a wide cross section of opinion. Following that consultation process, and in the light of the views submitted, the Government reviewed three elements of the 1994 Act.</P>
    <P>The first issue was the new blood alcohol level of 80 milligrammes of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood. This limit applies in eight member states of the European Union and the limit in the other states is lower. The Government is in full agreement with that limit. All the evidence available to us indicates that the risk of accident rises very sharply when the blood alcohol level exceeds 80 milligrammes. At that level, the risk of involvement in an accident is significantly greater than the risk of a driver with zero alcohol. Accordingly the Government has firmly decided that the alcohol limit of 80 milligrammes of alcohol per 100 millitres of blood introduced in December 1994 should be retained.</P>
    <P>The second element of the law to be reviewed was the disqualification requirements. Having reviewed this aspect, the Government is satisfied that disqualification from driving is a suitable penalty for drink driving offences and that the principle of consequential or mandatory disqualification should be retained. Under this system, the courts must, on conviction for specified <Col N="1917" /> offences, impose a minimum period of disqualification from holding a driving licence; this has been a feature of our road traffic legislation for many years and experience shows it to be a very effective deterrent.</P>
    <P>It is, however, valid to question the provision in the 1994 Act under which a single minimum period of disqualification is imposed, irrespective of the level of alcohol consumed. Accordingly, I sought advice from the Attorney General on the feasibility of introducing a range of disqualification periods to be linked to the amount of alcohol consumed in individual cases.</P>
    <P>I understand the former Minister considered this issue but was advised, following consultation with the Office of the Attorney General, that there were difficulties arising from the operation of a tolerance which resulted in borderline cases not being prosecuted. However, I was advised that the Director of Public Prosecutions had, since then, reviewed the need for that tolerance and decided, on the basis of assurances given to him about the accuracy of analysis, to discontinue the tolerance and to prosecute borderline cases. The Attorney General has advised me that this decision of the Director of Public Prosecutions has removed a major obstacle to the introduction of a graded system of penalties and the Government has decided that the law should be amended to provide for such a system.</P>
    <P>The third element of the Road Traffic Act, 1994 which was reviewed was the requirement to pass a driving test before a driving licence is returned following conviction for a drink driving offence. The courts have had a discretionary power since the early 1960s to impose such a requirement, but under the 1994 Act this became mandatory following conviction of certain offences. While it may have a deterrent value, the Government believes that an obligation to pass a driving test is not an appropriate penalty for drink driving offences and has decided that those provisions should also be amended.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1918" /> The changes to the disqualification requirements, including the driving test repeat requirement, are set out in section 2 of the Bill. This section proposed to substitute two new subsections for subsections (3) and (4) of section 26 of the Road Traffic Act, 1961, as inserted by the 1994 Act.</P>
    <P>Subsection (3) outlines the changes to the requirement to pass a driving test, in addition to the minimum period of disqualification, before the driving licence may be returned. Under the 1994 Act, the requirement applies where a person is convicted of any drink driving offence, dangerous driving, or leaving the scene of an accident where death or injury was caused. The amendment now proposed will confine the repeat test requirement to two serious offences, the first under section 53 &mdash; dangerous driving where death or serious bodily harm is caused &mdash; tried on indictment, and the second under section 106 &mdash; hit and run cases where death or injury is caused.</P>
    <P>The court will retain the discretion not to apply the driving test requirement where the court is satisfied that special reasons exist to justify such a course. The effect of this change is that the requirement will not apply in the future to drink driving offences or to offences of dangerous driving tried summarily.</P>
    <P>Subsection (4) sets out the proposed new disqualification provisions for drink driving offences. Consequential or mandatory disqualification will continue to apply to all drink driving convictions, but the subsection proposes different minimum periods of disqualification for certain drink driving offences depending on the level of alcohol found in the arrested person's breath, blood or urine.</P>
    <P>The Bill restates the offences to which a two year disqualification for a first offence, and four years for a second or subsequent offence, are to apply. These include the old &ldquo;drunk driving&rdquo; offence, the offence of being under the influence of an intoxicant to such an extent as to be incapable of having proper control of <Col N="1919" /> the vehicle. Those periods of disqualification will also apply to all offences of refusing to provide a specimen for analysis. Where a person refuses to comply with the law, maximum penalties should apply.</P>
    <P>For the purpose of offences of exceeding the alcohol limit, the Bill proposes three different grades or penalty bands, each with a different minimum period of disqualification.</P>
    <P>The lowest band will cover drivers convicted with a blood alcohol level in the range of 81 milligrammes to 100 milligrammes. This is the new offence category introduced in December 1994. There will be an automatic three-month ban for a first offence and a six-month ban for a second offence in this category.</P>
    <P>The middle band will be for drivers with blood alcohol levels in the range of 101 milligrammes to 150 milligrammes. There will be an automatic one-year ban for a first offence and two years for a second offence.</P>
    <P>The highest band will apply to drivers with blood alcohol levels over 150 milligrammes.  There will be an automatic two-year ban for a first offence and four years for a second offence in this category.</P>
    <P>Section 3 of the Bill is designed to deal with offences committed before this Bill is enacted. Drink driving offences committed since 2 December 1994 are subject to the penalties set out in the 1994 Act. I have been advised that it would not be possible retrospectively to apply the new provisions in section 2 to such offences. Some of those offences have already been tried and penalties have been imposed in accordance with the 1994 Act. Those which have yet to come to trial must continue to be dealt with under the 1994 Act; in other words all persons convicted of offences committed between 2 December, 1994 and the enactment of this Bill must be treated equally, under the law.</P>
    <P>Section 3 will allow all persons who committed relevant offences since 2 <Col N="1920" /> December 1994 &mdash; who are dealt with under the 1994 Act &mdash; to apply to the court seeking to have disqualification orders amended in line with the provisions in section 2. While that may sound a rather complex transitional arrangement, I am advised it is the only way to achieve the shared objective that everybody is treated equally. The transitional provisions in this section are desirable and I am sure the House will agree they are fair and equitable.</P>
    <P>This Bill has already been considered by Seanad Éireann where there was considerable support for its provisions. There was all-party support for the concept of grading penalties to match the severity of the offences and for the transitional provisions in section 3.</P>
    <P>Some Senators, however, expressed reservations about applying an automatic driving ban to people convicted with alcohol levels in the bottom band. It was suggested that a fine &mdash; with the level being decided by the courts in individual cases &mdash; would be a more appropriate penalty and that disqualification from driving should apply only to the middle and top bands. I informed the other House that I could not agree to such an approach.</P>
    <P>In drawing up the proposed changes in this Bill, I was anxious to ensure that the efforts of my predecessor, Deputy Smith, and the progress made over the last four to five years with our road safety campaigns would not be undermined.  Statistics of road deaths and injuries in recent years have shown a steady improvement and we must continue to take firm action to secure the maximum level of safety for road users. We must, in particular, continue to promote the message that all drink driving offences are serious and that there is no such thing as a trivial or acceptable drink driving offence.</P>
    <P>The proposals in the Bill are justified and strike a reasonable balance. I recognise that it is difficult to achieve a consensus, but I am satisfied this new Bill provides the basis for fair and effective enforcement of drink driving laws.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1921" /> In particular, I am convinced that some periods of disqualification, however short, should apply to all drink driving offences. The three-month ban for a conviction with a blood alcohol level between 81 and 100 milligrammes is a significant penalty but it is also an appropriate one. At the other end of the scale, people with blood alcohol levels over 150 milligrammes will face a two-year ban &mdash; something which I am sure will receive widespread support. Statistics from the Medical Bureau of Road Safety, which analyses the blood and urine specimens, show that 75 per cent of the people who provide a specimen of blood or urine are in this top band.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, there has been a noticeable, and welcome, change in recent years in attitudes to drinking and driving. The majority of motorists now recognise that drinking and driving are incompatible and are adopting a responsible attitude. Unfortunately, there is still a minority who have yet to be convinced, and for these education and publicity programmes must be complemented by effective legislation which provides a real deterrent. It is important that the public supports the law. Some people did not support all of the measures in the 1994 Act. This Bill provides the deterrent required in a balanced, fair and equitable manner, and I commend it to the House.</P>

      <P>When the campaign against the rounds system began not only was the system all pervasive, it was almost mandatory. For those in the House who are too young to remember the rounds system operated on the basis that regardless of how small or large the group everybody bought a drink for everybody else and buying one's round was almost a matter of honour. On a fine summer evening, perhaps after a football or a hurling match, groups of people would adjourn to quench their thirsts in the local hostelry or to perhaps celebrate a win in the local championship and, depending on the size of the group, people would leave the drinking establishment either drunk or ossified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1922" /> A refusal to buy a round would lead to the accusation that one was tight or mean. Also, if one failed to stay the pace and take a drink in every round, welcome as that might be to one's companions, there was a suspicion that one was not fully a man. I am not sure if the same applied to the female sex and although I am only referring to 30 or 40 years ago, women were not seen as often in pubs then. None of us will ever know the damage the rounds system did to generations of people. We will never know how many people became alcoholics as a result of the severe social and other pressures this system exerted. However, somebody decided to put an end to this practice. One person who was an advocate of trying to end this practice was the late Erskine Childers who held very strong views on this issue.</P>
    <P>A campaign began to change attitudes and end the rounds system. It was extremely successful and those responsible deserve credit because they changed a social practice with a minimum of fuss and very little trumpet blowing. As a result of the campaign, it became acceptable to go into a pub with a group and drink at one's own pace and people could leave the pub having had one or two drinks without a stigma being attached to that.</P>
    <P>I mention that campaign in the context of the Bill because the people responsible did not introduce laws, rules or regulations but succeeded in changing attitudes. Once attitudes were changed, the habits of a lifetime were also changed. In the same way, the law passed by the previous Minister for the Environment, Deputy Michael Smith, succeeded finally in changing the attitudes of people to drinking and driving. In a real and fundamental way, the then Minister Deputy Smith made us face up to the reality that there can be no place in our society for people who drink to excess and then drive a car.</P>
    <P>The Bill which Deputy Smith as Minister steered through the Houses of the Oireachtas last year was described as draconian and extreme by its opponents. Perhaps it was a little <Col N="1923" /> extreme, and the Minister might even acknowledge that, but regardless of whether it was draconian or extreme, it was absolutely necessary. In the past five or six years, successive Governments and Ministers for the Environment, with the support of all Members of this House, initiated very successful drink driving and road safety campaigns. Some of those involved changing laws, others merely involved intense publicity at certain times of the year, but the message was transmitted that drinking and driving were uncceptable.  Many people, particularly young people got that message but, unfortunately, a hard core of drivers, to which the Minister referred in his contribution today, remained to be converted and continued to kill and maim people as a result of drinking and driving.</P>
    <P>The legislation brought in was essential to get the message to those people that enough was enough. It was passed and the regulations implemented during the Christmas period served the useful purpose of finally changing attitudes to drinking and driving. It certainly helped to reduce the number of facilities on our roads in that period. The previous Minister, Deputy Smith, deserves to be congratulated in that respect and I thank the Minister Deputy Howlin for congratulating him today.</P>
    <P>If the legislation was responsible for changing the attitudes of drivers who persisted in drinking and driving, it raises a question as to why we should change it now. I am sure the Minister has been asked that by a variety of individuals and groups. The answer is that any law we pass in the Houses of the Oireachtas should find a general acceptance among reasonable people. While most of the Road Traffic Act 1994 was welcomed by the general public, there were specific aspects of it that many people felt were unfair. They included the requirement to resit a driving test following a disqualification and the fact that people with a blood alcohol level of 80 milligrams who committed offences were treated in the same manner as <Col N="1924" /> those with a blood alcohol level of 150 milligrams. Those aspects are being addressed in this Bill. Most reasonable people will regard this as acceptable legislation.</P>
    <P>The 1994 Act and this Bill must be seen not in isolation but in the much wider context of the Government's continuing efforts to promote road safety through the various campaigns against drinking and driving, speeding, etc. It must also be seen &mdash; and this was lost in the brouhaha following the introduction of the regulations &mdash; in the context of the attempts of successive Governments to secure a reduction in the cost of motor insurance costs, particularly for young people. This measure cannot be taken in isolation, it is part of the policy of successive Governments and should be seen as that.</P>
    <P>I welcome the measures in this Bill, in particular the fact the Minister has maintained the new levels of 80 milligrams.  While I believe it is acceptable and understandable that the Minister should respond to the calls made on other aspects of the legislation, to restore the limits to the pre-1994 Act levels, 100 milligrams would be a backward step. Some people in the drinks industry do not agree with this and have been lobbying the Government but, despite the public outcry about other aspects of the legislation there would be an equally vociferous reaction to any attempt by the Minister to restore the 100 milligrams level. The Minister is right in this regard. Most reasonable people never had any difficulty about the measure reducing the blood-alcohol level in the first place. Restoring the minimum level to 100 milligrams would undo all the good achieved by the 1994 Act. It would send signals that we were somehow soft on drink-driving and were not prepared to maintain the momentum of change in attitude over the past number of years.</P>
    <P>I welcome the decision to introduce graduated penalties for the different offences and for different levels of alcohol in the blood. In his contribution to <Col N="1925" /> the Seanad and in this House today, the Minister explained that this was made possible because the DPP had changed his mind on the prosecution of borderline offences. I am glad the DPP changed his mind and facilitated the introduction of the graduated system. The Minister adverted to the strong advice the previous Minister got against the introduction of such a system but, as the DPP changed his mind in this regard, the graduated system is being introduced. I hope the new system does not create loopholes which will allow people to escape prosecution. That was one of the fears of the DPP, the Attorney General and the previous Minister and the Bill should be carefully monitored to ensure that people do not avoid prosecution because of loopholes in the system.</P>
    <P>Another issue that has arisen over the past number of weeks is the question of the penalties to be imposed in the event of a prosecution of somebody with 80 to 100 milligrams of alcohol in their system. It has been argued that a fine for the first offence in this category should be sufficient. I doubt if there will ever be legislation before the House on which the main Opposition spokesperson and the Minister will see eye to eye&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but I agree that a reduction such as a fine instead of three months' disqualification would send all the wrong signs to the general public and to those seriously concerned with the effects of altering this legislation. Part of the argument used by those who support the reduction to a fine is that we should not build into our legislation mandatory sentences and that such mandatory sentences are a reflection on the integrity of the courts and our confidence in them. I do not accept that argument.  A mandatory sentence is the means by which we in the Oireachtas reflect what we consider to be the will and the views of the people and we as <Col N="1926" /> representatives of the people state what we regard as a minimum punishment for the crime. That is no reflection on the Judiciary because they are allowed to decide the upper limit of the punishment having carefully considered the details of the case. Putting minimum sentences into legislation is merely society saying to the Judiciary, this behaviour is unacceptable and demands at least the following action, what the judge does after that is based on the evidence before the court. It has been argued also that an endorsement on the person's licence for any offence under this legislation is a serious enough punishment.  With the loadings the insurance companies put on drivers, this is not an unreasonable argument. However, you could turn that argument on its head and state that anyone who drives a car, knowing or suspecting that he is over the limit, even if it is the lower limit, knows that he faces a potential ban of three months, plus a loading which might double his insurance premium.  If that deterrent is not enough, offenders deserve what they get.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the Christmas period the myth was propagated by many people that huge numbers were being breathalysed and losing their licence, having to do their test again because they were just over the limit of 80 milligrams and that this was a very harsh penalty for the offence. However, the Minister has quoted the statistics and nothing could be further from the truth. About 75 per cent of those who were stopped, breathalysed and prosecuted as a result had well over the maximum limit of 150 milligrams of alcohol concentration. I understand from well placed sources that this would be very much the norm, but the vast majority of cases throughout the year are prosecutions of people with high readings and in fact relatively few people at the lower end of the scale are prosecuted. One may ask is that because the gardaí only stop drivers that are most obviously drunk, use their discretion when they breathalyse somebody and if it is near to the limit they are happy to let a person go with a <Col N="1927" /> warning, or, as the Director of Public Prosecutions seemed to indicate, that it was unsafe to prosecute in borderline cases or, apart from the blitz that is usually undertaken at Christmas, the breathalyser is mainly used when there has been an accident. I do not know the answer but perhaps it is a combination of the reasons I have given that explains why such a high percentage of people breathalysed have high concentration levels when they are caught. It will be interesting to see with the new graduated penalties whether the number of convictions at the lower level of the scale rises.</P>
    <P>As the debate raged about road safety, accidents and causes of accidents, statistics were quoted left, right and centre by various groups. Most of the statistics were from the same sources but the arguments were totally contradictory. Indeed so contradictory were the statements that it reminded me of the criticism that is often levelled at politicians' use of statistics which goes like this &ldquo;politicians use statistics much as a drunk uses a lamp-post, more for support than illumination&rdquo;. In this case I think that charge can be levelled against publicans rather than politicians. There is a serious lack of proper statistics on road safety and probably other areas. Quoting statistics from other jurisdictions can be helpful in a general way in informing a debate. However, there is no substitute for accurate, up-to-date and relevant statistics compiled in this country.</P>
    <P>The various agencies such as the National Safety Authority, the National Roads Authority and the Departments of Justice and the Environment should seriously set about compiling accurate and relevant statistics which can inform future debates. There may be such statistics available but the debate in that area was not well informed. Perhaps insurance companies could help in this regard. They seem to have access to some statistics which others do not know about. How do they justify the loadings they put on persons convicted <Col N="1928" /> of drink related offences? If, as some people claim, drink related offences cause only 6 per cent of road traffic accidents, how can an insurance company justify a 100 per cent or 200 per cent loading on a premium, especially in cases where no accident occurs? Have they a scientific basis for these loadings or is it just a matter of thinking of a number and multiplying it by a factor of two, three or four? If they have reliable statistics they should make them public and ensure that we have informed debate.</P>
    <P>I stated at the outset that the measures should be seen in the overall context of efforts by successive Governments to increase road safety and encourage a responsible attitude to drinking and driving. Drink driving is only one element in ensuring safety on our roads &mdash; speed, the age and condition of vehicles, the standard of driving and the deplorable conditions of many non-national roads are major contributory factors to the unacceptably high toll of death and injury on our roads annually. Regular enforcement of existing laws is one way to reduce that toll but I regret that does not happen. It cannot happen with the drug epidemic sweeping the country and when crime and lawlessness are the norm in many parts of our cities and towns. The Government must do something about that.</P>
    <P>The success of the Road Traffic Act, 1994 over the Christmas period was due mainly to the belief that there was a fair chance of being breathalysed and the serious consequences of that. Once the fear of being caught receded, as it did when the Christmas checkpoint blitz finished, so too did the vociferous and vocal campaign to save the fabric of rural society. I have not heard anything about that in the last few months. There is no threat when the law is not enforced. It is now time to examine the way we enforce and implement road traffic laws. Such examination must be basic and fundamental. We must look at the question of freeing up Garda resources to fight serious crime and get <Col N="1929" /> our priorities right. Thousands of Garda man-hours are currently tied up in the enforcement of road traffic regulations and laws. Highly qualified gardaí spend hundreds of hours cooling their heels in courtrooms in order to prosecute relatively minor offences.</P>
    <P>It is time to consider setting up a traffic corps which would operate under the direction of the Departments of Justice and the Environment. It should have responsibility for all traffic related offences ranging from untaxed cars, driving without insurance and parking violations to more serious offences such as drink driving, dangerous driving etc. The provision of new and faster roads will require more careful and constant policing if we are to keep the death toll down. The Government should look at this as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>I congratulate our young people. They have taken the issue of drink driving seriously and the vast majority of them will not drink if they are driving.  They make other arrangements and have accepted the message of various Governments that drinking and driving is wrong. I pay tribute to them and wish members of my generation and the older generation would learn the lesson equally well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>I am strongly convinced that drinking and driving make bad bedfellows.  This principle should be reflected in our legislation which should be consistently and rigidly enforced and implemented, not just around Christmas time and Easter time but every day of the year. Leaders in society ought to use the means at their disposal, particularly the media and education, to change public attitude and try to establish a culture where it is the norm for drinkers to leave the driving to others. Young adults are much more responsible in their behaviour and attitude in this regard than are members of my generation.  I endorse what Deputy Dempsey said on the matter. I salute them for it and encourage them in the practice. I exhort them to set standards that they <Col N="1930" /> in time will be proud to pass on to their children.</P>
      <P>The majority of today's young citizens have an enlightened attitude to fitness, health and recreation. This is part of what prompts them to have a more responsible attitude to drink and driving.  We must not become complacent because it is also true that a minority of young people hold the opposite view on health and fitness. I refer to the almost 30 per cent of young people who, in one way or another, are caught up in a drug culture. How can we blame young people for being caught up in a culture of substance abuse if what they see, sometimes in their homes, neighbourhoods and localities is alcohol abuse by adults? What right have we to scold them if that is the kind of example they get from their elders? Why must we wonder if they say to their elders as one famous character in Hamlet said to another: &ldquo;Do not, as some ungracious pastors do, show me the steep and thorny way to heaven, Whiles, like a puff'd and reckless libertine, Himself the primrose path of dalliance treads,&rdquo;. We must try harder to change our attitude, otherwise the consequences will be horrendous.</P>
      <P>I support the reduced alcohol limit introduced by the then Minister, Deputy Smith, and upheld by the Minister, Deputy Howlin, from 100 milligrams to 80 milligrams. The legislative package of which that was a measure was the outcome of the deliberations of an inter-ministerial group set up by Deputy O'Malley when we were part of a Coalition Government in an effort to reduce the cost of motor insurance. Unfortunately, that effort did not achieve its objective.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>I acknowledge that but there is much scope for further effort in that direction. I urge the Minister to <Col N="1931" /> take on board that part of the agenda. The cost of insurance is a crippling burden, particularly on young drivers. A country with a relatively young population and an underdeveloped system of public transport cannot continue to ignore the implications of high insurance costs. Young workers in computer industries in my city have no option because of the timetable for shift work but to buy a car so that they can hold down a job. Most of them buy second-hand cars which are adequate in terms of getting them to work but in many cases the cost of insurance exceeds the cost of the car. This more than anything else illustrates the crippling cost of motor car insurance. If in the legislation we go part of the way towards dealing with that problem then it is very welcome and has to be endorsed on that point alone. I urge the Minister to continue with this effort as there is plenty of scope for further reductions.</P>
      <P>A fairly intensive road safety campaign has been ongoing since 1991. I am confident that as a result of that campaign the public attitude to drinking and driving has changed dramatically for the better. I am also confident that lives have been saved, the number of life threatening injuries has been reduced and accidents averted. I congratulate the Garda for the efficient manner in which they have conducted this campaign.  However, there is ample scope for its continuation and intensification. Old habits die hard. Every year more than 400 people die on our roads while 10,000 more are injured, many of whom are permanently incapacitated. I accept that all of these deaths are not caused by drunk driving but many of them are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The legislation being amended today was the subject of severe and sustained criticism at the time of its introduction. Nevertheless it succeeded in focusing the minds of the nation on the issue and it had a profound effect on people's thinking. I salute the former Minister for the Environment, Deputy Michael <Col N="1932" /> Smith, for having the courage to introduce that legislation. Nothing but good has come, and will continue to come, from it. The public owes him a debt of gratitude for having had the guts to tackle many strong vested interests and introduce the legislation. Having said that, I recognise that this Bill is essential.  My part supports it and we will not seek to amend it.</P>
    <P>The overall purpose of justice is best met when the punishment fits the crime and when it is seen to do so. That is what the Minister is seeking to achieve in the Bill. A graded system of penalties in accordance with the level of alcohol in the blood and taking into account previous convictions is the correct approach to adopt. I am in favour of due leniency for a first offence provided, of course, that the limit is not breached to a substantial amount. Second and subsequent offences must be severely dealt with and the Minister has my full support in this regard. My clear understanding is that the majority of drivers tested for blood alcohol show an excess of 150 milligrammes. The penalties for people with that level of alcohol in their blood should be severe and I am heartened by the Minister's announcement that the highest band will apply for people over that level. There will be an automatic two year ban for the first offence and a four year ban for the second offence. I fully support this proposal; it is my understanding of a punishment which fits the crime. People in charge of a vehicle with that level of alcohol in their blood are acting in an outrageous way and if they are found with a similar level of alcohol in their blood a second time then they deserve the punishment proposed.</P>
    <P>The Minister has struck a fair and worthwhile balance in the Bill. I support the decision to limit the requirement to sit a driving test to two of the most serious offences as set out in sections 53 and 106 of the 1961 Act. Under section 53 this punishment will apply to dangerous driving where death or serious bodily harm is caused. This is a fitting punishment and I am very glad it is <Col N="1933" /> being retained. Under section 106 the requirement to sit a driving test will apply in hit and run cases where death or injury is caused. It is very fitting that that punishment is being retained for those two very serious offences.</P>
    <P>I was amazed at the fear the requirement to resit a driving test caused among people over 45 years. This might force legislators, many of whom are in the category of terror stricken adults, to look at the way in which we organise our driving tests. It never ceases to amaze me how bright and intelligent young people who get enough points to study physics, medicine etc. in college manage to fail a simple driving test. There is something wrong with the way in which driving tests are organised and there is something fundamentally wrong with a law which does not impose stricter controls and regulations on driving schools. I appeal to the Minister to give further consideration to this area and to see in what way driving tests can be improved in terms of how they are applied and adjudged. He should carry out a review of driving schools and the qualifications of instructors with a view to putting at the disposal of young drivers the kind of driving instruction which merits the fees charged and which prepares them for a driving test. He must also introduce new legislation to control driving schools and to compel them to provide that kind of driving instruction. That is the minimum we should do for our young people in the context of promoting road safety.</P>
    <P>I have paid tribute to the responsible attitude of young people in respect of driving and drinking. It is also a fact that the majority of road accidents are caused by young people. If our aim is to minimise the number of road accidents and to reduce the cost of car insurance, we should examine the reason so many accidents are caused by young people. We should then take action to minimise the number of accidents. One of the ways we can attempt to do that is to examine the whole area of driving instruction, driving schools and driving tests.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I regard this Bill as a perfectly sensible measure. It is part of a very sensible campaign aimed at reducing the frequency with which people drive under the influence of alcohol. It is important to make the point that the campaign, which I think has the support of all Members of the House, is not in itself aimed at discouraging people from drinking and driving which is by far the more important part of the objective of the Bill. It was a well justified campaign and one which we all hope will be successful. I suppose if we are a little sanguine about it all we would hope the Minister would be able to report to us from time to time that the number of alcohol related deaths, injuries and accidents had declined, that the Garda were finding fewer and fewer people driving and making themselves amenable &mdash; as the Garda say &mdash; to the provisions of this Bill and of the previous Act it amends. We all hope that will happen and to the best of our ability our concern in this House is to make sure it does.</P>
      <P>I welcome this Bill. It is a sensible provision but it would not have been necessary if the former Minister for the Environment, Deputy Michael Smith and, indeed, the former Government, had taken the advice given to them by the Fine Gael Party, late in 1993 and early 1994, during the debate on the Bill that became the Road Traffic Act, 1994. If that Minister and that Government had had the wit to take the advice given to them in the autumn of 1993 this whole matter would have been satisfactorily resolved early last year. That would have saved us a great deal of unnecessary controversy and it would have saved a good many people a fair deal of worry. I must be fair and say it might also have saved us a few of the more lurid and amusing stories we heard during the few months that followed the passage of that Act in 1994.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Members will have heard some of the more entertaining stories. I was told as gospel truth that a lady on her way home from a child's birthday party, with <Col N="1935" /> her child in the car, was breathalysed and found to be over the limit. She protested to the garda that for the whole afternoon she had drunk one glass of wine and claimed there must be something wrong with the breathalyser. To demonstrate her bona fides she suggested to the garda that he breathalyse the child. The story goes that the garda breathalysed the child who was also over the limit. Both the lady and the garda decided there was definitely something wrong with the bag. She went home and the garda said: &ldquo;we will forget this ever happened&rdquo;. When she got home she checked with the lady in whose house the birthday party had been and found that her child, while all the ladies were saying good-bye to each other, had gone around and emptied the dregs out of the five or six glasses their mothers had consumed during the afternoon.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether as a nation we have a talent for inventing stories like this but that was perhaps the more amusing side of some of what went on during that debate. There were worse sides to it as has already been said here. A great many people are worried by this, many of whom have no particular reason to be worried because they do not behave in a way that would have led them into trouble with the law. We went through all that and indulged our national talent and fixation with hyperbole to beat the band. Finally, after much unnecessary worry, hassle and struggle we have this Bill before us which, I think, rectifies the position. We could have done without all that nonsense and pain over a period of months.</P>
    <P>The advice given by Fine Gael at the time, in particular by my colleague the Minister of State, Deputy Avril Doyle, was that the penalties attached to drunken driving and driving under the influence of alcohol should be graded as a function of the degree of intoxication as measured by the levels of alcohol detected in blood, urine or in breath. That is what the Bill now provides, months after the advice was first given.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1936" /> I am not sure whether we will ever get a complete explanation but I gather that at the time the 1994 Bill was going through the House it was said that the advice that was given from high legal circles was that grading of penalties in this way was not possible. Now it appears there has been a change of view on that. Frankly, I never believed that grading penalties in this way was not possible. I did not hear one single explanation, during all that time, as to why that might be the case. I am pleased to see we now have graded penalties.</P>
    <P>As a general rule, Sir, I object to the notion of mandatory penalties. The dispensing of justice, in my view, can never be a precise mechanical matter of cause and effect. It is worth reflecting, when we look at other legal systems, that those we find most objectionable have mandatory penalties for offences where our courts have a much greater degree of discretion.</P>
    <P>In our system the application of the law and dispensing justice can never be a mechanical matter. No matter how trivial the misdemeanour, no matter how grave the felony, every case is different. We have always taken the view that judicial discretion is essential to build the bridge required between the administration of the law and dispensing justice. Justice cannot ignore the law but the mechanical application of the law on its own very frequently does not dispense justice. That is why our system provides &mdash; rightly I think &mdash; for a fairly wide measure of judicial discretion. It is worth making that point in this context because we often find, in response to situations which people see developing in the area of crime, that there is a new resurgence in the demand for mandatory penalties. That is fine. Mandatory penalties seem always to be a good idea to the people who are not involved, and yet we find, time after time, that people see injustices in the application of mandatory penalties. I am glad that so far we have resisted the generalisation of mandatory penalties. I hope we continue to do so because it is a very wise feature in our law. <Col N="1937" /> Having said that, I will admit I can see a good reason for taking a slightly different view of mandatory elements in penalties relating to offences defined in terms that lend themselves to objective measurement, and that is the case in drink driving offences covered by this Bill. As part of a fairly hysterical debate that went on some time ago, many claims were made to the effect that mandatory penalties of the type included here were unconstitutional and in some way made people who drank a couple of pints of beer and drove home amenable to a more oppressive system of justice than people who carry out assaults, robberies, etc. That was part of the hyperbole for which we are widely famed. The difference is that we have defined in our law an offence &mdash; being in charge of a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol &mdash; and we have devised methods for measuring the degree to which people are under the influence of alcohol. There are objective measurements that can be carried out. I know we do not always agree with all of them and there are still arguments going on but, on the whole, they are fairly good guides to the level of capacity to be in charge of a motor vehicle. For that reason it is wise to include the provisions in section 2. I am happy to be able to support them, and to support the approach that leads to the table contained in section 2.</P>
    <P>I have only one criticism to make of that table, and the Minister will not be surprised to hear it. The proposal for mandatory disqualification from driving for three months on the first conviction of being in charge of a vehicle with up to 100 milligrams of alcohol seems unnecessarily severe. I say that because I am conscious that in section 2 and in the table we are not talking of cases where injury to other persons or damage to property is involved. Where there is injury to other persons or damage to property, section 2 does not apply. It is a different part of the legislation that applies in those cases. The penalty of three months embodied in <Col N="1938" /> the section and in the table is a minimum penalty. That penalty should be a maximum, not a minimum penalty. Apart from that, I am quite happy to let the table stand with the measures as set out.</P>
    <P>Although I favour judicial discreation, and I am glad to be able to take this opportunity to make that point, I object very strongly to some recent statements from judicial quarters about the petitions procedure, which is not a million miles away from our minds when we talk about these issues. I object to some recent statements from judicial quarters about allegedly objectionable interference by politicians in the judicial process. Judicial independence is an essential component of our constitutional system, but it carries with it an obligation for people on the Bench to ensure that they are as fully informed as they can be about the matters coming before them. That obligation is diligently and conscientiously fulfilled in the vast majority of cases. However, there were occasions when, as Minister for Justice, I found that was not the case, that matters that seemed to me to be relevant to the determination of a penalty had not only not been taken into account by the court but had not even been inquired into either by the Garda Síochána or by the court. The cases in question were not momentous; they were not cases of major felony but they were, nevertheless, cases that properly came before the court. One that comes to mind to illustrate my concern and the reason I object to those recent statements, concerns a lorry driver who was prosecuted, brought to court and convicted of driving an untaxed lorry with bald tyres and without reflecting strips down the sides. He had clearly committed several offences. He was convicted of the offences and fined a sum equal to several multiples of his weekly wage.</P>
    <P>A Member of this House sent a petition to me and I dealt with it in the way I normally dealt with such petitions, by taking them home with me at weekends and allowing myself to be distracted <Col N="1939" /> from &ldquo;The Late Late Show&rdquo; and other trivialities to deal with them. On examining the file it quickly became clear to me that the driver was not the owner of the lorry. I put a question on the file asking who was the owner of the lorry. I also asked if the owner had been charged with the offences because, on the evidence presented to the court, and which was not disputed, the owner of the lorry also had committed several offences. The replies I got indicated to me that neither the Garda nor the court had taken the trouble to ask that simple question. They had the driver, the lorry, and the evidence. They brought him to court, he was convicted and fined, and that was the end of that. I confess, I was somewhat annoyed by that because, looking at the other circumstances of the case, the fine imposed and the evidence given on behalf of the driver about his weekly wage and his family circumstances, it seemed most unlikely that that person was in a position to tell his employer, the owner of the lorry, that he would not drive it until he, the owner, had put proper tyres on it, reflective strips on the side, and taxed it. I know, as do other Members of this House about conditions in some sectors of our transport industry. If that driver had insisted on compliance with the law, he probably would have been invited to leave the premises immediately and told not to present himself for work again the following morning. He was not, therefore, in a position to insist and, although he was guilty of having infringed the law in several respects, he was not the only person who was guilty. In many ways he was not even the main culprit in the case. However, the Garda, the court and the district justice had not taken the trouble to inquire. It seemed to me in that case, although the court had administered the law, it certainly had not done justice to that man. I, therefore, reduced the fine substantially, and if I had the opportunity this evening I would do it again if presented with similar circumstances. The district justice and the Garda should have asked <Col N="1940" /> who was the owner of the lorry. They should have prosecuted the owner, and he should have been in court beside the driver at the same session, but he was not.</P>
    <P>I am not one of those people who claim that members of our Judiciary are divorced from society. That is certainly not so in the case of the vast majority of our Distict Court judges, our Circuit Court judges or, indeed, other members of the Judiciary. There were some, former ones at least, who claimed to have a direct line to God. Unfortunately they were not entirely divorced either, to use a malapropism, from society because they represent, happily, a very small section of our society. They represent a point of view that was defended last night with great obduracy by Father Denis Faul. However, that is unusual. Members of our Judiciary are linked to our society. In my experience the majority of District Court judges and prosecuting gardaí responded to the inquiries and in many cases recommended reduction of penalties even where a decision had not been appealed to the Circuit Court because they knew the petitioners did not have the means to fund an appeal.</P>
    <P>We praise investigative journalism. We should praise now and again investigative politics in the interests of fairness, justice and equity in society. We have experienced heavy sniping both inside and outside the House from the politically correct about this issue. They have targeted politicians and successive Ministers for Justice in particular but they have targeted the wrong people. If they targeted the right people, those who sit on the Bench would make sure they did not hear cases in a way which would give rise to the natural desire to right an injustice in cases where justice is only partially administered.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>While I am sure Deputy Dukes is correct in saying that if we had listened to Fine Gael this legislation would not be before the House, I am not sure that the 1994 Act was bad legislation in that an important <Col N="1941" /> debate on the question of the abuse of alcohol and drink driving was initiated and as a consequence people were made more aware of the associated dangers.</P>
      <P>The 1994 legislation had two main objectives, to reduce the permitted level from 100 milligrammes to 80 milligrammes of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood and to lengthen the period of disqualification and, in certain circumstances, to make it mandatory to repeat the driving test. The decision to reduce the permitted level to 80 milligrammes was correct although this is still the highest level within the European Union. I commend the Minister for not increasing it to the previous figure of 100 milligrammes although he was under some pressure to do so.</P>
      <P>I understand what the Minister is trying to achieve in grading the penalties to fit the offence. As has been stated, the decision that it would be mandatory to repeat the driving test was the source of great concern in rural Ireland, particularly for the elderly who obtained a driving licence before driving tests were introduced and who felt that they would not pass the test if they were convicted of drink driving.</P>
      <P>We have to accept that the permitted level is moving downwards worldwide. In some countries in Eastern Europe there is a zero level while the level in Sweden is ten milligrammes. I understand that if the figure reaches 80 milligrammes there is a mandatory jail sentence.  As everyone is aware, the scientific evidence shows that as the level of alcohol in the blood stream increases judgement becomes impaired, particularly when driving.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important that we do not forget the statistics for road deaths. During the troubles in Northern Ireland 3,000 people were killed as a result of political violence. In the same 25 year period 10,000 people were killed in road accidents in the Twenty-Six Counties. I am not suggesting that all of these accidents were alcohol related but I have no doubt that alcohol was a contributory factor in a significant number. In my earlier years I worked in a hospital and <Col N="1942" /> in my later years in general practice and saw the effect drink can have, in terms of road fatalities and injuries. Each year 10,000 people are injured on our roads and in a significant number of those cases the abuse of alcohol is a contributory factor. The sad thing is that each Saturday night when I was on duty in my general practice I saw someone who was maimed or scarred for life as a result of unnecessary accidents.</P>
    <P>It is recognised that drink is not the sole cause of road accidents. I appeal to the Minister to consider each contributory factor to ensure that we reduce the number killed on our roads. I do not like to hear announcements that the figures for a particular month are five less than the figure for the corresponding month in the previous year as one death is one too many and we can become too complacent if it is announced that the figures are decreasing.  There is no such thing as a tolerable level of road deaths. We must work together to ensure in so far as possible that we prevent road deaths and injuries.  I ask the Minister to consider the issues of speed, quality of cars and the condition of our roads. The use of seat belts is also important in preventing loss of life and injuries.</P>
    <P>I would like to raise a new issue in this debate, that is the provision of wipers on the headlamps of cars. These are provided on Swedish cars in particular.  I know from experience in commuting 55 miles to Dublin each day that on a rainy day the dirt clings like a sheet of brown paper on the headlamps of the car by the time one reached Dublin. If I drive home on a wet night it is necessary to stop to clean the headlamps. I cannot understand why so much chrome is used on the sides of cars and why wipers are not provided on headlamps. It would be very simple to do this.</P>
    <P>I agree with the decision to introduce graded penalties. While I note that in certain circumstances it will be mandatory to repeat the driving test section 2 states that this provision may not be applied if there are special reasons for <Col N="1943" /> not doing so. Will the Minister indicate what these special reasons might be?</P>
    <P>While I agree with the new penalties to be imposed where the figure is between 80 and 100 milligrammes, it appears that the Minister has decided, where the figure is over 100 milligrammes, to restore the penalties which were imposed before the 1994 legislation was introduced. Where the figure is between 100 and 150 milligrammes the mandatory penalty for the second offence was a three year suspension but I note that the penalty of a two year suspension is provided for in the Bill. I am not suggesting that the Minister should change the figures but I am drawing attention to the fact that there are differences with the figures in previous legislation.</P>
    <P>Judges will have discretion to restore a licence after a period of six months. I would like to see the legislation copper-fastened so that the licence will not be returned to a person who is known to have a problem with alcohol. It is a farce that a licence that has been mandatorily removed for 12 months is returned in six months when it is known the person involved has a problem with alcohol.</P>

    <P>That Dáil Éireann, mindful of the fact that ecstasy and other drugs are widely and cheaply available for sale to teenagers and schoolchildern throughout the country, proving a health risk to them and to society as a whole, mindful of the direct link of heroin abuse to petty crime and mindful also of the fact that there are 6,000 heroin addicts in Dublin alone with only 400 receiving treatment and that half of the prisoners in Mountjoy are IV drug users, calls on the Government collectively to respond urgently <Col N="1944" /> and strategically to this national emergency by</P>

    <P>establishing comprehensive programmes of methadone maintenance in targeted areas with known drug abuse problems;</P>

      <P>It is ironic this debate immediately follows the debate on the road traffic legislation, which caused much furore in terms of introducing stricter penalties for drink driving. That <Col N="1945" /> is a significant debate because the flight from reality in terms of intoxication, which is an unfortunate part of the Irish psyche, has not been addressed by this House. Any attempts to interfere with the constitutional right to get drunk meets with pandemonium, opposition and lobbying. Debate on that matter is relevant to debate on drug addiction. There has been a certain ambivalence down the years about this nation's propensity for drink and intoxication. We have not addressed a significant aspect of our social life in terms of the way crime is motivated by excessive drinking and drug taking.</P>
      <P>In moving this motion tonight the Progressive Democrats, rather than engaging in routine condemnation or populist hyperbole about escalating crime in our society, have put forward a range of measures which could have an immediate effect on the current crisis relating to drug abuse and its effect on crime and other social ills. Because the problem of drug abuse is not onedimensional, because it requires an inter-agency, multi-disciplined response, this motion calls on the Government collectively and urgently to address what we consider to be a national emergency.  The impact of drugs, particularly heroin addiction, on crime is incontrovertible.  Garda sources and the recent Lord Mayor's Commission on Crime confirm that up to 80 per cent of petty crime, that is, muggings, burglaries, shop-lifting and other violent crime, is directly related to heroin addiction. Given these facts &mdash; I hear no denials of these statistics from the Government&mdash; there can be no justification for refusing to redirect a large portion of Garda resources to tackling this aspect of criminality which is drug related.</P>
      <P>This Government of renewal was to be, as the Taoiseach said in his speech on becoming Taoiseach &ldquo;a simple Government&rdquo;, one which would address the problems which faced Irish society in a straightforward and direct manner. I looked forward to such conviction and simplicity, but let us look at the alleged simplicity which was promised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1946" /> This has been a Government of task forces, committees, review groups, charters, spin-doctoring, glossy reports and superfluous Ministries. It has been a Government of leaks, indecision, backsliding and media pap. The Minister for Justice announced a referendum on bail, but because of the bleating of the Labour Party, this has since been retracted.  This is the Government which promised to give leadership on the divorce issue, but instead it has blundered into confusion and political cowardice.</P>
    <P>This is the Minister whose party in Opposition howled for the accountability of the DPP and whose Taoiseach refuses, point blank, to allow any such accountability. This is the Minister who has huffed and puffed in relation to the festering dispute in the GRA, who instead of leadership and decisiveness has issued veiled threats but has taken no policy decision. It is high time the Minister either withdrew recognition from the GRA or gave recognition to the Garda Federation. It is not my duty as an Opposition Deputy to find a solution to this problem; it is the Minister's duty. The Minister with lethargy, indecision and trepidation awaits a response to her third option to the GRA. All the indications are that this response will not be positive. This matter is of urgent importance in terms of public policy, as it applies to the management and morale of the Garda and the public's confidence in the forces of law and order.</P>
    <P>This Government has failed in the quality of its decision making. Nowhere is this more obvious than in its response to the criminal justice system and, particularly the drugs emergency. The House will note that our motion calls for a redirecting of resources to meet the drugs epidemic. I am informed that there is a palpable sense of despondency in the existing drugs squad. I understand, and it beggars belief given the current crisis, that resources and manpower allocated to the drugs squad is half what it was in 1985. I want the Minister in her response to this debate to say how many gardaí comprise the drugs squad. My information is that <Col N="1947" /> there are about 17 personnel as compared to 29 in 1985. Is it true that one unit of the four working units in the drug squad has been operating for the last 12 months without a detective sergeant?</P>
    <P>The House has been gratified and compliments are due to the authorities, that in the last four or five months seizures of drugs to the value of £30 million have been made. Imagine what we could achieve in terms of seizures and arrests if the Government would only move today to refocus more resources in this area. The Minister went on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; this morning and said basically nothing. I question why she was invited and why she accepted the invitation if she had nothing new to say apart from the usual &ldquo;my Department is looking into&rdquo; or &ldquo;I will be bringing forward proposals which I am not at liberty to go into here&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Irish public is sick and tired of bluster and good intentions. There has been paralysis of analysis on this aspect of the criminal justice system. We do not have the luxury of a leisurely analysis by way of task force and Law Reform Commission reports. There is a place for such analysis and God knows there is no shortage of it. What we need is, as set out in this motion, the implementation of what has been recommended by a plethora of reports, the use of the powers that have been enacted by this House to restrain the assets of those people who are being investigated for drug importation and trafficking.</P>
    <P>The Criminal Justice Act, 1994, provides that applications for confiscation orders against persons convicted on indictment of drug trafficking offences and non-drug trafficking offences may be made by the Director of Public Prosecutions.  The Act also provides that applications for restraint orders freezing assets which may be liable to realisation if a confiscation order is imposed may be made by the DPP.</P>
    <P>In a parliamentary reply last Thursday the Minister said she understands &ldquo;that the DPP has made application for <Col N="1948" /> restraint orders in two cases&rdquo;. She went on in classic fashion to say, &ldquo;The DPP is independent in the exercise of his functions and, as such, I am not in a position to make any further detailed comment&rdquo;. I want to ask the Minister a straight question, have restraint orders been requested to be made by the DPP against the persons being investigated about the most recent seizures of £30 million worth of drugs in the past five months? If the Minister believes she has the powers, is she using them in dealing with those recent seizures?</P>
    <P>Section 23 (1) (b) of the Criminal Justice Act, 1994 ensures that a restraint order can be obtained before a person is arrested or charged with an offence according to a reply by the Minister to a Parliamentary Question tabled by Deputy O'Donoghue last Thursday. Is that true? Are those powers being used?</P>
    <P>Regarding the implementation of existing legislation or failure to use the existing powers in this area, I question the Minister, yet again, on the potential disastrous impact of a recent directive issued by the Garda Commissioner which compels detectives to reveal their sources. That directive marks a significant change in police practice and surveillance methods and could lead to a drying up of intelligence from informants about drug seizures. If a detective cannot give a solemn undertaking of confidentiality to his of her source, that source of valuable information could dry up. Two detective sergeants in the drugs squad have been suspended pending court proceedings on this issue and another person has since been suspended as a result of that directive. Irrespective of that case which is <i>sub judice</i> the Minister must consider the implications for police methods of investigation of this directive.</P>
    <P>Regarding procedures and the existing Garda powers, is the Minister aware that recently goods to the value of £30,000 were recovered on foot of a warrant obtained by the Garda and, subsequently, having recovered the goods the warrant was deemed bad by the DPP on the grounds that the peace <Col N="1949" /> commissioner who authorised it had relied solely on the word of a detective. What sort of nonsense is that? How could the word of a detective based on information received not be sufficient to satisfy the DPP even when the information was correct and the stolen goods recovered? It is nonsense that letters are being sent from the DPP indicating that a warrant is not good because we cannot rely solely on the word of a detective sergeant? That activity by the DPP is unreviewable in this House as Members cannot ask why that warrant was bad or why the word of a detective sergeant was not good enough.</P>
    <P>One could spend four hours talking about the procedural impediments which face the gardaí in carrying out their duties. The level of violent crime related to drugs can be seen on various fronts. We know that organised criminals armed to the teeth are masterminding drug trafficking activity in our cities. We are aware there is intimidation, murder, attempted murder of witnesses and of gardaí investigating such activity by the drug barons, the lowest form of life.</P>
    <P>That area is of particular relevance to the Minister for Justice. I do not want to hear of future plans. We want strategic initiatives and powers put in place similar to the emergency legislation which applied to terrorist related crime. We are all delighted that the Government recently repealed the state of emergency to show that the peace process is under way and we look forward to it progressing. I suggest another emergency has taken its place. The Offences Against the State Act is still in place and must be used to detain suspects. Special courts should deal with organised, drug related criminal activity.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of such criminal activity falls squarely within the brief of the Minister for Justice, that of our prison system. Fifty per cent of the prison population in Mountjoy prison is stated to be IV drug abusers and that institution is said to be awash with drugs. It is time that more than one custodial detoxification centre was established to <Col N="1950" /> accommodate and rehabilitate this particularly pathetic category of our prison population. Those persistent offenders are being churned through the ludicrous revolving doors of our jails. In the main, they are pathetic victims who have long since given up on normal life and are not deterred one whit from their criminal muggings, burglaries, etc. by the prospect of a term in Mountjoy prison.  The vast majority of them, as researched by Paul O'Mahony in his book, &ldquo;Crime and Punishment in Ireland&rdquo;, are chronically criminal from a very early age. Close to 10 per cent had received their first conviction before their twelfth birthday and more than 40 per cent had a first degree relative in prison. The most common age for first imprisonment was 16 years. Thirty two per cent were on prescribed drugs and, as stated at a recent prison officers' conference, that has risen to 50 per cent. Forty one per cent had experienced some from of professional psychiatric attention, 76 per cent of the prisoners came from Dublin, 51 per cent had left school before 15 and 80 per cent were unemployed. It is incredible that the number of convictions ranged from one to 93.</P>
    <P>As stated in the Lord Mayor's Commission on Crime, those statistics clearly indicate that many prisoners are regular offenders, have health and addiction problems, are poorly educated and come from deprived backgrounds. They have fallen thorough every net the social services have offered and, as we speak, are wallowing in a drug induced stupor in Mountjoy Prison. They have failed every test of citizenship, broken all the rules and in return the criminal justice system is failing them as it has failed society.</P>
    <P>I question the wisdom of building another traditional expensive jail in Castlerea when there is no policy in existence to specifically deal with the custodial detoxification requirements of those offenders.</P>
    <P>Regarding crime on the streets, a report yesterday by the independent retailers' body, RGDATA, shows that <Col N="1951" /> one in three retailers has suffered violent attacks in the past two years. As estimated £11 million has been lost in cash, goods and damaged property. Shop lifting and petty fraud accounts for a further £60 million in lost revenue. Last week bus drivers withdrew their labour and marched on this House in protest at the level of physical attacks on them, often with blood filled syringes.  At a recent Question Time, the Minister assured us that a blood filled syringe is an offensive weapon and that the law was adequate to deal with people who use them in attacks. She raised her eyes to Heaven when I suggested that it might be more appropriate for the Minister for Health to put in place Protocols with pharmacists to allow the extension of the methadone maintenance programme for heroin addicts who steal for their next fix.</P>
    <P>There are 6,000 heroin addicts in Dublin alone and only 400 of them are receiving treatment. It is lunacy to turn a blind eye to that fact and the daily impact of it on crime levels in this city. Recently, a conference of pharmacists sharply criticised the Government and, in particular, the Minister for Health, for the two year delay in formalising Protocols necessary for pharmacists to dispense methadone to addicts. We should try to deal with crime as prepetrated by heroin addicts and, having researched this matter as far as I can with the resources available to me as an Opposition Deputy, I have no doubt that the level of daily crime, muggings, burglaries and theft could be halved. There is no excuse for Government failure to act in this area of crime prevention.</P>
    <P>The age profile of our offenders is clearly juvenile and I will leave Deputy Quill, who chaired the Select Committee on Crime to deal with that issue and the immediate need for a juvenile justice Bill. We also need, and tonight ask for, an immediate response. We do not need more working groups, review groups or reports. We know what is needed. We need to implement existing <Col N="1952" /> law and redirect Garda resources to tackle the aspect of criminality caused by heroin addiction. In terms of collective Government responsibility, that also involves the introduction of a national programme to warn school children, particularly those in second level, about the dangers of heroin and substance abuse. Nothing is being done in our schools to make children aware of the dangers to their health of ecstasy and heroin addiction and the long term implications for society. Ecstasy can be obtained at relatively low cost and while it is non-addictive it has major health implications for those who use it. Young people are being offered heroin to come down from its effects. We have a serious national emergency and it is up to the Government to redirect resources immediately across all Government Departments to tackle the problem.</P>

      <P>Most conscentious people are deeply concerned about the drug problem and unless and until drug pushers are put out of business and the Minister is prepared to enact a law to ensure that happens, we are wasting our time in this House. If this does not happen soon this country will drift into a mafioso society. As it was the Revenue who finally put the drug barons out of business in the United States, perhaps the Minister would consider something along those lines when applying himself to finding a solution to the drug problem besetting this country and affecting us like the famine did 150 years ago.</P>
      <P>The Progressive Democrats party calls for a new beginning in regard to juvenile crime. A fresh approach is required to respond to public concern about juvenile crime and the needs of young people in trouble by using the best international knowledge in the field. Significantly more than one third of our crime is carried out by juveniles. It follows logically, therefore, that tackling juvenile crime constructively could make a major difference to our crime rates and, in addition reduce the number of people who stand to be sucked into a lifetime of crime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1953" /> Juvenile crime is having a horrendous effect on householders, law abiding members of the community, car owners and the commercial community. The cost to the public purse of repairing damage to public property done by vandals and petty criminals is enormous. Moreover, the cost to the public purse of providing proper security to protect private and public property from attacks by juveniles would, if quantified, constitute an enormous sum of money that could be put to better use in providing better education and recreational facilities for the young people involved. The consequences for young people of being allowed to slip into a lifetime of crime are horrendous. Large numbers of them are doing irreversible damage to their future prospects. Put simply, if young people have crime convictions they are literally debarring themselves from the labour market at home and abroad. They are rendering themselves ineligible for a passport and irreversibly damaging their future prospects at every level.</P>
    <P>No self-respecting generation of adults or Government should allow that to happen lightly. Seán O'Casey once described Ireland as &ldquo;an old sow that eats its own farrow&rdquo;. Is this coming true in this generation? There is so much complacency about juvenile crime, drug abuse and the damage young people are doing to themselves that I often wonder if what O'Casey said so many years ago has come to pass.</P>
    <P>Statistics prove that almost 90 per cent of juvenile crime is drug related, but the damage young people do to their health and future prospects by being caught up in the drug culture should also be quantified. For too long there has been much neglect and little action in regard to public policy. Some fine reports, notably the Whitaker report, have been published. An all-party committee on crime, of which I was chairperson, studied the question of juvenile crime during the 1989-92 Government. It went to great pains to <Col N="1954" /> interview all those interested in juvenile welfare, education and crime and studied best practice and procedure for dealing with the matter in other countries. It spent approximately nine months putting together a report and, having completed it, was assured by the then Minister for Justice &mdash; now a Commissioner in Europe &mdash; that our committee had put at his disposal the basis of a juvenile justice Bill which he promised would be introduced in the autumn. I wonder how many juveniles have done themselves irreversible damage in the meantime. It is a scandal that report has not been acted on by this or previous Governments.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats call for new legislation to respond to juvenile crime and to cater for young people in trouble. In essence, we request the introduction of a new juvenile justice Bill, geared towards modern conditions, to replace the hopelessly outdated Children Act of 1908, the basis of current legislation in this area. We call for a well co-ordinated Government policy not only to mobilise the gardaí, the courts and the probation service, but also to harness the contribution of schools, the health services, local government, the voluntary sector and businesses to fight in one all out effort to prevent youth crime. We also call for a recognition of the reality that offending by young people has complex and multiple causes and, therefore, effective responses must be equally multifaceted. We are asking for a recognition of the importance of tackling the social problems affecting young people which, in many cases, are the root causes of crime, in other words, family, school and community problems, long term adult and youth unemployment, drug abuse and home-lessness.  Following investigation, we found that at least one, if not all, of those factors lead young people into a lifetime of crime. Unless we tackle the problem at source we are only tackling the symptoms and will not solve the problem.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1955" /> We want a commitment to a range of well resourced preventive services in the community under the auspices of the probation and welfare service, the Garda juvenile liaison service and the health boards to respond quickly to young people in trouble and to offer alternatives to costly and generally ineffective custodial measures. Statistics illustrate that the cost of keeping young people in custodial care is enormous and in terms of reoffending it is almost 100 per cent non-productive.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>The reoffending rate is almost 80 per cent. That is proof of the ineffectiveness of that measure.</P>
      <P>We are also asking for a policy which promotes a positive role for parents and which encourages them in the important task of rearing the next generation. It is my strong conviction that even if the State had unlimited resources, it could not solve this problem without enlisting the support of parents. I fully recognise that a number of parents are not in a position to offer support of any kind to their children. However, such parents are in the minority. The majority of parents of young offenders are well placed &mdash; if they were so required &mdash; to play a positive and constructive role in keeping their children away from crime. In that respect, I am calling for a strong commitment to crime prevention. In dealing with young people, we must always try to keep them out of the judicial system. We must identify and tackle problems early on and steer young people from the hazards of a lifetime involvement in crime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must focus on the 12 to 18 year old age group in our new juvenile justice system. We believe that children under 12 years should be catered for within the care system. After the age of 18 years they become adults in terms of justice legislation. We are calling for a national policy in relation to young people who get into trouble, with <Col N="1956" /> named personnel in each relevant public body. They would have assigned responsibility for ensuring full implementation of the law and its procedures. A range of sanctions, with special emphasis on community based measures, should be made available to the courts. Our committee considered in great detail the effectiveness of the Scottish panel system where parents who had succeeded in their functions as parents played a positive role in putting in place a group of people who acted as referees, where people misbehaved, and who put crime prevention strategies in place in their own communities.</P>
    <P>We are calling for a system that is committed to fairness, efficiency and speed and which protects the rights and the dignity of the victim and the offender. We are asking for the development of local juvenile crime prevention committees. I attended a meeting of the Cork Chamber of Commerce yesterday morning at which the problem of drugs was discussed in great detail. The question was raised as to the role the business community and the Chamber of Commerce could play in helping to reduce the level of crime. That was the first time it occurred to those people that they had a role to play in this regard. They have a role to play because they are an influential group in any community. We must have locally based crime prevention strategies in place which are supported across the community and, in place, at least proposed legislation, I hope the Minister considers putting in place, at least on a pilot basis local crime prevention committees.</P>
    <P>I have a conviction that if we were to ask victims of drug abuse to talk to our children in the classrooms, thereby letting them see what those people have done to themselves by carelessly becoming involved in the drug culture and how it has affected their physical and mental health to the extent that they no longer control their own lives, it would be the most effective way of alerting young people to the danger of drugs. That can only happen, however, if we have the <Col N="1957" /> support of the community. Local radio in particular, which is now so strong, should be utilised much more effectively in terms of crime prevention. A number of other initiatives could also be taken in this regard.</P>
    <P>Nothing can be done in this area unless a proper legislative framework is put in place and unless a juvenile justice Bill is brought before this House which can be debated by Members. All Members have direct daily contact with the victims and the perpetrators of crime. If we do not pool our opinions in regard to this issue, based on the thorough research that has already been carried out, we will merely be making statements without finding solutions to this problem.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to bring in the juvenile justice Bill. Earlier today we had an example of how a Minister can respond to a crisis when the pressure is intense. The drink driving Bill caused great brouhaha before Christmas and when great pressure was brought to bear on the then Minister by a strong and potent lobby group, he was able to act. A new Bill was drafted quickly and brought before the House today. Surely the juvenile Bill is infinitely more important.</P>
    <P>We were told that the drink driving Bill would sound the death-knell for country pubs. I am much more concerned about the deaths of a large proportion of our young people as a result of drug abuse or becoming involved in a lifetime of crime. I appeal to the Minister to bring the Bill before the House before the end of this session.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&mdash; mindful of the menace of drugs and the extent to which they contribute to crime in our society, commends and supports the commitment of the Government to <Col N="1958" /> take serious and effective action to tackle the drugs problem.</P>
    <P>&mdash; notes, in particular, the commitment given by the Minister for Justice to bring forward comprehensive proposals to Government very shortly on important aspects of law enforcement and interagency co-ordination with regard to the drugs problem.</P>
    <P>&mdash; welcomes the recent record amounts of drugs seized by the law enforcement agencies,</P>
    <P>&mdash; recognises that the multi-disciplinary approach adopted by the Government provides the best possible framework for dealing with the problem, and</P>
    <P>&mdash; supports the measures taken by the Ministers for Health and Education in the area of education for young people and treatment of drug abusers.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I thank the mover of the motion, Deputy O'Donnell&mdash;and Deputy Quill &mdash; both of whom have a deep and lasting interest in this subject. Their concerns are shared by me and by the Government. Many suggestions have been put forward, some of which are already in place. There are others that can be considered and put in place if they are found to be effective.</P>
    <P>If I had been asked 12 months ago what the greatest difficulty facing Irish society was, I would have responded unhesitatingly to the effect that it was the violence in the northern part of our island. Since then, thankfully, we have had the ceasefires and the problem of paramilitary violence has been removed, to everyone's relief.</P>
    <P>Asked now what the greatest difficulty facing us is, I answer unhesitatingly, the drugs problem. The problems arising from drug addiction have replaced terrorism as our greatest cause for concern. The drugs scourge is damaging our society, is increasing our crime rate and is increasingly affecting the quality of many people's lives and <Col N="1959" /> livelihood. This Government is keenly aware of the evil effects of the drug trade and I intend to set out here our strategy to tackle the issue. The drugs problem is a complex one with no easy answers. I thank Deputy O'Donnell for recognising that. The Government recognises that the problem must be confronted on a number of different levels.  To put it simply, law enforcement, alone, can never provide all the answers. The multi-agency approach, involving the Departments of Health, Justice and Education and their respective agencies has been recognised by the Government as providing the best possible framework to deal with the problem. Essentially, we must tackle both the demand for, and the supply of, drugs.</P>
    <P>The need for this co-ordinated effort is especially apparent to those charged with law enforcement. The connection between drug dealing, drug addiction and crime is well established. Addicts need money and crime is one way of obtaining it.</P>
    <P>International experience has shown there are no simple solutions. Once the problem has developed, it can be extremely difficult to reverse. However, I am not one of those who shrug their shoulders and say we will just have to get used to the problem. I do not accept this counsel of despair. The problem is not insurmountable. It is not something we have to live with. On the contrary, it has to be tackled and it is being tackled. To do so, of course, requires great determination and a co-ordinated and integrated approach. That has been accepted by the two Deputies who have spoken. The Government strategy to prevent drug abuse recognises that the problem is a complex and difficult one and proposes a multi-disciplinary approach requiring action in the areas of supply reduction, demand reduction and increased access to treatment and rehabilitation programmes, in other words, the strategy calls for integrated action on the problem on a number of different levels. This approach provides <Col N="1960" /> the best possible framework to deal with the problem.</P>
    <P>In dealing with crime, the Garda operate under legislation enacted by the Oireachtas. Most significant in this regard is The Offences Against the Person Act, 1861, as amended; The Larceny Act, 1916; The Misuse of Drugs Acts, 1977 and 1984; The Criminal Justice Act, 1984; The Criminal Justice (Forensic Evidence) Act, 1990; The Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act, 1994, and The Criminal Justice Act, 1994.</P>
    <P>On the law enforcement response to the drug problem the impression being given that there is no legislation to deal with the drugs problem is false and the legislation I have listed is effectively used daily in our courts. Yesterday I visited Mountjoy Prison and I saw many inmates who had been prosecuted under these laws and are now in prison.</P>
    <P>The Garda Commissioner has been focusing special attention on the drugs problem because drugs are inevitably at the root of a very significant proportion of crimes committed in our society today. All Garda drugs units are co-ordinated on a national basis through the national drug administration office in Garda headquarters which is staffed by full-time gardaí with a detailed and specialised knowledge of the drugs problem. Deputy O'Donnell compared present figures with those of a previous time when there was only one drugs unit. There are now a number of drugs units throughout the country so the figures are not comparable.</P>
    <P>In Dublin, which is the main area where heroin is a problem, drug units have been established in each of the city's five Garda divisions and their activities are co-ordinated through the central drug squad based in Harcourt Square. Those five Garda divisions did not have drug units some years ago. This approach has enabled the central drug squad to monitor the activities of drug dealers all over the city and it has significantly enhanced the Garda intelligence gathering capability. In addition to the central drug squad, full-time drug <Col N="1961" /> units operate in Santry, Cabra, Raheny, Dún Laoghaire, Crumlin, Ballyfermot, Tallaght, Store Street, Pearse Street, Kevin Street and Donnybrook. To sum up, we have never had better coverage in the capital by specialist drug units.</P>
    <P>Outside Dublin, there are full-time drug units in Cork, Galway and Limerick.  In this regard, it is important to bear in mind that drugs are not just a Dublin problem. It is a national problem and the Garda are responding accordingly.</P>
    <P>In recent times, we have had a number of very significant seizures of illicit drugs. Indeed, record amounts have been seized and the Garda and the Customs and Excise service deserve all our thanks. These seizures have hit the drug traffickers and intercepted their supply routes. They show we are waging an unrelenting war on drugs. There can be no doubting the resolve and the determination of the law enforcement agencies to suppress this evil trade. These seizures amount to over £25 million in value and indicate the benefit of cross agency co-operation and good intelligence.  Ireland will not become a soft touch for drug traffickers who may entertain notions that we are a convenient back-door to Europe. We have an international responsibility and we take it seriously.</P>
    <P>My Department has finalised a detailed and comprehensive report on important aspects of law enforcement in relation to the drugs problem here. Based on that report I have prepared a set of comprehensive and far-reaching proposals which I will bring before the Government very shortly. The main task of the report was to identify the best arrangements for achieving a cohesive and co-ordinated response to the drug trafficking problem by the existing law enforcement agencies and the proposals will be mainly concerned with this aspect. However, the report also examined the legal powers of members of the law enforcement agencies and the need for legislative changes to assist the law enforcement response. The contribution in the health and education areas in developing strategies to <Col N="1962" /> reduce demand for drugs is also considered.  The proposals which I will bring to Government shortly will cover all these aspects.</P>
    <P>My proposals will be far-reaching and wide-ranging. They will be no mere tinkering with the problem, but a root and branch radicalisation of plans to tackle drug-trafficking. I am determined to do whatever is required and I will have no hesitation in asking the Government for the necessary resources.</P>
    <P>Drugs are smuggled into this island by sea and by air. Obviously, it is neither practical nor possible to search every person, every package, every item that comes into the State. To do so, would bring traffic, both passenger and commercial, to a grinding halt. For this reason, intelligence-based strategies are crucial in combating the importation of drugs and, in this regard, the closest international co-operation is vital if such strategies are to prove effective. Customs and Garda must be in a position to target the traffickers.</P>
    <P>The serious implications for law enforcement which arose from the abolition of customs control in Europe on 1 January 1993 have been examined in detail by member states of the European Union. The ending of customs controls posed an additional and serious challenge to those charged with law enforcement. As a response to this challenge, the European drugs unit has been established. The unit, which became operational in 1994, is charged with the essential mission of exchanging and coordinating drugs intelligence throughout the European Union. A liaison officer from the Garda Síochána is serving with the unit and the information obtained from this source will be vital in preventing the illegal importation of drugs.</P>
    <P>From a meeting I had with fellow Justice Ministers of the European Union last month I know that the drugs unit has had some considerable successes since it was constituted. I welcome the Taoiseach's initiative in highlighting the drugs problem with other EU leaders in <Col N="1963" /> Moscow recently. I can assure Members that drugs will be one of the priorities during our Presidency.</P>
    <P>In enforcing the law, we must target everyone concerned. In cracking down on the local pusher, we must not lose sight of the fact that he or she is just one part &mdash; indeed, a small part &mdash; in the evil chain of drug trafficking and distribution.  We must get at those who direct things behind the scenes. In this regard, the Criminal Justice Act, 1994, provides for the seizure and confiscation of the proceeds of crime, including drug trafficking.  However, there are powers to get the local pushers off the streets and I am determined that the Garda shall implement the full rigour of the law.</P>
    <P>I share the concern of Members that it is vital that our courts have the necessary powers to order the seizure and confiscation of the proceeds of drug trafficking. We all recognise that where large amounts of criminal proceeds are involved it is not sufficient that the perpetrators be dealt with simply by way of the traditional penalties of imprisonment and fines. Deputies will recall that this is a matter which was dealt with in a comprehensive way in the Criminal Justice Act, 1994.</P>
    <P>Part II of the 1994 Act confers power on a court to make a confiscation order, on the application of the Director of Public Prosecutions, against a person who has been convicted of a drug trafficking offence. For that purpose, `drug trafficking' is defined in the broadest terms and it includes importing drugs and laundering the proceeds of trafficking.  Where a court determines that the offender has benefited from drug trafficking it can make a confiscation order for the amount of the benefit he or she received from all drug trafficking and not merely from the specific offence in respect of which he or she has been convicted.</P>
    <P>The Act provides that a court is required to assume that all property in the hands of an offender at the time of conviction and all income or other <Col N="1964" /> assets received by him or her in the previous six years were part of the proceeds of drug trafficking. It is up to the defendant to prove to the court that particular assets, including money or property, were not derived from trafficking. Where a court is satisfied that proceeds of drug trafficking arose prior to six years before the conviction these can, of course, be confiscated.</P>
    <P>The Act also empowers the High Court to make restraint orders freezing assets, including money, which may be liable to realisation if a confiscation order is made at a later stage. The effect of a restraint order is to prohibit any person from dealing with the property to which the order applies. Applications for these orders are made by the Director of Public Prosecution and can be made without the need to give notice to a party against whom an order is sought.</P>
    <P>The circumstances in which a restraint order may be made are set out in section 23 of the 1994 Act. Subsection (1) (a) of that section provides that the court may order property to be restrained where proceedings have been instituted against a person for a drug trafficking offence or for an indictable offence other than a drug trafficking offence and a confiscation order has either been made or may be made. Section 23 (i) (b) allows the High Court to make a restraint order where the court is satisfied that proceedings are to be instituted and it appears that a confiscation order may be made. This provision ensures that a restraint order can be obtained before a person is arrested or charged with an offence.</P>
    <P>Section 63 of the 1994 Act permits the Garda Síochána to apply to the District Court for the purpose of an investigation into drug trafficking, money laundering or an offence in respect of which a confiscation order may be made, for an order requiring the disclosure of material which is relevant to the investigation. Failure to comply with an order made under section 63 is a criminal offence.</P>
    <P>I have outlined the relevant provisions of the Criminal Justice Act 1994, <Col N="1965" /> in some detail because it is very important for Deputies to be fully aware that the law makes extensive provision for powers which enable our law enforcement authorities to identify and secure restraint and confiscation orders in respect of the proceeds of drug trafficking.  All these powers came into operation in November 1994 and are being put to good use.</P>
    <P>In addition, I brought into force, with effect from 2 May 1995, a number of provisions in the 1994 Act which require banks and other financial bodies to take certain measures, for example, identification of customers and reporting suspicious transactions, which will make it more difficult for drug traffickers to launder their dirty money. Since becoming Minister for Justice, I have made every effort to ensure that these anti-laundering procedures were put in place as soon as possible. The reason May was chosen as the start-up date was to allow sufficient time for the preparation of the detailed guidelines which were necessary for staff of banks and other financial bodies operating the new procedures and for appropriate training. The Revenue Commissioners also have powers to investigate how a person who is on a reduced income can purchase property, etc.</P>
    <P>The possession and supply of illicit drugs is covered by the Misuse of Drugs Acts, 1977 and 1984, which contain severe penalties for those guilty of an offence under the Acts. For example, in respect of pushing or supplying the maximum penalty is a fine of £3,000 and/or imprisonment for a maximum term of 14 years. As regards possession for the more serious offences, maximum penalties include life imprisonment or an open-ended fine. This legislation is the responsibility of my colleague the Minister for Health, Deputy Noonan.</P>
    <P>I am aware that my colleague, the Minister for Education, Deputy Bhreathnach and her Department co-operate actively with the various agencies concerned with the prevention of drug abuse. The resulting initiatives focus especially on the reduction of <Col N="1966" /> demand for substances likely to be abused and involve close collaboration with the Department of Health. Among the initiatives undertaken or in hand are the following: a major programme on substance abuse prevention education for post-primary schools, &ldquo;On my Own Two Feet&rdquo;, was launched by the Minister for Education in October 1994. This programme is being disseminated to post-primary schools generally at present. The programme includes detailed educational resource materials which have been developed for use with pupils of all age levels throughout their post-primary schooling. There is associated and substantial in-service training for teachers on the implementation of the programme. Training courses have already been held for teachers at 26 centres throughout the country. Each course lasts for approximately 50 hours. It is intended to continue this training, which is supported by the Departments of Education and Health, during the coming school year. The programmes educational materials and in-service training constitute a major initiative on substance abuse prevention education in post-primary schools. It is not true, as Deputy O'Donnell said that there is no ongoing educational programme.</P>

      <P>A development project called the &ldquo;Health Promoting School&rdquo; has begun at both primary and post-primary school levels. The project is concerned with developing resources, programmes and a supportive climate for health promotion in schools and close links and collaboration with parents and the community generally in this work. Substance abuse education receives special attention in this project.</P>
      <P>At present the project is located in ten schools, five primary and five post-primary.  It is planned that a start will be made on disseminating outcomes next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment is reviewing the provisions of social, personal and health <Col N="1967" /> education at both primary and post-primary school levels. This review is considering the inclusion of substance abuse education in the school curricula at both levels and it is expected that its outcome will be available in the near future.</P>
    <P>The Department of Education cooperates in the various media and other campaigns designed to promote an awareness of the dangers of misuse of substances, for example, the Department participated actively in the activities of European Drug Prevention Week held in October 1994. The Youth Section of the Department of Education supports initiatives aimed at young " &gt;people in out-of-school environments in the prevention of substance abuse. For example, various educational packages on aspects of substance abuse have been prepared by the National Youth Council with support from the Department. The National Youth Council is supporting the employment of a health education officer and a number of community action groups receive assistance as well. The Department of Education has indicated that it will co-operate with initiatives and co-ordination at regional level which support the prevention of substance abuse.</P>
    <P>The demand reducation aspect of the strategy is primarily the responsibility of my colleague the Minister for Health, Deputy Noonan. Since 1991 the Department of Health has been overseeing the implementation of the recommendations in the strategy. The publication in 1992 of the recommendations of the National AIDS Strategy Committee has also had a major impact on policy in this area, given the close connection between HIV-AIDS and intravenous drug abuse. At present 57 per cent of all known HIV positive cases in this country are drug abuse related and the emphasis has been on putting in place a comprehensive treatment network for drug misusers.</P>
    <P>Since 1992 special funding has been allocated each year to allow for the <Col N="1968" /> development of extensive prevention and treatment services by the Eastern Health Board, which, together with the Drug Treatment Centre in Pearse Street and voluntary organisations, provides such services in the Dublin area where the majority of drug misusers reside.</P>
    <P>The ultimate objective of the treatment and rehabilitation programmes is a drug-free lifestyle. It is acknowledged, however, that this is not an option for many drug misusers, at least in the initial stages of treatment, and consequently it has been necessary to introduce methadone maintenance programmes in community-based satellite clinics as a means of stabilising the behaviour of drug misusers and preventing the spread of HIV through sharing contaminated needles.</P>
    <P>To date, three satellite clinics have been established by the Eastern Health Board, at Baggot Street, Ballyfermot and Amiens Street. The clinics provide a range of primary services for drug misusers, including methadone maintenance, needle exchange, urinalysis, HIV testing and counselling and free condoms.  They provide services for drug misusers within a defined catchment area. At present a total of 420 drug misusers are on methadone maintenance programmes at the satellite clinics and a further 190 patients receive methadone at the Drug Treatment Centre, Pearse Street.</P>
    <P>The demand for services at the satellite clinics has been so great a waiting list has built up. The Minister for Health regards it as an urgent priority to provide services for those on the waiting list. As a first step the Eastern Health Board has commenced with the provision of services at two of its satellite clinics in the afternoons. This will allow a further 100 patients to be put on methadone maintenance programmes. In addition, funding is being made available to the Eastern Health Board to enable it to open additional clinics in Dublin during 1995 as part of the development of a comprehensive network of services.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1969" /> It is important to be able to treat drug misusers in their own community in so far as this is possible. To this end the report of the expert group on a Protocol for the prescribing of methadone together with a letter from the Department of Health's chief medical officer, was circulated to general practitioners, who are being encouraged to take on responsibility for the treatment, including the provision of methadone, of drug misusers. At present, in excess of 400 patients are on methadone maintenance with general practitioners. It is known that there is a reluctance on the part of some general practitioners to become involved in this area and this is perhaps understandable. I understand, however, that the Protocol for the prescribing of methadone, which was recently circulated, provides a framework of support for general practitioners willing to become involved. Any practitioner who was so willing would be asked to take on a stabilised patient from a satellite clinic and continue with their treatment.</P>
    <P>The services of the satellite clinic would continue to be available, where required, together with the right to refer the patient back should any problems develop. The discharge of patients in this way from the satellite clinics would free-up spaces for patients on the waiting list who are currently not in receipt of service. The Minister for Health is determined to continue with the policy of involving GPs in the treatment of drug misusers to ensure an adequate level of service for those presenting for treatment.</P>
    <P>The ten-bed detoxification unit in Beaumont Hospital has been under intense pressure and a waiting list has developed as a result. This problem will be addressed by the Eastern Health Board with the commissioning of a ten-bed unit at Cherry Orchard Hospital. It is hoped to have the unit available in the middle of June.</P>

      <P>According to the Health Research Board report on Treated Drug Misuse in the Greater Dublin Area 1992-93, 80 per cent of those receiving treatment for drug abuse in 1993 were unemployed. The national co-ordinating committee identified the availability of rehabilitation facilities as a key element in reintegrating drug misusers into society. The Eastern Health Board has been running a rehabilitation facility, the &ldquo;Soilse&rdquo; project, which has achieved a high degree of success in equipping drug misusers with social and occupational skills. It is the health board's intention to extend this programme in 1995 to cater for more drug misusers.</P>
      <P>The Eastern Health Board has recently established a drug co-ordinating committee comprising of the board, the Garda, my Department, the drug treatment sector, the education sector and voluntary agencies. This committee will monitor and review the services for drug misusers in the eastern region and the Minister for Health is confident that this will result in a substantial improvement in the co-ordination of services for drug misusers.</P>
      <P>There is a problem with drug abuse in some of our institutions as many of those convicted are users when committed.  In order to ensure absolutely that no drugs could get into prison a highly restrictive regime for visitors and prisoners who have to go in and out to court, hospital, etc. would have to be introduced, including constant strip and body searches. It would not be acceptable if visitors, especially women and children, were subjected to this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is not to suggest that we can do nothing. The steps being taken to keep drugs out of the prisons include a high level of staff vigilance, closed circuit video surveillance of visits, screening of prisoners after visits and regular searches of the prisons. For example, in Mountjoy Prison greatly enhanced video monitoring equipment is being purchased to monitor visits, a new <Col N="1971" /> search room to deal with prisoners coming in off visits or on committal is nearing completion and an education programme has been delivered to all prisoners willing to receive it. In Cork prison, a special net is being placed over the main exercise yard to prevent drugs being thrown in to inmates. The installation of a net has already worked very well in another exercise yard in that prison.</P>
    <P>It is planned to carry out a full review to establish how best to manage the problems of access to drugs and the treatment and rehabilitation of drug-addicted offenders. In this context, the question of providing extended methadone maintenance treatment programmes in prisons, in consultation with community health agencies, is currently being explored with the relevant experts. The establishment of a detoxification facility together with a drug free unit within the existing prison system is under active consideration at present, and the Mountjoy Prison complex is the location being considered in this context. The motion calls for the immediate introduction of the Juvenile Justice Bill. I thank Deputy Máirín Quill for her input into the debate on this Bill. She was chairperson of the Oireachtas committee and her information and experience will be very valuable to the Minister of State, Deputy Austin Currie. The Bill, which will replace the remaining provisions of the 1908 Children Act with a comprehensive modern statute, is at an advanced stage of preparation in my Department. I cannot give a precise date for publication because of the Bill's size and scope, the need to finalise discussions on related core policy issues between the Departments of Education, Health and Justice and the time it will take to be drafted. The discussions referred to are currently taking place between senior representatives of the Departments concerned. I can assure the House that the preparation of the legislation is being given high priority and there will be no delay in its publication.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1972" /> I have outlined the Government's broad strategy to deal with the terrible problem of drug-addiction on three fronts, law enforcement, treatment of addicts and education. I want to express in the strongest terms that it is time to take off the gloves in dealing with drug importers and peddlers. I regard these people as modern day terrorists whose evil trade is attempting to undermine communities not only in Ireland but throughout the world. A world-wide response to this threat is long overdue.</P>
    <P>The drug problem has not suddenly appeared in the past few months; sadly it has been building up for a number of years. Greater access to travel has led to an increased influx of drugs. The major finds by the Garda and customs and excise officers is an indication of what good intelligence work and co-ordination can achieve. However, it will not take all the drugs out of our community. I assure those communities, particularly in Dublin, Cork and other cities, which are suffering so much from the unsocial and despicable behaviour of drug pushers that they will receive the necessary back up and attention from the Garda if they give them information on where these people are operating. To secure a conviction, the Garda must have evidence to prosecute and bring someone to trial.</P>

      <P>I want to assure those communities which are suffering that any information they give to the Garda will be acted on. I give a commitment to continue to tackle this evil which is afflicting society not only in Ireland but elsewhere.</P>

      <P>It goes without saying that a quarter of a century ago the use of prohibited drugs was alien to Ireland and the concept of drug addiction was foreign and virtually unknown. It was unthinkable then that Irish cities and towns might go the way of New York, London, Amsterdam or other large cities. Sadly, the past two decades have seen the menace of serious drug addiction spread its evil tentacles into virtually every city, town and village in Ireland. Crime, which is the inseparable by-product of addiction, has become endemic. A tide of violence has overwhelmed the elderly. As I said here last week during the course of a debate on the Criminal Law (Bail) Bill, 1995, which the Government voted down for no good reason, many people are forced to live as prisoners of terror in their own homes. It is fair to say that directly or indirectly each of us has been affected.</P>
      <P>The time has come for a radical and a comprehensive overhaul of our anti-drug legislation. In this respect, I confess to my deep disappointment that the Minister did not avail of the opportunity here in the House to come up with a radical legislative response to an ever deepening crisis. However, I wish my contribution to this debate to be seen as constructive. It is possible for all in this House to lament the happenings of the past. It is all too easy to denounce the present move towards unspecified action. It is possible, as the Minister well knows, to promise action and to give the illusion of concern by establishing secretive committees with unspecified agendas whose principle function is prevarication.  The time for those has long since passed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If it is the case, and I think it has been established here tonight that it is, that the Minister does not have a clear anti-drug policy that she can announce to this House, I challenge her to take a <Col N="1974" /> step in the national interest and establish a national forum to combat drugs. Such a forum could, I suggest, by public hearings focus the attention of the nation on the scale of the drugs problem.  It could harness the expertise of lawyers, doctors, the Garda, Revenue and customs officials. It could examine the steps taken in other countries and learn by their experiences. It could provide the basis for an all party community-based drugs initiative. Fianna Fáil would fully support the establishment of such a forum and is prepared to publish a policy paper on drugs with a view to stimulating public debate. I invite the Minister to seize the initiative and announce the establishment of such a forum in this House.</P>
    <P>It is clear, and the Minister did not address it, that the Misuse of Drugs Acts, have failed to stem the tide of drugs. A fundamental reappraisal of our anti-drugs code is necessary. Existing legislation concentrates on detection and punishment for possession and the supply of drugs. It is not a criminal offence to consume most prohibited drugs, prepared opium being the exception.  While there are legal and evidential reasons for this, it demonstrates plainly that the criminal law loses interest in the drug and the addict at the time of consumption. Yet it is at the time of consumption that the problem is magnified. Consumption leads to addiction and addiction leads to crime.</P>
    <P>The apparent insatiable desire for drugs has driven addicts to commit crimes of inexplicable cruelty, often for relatively modest sums of money. Halting the supply of drugs is one method of tackling the problem. It is a method which has been tried and despite the best efforts of the Garda and customs authorities it has failed. I compliment them on their seizures and their efforts. They are under-resourced and under funded and are fighting against multi-billion pound criminals.</P>
    <P>Last year there were over 3,800 detected drug offences. Clearly that is only the tip of the iceberg. The statistics do not tell us what percentage of the £46 <Col N="1975" /> million stolen in Ireland last year was stolen in drug related crime. What is clear is that addicts need money and they obtain it from larceny, burglary and robbery. An addict with a modest drug habit will need between £50 and £100 per day to fund his addiction. Many will consume up to £200 worth of heroin per day. Invariably this money is acquired by crime.</P>
    <P>An addict stealing cash in robberies or muggings will need to steal between £18,000 and £40,000 each year to feed his habit. In many instances the amount required will be greater, in some cases as much as £75,000 per annum. If an addict tries to fund his drug habit through the theft of goods from houses or shops, the value of the goods which it is necessary for him to steal will increase dramatically. Stolen goods are frequently sold at a small fraction of their true value. An addict who wants to get £20 in cash has to steal goods worth £100 or more.</P>
    <P>The harsh reality is &mdash; and it gives me no great pleasure to say this &mdash; that each serious drug addict is a one man crime wave. Addiction is an illness and drug addicts are entitled to our sympathy and assistance. What they are not entitled to is an ongoing licence to plunder and terrorise.  If, through addiction, addicts cannot remain on our streets without constant recourse to theft they must be removed. Drug addiction is an illness which is physically harmful. By tolerating the ongoing consumption of prohibited drugs, society is failing to vindicate the addict's constitutional right to bodily integrity. There is no reason in logic or in justice a person with severe drug addiction should be treated in a materially different way from a person who is mentally ill and a danger to himself and the community.</P>
    <P>There should be a drug offenders treatment Act which would allow, in certain circumstances and subject to specified controls, the detention of drug addicts for the purpose of detoxification, counselling and vindicating their right to bodily integrity. The use of <Col N="1976" /> any controlled drug must as a matter of extreme urgency be made a criminal offence. That is the least the public will ask of the Minister and this House tonight.</P>
    <P>Under the Misuse of Drugs Acts it is not an offence to use any drug other than prepared opium. This sends the wrong message to addicts and people tempted to dabble in drugs. It tells them it is not an offence to consume drugs, that there is no sanction for consuming prohibited drugs. In the same way that the Garda are empowered to test and take bodily samples from persons suspected of driving a mechanically propelled vehicle while under the influence of an intoxicant they should be permitted to exercise a similar power in respect of suspected drug addicts.</P>
    <P>Another obvious lacuna in our anti-drugs legislation is that a person who is under the influence of a controlled drug cannot be arrested by the Garda. A member of the Garda Síochána who suspects, on reasonable grounds, that a person has consumed a prohibited drug during the previous three hours should be permitted to arrest the suspect without warrant. The member in charge of the Garda station to which the arrested person is brought after his arrest should be given power to detain that person for up to four hours for tests to be carried out to ascertain if the arrested person is under the influence of a controlled drug. The member in charge should only be permitted to exercise this power of detention if he is satisfied there are reasonable grounds for believing the detention is warranted.</P>
    <P>A broadly similar power of detention is given to the member in charge of a Garda station by section 4 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1984. A member of the Garda Síochána should also be empowered to request the arrested person to provide a medical practitioner with a sample of his urine and to permit the medical practitioner to take from him a sample of his blood. Failure or refusal to provide either of the requested samples should be a criminal offence and the <Col N="1977" /> court should be entitled, in any proceedings brought under the drug offenders treatment Act, to draw an inference that the arrested person refused to provide the sample as he had consumed a prohibited drug.</P>
    <P>Measures such as these would permit a twofold attack on the drugs plague, a continuation of the policy of stopping and seizing shipments and a new policy of arresting and charging addicts who had consumed prohibited drugs. It is inevitable that specialised and purpose built drug treatment units will have to be provided to treat people for their addictions. These will include detoxification facilities and would have fully trained counsellors available as part of the overall treatment.</P>
    <P>Are we now reaching a stage where we will have to allow a person who has undergone, say, three periods of detoxification and detention and who is still using drugs to register himself as a habitual drug addict? In that event will we have to provide that such a person is provided with an appropriate medicinal dose of the controlled drug on a daily basis by a State agency? Will we ultimately be forced to legislate for severe sanctions against those who refuse to register as habitual drug addicts, to protect society against drug-related crimes? These are serious questions which require in-depth analysis. The only certainty now is that the Minister must tackle a drugs crisis which is rapidly running out of control. In that respect I am extremely disappointed with the Minister's response. Aside from her statement that she will establish an interagency co-operation and put a net over the walls of Cork Prison, I see little to encourage anybody to believe the Minister will take decisive action in this crisis.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to certain actions being taken by the Ministers for Health and Education and quoted liberally from the Criminal Justice Act, 1994, which was introduced by her predecessor, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn. Aside from that, little solace was offered to the victims of crime. I have <Col N="1978" /> put forward positive proposals which should be taken on board by the Minister because the problems which the proposals address transcend politics. I would have expected a more generous response than I received to the constitutional Criminal Law (Bail) Bill, 1995. If necessary Fianna Fáil will introduce the Drug Offenders (Treatment) Bill and put it before the House, but it would be preferable if the Minister took the initiative and published a Bill along the lines I have suggested, and any amendments the Minister wishes to suggest and which are constructive and in the interests of society will be taken on board by Fianna Fáil. In the face of a rapidly growing crisis I would expect the Minister, in a spirit of generosity, to accept the positive measures put forward by my party which are aimed not at scoring political points but at solving crime in our society, most of which is drug-related.</P>
    <P>In respect of drug trafficking, I expected a more positive reply from the Minister on the possibility of establishing an aerial Garda unit, and a more positive reply as to what the Government intends to do at European Union level to get the European Union to assist us in protecting our frontiers. We are not getting positive responses from the Minister and the Government. We consistently put forward positive proposals for tackling the crime wave and the drug problem but they are rebuffed. Sometimes the Minister and the Government hide behind the Constitution for the flimsiest of reasons.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to make a short contribution to this debate from the perspective of a parent of four young children, none of whom has reached their teens, to try to represent the concerns of every family and emphasise the gravity of the threat from drugs which are now rampant in our society. I do so also from the perspective of a legislator to put down a marker for the Minister that the Fianna Fáil Party will put this issue at the top of our agenda and it will remain there for the foreseeable future.</P>
      <P>I am disappointed with the Minister's amendment. Its abusive language is indicative of how the Minister perceives the drugs issue. Her opening phrase, &ldquo;mindful of the menace of drugs&rdquo; suggests that she thinks there are a few pushers, a few purveyors of drugs, and a few drug addicts. The reality is that there is a war. This country is awash with drugs in spite of the very gallant efforts of the Garda Síochána and their recent successes in discovering drugs coming into this country for use both here and in other countries, and there are indications that the price of drugs is falling. That is because the market is awash with the drugs that are perpetrated on our youth by the drug barons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is also interesting that in her opening statement the Minister drew the same analogy as I do, that the drugs and crime culture is a bigger threat to society now than the 25 years of the troubles in the North. I do not say that to diminish the horrors of the past 25 <Col N="1980" /> years but to equate the murder and mayhem there with the murder and mayhem perpetrated by the purveyors of drugs. The abuse and misuse of drugs is a cancer eating away at the heart of society, and the criminals and drug barons must be faced down by bringing in the toughest set of legislative measures to root them out of normal society. I would support the introduction of the death penalty for the drug barons, the perpetrators of the most heinous crimes that wrest a terrible price from those they inveigle into abusing drugs. We have to be unequivocal about this, stop distancing ourselves in our use of language, and face up to what these people are and the results of what they do, which is murder.</P>
    <P>A prison sentence is now an acceptable risk for those involved in crime. In the past decade the balance of legislation has swung towards the rights of the criminal to the detriment of the victime, the Garda Síochána, the Judiciary and the family, and this is wrong. Punishment of those who involve themselves in crime should be real and it should be harsh. Prison should be a place where acceptable standards are maintained, but it should also be a hard taskmaster. Unfortunately, the fear of losing one's freedom no longer exists. The logjam in our court system, the lack of prison places, the remission of sentences and minimal punishments for many crimes all contribute to the revolving door syndrome. I have often heard that some of the criminal fraternity look forward to spending the winter in jail because it is preferable to being on the streets. That is how the prison system is viewed today. It should not be a happy camping facility. It should be a hard taskmaster with acceptable standards but reflecting that those who are there have committed serious crimes against society.</P>
    <P>The modern argument that social ills are the cause of much crime may be partly true, but that is no justification for criminal activity. As a society we <Col N="1981" /> have to make choices. If we want the freedom to walk our streets without fear, to work in our shops, industries and businesses, the laws that govern our way of life will have to be tougher. This may be a small price to pay to win the war against the criminals. Because of the explosion in drug abuse and the increase in serious crime urgent action is required. We may all have to sacrifice some of our individual freedom so that collective wellbeing and freedom for all can be protected.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Ballycroy (Mayo) Group Water Scheme.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>In October 1994 a local priest, Fr. Joe Gibbons of Ballycroy, County Mayo, after persistent complaints from his parishioners, decided to have eight separate samples of the local drinking water supply tested by the Department of Medical Microbiology at University College Hospital, Galway. The results of these private and independent tests were that the water contained the bacterium E coli in significant quantities and the water was determined unfit for human consumption.</P>
      <P>E coli is an indicator bacterium used to determine the presence of faecal contamination of a water supply. The EU drinking water quality directive AD/778/EEC L229 of 30 August 1980 states that the maximum admissible concentration of total coliforms per 100 millilitres shall be zero. Total coliform counts in the samples taken by Fr. Gibbons ranged from 9 to 32 per 100 millilitres.  All samples contravened the drinking water directive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>After further investigation it was revealed that the water supply which is drawn from Lough Annafrin in the Nephin Beg Mountains had been tested previously by the county council and health board in 1992 and 1993 and had <Col N="1982" /> been found to be similarly contaminated.  This information had not been made public prior to the privately conducted tests of October 1994. Some 240 households are served by this water source which is managed by Ballycroy group water scheme and its trustees.</P>
    <P>Since the area around the lake is uninhabited for several kilometres it was concluded after visual inspection that the only possible source of the excrement contamination was the high sheep densities on the mountain. In addition, visual inspection of the mountain showed the remains of one dead sheep in the headwaters of the supply to the group scheme as well as large amounts of sheep excrement in the vicinity of and above the headwaters of the scheme source.</P>
    <P>In addition to the bacteriological contamination of the water supply, samples also contained large amounts of turf humus and varied in turbidity from light rust on good days to dark brown semi-translucency on bad days, after heavy rainfall. The water continues to have an odour and poor taste.</P>
    <P>Since the discovery of the water contamination Board Fáilte has expressed its grave concern about the issue and its potential effects on tourism in the area. In addition, two large travel guide publishers have expressed a desire for more information regarding the problem with a view to publishing warnings to travellers in their next editions &mdash; Fodor's of New York and Lonely Planet of London.  Ballycroy is a developing agri and eco-tourism destination and the contamination of the mains water supply represents a serious obstacle to the growth of such enterprises.</P>
    <P>Simultaneous with the discoveries in Ballycroy reports have appeared in the academic world and the national media of problems of erosion in mountainous regions of County Galway and south County Mayo, apparently the result of the intensity of sheep grazing in these areas. Physical inspection showed that <Col N="1983" /> similar erosion had taken place in the Nephin Beg range and that the apparent cause of the turbidity of the water supply was the run-off of turf humus and silt from large areas of eroded hillside which has been denuded of vegetation by the large sheep population. It is probable that the loss of vegetation in the area has decreased the eco-system's ability to trap and recycle sheep droppings.  Consequently, the sheep faeces wash directly into the headwaters of the Ballycroy group water scheme, resulting in the high E coli counts.</P>
    <P>In February 1995 a formal complaint was lodged by a private resident of Ballycroy with DG XI of the European Commission regarding non-conformity with drinking water directive AD/778/EEC L229. The directive demands a zero E coli count in drinking water. This complaint was accepted by the Commission and is currently pending reply by the Irish Government.</P>
    <P>Currently Ballycroy Development Limited, a community based, voluntary and non-profit making company, is making proposals to the Department of the Environment with regard to a properly conducted scientific study of the sources, mechanics and potential technological and environmentally sound solutions to this problem. No reply has been made to these proposals. I wish to ask the Minister what action the Government will take to curtail the source of the contamination, that is, the over-grazing of sheep on the mountain. Why has the Government not exercised its rights to apply the planning Acts and require an environmental impact assessment before allocating additional sheep headage grants under the ewe premium scheme in areas of extreme environmental sensitivity such as the Nephin Beg Mountains?</P>
    <P>What measures is the Government taking to ensure that in future the rights of access to environmental information which are enshrined in the EU directive <Col N="1984" /> on freedom of access to environmental information and Statutory Instrument 133 of 1993 are guaranteed to those seeking such information from both county councils and health boards? Why has this not been the case in the past? What plans does the Government have to instigate proper scientific investigation into the erosion problem and its consequences for the landscape, economy and local public health? Why has Coillte Teoranta as land owner in the water catchment area not been obliged to fence and exclude sheep from the area and to cease the leasing of this land for sheep farming?</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen) Nora Owen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to respond to the Deputy on this important matter on behalf of the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Howlin.</P>
      <P>The Ballycroy area has a private group water scheme which serves up to 290 houses and farms. The scheme was developed through co-operative community effort and with assistance of group water scheme grants of almost £200,000 from the Department of the Environment.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will acknowledge that group water schemes have made a huge contribution to the improvement of the lifestyles of rural communities and to the development of agriculture and offfarm economic activities. For over 30 years, successive Governments have supported this &ldquo;bottom up&rdquo; approach to providing an essential rural piped water infrastructure. Over 5,400 group schemes have now been completed, serving in excess of 150,000 households.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Ballycroy group scheme was completed some 15 years ago using an upland lake as the source of supply. Since then, the scheme has been extended to serve a further 50 houses. Unfortunately, in recent years, intensified agricultural activity within the lake catchment has given rise to increased levels of suspended organic matter <Col N="1985" /> entering the lake. This has adversely affected the water quality of the scheme's source.</P>
    <P>For some time, the group organisers have been taking steps to protect the source against the threat of organic pollution.  An access road to the abstraction site was provided to facilitate maintenance and the immediate area adjacent to the site was fenced off. In parallel with these developments, Mayo County Council formally notified the group of the non-compliance with water quality standards and of the need for various remedial measures, including water treatment facilities. The Department of the Environment invited the group to develop proposals for this purpose which would be financed from the group scheme grants budget.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, some delays took place in the preparation of these remedial proposals. The Ballycroy group has very recently submitted a proposal, prepared by the group's consulting engineer, for the construction of water treatment facilities and of new intake and source protection works. This proposal has been examined in the Department and the group will be authorised shortly to progress the proposal as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>A number of lessons will be learned from the difficult experience of the Ballycroy householders. The majority of group schemes are now connected to public water supply systems. Private sources of supply as lakes, springs and boreholes can be more susceptible to organic pollution and, in these circumstances, groups are advised to filter and disinfect their supply. The Department of the Environment provides grant assistance for such facilities in cases where an alternative public supply is not available. In addition, the Department has published an advisory leaflet entitled &ldquo;Private Water Supplies: Focus on Quality&rdquo; which has been widely circulated and is available from county council offices.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1986" /> We must guard against excessively negative generalisations in responding to the specific problems of Ballycroy. First, there is no acute problem of drinking water quality either in rural or urban Ireland. Some 94 per cent of Irish drinking water complies with stringent EU quality standards and many of the deficiences affecting the balance are technical rather than substantive.</P>
    <P>Second, we should continue to place our confidence in group water schemes as an important community-based and cost effective resource in bringing good quality drinking water to less populous areas. The European Commission has also demonstrated this confidence by agreeing to a new system of co-financing of group schemes. This will allow us to expand work under the programme over the next four years.</P>
    <P>As my colleague the Minister for Tourism and Trade has already done, I deplore the irresponsible attempts which have been made to sabotage Irish tourism interests by portraying the difficulties in Ballycroy as being representative of a widespread problem. The broader picture is of high quality drinking water services. The problems of Ballycroy are being urgently addressed. That is the message which should go out.</P>
    <P>I will pass on to my colleague, the Minister for the Environment the other questions raised by Deputy Molloy which are allied to this problem.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for allowing me to raise this matter on the Adjournment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Substantial delay in the processing of a legal case is frequently a cause of great distress to the people involved. The aggravation is particularly damaging for the innocent party who simply wants to see justice done, and to have the case completed as quickly as possible so as to get on with their lives. While the <Col N="1987" /> delay itself is a cause of great concern, a further problem frequently arises. This relates to the ever-increasing costs which are associated with long drawnout cases. The problem of costs is particularly acute when the case is being heard in either the High Court or the Supreme Court.</P>
    <P>Recently I submitted a question to the Minister for Justice on the number of cases which have been pending in the High Court for five years or more. In her reply last week the Minister informed me that the longest delays in the High Court are associated with personal injury claims. She stated that there are 27 such cases currently in the system for which a notice of trial has been received more than five years previously, and which have not yet been completed. In the course of her reply, the Minister expressed her personal concern at delays and indicated that a review of the situation is under way. I welcome both the Minister's concern and the review process.</P>
    <P>However, I am extremely dissatisfied with the quality of information which seems to be available to the Minister on this matter of critical importance to the efficent operation of our higher courts. For example, I am aware of a case involving a dispute relating to a will which has been ongoing in the High Court for in excess of ten years. Indeed the case in question initially came before the High Court in February 1978. Consequently the case, which remains before the High Court, is without final resolution more than 17 years after its initial hearing.</P>
    <P>This is simply ridiculous and cannot be allowed continue. As well as being a source of great concern to those immediately involved, it clearly reflects a major gap in the audit procedures which are in place to monitor the processing efficiency of our higher courts. The fact that the Minister was seemingly <Col N="1988" /> not made aware of this case when preparing a reply to my question is particularly worrying. The obvious question that arises is whether there are many other such cases pending resolution in the High Court for totally unacceptable periods of time.</P>
    <P>For obvious reasons of confidentiality, I cannot comment in any specific way on the case I mentioned. However, as an indication of the extent of upset caused by the case, I would like to state that the legal representatives of one of the parties have attended the High Court or the examiner's office on more than 40 occasions since 1985.</P>
    <P>I will be happy to provide the Minister, in confidence, with the details of the case, and I urge her to obtain a comprehensive assessment of the factors contributing to the delay as a matter of great urgency. Keeping in mind the fact that justice delayed may become justice denied, I request the Minister to ensure that her original reply to my question be reviewed and updated as soon as possible.  The many people who place their full trust in our higher court system deserve nothing less.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter. I would be very glad to receive the details of that case, about which I do not have information, and I will look into it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position is that the longest delay in the hearing of listed cases in the High Court arises in the hearing of personal injury cases where there is a delay of approximately three years between the date of receipt of the notice of trial and the date of trial. Personal injury cases cannot be listed to fix a date for hearing until a notice of trial is received by the court from either of the contesting parties.  In relation to other types of civil cases &mdash; for example non-jury and Chancery cases &mdash; the position is that cases cannot be listed to fix a date for hearing until a notice of trial and subsequent certificate of readiness is <Col N="1989" /> received by the court. There is a delay of approximately nine months between the date of receipt of the certificate of readiness and the date of the trial in such cases.</P>
    <P>Cases listed for trial, however, are subject to application for adjournment from either party and, in the interest of justice, the courts obviously have to rule on such applications. It is not a matter in which the Minister for Justice has a function. It is in this context that some cases can be outstanding in excess of five years after service of a notice of trial.</P>
    <P>It would not be appropriate for me to give information regarding any specific case which is pending. Such information will be given on request by the court to the litigant or his legal representative.</P>
    <P>Delays in the hearing of cases in the courts is a matter of great concern to me and is currently under examination in my Department. In line with the commitment given in the Programme for Government, a review of the Courts and Court Officers Bill, 1994, is being carried out to ensure that the provisions it contains adequately address the backlog of cases for hearing in the courts. This review is being carried out and I hope to be in a position to announce my proposals in this regard shortly.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Foreshore Legislation Applications.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for the opportunity to raise this matter and I thank the Minister for coming in to reply. This problem relates to Carlingford Lough which straddles the Border, with County Down on one side and County Louth on the other. There is a good aquaculture industry in this area, with the farming of oysters and mussels. In recent years there have been problems on the lough in that a number of ships from outside this jurisdiction entered the lough and hoovered up mussels before leaving &mdash; the position with oyster farming is different. <Col N="1990" /> This matter has been raised on a number of occasions in this House.</P>
      <P>The problem relates to an area from Carlingford to Omeath and involves a number of applications currently before the Department for the farming of certain areas in the locality. Under the Foreshore Act, 1933, there is provision for the Minister to hold an oral public inquiry to hear applications for licences along the foreshore. In view of the previous problems that have arisen in the area, particularly in the farming of mussels, I ask the Minister to consider favourably my request. It is the wish of the vast majority of applicants in this business, who have previously met the Minister on this, that an oral public inquiry be held so that they can put their arguments and hear the views of other people who have applied.</P>
      <P>As the Minister is aware, a number of local people in the Carlingford area, whose families have been involved in mussel farming for many years, applied to his Department for a licence some time back and were told they would have to form a co-op. They subsequently formed one and their application is before the Department. I do not want to prejudge a public oral inquiry, but there is disquiet and conflict in the area similar to that existing between the supermarket industry and the small corner shop. The locals who formed that co-op are trying to make a living out of mussel farming in the area and are seeking to do so on the shores in their locality. There is potential for large commercial operators within and outside the State in this area and such non-national operators using foreign crews and boats registered outside the State have applied for licences. It is important, because of that and the existing conflict, that the Minister accede to my request and allows a public oral inquiry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Carlingford Lough, situated close to the Border, is unique. There is great co-operation between oyster fishermen and <Col N="1991" /> a successful co-op is being run between the North and the South with the aid of international funds, one of the greatest marine success stories as regards North-South co-operation. I fear there may be some ill-feeling in the general locality of Carlingford Lough on both sides if the foreshore licence along the southern side, particularly regarding mussel farming, is not dealt with properly by the Department. I am sure I speak for a number of people on the northern side in that there is concern that the large commercial operators are given preference over small local ones. I am sure the Minister will say that is not the case, but I ask him to consider that aspect and accede to the request for a public oral inquiry.</P>
    <P>Mussel farming involves local jobs and if those people were not engaged in that occupation, they would probably be on the dole. Recently, two of the fishermen, Fergal and Eugene McKevitt, who were part of that co-op, met their deaths tragically on the lough. The fact that they were out on the lough shows that they, their families and many families in that locality have been involved in such farming for many years.</P>
    <P>The Government has jumped on the bandwagon of openness, transparency and accountability. Because of that the Minister should accede to my request, be open and transparent and make his Department accountable to a democratic process allowable under the legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. Gilmore) Eamon Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. Gilmore)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Ahern for raising this matter which relates to a specific foreshore licensing application to engage in bottom culture of mussels in Carlingford Lough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The application in question is the subject of a letter received by the Department of the Marine today from Woods, Ahern, Mullen, Solicitors, 18 Francis <Col N="1992" /> Street, Dundalk calling for a public inquiry to be held with regard to granting that specific foreshore licence.</P>
    <P>The policy objective with regard to the licensing of aquaculture and mariculture development is to ensure that such developments take place in an orderly and well regulated manner with full respect for other interests and in harmony with the environment while maximising the industry's contribution to the economy in terms of jobs and revenue.  In line with this objective, the Department is devoting considerable resources to meeting the licence demand for aquaculture operations in Carlingford Lough, particularly for shellfish farming, which is expanding rapidly to the benefit of the coastal community.</P>
    <P>All applications for licences to engage in fish farming are subject to comprehensive evaluation by the Department's aquaculture licence vetting committee, a multidisciplinary advisory body, which brings together all relevant expertise from within the Department and the Central Fisheries Board. Applications are assessed from all technical, scientific and other relevant perspectives to determine the suitability of proposals.</P>
    <P>In all cases this evaluation process is further informed by public consultative procedures including consultation with appropriate statutory bodies such as the regional fisheries boards, local authorities, the Wildlife Service, the Department of the Environment, Bord Fáilte and the Commissioners of Irish Lights. Representations and comments received under this procedure are taken into account as part of the overall evaluation of applications.</P>
    <P>My decisions, as the statutory authority, either for or against individual applications are taken on the basis of the wide-ranging advice and analysis derived from this evaluation and consultation system.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1993" /> My primary aim is to ensure the sustainable and well regulated development of the aquaculture sector with full respect for the rights and interests of all users of the marine and freshwater resources. I will continue to combine the need for a strategic view of the acknowledged economic contribution of aquaculture with the responsibility to take all relevant factors and interests into account. With this objective in mind, an intensive review of the existing planning-regulatory framework for aquaculture is at an advanced stage. This review will determine the scope and need for improvements to the present licensing system.</P>
    <P>My statutory powers in relation to consideration of foreshore licence applications to engage in shellfish cultivation derive from section 3 of the Foreshore Act, 1933.</P>
    <P>I am empowered by that section of the Foreshore Act to grant a licence to any person in respect of the foreshore if, in my opinion, it is in the public interest to do so. While there is provision for holding a public inquiry in regard to granting any foreshore licence, such provision is discretionary.</P>
    <P>In the event that any public inquiry was to be held under the Foreshore Act, 1933, all expenses incurred in the holding of an inquiry would fall to be paid by the licensing applicant.</P>
    <P>The Deputy may not be aware that a public inquiry under the Fisheries Act, 1980, was held on 26 June 1984.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>That public inquiry centred on the proposed designation by order under section 54 of the Act of part of Carlingford Lough as an area within which it shall be lawful to engage in aquaculture pursuant to an aquaculture licence granted by the Minister. Both an aquaculture and a foreshore licence are required to lawfully engage in shellfish growing in Carlingford Lough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1994" /> On 5 December 1986 a specific area of Carlingford Lough and adjoining waters was designated for aquaculture purposes by virtue of the Aquaculture (Carlingford Lough) Order, 1986. Having regard to the comprehensive system of public notice and consultation applicable to all subsequent licensing applications for aquaculture developments, the rigorous assessment process in place to evaluate and advise me on objections or representations received by the Department on foot of the extensive consultation procedures, the fact that a public inquiry has already been held on the designation of the area concerned for aquaculture purposes and a ministerial Order subsequently made designating the area and the need to avoid imposing undue financial burdens on aquaculture licensing applicants by having to bear the costs of any inquiry held under the Foreshore Acts, I am satisfied that there is no justification for holding an additional public inquiry at considerable expense for an area already designated for aquaculture purposes.</P>
    <P>The holding of a further public inquiry would only conceivably be justified if the issues to be resolved were of such complexity, seriousness and of such public import as to warrant it in the common interest.</P>
    <P>I do not consider that the difficulties associated with the present applications in Carlingford Lough warrant such a course of action. Deputy Ahern referred to conflicting applications, but the applications under consideration are all from within the State. The Department of the Marine and I have the highest respect for the applicants concerned, including the co-operative to which Deputy Ahern referred. I am confident that the difficulties to which he referred can be resolved through consultation, mediation and good will on both sides. The Department is committed to working with all the parties concerned to achieve a solution based on consensus and reflecting the legitimate needs of all <Col N="1995" /> users of the foreshore resource. I am confident that a resolution of the difficulties to which Deputy Ahern referred and the fears he expressed can be reached through existing mechanisms in the Department of the Marine for dealing with such applications without recourse to a formal public inquiry.</P>
    <P>I emphasise the positive contribution of aquaculture to jobs and exports which has been fully recognised under the National Development Plan and the co-operative to which Deputy Ahern referred played an important part. The <Col N="1996" /> planned investment under the programme over the next five years of some £36 million has the potential to generate more than 1,000 new jobs directly in the sector and an additional output annually valued at some £12 million. A significant number of jobs will also be created in the value added processing and marketing sectors. I am sure Deputy Ahern will welcome the fact that we anticipate a number of those jobs will be created in the Carlingford area.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 17 May 1995.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 27, 64, 76 and 193 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since November 1993, 149,090 samples of bile taken from bovine animals at slaughter plants have been analysed for the presence of illegal growth promoters. The test involved is a &ldquo;screening&rdquo; process which is a system <Col N="1753" /> designed to indicate the possibility that illegal substances were present in animals tested. Of the samples tested 2,355 were suspect positive for the illegal growth promoter, clenbuterol. This represents 1.56 per cent of the samples tested.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that under EU rules, all member states carry out a random sampling programme for illegal substances. Each country's programme is approved annually by the Commission.  This country carries out a far higher level of testing than required by EU rules. I am committed to continuing the programme of intensive testing for illegal substances at farm and factory level as well as at points of distribution of veterinary medicines.</P>
    <P>All meat is subjected to ante and post-mortem examination at meat plants to ensure that such products are fit for human consumption. In addition officers attached to the veterinary medicines task force in my Department have commenced a programme of intensive spot checks on carcases at point of slaughter. The objective of this operation is to make every effort to ensure that meat products from Ireland are of the highest quality.</P>
    <P>One such investigation commenced at a Leinster meat plant on 5 April, not the week commencing 23 April. A total of 326 carcases have been examined since then; 188 of these gave rise to a suspicion that illegal substances had been used and were sampled and detained. The substances found in some samples were illegal hormonal growth promoters not an angel dust type chemical; analysis of samples is continuing.</P>
    <P>I wish to reaffirm what I said to this House on 28 March in response to a question from Deputy Hugh Byrne. It is a matter of serious concern to me that a small minority of beef farmers continue to use illegal substances. My policy in this area is clearcut; where abuse is encountered evidence is gathered, those involved are prosecuted and every means open to me is pursued to have them brought to justice.</P>
    <P>The measures I have outlined have <Col N="1754" /> resulted in the Irish beef industry being subjected to a higher level of surveillance for residues of illegal growth promoters than any other member state and has enabled my Department to compile a comprehensive record of suspected abusers and target enforcement resources at the small minority who continue to endanger public health and, by their actions, attempt to sabotage this country's economy.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 28 and 71 together.</P>
      <P>The position as regards appeals procedure is set out in the Charter of Rights for Farmers which I launched just after Easter. My intention is to put an appeals unit in place by the end of the summer which will formally deal with appeals against decisions under headage and premium schemes starting from the 1995 campaign. The unit will operate independently of the staff involved in implementing the schemes and the appeals process will include the right to an oral hearing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The arrangements for the staffing of the unit are still under consideration in <Col N="1755" /> the Department as is the matter of appropriate training for the personnel who will be involved. The appeals unit will deal initially with the headage and premium schemes. I will be reviewing the work of the unit after its first year of operation with a view to its extension to all schemes for farmers at the earliest opportunity.</P>
    <P>The appeals unit will build on the informal appeals procedures which already exist in relation to headage and premium schemes and under which appeals against decisions and penalties hinging on late applications as well as other reasons are dealt with.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 29, 45, 49, 58 and 63 together.</P>
      <P>In my announcement of 2 May last, I set out the details of the selection groups for Leader II and their indicative funding allocations. The budget for Leader II is £77 million &mdash; £54 million EU aid, £23 million Irish Exchequer. This represents a 70/30 EU and national financial package in line with all EU Community Initiatives being operated here.</P>
      <P>The eligible categories of expenditure under Leader II are practically the same as for the first programme, namely technical support for rural development, training and recruitment assistance, rural tourism, small firms, craft enterprises and local services and exploitation and marketing of local agricultural, forestry and fishing products.</P>
      <P>The EU Commission has, however, added a further category of activity described as &ldquo;preservation and improvement of the environment and living conditions&rdquo; which includes the renovation and development of villages and the existing architectural heritage, support for cultural products linked to rural development and disposal and recycling of waste.</P>
      <P>My Department will shortly be providing detailed operating guidelines to groups to assist them in the implementation of the new programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my announcement of the Leader II groups I said that arising from my Department's experience of operating Leader I, the independent evaluation of that programme and the Comptroller and Auditor General's recent report of his Value-for-Money Examination, Leader II would be more tightly administered.  I do not regard the additional requirements as excessively bureaucratic.  They should be seen as increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of the <Col N="1757" /> programme, and ensuring transparency in accountability of public funding.</P>
    <P>My Department's staffing costs, both administrative and inspectorate will not be borne on the Leader budget. Technical assistance in the form of improved computerisation facilities and the costs of on-going, independent evaluation will however be borne on the budget, for which purposes £1.5 million has been set aside.</P>

      <P>The provisions governing the age at which animals qualify for the special beef premium are set down in EU Regulations which were agreed as part of the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy in 1992. Any alteration to these provisions would require agreement at the Council of Ministers. The age requirements for the special beef premium are well suited to beef production patterns in Ireland and I do not intend to seek to have them altered.</P>

      <P>My Department has no plans at this time for the development of hemp as a commercial crop. Information on cultivation aspects of the crop is available, and the research <Col N="1758" /> services of Teagasc have grown experimental crops under Irish conditions. There has been no commercial production of the crop in the country.</P>
      <P>The position is that hemp (cannabis) is a controlled drug under the Misuse of Drugs Acts and its cultivation is prohibited except under licence granted by the Minister for Health. Licences could only be granted in cases where sufficient security and control of the crop could be guaranteed.</P>
      <P>There is no processing plant for hemp in the country and the large investment involved could only be justified if an extensive area of raw material crops were available. This would not be feasible because of the control and security requirements.</P>

      <P>The Irish Government made submissions to the EU Commission on the extension of the disadvantaged areas and reclassification of certain areas from less severely to more severely handicapped area status in November 1993 and October 1994 respectively. The Commission asked for clarification of some aspect of the submissions and for some additional information to assist in its examination of the proposals, and our response was transmitted to the Commission on 14 April 1995. I met with Commissioner Fischler in February 1995 to stress the urgency of a decision on these submissions, and he assured me that he will attempt to secure a decision on both extension and reclassification during the first half of 1995. I will be taking the opportunity to have further detailed discussions with Commissioner Fischler when he visits Ireland next week.</P>
      <P>I cannot comment on the contents of the proposals while they are under consideration by the Commission. Once a decision has been reached, I will then have the successful townlands published without delay.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 39 and 211 together. My objective is to maximise efficient production of cereals so that the market price for grain here is not unduly influenced by the price of imported cereals. I regard the eligible land rule as an obstacle in that regard and my immediate priority is to obtain a modification which, at least, will allow the rule to be applied more flexibly. I am actively pursuing this matter with the EU Commission and I have already made a detailed written submission on the subject to Commissioner Fischler.</P>
      <P>I am also seeking a number of changes to the existing provisions on individual base areas (IBAs) so that, if it is necessary to operate such a system, we can do so in a practical and equitable manner. The existing provisions relating to IBAs in EU legislation are not satisfactory.  They do not cater for hardship cases, such as farmers who temporarily ceased production during the qualifying base years, nor do they make any provisions for allocation of base area rights for new entrants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendments which I am seeking include the setting up of a national reserve to cater for such cases. These changes would require the agreement of the Council of Agriculture Ministers. It <Col N="1762" /> is not open to me to introduce national rules which would resolve the difficulties.  I will also need to be satisfied that any revised individual base area rules can be implemented in a way that will ensure that the objective of maximising efficient production can be realised. This is of particular importance in a sector which, in Ireland, is in deficit.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 42 and 56 together. The revised installation aid scheme document and the operational guidelines for applicants have now been circulated to all farm development service offices of my Department. Copies have also been <Col N="1763" /> sent to Teagasc who are making arrangements to circulate them to all Teagasc Offices.</P>
      <P>The operational date of the scheme is to be 1 January 1994, the date from which the retirement scheme operated.</P>
      <P>As part of the review of the scheme carried out by my Department the question of delays in the registration of title was examined. I have been advised by the chief state solicitor that where lands are transferred to the young farmer it is necessary that the title be registered in Land Registry before the premium can be paid.</P>
      <P>However in cases where land is allocated by the Land Commission the matter of vesting of such lands is being addressd by the Land Commission on an ongoing basis and steady progress is being made. Delays have been caused by the necessity to transfer Land Commission staff to arable aid work to which is was necessary to give priority. I expect, however, that the staff in question will be reassigned to Land Commission work in the next few months.</P>
      <P>Schedule numbers are allocated by the Land Registry when the vesting documents are lodged with that office. These numbers are accepted by my Department as proof of ownership and the delay in registration of title in these cases is not a cause of delay in the payment of the premium.</P>

    <P>In relation to retaining quota in the disadvantaged areas, I have already announced that I intend to proceed with arrangements for the ring-fencing of quotas in these areas. In the context of this year's restructuring scheme, quota available for sale in more severely and less severely handicapped areas will be offered firstly to priority category producers located in those areas who are <Col N="1765" /> willing to purchase it. The availability of a subsidy towards such purchase will further contribute positively to the maintenance of milk production in the disadvantaged areas.

However, this figure refers to the income level of all drystock producers, including a substantial number of part-time farmers who have off-farm income. The 1993 <Col N="1766" /> Teagasc survey estimated that the average family farm income of full-time drystock producers in 1993 was approximately £10,000. I should point out that drystock producers generally have benefited considerably from increased premium payments under the 1992 CAP reform package.

      <P>The quota review groups were established pursuant to a commitment in the <i>Programme for Competiveness and Work</i> and membership of the groups consists of representatives of organisations which are party to the programme. I am satisfied that the interests of the producers concerned are adequately represented in the groups. It should also be noted that the groups are consultative in nature and that it is important to have a proper balance between the different interests.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates)</NameTxt>
      <P>The EU Commission has recently adopted a regulation which permits the substitution of eligible land with ineligible land for agronomic, phytosanitary or environmental reasons. Member states are required to submit plans to the Commission each year indicating the total area of land substituted and the measures taken to ensure that the substitution does not result in an increase in the area of eligible land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1768" /> My Department is at present examining the new regulation with a view to deciding on the criteria which can be used to permit substitution, and the circumstances under which the necessary controls on the area limitation requirement can be implemented.</P>
    <P>In the latter regard, the conacre system can give rise to certain difficulties in the short term, particularly where land can be used by different farmers over a period of years. It would be difficult to keep track of individual fields in such situations, in order to ensure that land which loses eligibility in any year is not the subject of a claim for area payments by a different producer in a future year.</P>
    <P>We must provide a satisfactory solution to this problem in order to ensure that our national plan will be accepted by the European Commission, thus providing access to the new arrangement for all producers. The objective is to make the facility as widely available as possible. A statement will be made in advance of this year's autumn sowings.</P>
    <P>While the land substitution facility is a step in the right direction a more satisfactory solution to the eligible land rule is required which would benefit all producers and which would not involve additional regulatory requirements. I have made a submission to Commissioner Fischler on the difficulties arising from the eligible land rule.</P>

      <P>The total quantity of Irish beef, dairy products and cereals in intervention at end of March 1995 was as follows: boneless beef, 23,000 metric tonnes; bone-in beef, 856 metric tonnes: butter, 15,464 metric tonnes; skimmed milk powder, 41,452 metric tonnes: barley, 65,766 metric tonnes.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1769" /> The gross cost to the Exchequer for each of the last three years in relation to the operation of the intervention system for all products, beef, butter, skimmed milk powder and cereals was £55.1 million in 1992, £57 million in 1993 and £39 million in 1994. This includes storage, handling, freezing and transport.  Receipts from Brussels amounted to £36.1 million in 1992, £42.4 million in 1993 and £27.5 million in 1994 leaving a net cost of £19 million, £14.6 million and £11.5 million respectively to the Exchequer.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 66 and 215 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The matters to which the Deputies refer have been the subject of extensive and continuing discussion between the European Commission and the Irish authorities, involving my Department, the Department of Finance and the Office of the Attorney General. The position taken by the Irish authorities in these discussions has been that, in view of the fact that the headage and farm investment grant schemes are non-compulsory for member states, the requirements in relation to tax compliance and <Col N="1772" /> submission of an RSI number are consistent with European Union Law. Failure to meet the requirements in relation to tax compliance will not prevent payments where a farmer meets the conditions of the scheme but it will lead to an examination of the farmer's tax affairs by the Revenue Commissioners. Provision for the transmission of the information required for such an examination has been made in the 1995 Finance Bill. The legal possibilities of offsetting payments against any outstanding tax liability are also being considered.</P>
    <P>All applicants for headage or farm investment grants of £500 or more must supply an RSI number. Submission of an RSI number is essential to properly process an application.</P>
    <P>Experience of the 1994 headage and farm investment schemes is that there was a very high level of compliance by participants in relation to tax clearance arrangements and the provision of RSI numbers.</P>

      <P>I am satisfied with the operation of Irish Thoroughbred Marketing. The establishment of a division within the statutory racing body to promote Ireland as a location to purchase thoroughbred horses was widely welcomed in the industry. The success of its marketing and promotion campaign is well recognised by the major organisations in the horse racing and breeding sectors. I understand that the UK and Australia have established similar bodies in response to the activities of ITM. The promotional work of ITM has contributed to Ireland's share of the main European yearling sales increasing from 22 per cent in 1991 to 33 per cent in 1994; an increased awareness in the UK of Irish bred National Hunt horses; about 900 potential purchasers coming to Ireland each year and the development of new markets in China, Korea, Hong Kong and Taiwan.</P>
      <P>I assume that the second part of the question relates to the financial input to ITM by the private sector. This matter is kept under constant review by my Department. I am satisfied with the relative inputs from the Exchequer and the private sector to date and projected inputs for 1995. These inputs are in accordance with the levels agreed with the Racing Board and its successor the Irish Horseracing Authority.</P>

      <P>I would refer the <Col N="1774" /> Deputy to a reply I gave in February to a similar question where I pointed out that there has been no diminution of ministerial responsibility for food. The present position is that my colleague Minister Deenihan and myself share responsibility for food and this includes the protection of the consumer's right to food which is safe to eat.</P>
      <P>In my Department there is a comprehensive legally based system which has been designed to ensure that the production and processing of farm products for food is carried out to the standard necessary to protect public health. In the application of that system extensive checks are carried out at both farm and factory level and anyone contravening it is dealt with appropriately.</P>

      <P>Forestry training is one of the measures currently being funded under the Operational Programme for Agriculture, Rural <Col N="1776" /> Development and Forestry 1994-1999 and the INTERREG Programme. Funding was also provided in the period 1991-1993 under the previous round of Structural Funds.</P>
      <P>Training programmes are focused directly on the following requirements of the industry:</P>
      <P>1. As farm forestry is a relatively new activity, it is necessary to provide farmers with the skills required to succesfully establish and maintain this new enterprise as they would any other farm activity. This training is being provided by Teagasc in conjunction with my Department. I am currently looking at ways to improve the service provided to farmers in this area.</P>
      <P>2. Timber production will increase by 50 per cent by the end of the decade creating 500 jobs in timber harvesting as well as additional employment in transport and processing. Training for new entrants as well as upgrading skills of existing participants is essential if the forestry sector is to remain competitive. Furthermore, safety training in this sector has significantly reduced the incidence of accidents in what can be a dangerous occupation. This training is being provided in conjunction with Coillte Teo. and training courses are principally targeted at harvesting contractors.</P>
      <P>3. The increase in timber production will provide increased export opportunities for the timber processing industry.  To match these opportunities, there is an identifiable need for the training in marketing of new and existing personnel coming into the industry. This training covers areas such as changing work practices and new developments associated with diverse market needs at home and abroad as well as new European standards. Another aspect of the training provided is to educate specifiers and end users in order to overcome outdated attitudes towards the quality of Irish timber. This training is provided in conjunction with Forbairt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1777" /> I should also point out the vast majority of those trained are either already in employment or enter employment shortly after training.</P>
    <P>It is vital that the training needs of the sector are kept under review in view of the changing needs of the sector. In this regard, I will be reviewing the focus of the training programme in the light of the &ldquo;Strategy for the Development of the Forestry Sector to the year 2015&rdquo; which will be published in the coming months as well as of the changing needs of the industry.</P>

      <P>Arising from the CAP reforms agreed in the EU in 1992 and the increased compensatory payments for farmers which the reforms introduced, member states were obliged to put in place an integrated administration and control system to monitor and control the various payment schemes. As part of the integrated <Col N="1778" /> system, member states are required to introduce by 1 January 1996 an alphanumeric system for the identification of agricultural land parcels. In this context, the Department issued a Notice of Request for Tender for the creation of a Land Parcel Identification System and this was published in the Official Journal of the European Community on Friday 24 February 1995. The closing date for receipt of replies to the Request for Tender was Monday 20 March 1995.</P>
      <P>The replies received are being evaluated at present and it is hoped that a contract for the creation of a Land Parcel Identification System will be signed within a few weeks. The contract will require that a data base for land parcels declared on Area Aid Applications is set up by the end of 1995. It is envisaged that in 1996 and later years farmers will quote in their area aid applications the unique references that will be assigned to their land parcels and will not need to submit maps unless existing parcels are being altered or subdivided or unless parcels which were not previously declared are being included in their applications.</P>

      <P>My Department in conjunction with the European Commission funds an extensive research and development programme covering the various sectors of the forest industry ranging from nursery techniques to end product development of the sawmilling and wood-based panel sectors. Other <Col N="1779" /> bodies such as Coillte Teoranta, the universities and the industry itself also provide funding for research and development.</P>
      <P>I regard expenditure on forestry research as being essential for the future of the sector. This is all the more important given that forestry investment now stands at record levels.</P>
      <P>Forestry research funded by my Department in 1993, the base year used in the recommendation referred to in the question, was £0.925 million. My Department's budget for such expenditure in 1995 is £1.6 million, an increase of more than 70 per cent. With regard to future expenditure in forestry research, as with all areas of Government expenditure, this can only be decided on in the context of the annual Estimates. I will keep this matter under continuous review, although it will be clear from the data I have given that substantial progress has already been made in the area within my control. While I have no role in relation to the overall expenditure by the industry in research, I can assure you that I will be encouraging all parties involved to maximise expenditure on all areas of vital research.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department of Foreign Affairs has commissioned and published two studies in the area of cross-border economic co-operation. The &ldquo;North West Study&rdquo; dealing with the economic development of the Donegal-Derry-Strabane region was published in April 1990. The cost of the study was shared equally between the Irish and British Governments; the Irish Government's share was £69,614 of which 75 per cent was refunded by the European Regional Development Fund.</P>
      <P>A second study, &ldquo;Ireland in Europe: A Shared Challenge&rdquo;, dealing with economic co-operation on the island of Ireland was published in June 1992. The total cost involved, including production and printing costs and fees to consultants commissioned to write individual sectoral chapters, amounted to £58,317.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>More recently, the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs has commissioned the Irish Aid Advisory Commitee to carry out a study on &ldquo;The impact of Ireland's Official Development Assistance on the Irish Economy&rdquo;. This report was presented for discussion in Trinity College on 11 May 1995. The <Col N="1782" /> costs of the study have not yet been finalised.</P>
    <P>The Irish Aid Advisory Committee has also been commissioned to carry out a study on &ldquo;Ireland and the United Nations&rdquo; which is expected to be finalised by June of this year. The cost of this report is not yet known.</P>
    <P>In the course of the normal activities of the Irish aid programme, reports for the purposes of appraising and monitoring individual aid projects are undertaken by consultants on an ongoing basis. These reports are for internal use only and the costs are absorbed within the budget for each individual project. Details of these reports are available in Annex 16 of the Irish Aid Programme annual reports, copies of which are available from the Dáil Library.</P>
    <P>Since its establishment in January 1993, the Office of the Tánaiste has not commissioned any reports from outside agencies. The office is currently in the process of commissioning a report for the Task Force on Long-term Unemployment on employment options for the long term unemployed. Final details in this regard are not yet concluded.</P>

      <P>The company concerned has a licence from the Revenue Commissioners to manufacture spirit drinks. One of the drinks that they manufacture for export is described as &ldquo;poteen&rdquo;. I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that it is their policy to object to the distribution in the State of products so described. The reasons for this include the strong association of the name &ldquo;poteen&rdquo; with illicitly distilled spirits and the confusion that use of the term would give rise to the public mind as to the duty status of such spirits.</P>

      <P>In the 1992 General Election the total cost of administering the special voters' system was approximately £3,200 and the total cost of administering the postal voting system was approximately £4,500. Because a Referendum was held in conjucntion with this General Election, some of the costs were common costs and the figures attributed to the General Election are, of necessity, estimates.</P>
      <P>In the 1994 European Election, based on figures to hand, the cost of administering the special voters system was £4,329 and the total cost of administering the postal voting system was £5,311. Figures have not yet been received from three local returning officers and my Department has asked them to expedite same.</P>

      <P>I am aware of allegations in a newspaper article to the effect that &ldquo;fake tax clearance certificates&rdquo; are being sold by officials. I understand from the Revenue Commissioners that the journalist involved contacted them prior to publication of the article and gave them as much information as she felt was possible.  However, no evidence was supplied to them, such as the names of the officers alleged to have been involved or the tax districts. Neither was the information supplied of a kind that would readily enable the Revenue Commissioners to identify them.</P>
      <P>All allegations of irregularities within their area of operation are investigated by the Revenue Commissioners and taken very seriously by them. In this case, an urgent internal inquiry commenced immediately the allegations were made and is ongoing but, to date, no evidence has been discovered in support of the allegations. The Deputy will, of course, appreciate the difficulties inherent in conducting an investigation into unsubstantiated allegations in relation to unnamed persons.</P>

      <P>I am precluded by EU VAT law from removing VAT from adult clothing and footwear. It would be possible, under EU rules, to apply a reduced rate to adult clothing and footwear, provided it is not less than 12 per cent. Our current reduced rate is 12.5 per cent; if applied to adult clothing and footwear, the estimated cost to the Exchequer would be £84 million in a full year. Given this very significant budgetary impact, I have no plans to reduce the VAT rate on adult clothing and footwear.</P>

      <P>Commission approval for the second Ireland-Northern Ireland INTERREG programme was announced on 27 February last. The programme provides for a monitoring committee representative of the various interests involved which includes Commission representatives, implementing Departments and representatives of other relevant interests such as the new Border Regional Authority.  As under the first INTERREG <Col N="1791" /> programme, the monitoring committee is charged, among other things, with ensuring that the programme is complementary with and in addition to other operational programmes and initiatives. The sectoral working groups for the measures under the programme, which report directly to the monitoring committee, are charged with ensuring the maximum level of co-operation between the various relevant development agencies on both sides of the Border.</P>
      <P>Additional EU funding is also being provided to support the Northern Ireland peace process. Formal adoption of the initiative is expected shortly and the operational programme is expected to be approved later in the year. In drawing up the programme the two administrations are paying particular attention to ensuring full complementarity with INTERREG and other programmes relevant to the Border region, including the International Fund for Ireland.</P>
      <P>In the tourism area one of the measures already introduced to help generate new business is the £6.3 million overseas tourism marketing initiative, which represents an entirely additional promotional effort to increase consumer awareness of Ireland. It is a private sector led consumer marketing campaign, which will promote the island of Ireland as a single destination in our four most important markets, namely the US, Britain, Germany and France. For the first time, the tourism industry on both sides of the Border, together with Bord Fáilte and the Northern Ireland Tourist Board, under the chairmanship of the Department of Tourism and Trade are participating in the initiative and are selling the island of Ireland as an attractive holiday location. This initiative, coupled with the existing promotional work being undertaken by the two tourist boards, will deliver additional tourism business to the whole island in 1995.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Both tourist boards, together with trade partners, are currently implementing a new joint consumer <Col N="1792" /> advertising programme in Holland which has been identified as a key emerging European market, because of its direct access by air to both the North and the South.</P>
    <P>A new initiative, aimed specifically at marketing Ireland's wide and diverse range of historical and cultural attractions in the British and Dutch markets, is being developed through the tourist boards in co-operation for the first time with the Irish Heritage Properties Association, the National Trust in Northern Ireland and the Hidden Ireland organisation. In addition, it is planned to support &ldquo;Heritage Island&rdquo;, the private marketing group, in encouraging British coach and tour operators, who do not at present access the island of Ireland, to offer all-island heritage tour packages.</P>
    <P>Two specific tourism activities have also been identified as suitable for joint promotion. The product marketing group &ldquo;Equestrian Ireland&rdquo; will be encouraged to extend its 1996 portfolio of tourist riding establishments to Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>A coarse angling marketing programme is also planned involving Fermanagh and Dungannon district councils and the North West Regional Tourism Organisation in partnership with guest houses and bed and breakfast establishments.</P>
    <P>North/South tourism co-operation is reviewed regularly at the Anglo-Irish Conference and during separate bilateral ministerial meetings and consultations.  It is hoped that a number of other general and regional marketing initiatives can be developed by the tourist boards in association with public and private sector partnerships during the course of the year.</P>

      <P>I have been advised by the Central Bank, which is responsible for printing and issuing banknotes, that the paper specification for the current series of notes is higher than that for the previous series and is similar to that of banknotes in other EU countries. The bank also confirms that adequate supplies of new notes are available to replace notes whose quality has deteriorated. However, the bank is aware that there is a particular problem with the condition of the £5 notes in circulation. Consultations are being held with the main banking and retail organisations to identify what further action can be taken to get notes out of circulation when their quality has become unacceptable.</P>
      <P>I would also add that the question of the durability and quality of banknotes is kept under constant review by the Central Bank.</P>

      <P>I have no plans to introduce a State provided wage or specific tax allowance for <Col N="1794" /> women working in the home. I would draw to the Deputy's attention that the Irish income tax code already favours married couples where one spouse is working full-time in the home. The tax code allows a married couple to be taxed as a single unit rather than as two separate individuals. A married couple is permitted to transfer allowances and tax bands between each other, thereby providing the unit with double allowances and bands. This arrangement can considerably reduce a couple's tax liability, especially where one spouse is working full-time in the home.</P>

      <P>Parents with a child who is permanently incapacitated by reason of mental or physical infirmity are entitled to claim, in addition to the normal income tax allowances, the incapacitated child allowance of up to £600. This allowance is reduced pound for pound for any income the child has in his/her own right in excess of £2,100. The following table sets out the amount of the allowance in each of the last 20 years as requested by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>As regards medical expenses parents may also, of course, claim tax relief in respect of non-reimbursable medical expenses in excess of £200 incurred in any year in respect of their family, including dependent children up to the age of 16, or up to 21 years of age if the child is in full-time education. Relief may also be available in the case of incapacitated children over the age of 21 who are fully dependent on their parents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is the Government's policy to continue the process of tax reform which is to concentrate available resources on <Col N="1795" /> reducing the tax burden on income earners, especially in the case of low income earners with children. This policy has been financed by way of broadening the tax base and curtailing discretionary income tax reliefs. In line with this policy the incapacitated child allowance, among a number of other small reliefs, has not been increased in recent years. In addition, it is considered that the income tax code is not the most effective or appropriate vehicle for making provision for the special needs of incapacitated persons. I believe that the legitimate needs of disabled persons can best be addressed through the direct expenditure system where such needs can be more accurately assessed by trained professionals and addressed wherever appropriate.</P>

        <i>Limerick East):</i> The long-term illness scheme entitles persons who suffer from certain specified illness to free drugs and medicines which are prescribed in respect of the particular illnesses and there are no plans to extend the number of illnesses covered by the scheme.</P>
      <P>The long-term illness scheme, however, is only one of a number of schemes in operation which provide assistance towards the cost of prescribed drugs and medicines for persons with ongoing medical conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where an individual or a family is subjected to a significant level of ongoing expenditure on medical expenses &mdash; general practitioner fees, prescribed drugs etc. &mdash; due to a long-term medical condition these expenses may be <Col N="1799" /> reckoned in determining eligibility for a medical card. In some cases a medical card may issue to a family member on a personal basis. Eligibility for a medical card is solely a matter for the chief executive officer of the relevant health board to decide.</P>
    <P>Persons who suffer from an ongoing medical condition can avail of the drug cost subsidisation scheme which caters for people who do not have a medical card or long-term illness book and are certified as having a long-term medical condition with a regular and ongoing requirement for prescribed drugs and medicines in excess of an amount per month, currently £32.</P>
    <P>Persons who qualify for inclusion in this scheme will not have to spend more than £32 in any month on prescribed medication. Under the drug refund scheme which covers expenditure by the whole family, any expenditure on prescribed medication above £90 in a calendar quarter is refunded by the health board.</P>
    <P>The information on expenditure on anti-asthmatic drugs available to the Department relates to the general medical services scheme which covers medical card patients. The total 1994 expenditure in respect of anti-asthmatic drugs in the general medical services scheme was £10.7 million. This figure, however, may include expenditure on drugs for persons who do not have asthma but require certain products that are categorised as anti-asthmatic drugs.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that appropriate and comprehensive support is being provided by the State through the existing range of drug schemes to those with medical expenses arising from conditions such as asthma.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> I propose to take Questions Nos. 110 to 112, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>It is not general policy to undertake routine screening of patients for the presence of E. Coli 0157 and incidences of infection by the micro-organism are not routinely reported to my Department.  I understand, however, that a certain amount of information about the presence of E. Coli 0157 is contained in returns made under the National Hospital In-patient Enquiry File (HIPE). This information is not immediately to hand but I am making arrangements to have it extracted and forwarded directly to the Deputy.</P>
      <P>The food safety advisory committee has issued a report (No. 18, June, 1994) on this matter. This report considered, <i>inter alia</i>, the sources of the infection and suggested preventive measures. Pursuant to that report, all health boards have been instructed to alert their control offices to the risks posed by E. Coli 0157, with particular emphasis on the cooking of minced meat and hamburgers.</P>

        <i>Limerick East):</i> I understand the person in question was placed on the Mater Hospital's waiting list on 17 February 1995 and at this time the hospital is not able to give an exact date of admission. The scheduling of surgery is a matter for the clinical judgment of the consultant concerned, is based solely on the patient's condition and not on the length of time on the waiting list. Emergency cases are given priority. The patient's general practitioner should, accordingly, keep the consultant informed on a regular basis of the patient's condition.</P>

      <P>St. Clare's Unit in the Children's Hospital, Temple Street deals with the investigation and management of cases of suspected child sexual abuse. It provides a 9 a.m.-5 p.m. service for children and families and emergency cover is also provided where appropriate.</P>
      <P>The staffing level of the unit consists of:&mdash; one consultant child-adolescent psychiatrist: one senior clinical psychologist; one clinical psychologist; one senior social worker; two social workers; one grade IV secretary; two grade III secretaries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The majority of referrals to St. Clare's Unit comes via the Eastern Health Board social work teams which cover the Inner City, North city and North <Col N="1802" /> County of Dublin. In some circumstances, they provide second opinions for agencies from around the country.</P>
    <P>Upon referral, patients are offered within two days an appointment with a member of the staff of the unit to arrange an assessment. Physical examinations take place approximately twice a month in the unit, except in emergencies where there is an immediate service from the hospital casualty unit. The normal waiting period for assessment for non-emergency cases is four to six weeks. While waiting for the assessment, all families can avail of the social work service of the Eastern Health Board. Also, staff of the unit are available to answer any queries that may arise.</P>
    <P>On average, about 300 children per annum are referred to the unit and approximately 225 of these are seen for assessment. The assessment of a child usually involves three visits to the unit. I understand that in the last three months, the unit has taken an average of 20 new referrals per month and an additional 30 children per month have attended for their second and third appointments.</P>
    <P>The ongoing requirements of St. Clare's Unit are regularly reviewed by my Department in the light of the demands placed on it and in the context of developing child abuse treatment services in Dublin in preparation for the implementation of the remaining provisions of the Child Care Act, 1991.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1804" /> The budget for occupational therapy services is comprehended in the overall funding of para-medical services, whether it is in a specialist unit in hospital or part of a community care programme at health board level. The average waiting period to be seen by an occupational therapist would vary considerably depending on the level of priority need attached to the case. Detailed information of this nature is recorded at health board level but is not collected by my Department.</P>
    <P>As certain services are developed, there will be a need to increase the number of occupational therapists and this will be done as and when resources permit.</P>
    <P>Additional funding, for example, has been provided since 1993 to develop services for people with physical disabilities.  From this funding, £96,000 was allocated in 1993 and £240,000 in 1994 for occupational therapy services, resulting in the creation of 16 full-time and two part-time posts nationwide. An additional revenue allocation of £2 million has been made in 1995 and it is expected that a proportion of this will be devoted to further improvements in occupational therapy services.</P>
    <P>The review group on services for people with a physical or sensory disability, which is due to report to me within the next few months, will make recommendations for the development of physical disability services, including occupational therapy services.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Howlin) Brendan Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The EU Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive specifies different timeframes for the upgrading of treatment facilities according to size of population discharge and the quality of receiving waters. The most significant deadline is end-year 2000 which will apply to all discharges with a population equivalent in excess of 15,000. This covers all major cities and towns, including Dublin/Ringsend, Cork, Limerick, Waterford, Galway, Dundalk, Drogheda, Clonmel and Wexford.</P>
      <P>A deadline of the year 2005 will apply for provision of secondary treatment for all discharges with a population equivalent between 2,000 and 15,000 discharging to freshwaters and estuaries, and for all coastal discharges between 10,000 and 15,000 population equivalent.</P>
      <P>In addition, more stringent treatment than secondary (in the form of nutrient reduction facilities) will be required by end-1998 for all discharges in excess of 10,000 population equivalent into any of the ten sensitive areas which have been identified in Ireland for the purposes of the Directive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1814" /> In accordance with the Directive, my Department has prepared an implementation programme for submission to the European Commission. This involves some 95 treatment and some 60 collection schemes and an estimated expenditure covering the 11 years to end-2005 of some £1.2 billion.</P>
    <P>Implementation of the Directive will involve a major financial commitment for Ireland as for all EU member states. Appropriate EU co-financing will be availed of for this purpose. I am satisfied that significant improvements in water quality generally will result throughout the country, including County Wexford, as a result of the investment.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 132 and 145 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Drinking water quality standards are at present prescribed by the European Communities (Quality of Water Intended for Human Consumption) Regulations, 1988. Monitoring and enforcement in relation to these standards is for the sanitary authority concerned, subject to reporting of information to the Environmental Protection <Col N="1815" /> Agency. The agency co-ordinates an annual report and assessment on drinking water quality.</P>
    <P>Where the monitoring of a private water supply indicates that the water quality does not meet the requirements of the 1988 regulations, the sanitary authority is obliged to notify the person or persons responsible for the supply as soon as practicable of the measures which should be taken to improve the quality of the water.</P>
    <P>My Department provides capital grants for improvement both of public water supply schemes and of private group water schemes. In the case of group schemes, general advice on design and engineering of works is available to groups from my Department's inspectors. In addition, my Department has published a leaflet entitled &ldquo;Private Water Supplies: Focus on Quality&rdquo; which has been widely circulated and is available from county council offices.</P>
    <P>As regards maintenance of drinking water quality in public schemes, my Department issued relevant guidelines to local authorities in 1986 and in 1992; the latter focus in particular on preventing and responding promptly to contamination.</P>

      <P>The assignment of staff to manage water and sewage treatment plants is a matter for individual local authority managers in the first instance. <Col N="1816" /> Following proposals from a number of local authorities, my Department has approved technician level posts for the management of new plants.</P>
      <P>The qualifications for local authority officers in the general Draughtsman/ Technician structure are under review and are currently the subject of discussions between management and staff interests. I also understand that the staff side have sought a review of the Draughtsman/Technician structure.</P>
      <P>My Department is represented on a national steering committee (comprising also representatives of local authorities, Environmental Protection Agency and FÁS) which has provided local authorities with a professional training course to be run in-house for water and waste water operative caretaker staff. A national assessment and certification scheme which has been piloted in nine counties aims to enable each caretaker in water and waste water operations to have his/her level of competency assessed and certified by reference to a uniform national standard.</P>

      <P>The Cork city main drainage scheme is intended to complete the sewage collection network for Cork city and provide secondary treatment facilities, thereby eliminating the current discharge of untreated sewage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Cork Corporation is at present seeking planning permission from An Bord <Col N="1817" /> Pleanála for the project. Preliminary estimates at this stage indicate costs in the region of £96 million; accurate costings will not be possible until preparation of the scheme is more advanced. Cohesion Fund assistance of £2.5 million has been approved by the European Commission in respect of the initial planning costs of the scheme. Additional Cohesion Fund assistance for the construction costs would be the subject of a further application to the EU Commission at the appropriate time.</P>
    <P>As is the case with other major water or sewerage schemes, my Department is involved in assessing financial requirements and in seeking appropriate EU co-financing.</P>

      <Quest>the source of his information for the statement contained in his reply to Parliamentary Question No. 3 of 27 April 1995, that phosphate-free products represent about 40 per cent of overall domestic consumption of washing powders and liquids; if he will give comparative figures for previous years; if he will publish figures to show the quantities in use and trends in use of such substances by agriculture and industry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The data concerned was generated by the Irish Detergent and Allied Products Association in the context of discussions with my Department on a voluntary agreement to increase use of phosphate-free products. Total domestic and commercial usage of detergents and household cleaners (including powder and liquid fabric washing products) is currently estimated at some 46,000 tonnes per annum, of which 26,000 tonnes is phosphate-free. By comparison, in 1988, some 34,000 tonnes of such products were used, 14,000 tonnes of which were phosphate-free.</P>
      <P>Domestic powder and liquid washing fabric products are by far the biggest single source of phosphates from detergents.  These are accordingly the main target for improvement: an estimated 12,000 tonnes (40 per cent of the total) of such products are now phosphate-free compared with none in 1988.</P>
      <P>Detailed figures on the quantities and trends in use of phosphate-free detergents in agriculture or industry are not available; usage of phosphate-based detergents in these sectors is believed to be low.</P>

      <P>It is well known that the careless disposal of packaging and other types of waste can have a significant detrimental effect on the environment in terms of the adverse visual impact of litter. Many types of litter, including plastic bags, can also cause injury and distress to marine and bird life. Information and comment on the adverse effects of various types of litter is contained in various publications, including <Col N="1832" /> the reports of surveys of coastal areas carried out by Coastwatch Europe. The quality status report on maritime areas, which will be prepared under the auspices of the Oslo/Paris Commission and will, <i>inter alia</i>, cover the Irish Sea and the Celtic Sea, will include an assessment of the impact of garbage on the marine environment.</P>
      <P>A number of reports have been commissioned by my Department in relation to packaging waste generally. Regarding plastic bags specifically, I refer to the replies to Question No. 84 of 6 April 1995 and Question No. 60 of 9 May 1995. These make it clear that appropriate measures to deal with this form of packaging will be considered in the context of the further implementation of the Government's recycling strategy, to which an industry task force is currently responding, and of the Waste Bill which I intend to publish shortly.</P>

      <P>Information in the form requested is not available in my Department. Assessments of the number of homeless persons carried out by local authorities in March 1991 and March 1993 showed, respectively, totals of 2,751 and 2,667 homeless persons, excluding individual homeless persons under the age of 18 years the accommodation of whom is the responsibility of health boards under the Child Care Act, 1991. Neither assessment included a breakdown of the numbers of homeless people on a gender or age basis.</P>
      <P>Local authorities are responsible for the accommodation of homeless persons and for monitoring the position in relation to homelessness in their area. My Department provides capital funding through the capital assistance scheme for the provision of accommodation for homeless people by voluntary bodies in addition to housing provided by local authorities under their housing programmes. My Department also recoups 90 per cent of local authorities' expenditure under section 10 of the Housing Act, 1988 on the accommodation of homeless people.</P>

      <P>Under electoral law, responsibility for the conduct of elections and referenda, including the selection of premises to be used as polling stations and count centres, is vested in returning officers. I have no information on the number of such premises which are accessible to people in wheelchairs.</P>
      <P>At each election and referendum, my Department advises returning officers, as far as possible to select for use as polling stations premises which are accessible by persons with disabilities and, where appropriate and practicable, to consider the provision of temporary ramps. Following discussions with the National Rehabilitation Board last year, my Department issued more detailed advice to returning officers in relation to selecting and making polling stations accessible to voters with disabilities.</P>
      <P>An elector with a disability who has difficulty in gaining access to his-her own polling station may apply to have his-her vote transferred to a more accessible polling station in the same constituency or local electoral area. An elector who is unable to travel to vote, due to physical disability, may apply for registration as a special voter and vote at home.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 164 and 165 together.</P>
      <P>There is no specific financial provision at present in the vocational training opportunity scheme for assisting participants with child-care. However vocational education committees may provide assistance, where possible, within the funding available to them for general non-pay costs for the scheme. Some vocational education committees do so having regard to local circumstances.</P>
      <P>At the centre where the person concerned in the question is participating in VTOS, crèche facilities are provided in the morning. Because of lack of demand the vocational education committee has not found it practicable to provide such facilities in the afternoon. It has the situation under review. The position concerning child care for participants in VTOS generally is being kept under review in my Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Ms Bhreathnach)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that the school in question has applied for inclusion in the disadvantaged areas <Col N="1845" /> scheme. Schools are selected for inclusion in this scheme on the basis of priority of need as reflected by a range of socio-economic indicators. Factors taken into account include the incidence of unemployment, local authority housing and medical card holders among the parents of the children concerned. Account is also taken of the views of my Department's inspectorate on the relative levels of need between schools and the prevailing pupil-teacher ratio. A total of 54 primary schools have been included in the disadvantaged areas scheme in the current school year. The school referred to by the Deputy did not rate high enough on the priority list for inclusion on that occasion.</P>
      <P>I have commissioned the Combat Poverty Agency to conduct a detailed study of current approaches to the identification and support of pupils in disadvantaged areas. The criteria used to determine eligibility for inclusion in the disadvantaged areas scheme will be among the matters covered by the study. I expect to receive a report on the outcome of this study by the middle of this year and this will provide a basis for the development of future approaches in this area.</P>
      <P>The needs of the school referred to by the Deputy will be considered in the context of any expansion of the disadvantaged areas scheme being undertaken.</P>

      <P>The vehicles used in the school transport scheme meet all statutory regulations as required by the Department of the Environment. Safety of operation is a priority consideration which is evidenced by Bus Éireann's excellent safety record. Vehicles operated by private contractors are subject to an annual roadworthiness check and to regular inspection to ensure that their reliability is maintained throughout the year. Bus Éireann is also committed to providing the best overall standard of comfort possible, having regard to the resources available to support the school transport system as a whole.</P>
      <P>Since 1988 a programme has been in operation to replace Department of Education-funded school buses. To date, Bus Éireann has introduced 140 replacement buses to the school transport fleet. Another 370 replacement buses have been acquired and it is intended to have the &ldquo;yellow&rdquo; school buses fully replaced within the next two years.</P>

      <P>As I recently announced. I intend to allocate an additional 55 <Col N="1847" /> remedial teacher posts to the primary school sector in 1995. These posts will be allocated on the basis of priority of need following the collection and analysis of data from primary schools by my Department's primary inspectorate. The needs of all schools will be considered in the context of this allocation. An additional 100 remedial teaching posts were allocated to primary schools in the 1994-95 school year bringing the total number of remedial teachers in place in the primary sector to 1,133.</P>
      <P>As far as psychological assessment services in primary schools are concerned, I have begun the extension of such services on a phased basis. Ten additional psychologists are being recruited this year, nine of whom have taken up their appointments since the end of February 1995. They have begun to develop psychological services to primary schools in parts of Dublin, Cork and Limerick. Priority is being given to schools serving disadvantaged areas. A further group of ten psychologists will be recruited later this year in order to continue the extension of the psychological service to primary schools.</P>

      <P>In 1991, my Department engaged in a research contract with the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) valued at £102,000 to be paid over the years 1991, 1992 and 1993. As part of this contract, the ESRI researched two main project areas; a computer based modelling of the tax liabilities and social welfare entitlements of households, and the duration and dynamics of poverty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The ESRI has used the model to research a number of areas of interest to my Department including the family income supplement scheme and this was published by the ESRI in January of this year under the title &ldquo;Supplementing Family Income&rdquo;. The report on the dynamics of poverty was published by the ESRI in December 1994. A national survey and research programmes on income distribution, poverty and social <Col N="1857" /> services have been commissioned in 1994 at a cost of £150,000.</P>

    <P>In addition, my Department is involved in the production of reports by <i>ad hoc</i> groups of public servants and outside experts to examine and make recommendations on policy issues. Costings are not available of these activities.</P>
    <P>As part of its ongoing business, my Department from time to time engages consultancy assistance principally to assist in the development of the computer systems aimed at modernising service delivery and to provide analysis of specific organisational issues. Most consultancies relate to technical and/or management support with projects that are designed to improve the delivery of the services of my Department.</P>

      <P>Social welfare law provides that property not personally used or enjoyed, such as a second house, must be taken into account when assessing a person's means. Effectively this means taking the market value of the property and applying a yearly value to it as if it were a sum of money. The same assessment applies whether or not there is a rental income from the property. In the case of the person concerned, who is in receipt of unemployment assistance, it has been established, following a review of his entitlement, that he owns a second house valued at £20,000. A report on this matter has been prepared and a decision on the case will be made as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>The present rules in relation to the assessment of the value of property for means test purposes are quite specific. I am, however, considering changes in the provisions for the assessment of means. This would include disregarding, in certain circumstances, the capital value of property where the property is not personally used for a limited period, for example through illness. I will be bringing forward proposals in this regard later this year.</P>

      <P>Child dependant increases are payable in respect of all children up to the age of 18 years. Where a claimant is in receipt of a long term social welfare payment child dependant allowances are payable where children are in fulltime education up to the age of 22 years. This is in recognition of the fact that <Col N="1859" /> families with children on long term payments face a higher risk of poverty.</P>
      <P>Any proposal to extend the age at which child dependant allowances are payable with short term payment, such as disability benefit and occupational injury benefit, would have expenditure implications and could only be considered in the context of the budget.</P>

      <P>The evidence given by an assistant principal officer in my Department in a recent court case referred to yields as recorded in commercial documentation seized in the meat plant concerned. It was clear from other evidence given that the beef in question was not deboned in accordance with the prescribed intervention specification.  Technical advice and the results of controlled trials indicate that, when that specification is adhered to a yield of 68 to 69 per cent is what is achievable from the normal mix of cattle offered for intervention in Ireland.</P>

      <P>The six sheep dips containing organophosphates shown hereunder are approved under the Sheep Dipping Order, 1965 (S.I. No. 105 of 1965). Approval of a sheep dip indicates that the product has met my Department's criteria as regards efficacy against sheep scab. Since 1 January, 1987, all veterinary medicinal products, including sheep dips, must be evaluated by the National Drugs Advisory Board (NDAB) in accordance with the European Communities (Veterinary Medicinal Products) Regulations, 1986 (S.I. No. 22 of 1986). Under these regulations manufacturers are required to satisfy the NDAB as to the safety, quality and efficacy of their products. Assessment of safety takes account, not only of the effect on the target animal, but also of (a) the safety of the product from the point of view of consumers of produce derived from treated animals and (b) the risks to persons who handle or administer the product. If it has been refused authorisation by the NDAB a dip will automatically become ineligible for inclusion in my Department's list of approved sheep dips.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department has been made aware of complaints of ill health attributed to the usage of organophosphate dips. I understand that the Department of Health has requested a full report from the NDAB on products which contain organophosphates. I await the outcome of this report in order that my Department may take appropriate action in due course. My Department has always advised flockowners to observe the manufacturer's instructions in the use of these products. There are <Col N="1864" /> inherent risks in using all chemical and pharmaceutical substances. Even when a product has been authorised, the onus remains on the user to observe carefully the specified directions and precautions so as to ensure safe use of the preparation in question.</P>
    <P>Sheep scab is a very distressing disease and no affected sheep should be left untreated. In the absence of alternatives there was, therefore, no option but to use the approved dips to eradicate outbreaks of the disease. The countrywide compulsory dipping of sheep was discontinued in 1994 as a result of which there has been a marked reduction in the use of dips. This trend should accelerate with the arrival of injectible treatments on the market. One such product has been approved by the NDAB and another is currently being considered for approval.</P>
    <P>The Investigation into the Environmental Effects of Sheep Dip referred to is primarily a matter for the attention of the Department of the Environment. The departmental record does not indicate the receipt of representations from the Pesticide Action and Legal Network but there have been representations from concerned individuals about the use of sheep dips. I have not sought legal advice in the matter as I have statutory responsibility for the health and welfare of sheep and I must accordingly allow and require treatment in the case of a scab outbreak.</P>

      <P>Measures designed to promote the development of seed potato production are already in place. On the plant health side a provision was negotiated, within the EU regime, under which Ireland is a designated high grade seed potato growing area and protected zone status is allocated for certain plants and plant products including seed potatoes. These measures recognise the relatively high plant health status of this country.</P>
      <P>My Department operates a seed certification scheme for the production of high quality seed potatoes. It arranges for the provision of pre-basic seed, conducts a range of potato variety trials aimed at identifying the best performing varieties under Irish conditions and for export and makes such varieties available to growers. Teagasc operates a potato breeding programme and provides a comprehensive advisory service to potato growers. An Bord Glas promotes the development of the potato sector and has prepared a development programme for seed potatoes.</P>
      <P>Financial aid is available to the seed potato sector under the Operational Programme for Agriculture, Rural Development and Forestry (OPARDF) towards the formation and administration costs of seed potato producer groups and towards investment in improved storage facilities and storage related equipment.</P>
      <P>There are favourable indications that these measures are showing beneficial results. For example, there was an increase in the acreage of foundation and super-elite stock grown for certification in 1994 over 1993. New initiatives such as the promotion of minituber potatoes are being pursued in An Bord Glas's development programme. There has also been a satisfactory take-up of investment aid under the OPARDF which indicates confidence within the industry.</P>

      <P>The operational programme for agriculture, rural development and forestry sets out the priority categories for the EU Structural Funds allocated to my Department under the Community Support Framework (CSF) of EU Structural Fund assistance for Ireland 1994-99.</P>
      <P>These priorities include headage premia, farm pollution control, improvement of dairy hygiene facilities, and various rural development measures. Considerable resources have in the past been put into land improvement activities.  As these activities could not be considered a priority category it has not been possible to provide funds to cater for further land reclamation measures.</P>
      <P>Farmers who have already taken out farm plans under the farm improvement programme which include investment in land reclamation will be able to complete these works under the scheme.</P>

The absence of visible lesions in a reactor animal at post-mortem examination does not mean that the animal is not infected with the tuberculosis organism.  Lesions disclosed in the host animal merely indicate that the disease has progressed to an advanced stage.</P>

This represents an investment by farmers of over £400 million. A further £96 million will be allocated to farmers in the next four years for pollution control work.</P>
      <P>My Department has also introduced the rural environmental protection scheme (REPS) which requires participating farmers to have a waste management and fertilization plan drawn up for their farm. My Department with the Department of the Environment has also drawn up a code of practice dealing with the storage and handling of farm wastes under the Nitrates Directive.</P>

      <P>The ring-fencing of milk quota within the disadvantaged areas has already been introduced in the context of the milk quota restructuring scheme. Milk quota which becomes available under that scheme in the more severely and less severely handicapped areas is now reallocated on a priority basis to small scale milk producers in those same areas. This new element in the restructuring scheme proved to be successful in retaining quota in the disadvantaged areas and I have, therefore, decided to include this provision again in the 1995 scheme.</P>
      <P>I have also decided to proceed with a more general ring-fencing measure aimed at maintaining milk production in the disadvantaged areas, and legislation for the introducing of this is presently at an advanced stage of preparation.</P>

      <P>The improvement of safety levels at accommodation level crossings on privately owned land is a matter for the board and management of CIE and Iarnród Éireann.</P>
      <P>Iarnród Éireann is fully aware of the safety requirements of such level crossings and improvements are being made on an ongoing basis to ensure their safe use. These improvements consist of resurfacing, cutting back growth and excavating embankments to maintain and improve views, the installation of cattle grids where required, the provision of warning signs, widening crossings to allow machinery to cross more quickly and maintaining crossing gates to ensure ease of opening and closing and to ensure that they provide a secure stock-proof barrier.</P>
      <P>Iarnród Éireann is currently producing an explanatory booklet on the safe use of accommodation crossings and it is its intention to visit every crossing user to discuss the contents of the booklet.  These visits will be used to discuss any land owner's particular problems, to investigate whether crossings can be closed and to identify any improvements which can make the use of crossings safer for the users.</P>
      <P>Where closure is feasible it is carried out by means of a legal agreement following full consultation with the land owner concerned and-or his legal representative.  In all cases involving closure, appropriate agreed compensation is made available. In some cases agreed alternative means of access are provided, for example, by building access roadways, negotiating rights of way over adjoining land and in some limited cases providing underpasses.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 226 and 227 together.</P>
      <P>The Government is strongly committed to the optimum development of the leisure and recreational potential of Dún Laoghaire Harbour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1889" /> The essential base technical information, including detailed site investigation and comprehensive wave analysis, to facilitate the installation of marine facilities has been completed. The information obtained from these studies has been made available to interested parties.</P>
    <P>Comprehensive consultations, through the recreational committee of the Dún Laoghaire Harbour Board, with harbour users and other interested parties, have elicited a number of potential development and recreational projects. The financial viability of some of these projects is being professionally assessed at the moment.</P>
    <P>If these projects prove to be technically and financially viable and attract a reasonable degree of support, my Department will do everything in its power to facilitate their progression to the planning stage.</P>
    <P>For the information of the Deputy both the Minister of State, Deputy Eamon Gilmore, and I recently met with the commodores of the main yacht clubs to hear their views on any proposals.</P>
