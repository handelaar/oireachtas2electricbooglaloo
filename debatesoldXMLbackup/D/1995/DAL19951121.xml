      <asker>Mr. O'Dea</asker>
      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Taoiseach</askee>
      <Quest>the person who decides on the circumstances in which a Government Minister who becomes involved in legal proceedings should be indemnified by the taxpayer for any costs incurred or damages awarded; if he will give details of these circumstances; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Where a Government Minister is involved in legal proceedings which arise through the exercise of his duties, no question of indemnity arises as any judgment given against the Minister would be effectively against the corporate person and thus becomes a State debt to be discharged in due course. However, if a Government Minister is involved in legal proceedings which do not arise through the exercise of his duties, it is difficult to imagine a request for an indemnity at all.  Nevertheless, if an indemnity was sought by a Government Minister involved in legal proceedings and there was any doubt as to whether these arose through the exercise of his duties, any legal advice on the <Col N="858" /> giving, or non-giving, of the indemnity might be clarified by the Attorney General for the benefit of the Minister for Finance who vets all public expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Taoiseach if the criteria have been published?  The granting of indemnity to a Minister involved in court proceedings potentially exposes the taxpayer to payments of perhaps hundreds of thousands of pounds.  Does he agree that the criteria should be made public or does the exposure of the taxpayer depend on a nod and wink arrangement?  Has agreement been reached to indemnify a member of the Government in respect of court proceedings in which he or she may be involved?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards the second part of the question, no decision has been taken to grant indemnity to any member of the Government and no application for same has been made.  As regards the first part of the question, I have set out the criteria in my reply to the Deputy's question today.  Where proceedings arise, the position is that consideration is given to whether the alleged action is taken by a Minister in the exercise of his duties.  A decision is made by the Government having regard to the facts of the case and having received the legal advice of the Attorney General and of the Minister for Finance in so far as the public expenditure implications are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach said that the issue depends on whether the Minister is acting in the exercise of his duties. Does he envisage a situation arising in which a Minister would libel somebody in the exercise of his duties?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not engage in a process of speculation about matters. As I have already indicated, the criteria are clear.  In order for the Minister to be covered as a corporate person or corporation sole, the matter must come within his area of responsibility and the <Col N="859" /> action must be taken by him in the exercise of his duties.  No application for indemnity has been made at this stage. I have given a complete answer to the question and if the Deputy wishes to pose hypothetical questions I am not willing to follow him down that road.  I think cases of this nature can be assessed only in the light of the facts of the case as known, either as disclosed in the proceedings or in the statement of claim.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>In his reply the Taoiseach mentioned the fact that the Attorney General would be the person responsible for making the decisions in relation to the indemnification.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not.  The Deputy should listen to the replies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Taoiseach clarify what he said?  I understood him to say that the Attorney General advises him&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is on the record. Any legal advice on the giving or non-giving of the indemnity would be sought from the Attorney General for the Minister for Finance who vets all public expenditure but, as I indicated, a decision would be taken in the light of those advices by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>In the programme for renewal the Government has already identified the conflict between the <Col N="860" /> Attorney General's role as legal adviser to the Government and as protector of the common good.  The Taoiseach has undertaken to review that and perhaps to make changes.  Does he not accept that there would be a conflict of interest in respect of the legal advice the Attorney General would give on this issue?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It depends on the case.  Where an Attorney General may have acted for one of the parties concerned when he was in private practice, a conflict of interest might arise&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not the point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but where that is not the case there is no question of a conflict of interest.  The Attorney General is the appointed legal adviser to the Government and his advice will be received and taken into account by the Government.  In a matter of this nature a decision will be made by the Government as to whether an indemnity is appropriate.  That can only be decided in the light of the facts as disclosed in the statement of claim.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 to 13, inclusive, together.  I received from the British Prime Minister at the weekend a <Col N="863" /> detailed response to my proposals which, as the House will be aware, were designed to point a way forward in the short-term on a path towards all-party round table talks.  Following careful and deliberate consideration, a comprehensive reply issued last evening.  Because discussions between the two Governments are now at a critical phase, I would ask Deputies to appreciate that I cannot elaborate at this stage on the issues under consideration which do, of course, include matters referred to in the questions.  As soon as I am in a position to do so, I assure the House that I will provide it with the necessary information.</P>
      <P>On the question of the letter received last week from the British Prime Minister, I was advised of the contents of a message prior to Question Time on Wednesday last and I referred in reply to supplementaries on that day to the contents of that message i.e. that I would receive a formal response from the British Government reasonably soon to the proposals I had made the previous week.  As I have already indicated to the House I was unaware at the time of answering questions last week that the message was in letter form.</P>

      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that the most important matter to be dealt with in the peace process in the next few weeks is to get pace and momentum back into the process?  We seek reassurance on whether the summit will be held in the next week or ten days and that a date will be set for all party talks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that it is of great importance to maintain the pace and momentum of the peace process. On the question of setting a date for the summit I wish to agree to the setting of a date only when I am satisfied that we would be in a position to settle all the outstanding matters at or before the summit.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the sensitivities at this stage.  Has there been any strategic change on the part of the British Government since the beginning of September when the summit was cancelled?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There have been ongoing discussions between the British and Irish Governments on this matter during that period.  Attempts have been made on all sides to understand and accommodate the views of others, but beyond that I do not wish to go.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that the Taoiseach will not state the facts of his negotiations with the British Government but will he ensure that the international commission would cover Washington III and that this would be part of whatever the Irish Government would agree with so that Washington III will be a part of their examination and not remain as a difficulty or an obstacle when the commission reports back to the two Governments?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose at this critical juncture to engage in delineation of the issues that remain to be settled in detail because I do not believe that it would be helpful to the process we are engaged in.  It is important that the British Prime Minister and I should be able to work out any remaining difficulties as fully and as expeditiously as possible and for those reasons I am not in a position to go into the detail on the reasonable and pertinent questions the Deputy has posed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been suggested that this part of the peace process is at an end.  Is that a pessimistic view, particularly in view of the contact he has had over the past couple of days with the British Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It would not be an accurate view.  My understanding of the peace process is a process where there is an absence of violence and there is work in progress to achieve the level of <Col N="865" /> reconciliation that is necessary to ensure that not only will there be an absence of violence but there will be no question of a return to violence.  To my mind the peace process is being worked at sincerely and actively by all of the parties. I can understand, however, that there will be from time to time concerns felt by some of the parties in regard to matters that may be in contention and these may lead to expressions being used which are more doom laden that the reality would warrant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to pursue the Taoiseach unfairly on any issue but two weeks ago he told me that in his view the Washington III clause was something the Government did not support.  I know the Taoiseach is not going to tell me today what is in the memorandum but it is reasonable to ask him if he still holds that view.  In agreeing to move on the twin track approach as a &ldquo;pre-stage&rdquo; to get to all party talks and at the same time having an international commission, can we on this side of the House and the public generally take it that the Taoiseach has not changed his recent position on Washington III?  If that is correct, is it not a fair assumption that he should insist that the international commission deal with Washington III in whatever terms of reference are set down?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to that question is covered by my original remarks in answer to the first question posed.  I do not propose to go into detail about any particular matters that may be in discussion between myself and the Prime Minister at this juncture.  Of course, the Irish Government's position has been made known on a wide range of matters on many occasions both here in this House and outside it and the Deputy will not be uninformed about the Irish Government's view on all relevant matters by now.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I note from briefings given to the media last night by Government sources that the emphasis was put <Col N="866" /> on this being a Government to Government agreement.  While I appreciate that, may I take it that Sinn Féin is not on board at this point?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure what purpose the Deputy intends to serve by asking that question, any more than I am clear about the purpose of Deputy Ahern's questions in the light of present circumstances.  I have already given a clear indication of the critical juncture we are at.  I am convinced of Sinn Féin's commitment to the peace process and of its determination to make it work.  I believe it wishes to make the necessary compromises to achieve movement on the process and recognises that, like others, it too must compromise.  For the reasons I outlined in response to earlier questions, I do not wish to go beyond that general statement and I ask the House to respect that.  I indicated to both Deputies that, if they wish, I am willing to make confidential briefing on these matters available to them.  I understand the Deputy might not be able to use confidential information other than in a confidential setting and may feel inhibited by that.  Equally, I hope she understands that I am inhibited in giving information about confidential discussions with others.</P>

      <P>Before the Taoiseach attributes anything sinister to my question, I want to inform him that we have a duty to ask relevant questions.  The last summit was cancelled because Sinn Féin was not on board.  I am trying to deal with this matter in as delicate and sensitive a manner as possible.  Given what Government sources briefed the media on last evening, it is relevant that I ask that question.  Can I take it the Taoiseach is optimistic that all parties, particularly Sinn Féin and the SDLP, will conform fully with the position put forward by the Irish Government if the summit is held at the end of this week? Is that what the Taoiseach is aiming to achieve?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We are seeking agreement between the two Governments to launch a twin-track process towards round table all-party talks.  Obviously agreement to do so &mdash; if that is reached &mdash; will be an agreement legally binding only on the parties to it, namely, the Governments.  That is not to say, however, that each of us will not do everything possible to get the maximum endorsement, co-operation, consent, compliance or toleration &mdash; whichever word is appropriate &mdash; among all the relevant parties.  Unless people are willing to co-operate with the process or at least give it a fair wind &mdash; even if they have reservations &mdash; we will not be able to move forward.  That is the basis on which we are proceeding.</P>
      <P>As I outlined on many occasions, most notably in my speech at the Warren Buffett dinner in Dublin Castle, at the end of the day, Governments have responsibility to make decisions.  I also outlined this in my speech to the Meath Association in London and in subsequent media interviews.  That remains my position, but that is not to say we are not seeking the maximum level of endorsement, agreement or co-operation from others.</P>

      <P>During my visit to New York from 9-10 November 1995 I had the following meetings: a private reception and dinner on 9 November; on 10 November, a meeting with Mayor Giuliani at City Hall; a meeting with Bill Flynn, a member of Americans for a New Irish Agenda; a visit to the Emerald Isle Immigration Centre at Wood-side, Queens; an interview for the Adrian Flannelly Radio Show; a meeting with Eamon Coghlan's team for the New York Marathon; and a meeting with Niall O'Dowd, publisher of the <i>Irish Voice</i> newspaper and <i>Irish America</i> magazine.</P>
      <P>During the visit, I availed of all appropriate opportunities to promote the Irish economy, particularly trade and investment, as well as promoting the peace process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was particularly pleased to visit the Emerald Isle Immigration Centre which provides training, education programmes and advice for Irish immigrants to the United States of America. In doing this, the centre's staff provide an exclusive service in helping Irish <Col N="872" /> immigrants find suitable employment and familiarise themselves with US tax, welfare, health and public administration procedures.</P>
    <P>I had the opportunity to meet and speak to people in the centre who offer immigration counselling, computer training, and citizenship and naturalisation advice.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 15 and 16 together.</P>
      <P>There is no statutory prohibition on the Director of Public Prosecutions appearing on a radio or television programme or giving interviews to journalists.  It is entirely a matter, therefore, for the Director as to whether he accepts such invitations.</P>
      <P>On the Order of Business on 16 November, I informed the Deputy that I believed it is important that the House should not be treated in a less informative way than any other institution, at the very minimum.  Following consideration by the Government of the issues involved, it has been decided that the Committees of the Houses of the Oireachtas (Compellability, Privileges and Immunities of Witnesses) Bill, 1995, will be amended to allow for the compellability of the Director to attend before a committee, to be designated, in order to answer questions on statistical and general policy issues arising from the annual reports which it is envisaged the Director will henceforth publish. Compellability will not extend to discussion of specific cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I very much welcome the Government decision but it is strange that a Government Bill published a week ago has to be amended within a week because of a radio programme.  This shows how restrictive the Government was in approaching that Bill.  It is only right that an independent officeholder should be accountable and that accountability is not incompatible with independence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In answering parliamentary questions on the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, does the Taoiseach intend to be more forthcoming about general policy issues?  I am not talking about <Col N="874" /> individual cases.  There are general policy issues that arise on which the Director was able to answer on the radio last Friday but which the Taoiseach has not been prepared to address in parliamentary questions here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In so far as the general policy questions are ones upon which the Director makes independent decisions, the appropriate person to explain those policy decisions is the Director.  I will respond to the matters concerning administration or the provision being made for the Director's office in terms of resource support and so on in the House.</P>
      <P>In view of the Government decision to introduce a reporting mechanism for the Director directly to a committee of this House in due course, I presume the Ceann Comhairle will make decisions within his prerogative on whether particular matters are more appropriately directed to me or the Director.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot ask the Director questions in the Chamber because he is not a Member of the House. Therefore, I have to ask the Taoiseach. If the Taoiseach feels the Director should answer general policy questions, surely the Bill should have been amended along those lines?  I understand the Bill will only be amended to allow him to answer questions on administration or did I misunderstand?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill will be amended to allow us compel the Director to attend before a designated committee to answer questions on statistical and general policy issues arising from the annual reports, which it is envisaged the Director will henceforth publish. The admissibility of particular questions to me in that context will be a matter for the Ceann Comhairle.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Director becomes involved in public disclosure and discussion of reasons for decisions in individual cases, there will be a serious risk they will become influenced by political discourse and trends in public opinion.</P>
      <P>It is more appropriate that these should not be of that nature.  However, the matter can be examined.  Hopefully, as a result of the Government's decision, there will be a discussion before a committee, in a non-adversarial way, of the general policy considerations that underlie the way in which the director approaches particular categories of decision.  I hope the Deputy agrees it is important that we do not become involved in the politicisation of individual decisions.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 19, 24, 38 and 59 together.  I welcome the excellent employment figures revealed in the preliminary labour force survey estimates for the 12 months to April 1995.  These figures show that growth in employment of 49,000 was accompanied by a significant reduction of 26,000 in unemployment despite the substantial increase of 23,000 in the labour force.  The Government consider it likely that this rapid rate of employment growth has been maintained since April.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been considerable debate about the most appropriate measure of unemployment.  The labour force survey is the internationally agreed standard statistical method of establishing numbers at work and not at work.  The estimate published in the recent April 1995 <Col N="877" /> labour force survey is based upon a person's own description of his or her situation by his or her principal economic status, such as at work, unemployed, student or on home duties and because of its comprehensiveness and coherence it is the key measure of employment and unemployment that informs policy making in my Department.</P>
    <P>The live register is a count of the numbers of people who sign on for payments or credits within the scope of certain schemes administered by the Department of Social Welfare and, as such cannot be considered as a robust measure of unemployment.  It is the only indicator of change in the level of employment between labour force surveys and as such has some use as a short-term indicator of trend.</P>
    <P>Changes in the administrative rules and practices governing schemes administered by the Department of Social Welfare also have an impact on the live register.  Such changes may involve improved access to schemes for social policy reasons.  Increased access such as improved support for those in part-time employment should not be considered as an increase in unemployment.  If public policy was driven by such a measure it could lead to peverse policy responses.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ahern asked about the reasons for the increase in the live register since April.  There has been a fall in the number of persons signing on between April and October but on a seasonally adjusted basis this translates into a rise of 7,100 during this period. It is difficult to be definitive about the precise reasons for changes in the register over short-time intervals.  The impact of migratory flows and increases in the size of and flows to and from the labour force can influence the flows on and off the register.  Apart from these factors significant numbers of part-time workers are currently included in the live register count.  I have been informed by the Department of Social Welfare that there has been an increase of the order of 6,000 in the numbers of such workers, that is, people employed <Col N="878" /> on a part-time basis signing on in the period since April 1995.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that the labour force survey provides the best information on which to base public policy.  As the live register is an indicator of one aspect of the labour market&mdash;unemployment&mdash;it is an inadequate base on which to assess, formulate and carry out labour market policy.  The fact that it does not cover employment information is a major constraint on its potential use as even the most rudimentary indicator of labour market trends.</P>
    <P>As Deputies know, the live register total has always exceeded the labour force survey estimates of unemployment.  The difference was relatively small until the mid-1980s but has grown considerably since then.  The many factors which are likely to have contributed to this divergence include equality legislation, eligibility relating to part-time workers and other changes in eligibility already outlined to the House on 8 November 1995.</P>
    <P>An interdepartmental group has been established by the Government to oversee the preparation and implementation of a comprehensive strategy on unemployment.  As part of its remit the group will examine the divergence between the live register claimant count and the labour force survey estimate of unemployment.  It is vital that employment, unemployment and labour market policies in general are informed by a consistent and coherent information base as is produced by the labour force survey.  It is, therefore, desirable to seek to secure regular and timely labour force statistics.  I am considering, with my Government colleagues, the question of increasing the frequency and timing of labour force survey estimates, a move which I support.  Clearly the most recent results from the labour force survey covering both employment and unemployment truly demonstrate the success of Government policy in turning economic growth into employment and jobs growth into reduced unemployment.  This information can encourage us to further expand and <Col N="879" /> develop proven policies.  It can also identify labour market problems requiring further attention.</P>

      <P>The Minister said the Government is examining more accurate ways of measuring unemployment. Will he consider having the labour force survey on a quarterly basis?  The Taoiseach stated that the cost of quarterly surveys would be £1.9 million.  Is that the correct figure?  Can the Minister explain the discrepancy of 84,000 in the numbers on the live register and those in the labour force survey?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the idea of quarterly labour force surveys.  That issue is currently being examined by different Departments.  Cost is one factor which must be taken into account and while I do not have the figures to hand I have seen figures of the nature referred to by the Deputy.  There is a cost factor in surveying 47,000 houses quarterly rather than annually.</P>
      <P>The discrepancy in the number of people arises from changes in eligibility criteria for social welfare.  One of the primary changes is the introduction of more liberal eligibility criteria for part-time workers to claim unemployment on the days they do not work.  The number of such claimants is 29,000.  There have been changes in equality legislation which give greater entitlement to women to sign on for unemployment assistance and also for splitting entitlements between spouses.  We do not have accurate estimates of the scale of that change.  Other changes are in the rules relating to unemployment assistance where the eligibility of those living at home with their parents has changed to make it more accessible.  That resulted in an increase in the number of claimants as measured by the live register figure.  The group which has been established will investigate this in greater detail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The equality legislation widened the eligibility criteria <Col N="880" /> and more women were entitled to sign on and seek employment.  Those on the live register are eligible for employment and therefore it is a more accurate figure.  The outcome of that legislation means that more women sign on as they are entitled to do and to seek employment.  Does the Minister agree that there is a need for a more precise delineation of those who are unemployed <i>visà-vis</i> sex, previous employment, length of unemployment, chosen profession and category of work?  I sent a request to the UK, which has a more precise delineation of the statistics or the facts behind statistics on live registers and labour force surveys, for information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be useful to have more data.  The labour force survey provides certain data which is useful from the point of view of looking at unemployment, for example, information in relation to education and other matters.  I always regretted the changes in 1987 or 1988 when much of this information was dropped.  We have data from FÁS which covers similar territory but which is not similar to that available in relation to the live register.</P>
      <P>I accept that certain persons signing on are eligible to do so and are, therefore, declaring themselves available for work.  However, from a policy perspective, we need a measure which does not change for reasons other than changes in the labour market.  The difficulty with the live register measure is that it changes for administrative reasons &mdash; changes in eligibility affect it whereas the labour force survey is internationally recognised and gives a clear trend on a consistent measurement as to the impact of policy measures on employment and unemployment.  It is, therefore, regarded internationally as the best measure and one to which we have always subscribed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 20, 30 and 39 together. The Government proposes to pursue high level political contacts with the UK over the question of UK demands for caps on European sales of Irish Steel over the coming days.  I propose seeking a further meeting with British Ministers this week in an effort to unblock UK objections to the State aid recommended by the EU Commission for Irish Steel and supported by other member states at the Industry Council on 6 and 7 November 1995.  While we and the UK have not yet reached agreement, which is extremely disappointing, I am still hopeful that if a more reasonable approach is adopted by the UK authorities, a formula can be found which would resolve the matter and enable the UK to join the other member states of the European Union and the EU Commission and give assent to the modest State aid involved in the Irish Steel case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The distance between the UK's demand for a cap on European sales and the basic minimum figure that the company will accept is very small.  I sincerely hope that we can reach an accommodation on those tonnes with the UK. <Col N="882" /> The gap between the UK and Ireland is small and with goodwill on the part of the UK to appreciate the special circumstances attaching to Irish Steel I remain hopeful that a deal can be reached.  I will do everything within my power to convince the UK of the genuineness of the Irish Steel case for State aid which could not have any major adverse impact on any steel plant in the UK.</P>
    <P>As regards the specific points made by Deputy O'Rourke, it had been speculated in the UK media that if the Irish Steel package was approved it would lead to the closure of a British Steel plant in Shelton, near Stoke-on-Trent.  I made it clear to Minister Eggar that this was not a credible position &mdash; a small increase in production by Irish steel could not have a major impact on a plant in the UK which is estimated to have an annual output of 400,000 tonnes.  The idea that approval by the UK of the Irish Steel package would close down production in Shelton is a fallacy.  I understand from Irish Steel that its annual production of lines that are also produced at Shelton amounts to only 34,000 tonnes.  Shelton makes heavy sections, while Irish Steel makes medium sections.  They are not really in the same market.</P>
    <P>At this stage I do not want to contemplate the Irish Steel plan being rejected by the EU simply because one member state holds up approval because of the legal necessity to obtain unanimity for the proposal.  ISPAT is being kept informed of all developments about our efforts to overcome UK objections and has indicated that it is also anxious for a resolution.</P>

      <P>In the Minister's absence, the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, dealt very admirably with this matter.  The Minister said he had shafted the two arguments which had been put forward in the British media. The fact they were willing to put them forward shows the line of thought and action which they are pursuing.  The Minister also said he will have further meetings this week with his opposite <Col N="883" /> number.  When will those meetings take place?  Have the meetings between the Minister's officials and British officials moved closer to reaching agreement than when we last discussed this matter? This morning I heard on the BBC that the EU is considering taking the UK to court over a subvention to the Jaguar car company.  Perhaps that is something on which the Minister could do a deal.</P>

I do not know what day I will meet Mr. Eggar, but I hope to do so before the end of the week.  The stand being taken by the British Government causes me concern.  I believe it is putting unreasonable obstacles in the way. Through the detailed work we are doing I hope we can demonstrate that the Irish Steel case will not be disruptive to its market on the scale suggested.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 21, 23, 37 and 56 together.</P>
      <P>The matters raised by the Deputies relate to the day to day responsibilities of IDA Ireland and are not ones in which I have a direct function.  In any event, contacts between IDA Ireland and the promoters of potential projects are conducted on a confidential basis and, as such, it would be inappropriate for me to comment on the details of the incentive package proposed in the case of the companies mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputies will appreciate that there is intense competition from other <Col N="885" /> industrial development agencies for overseas mobile investment projects. Notwithstanding this, IDA Ireland has been extremely successful in attracting new projects, particularly in the electronics sector.  In deciding on an incentive package to attract projects, IDA has regard to the incentives on offer from competing countries.  It must also, of course, have regard to the balance between the cost of securing the project and the benefits that will accrue from it to the country.</P>
    <P>In the final analysis, decisions as to where to locate overseas manufacturing operations rest ultimately with the owners of companies themselves and are beyond the control of the IDA.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it from reading between the lines of what the Minister said that newspaper reports suggesting that we offered higher grants are probably correct.  That being the case, will the Minister accept that if these companies go to jurisdictions offering lower grants there is something else which is not attracting them to Ireland?  Will the Minister accept that it is the high taxes on labour?  Does the Minister agree with me and, indeed, the Culliton report that the 10 per cent manufacturing tax has been the greatest attraction to foreign industry locating here rather than individual grant-aid packages?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Foreign companies are attracted to Ireland by various factors &mdash; very often the attraction is the quality of the labour force, particularly in the electronics area, rather than tax on labour cost issues.  Access to markets is another factor taken into account, as is location of sub-suppliers.  Because of our small market size, Ireland may be at a disadvantage in terms of companies that wish to locate close to markets or suppliers.  A range of factors is taken into account in deciding location; no single factor can be attributed as the primary reason for locating in a particular country.  I agree with the Deputy that one of the problems we need to address is the wide tax wedge.</P>

      <P>Given our resources, we will never be able to compete with the British and French in terms of grant-aid pay packages &mdash; those countries have almost limitless resources.  Will the Minister agree that at EU level we should strive to have large scale grants to industries of this kind reduced or abolished?

      <P>I fully accept that some of the richer central countries have an advantage in the amounts they can pay.  While certain restrictions are operated by the EU in terms of maxima that may be paid by way of State aid, those restrictions are not effective. When I recently had occasion to meet Commissioner van Miert I raised this question with him.  He has reported to the Council of Ministers on this issue, which was discussed at a recent Industrial Council.  It is an issue that has been under consideration for some time and one which I hope to pursue.  National interests vary dramatically in this regard and it will be difficult, but nonetheless important, to make progress on it.</P>

If he did not do so, will he confirm the reason was not related to the fact that the Chinese Vice Premier and Foreign Minister were visiting Ireland around that time? As we are aware, there are strange diplomatic relations between those two countries.  Was the Minister afraid that by holding such meetings he would offend the Chinese?  Has the Department of Foreign Affairs expressed a view on this matter?  Obviously, political considerations come into play here. Since the British made intense political approaches to the Taiwanese on this issue, I am concerned that not enough action was taken by our Government.</P>

I was there to demonstrate the Irish Government's clear interest in the project going ahead.  Detailed negotiations are a matter for the IDA, but it was essential to demonstrate clearly the great importance the Irish Government attributes to investment by this company in Ireland.  The Government did everything appropriate to deal with the case.  At the end of the day the company made its decision on the basis of factors such as proximity to marketplace, and it is not easily amenable to change.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister will accept that this is the largest investment by a Taiwanese company in Europe and, therefore, the strongest possible representations should have been made at political level.  The British clearly had done their homework.  Did the Department of Foreign Affairs express the view that the Minister should not press too strongly on the matter at ministerial level?  In view of the fact that the British made strong political representations in this case, will the Minister accept that we should have done likewise?  Two-track approaches are adopted by many countries to Taiwanese investment, which in terms of this country is significant.  Will the Minister accept that mistakes were made in this case in that strong political representations were not made at the highest level?</P>

I met the company, and I believe that was the correct approach.  With the IDA we clearly demonstrated the advantages of locating in Ireland, but the company, as is its right, made its decision based on other factors relating to marketplace and supply issues.  We have had extraordinary success this year in attracting projects in <Col N="888" /> the electronics sector.

Will the Minister agree it is wasteful from an island point of view to have two promotional agencies &mdash; the IDA and the IDB &mdash; dealing with foreign investment?

Equally, the IDB has recently established a success rate.  It adopts a different approach and has a different package to offer.  The two agencies are complementary.  At times there is an element of competitiveness on projects, but that is welcome.  There is a competitive market for foreign investment.  Both agencies operate sensible, co-operative <Col N="889" /> principles which prevent one from bidding against the other.  They have a satisfactory relationship.</P>

On 14 November direct questions were put in writing to Independent Newspapers in regard to these matters with a request for a reply within seven days.  I await, with interest a reply from Independent Newspapers.</P>
      <P>In regard to groups who were interested in relaunching the Press titles, I have had contacts with them since my reply to the Deputy on 10 October 1995. Ownership of the Irish Press titles rests with Irish Press Publications, of which Independent Newspapers owns 24.9 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I stated in the House before, the Competition Authority Report submitted to me states that the agreement involving the acquisition by Independent Newspapers plc of a shareholding in Irish Press and the provision of loans to Irish Press is anti-competitive and an abuse of a dominant position.  I have <Col N="890" /> stated before that I accept the findings of the Competition Authority.</P>

      <P>The Minister, in reply to an oral parliamentary question, told me he had written an earlier letter to Independent Newspapers.  Did he receive a reply to it?  What action does he propose to take apart from writing letters?</P>

      <P>I did not get a reply to the earlier letter and that is why I indicated I required a reply to the latest letter within seven days.  I will have to assess what Independent Newspapers says about the action it has taken to date and what action it proposes in relation to the Irish Press titles before I make a decision.  My central concern is that any action taken by Independent Newspapers would comply with the Competition Act.</P>

      <P>I accept that.  Has the Minister asked why there was no reply to his earlier letter?  Is it not ridiculous that a Minister in charge of the Department with responsibility for the Competition Authority does not receive a reply from a group to which he writes seeking information?  Does that not flout the Minister's authority?</P>
      <P>The Minister says he will take action when he receives the reply but what exactly does he intend to do?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not in advance of seeking detailed information about what has occurred indicate what I intend to do.  I cannot act on hearsay or newspaper reports.  I want to see Independent Newspapers openly state what it has done and what it intends to do. On the basis of its statement, I will judge whether it is conforming with the Competition Act.  That is my responsibility.  It indicated in the past that it intends to reply to this letter.  I expect it will do so and I will be in a position then to decide what I will do.</P>

      <P>I assume the Deputy is talking about work permits.  In the period January to December 1994, the latest date for which statistics are available, 4,377 work permits were considered.  A total of 4,293 work permits were granted, of these 3,051 were new permits and 1,242 were renewals.  A total of 84 applications were refused, of these 79 were new applications and five were renewals.</P>

    <P>Statistics regarding nationality are recorded only in respect of work permits granted.  Work permits were <Col N="892" /> granted in respect of 82 different nationalities in 1994.

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Minister for his detailed reply.  I surmise that many applications from Third World applicants would be from medical doctors who work in our hospitals.  I put down the question with that in mind.  Can the Minister confirm that, as a general rule, Irish immigration policy as reflected in the number of work permits granted in this country reflects that of the United Kingdom?  Can he also comment on the view that our policy in this regard is more suited to the United Kingdom and rather less suited to Irish needs and concerns?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Joe Jacob">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The question before the House is essentially a statistical question and we really should not go beyond the bounds of that unless the Minister wishes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot give that type of information.  The principle behind our approach is that there must be an effort to advertise the position and the employer must be unable to find an EU national who could suitably fill the post; that is the test applied in decisions on work permits.  There are certain exceptions to particular professions. However, the broad principle is that the employer must demonstrate that the post in question could not be filled by a suitable Irish or EU national.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. D. McDowell Mr. D. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that the effect of this policy as it applies to doctors from the Third World working in our hospitals is most regrettable in that it requires such doctors to return to their own countries after providing valuable and, in some cases, invaluable service in our hospitals?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It has the effect that people in training would not be permitted to remain after their training period, as a general rule, unless there were other reasons that would put them in an eligible category, for example, if they were married to an Irish national.  This policy has been operated for a considerable time.  A review is taking place at present and I undertake to look at the issue the Deputy is raising.  However, the established principle is clear.  The test is whether the position could be filled by an EU national.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. D. McDowell Mr. D. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister's Department maintain figures on the sectors of the economy or the nature of the jobs in respect of which permits are granted?  If so, will the Minister circulate them?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">

      <P>We maintain such figures but I do not have them to hand.  I can get them for the Deputy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I to take it that only 2 per cent of all applications for work permits are refused?  If that is the case many of the 2 per cent have contacted me.  That is why I find that assertion astonishing.  I have received between 15 and 20 letters in the past year or 18 months about people who were refused such permits.  When the Minister says &ldquo;considered&rdquo; does that refer to all applications?  Only 84 out of 4,377 &mdash; is that the total number of applications?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the total number of refusals.  A total of 4,377 work permits were considered.  In order to be considered an employer must make the application.  The Deputy might be receiving correspondence from people who want a work permit but do not have an employer to make an application.  An individual cannot make an application so there might be many other people who are not recorded in the statistics.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>There is provision for dealing with ethnic restaurants where there is a need for a particular skill, such as a chef.  That is taken into account although people would have to be able to demonstrate that they have the requisite skill.  If they can do so, work permits are issued in such cases.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will agree that the manner in which such decisions are taken can be a somewhat blunt instrument.  While on the surface it might appear that there is a superfluity of people eligible to do the job, when one inquires further there is not. There is a similar case in my constituency to that which concerns Deputy McDowell.  A doctor who is finished training wishes to remain in his job but <Col N="898" /> he has been told that others can do the job just as well as he.  There is great general appreciation of this person's skills and a wish to see him retained in his position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that it is a blunt approach.  It surprised me somewhat when I discovered the nature of the system.  It is appropriate that a review should be undertaken.  One has been under way for some time from which I hope will emerge clear criteria which would govern such decisions in the long-term.

      <P>My Department has maintained contact with Packard Ireland.  A meeting involving my Department and senior officials of the Labour Relations Commission took place on 2 November with management of the European and Irish companies of the Packard group.  The main purpose of this meeting was to explain to senior management in Packard the role and work of the advisory service of the Labour Relations Commission.</P>
      <P>The company has been discussed in this House on a number of occasions over the past 12 months.  Unfortunately, the company is still experiencing difficulties in achieving productivity levels that would assure viability.  At this stage it is vital that the problems at the plant be examined critically with a view to improving its competitive position and securing its future.  The advisory service of the Labour Relations Commission has the necessary expertise and experience to make a major contribution in this regard.  Since it was set up the advisory service has helped numerous enterprises to bring about improvements in their industrial relations practices and procedures resulting in improved productivity.  The company is considering whether to avail of the services offered by the advisory service. Discussions are continuing between management and senior officials in the Labour Relations Commission.  The services of the Labour Relations Commission are available on a voluntary basis and it is up to management and the workers in any enterprise to decide whether to use these services.</P>
      <P>In this case I hope all parties agree to avail of the services offered by the Labour Relations Commission as I believe this course offers the best hope for bringing about the improvements necessary to secure the future of the Packard factory in Tallaght.</P>

      <P>I am worried about the Minister's tone and the content of some of his reply.  It appears there are worrying signs in Packard.  The Minister set up an industry intervention committee or one of a similar name when Packard experienced difficulties on an earlier occasion.  That committee's role was to adopt a hands-on method of dealing with incipient or potential problems in companies generally and was not related specifically to Packard.  Has that committee been active?  The Minister did not refer to it in his reply.  He spoke of the work of the Labour Relations Commission, with which we all agree. What work has been undertaken by the industry intervention committee?  Has the Minister invoked its services to deal with the latest problems in Packard?</P>

      <P>That committee has undertaken considerable work and is in a position to identify a programme that will be available to companies seeking assistance in repositioning to deal with competitive pressures.  It is open to Packard to apply for assistance under such a programme.  As the Deputy will recall, part of the approach adopted was to assist Packard earlier in the year regarding some of its requirements to meet higher productivity.  The IDA had discussions with it regarding particular assistance it could provide in that regard.  There is a willingness on the part of the industrial agencies through the adjustment measure and generally to assist in any way possible in dealing with some of the issues.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>If I recall correctly the Minister stated that there were identifiable worries regarding productivity.  Has this committee, about which there was a good deal of hype <Col N="901" /> when it was set up to the effect that it would provide many answers on a cross agency basis, worked with Packard in identifying productivity requirements? What was the cause of the meeting on 2 November?  Are there worries about productivity in the company?  What issue in Packard is giving rise to tension and worries?</P>

      <P>The industrial adjustment measure introduced under the industrial operational programme was a general one.  That committee considered how that measure could be made available as a programme under which companies could apply for support.  We will be in a position shortly to announce the precise way in which a company can apply for support, the areas of support that will be available and how it will be administered.  The committee has developed a concept into a programme under which companies can apply for support.  That committee has not been working directly with specific companies.  It is envisaged that the agencies will be working with specific companies.</P>
      <P>Packard is experiencing ongoing industrial relations problems.  The purpose of the meeting on 2 November was to bring to the attention of management that the Labour Relations Commission has been a valuable resource for working out such difficulties and securing a better approach by companies to difficult productivity improvement measures.  Packard is undergoing considerable repositioning and the Labour Relations Commission could usefully assist it in that regard.  We have been encouraging the use of such machinery.</P>

      <P>I will not enter into a detailed assessment of the difficulties involved.  As the Deputy is aware, we have had a troubled experience with <Col N="902" /> that company.  I believe it has a committed workforce and we need to adopt a better approach than the one adopted in the past to deal with the present difficulties.  All sides can learn from the services provided by a body like the Labour Relations Commission.  I continue to be optimistic about the plant's future. The company must get its cost base and productivity right and that poses a challenge to all sides in the plant.  It is a competitive and cut throat business and one that requires considerable investment of commitment on the part of management and trade unions to make it work.  That is what we need to enlist and are seeking to achieve through these meetings.</P>

Does he envisage that he or the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, who was centrally involved in this issue during past months, will become directly involved in ensuring that the advisory service of the Labour Relations Commission is utilised, given that today is 21 November, the last meeting took place on 2 November and time is running out?</P>

These are not political issues.  The approach to the Labour Relations Commission should not be made in the glare of political focus.  The most useful approach is the one adopted, a low key meeting at which the merits of that approach were explained.  As indicated in the reply the discussions are continuing and I hope they will be fruitful.  I am responding to this because I want to assure the House of the continuing interest in this matter by both Ministers of State at my Department and myself.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Ms E. Fitzgerald)</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the minimum wage provisions which are set out in employment regulation orders and registered employment agreements.  Employment regulation orders are drawn up by joint labour committees which are bodies representative of employers and workers in certain employment sectors. The orders set out statutory rates of pay and conditions of employment for workers in those sectors of employment. Registered employment agreements are collective agreements registered with the Labour Court, concerning the pay or conditions of employment of a particular class, type or group of workers. When registered, the provisions of the agreement become legally binding.</P>
      <P>There are currently 16 joint labour committees in operation.  About 150,000 workers are covered by joint labour committees and registered employment agreements.  While the legislation does allow me as Minister to apply to the Labour Court for establishment of new JLCs, the long-standing practice has been that such applications are normally initiated by workers or their representatives and this practice should continue. The Labour Court has the role of finally determining whether a new JLC should be established for any particular sector and also for registering new employment agreements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Employment regulation orders and registered employment agreements (REAs) are enforced by the labour inspectorate of my Department.  Routine inspections are undertaken to ensure that employers are complying with the terms of the EROs and REAs. <Col N="904" /> In addition, inspectors pursue reported breaches of the orders and agreements. Last year nearly 5,000 inspections were carried out and £250,000 in arrears was collected on behalf of workers.  I am satisfied with the current operation of the labour inspectorate and the level of enforcement activity carried out.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Minister of State for her reply, she will know that in a previous manifestation I was a solicitor.  That is one of those sectors which is governed by a joint labour committee and where minimum wages are set for legal executives and legal secretaries.  I am not aware that employment in that sector has been adversely affected by the existence of a minimum wage.  Will the Minister of State agree that as a general principle there is no evidence to suggest that the existence of a minimum wage, as she rightly points out governing 150,000 workers, has adversely affected employment in that sector?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EithneFitzgerald" hpid="Ms E. Fitzgerald Ms E. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms E. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Minimum wages in the legal secretary-legal assistants sector are there to prevent exploitation of an unorganised group of workers and have not prevented employment in those sectors.  However, that does not mean I agree that the widespread application of minimum wage legislation would necessarily have the same effect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. McDowell</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Ms E. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I am saying that we have been careful in this country in the application of minimum wage legislation.  The minimum wage legislation, under joint labour committees and employment regulation orders, has a role in preventing exploitation. However, I do not believe that a more widespread application of the principle <Col N="905" /> of a national minimum wage would adversely impact on employment.  The best way of increasing wages is to improve the take-home pay of those on low pay &mdash; we did this in the last two budgets by a particular focus on the lower paid &mdash; and to ensure that their earnings are improved by enhancing their skills and productivity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I note that the Minister of State does not approve of extension of the minimum wage to any other sector, she has said that quite clearly. How does the Minister of State feel about the major statement four weeks ago of the Leader of Democratic Left, Deputy De Rossa &mdash; to which I think Deputy Derek McDowell was referring &mdash; in which he said he would strongly advocate, presumably at Cabinet, and seek to implement the minimum wage sector by sector?  That major speech and his demands about social welfare show that he is flexing his muscles at Cabinet and that he is taking the lion's share of authority and decision making.  The Minister of State said on the one hand &mdash; I do not necessarily disagree &mdash; that she does not envisage the extension of the minimum wage to any more sectors and on the other hand that her partners in Government say it should be introduced sector by sector.  Will the Minister throw some light on that dilemma?</P>

    <Speaker pid="EithneFitzgerald" hpid="Ms E. Fitzgerald Ms E. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms E. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>

      <P>That would be my approach to a sector by sector group of workers.  If a particular group of workers comes forward with a proposal, it will go to the Labour Court and will be examined on its merits.  I do not <Col N="906" /> believe, nor does Deputy De Rossa, that the time is right or appropriate to introduce a national minimum wage.

    <Speaker pid="EithneFitzgerald" hpid="Ms E. Fitzgerald Ms E. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms E. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>This depends on the level at which minimum wages are set If one sets a minimum wage of £10 per hour and a person's ability to earn only £4 per hour one would lose job which are priced between £4 and £9.9 per hour.  They have a limited role to play in preventing exploitation but I do not believe a national minimum wage the best strategy to address the problem of low pay.  The best strategy to address that problem is to increase the earning power of those in low paid employment and to increase the share of those earn is ings which they can take home.  The Government's strategy during the last number of budgets has been to focus budgetary reductions in taxation at the lower paid by the introduction of the PRSI tax allowance for workers, by expanding the family income supplement, by reducing the rate of mar ginal relief from 48 per cent to 40 per cent and by expanding allowances and particularly, income tax exemption limits.  The focus of tax reform must continue to be on the lower paid so that <Col N="907" /> they can take home more of their income.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister of State accept that the least we require as Opposition spokespersons, with an interest in this subject, is a definite Government policy position when the Minister of State with responsibility for labour affairs speaks on this matter?  In her earlier contribution we heard some of her ideas regarding the minimum wage, on which she has now expanded. Will the Minister of State accept she is doing a disservice to the House by initially expressing her personal views on this matter which differ radically from those of the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa?  I referred to this confusion in the past and I repeat my concern.  Will the Minister of State agree that to improve the plight of workers, especially the low paid, there must be a tax reduction and also a reduction in employers' PRSI?  Finally, does the Minister agree with the principle of the extension of the minimum wage provisions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EithneFitzgerald" hpid="Ms E. Fitzgerald Ms E. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms E. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy that it is important to reduce the tax burden on lower paid workers. We placed great emphasis on that issue in Government with our current partners and with the Deputy's party.  That is the best way of increasing the earning power and take home pay of people in low paid employment.  It is also extremely important to raise the earning power by improving skills and productivity.  That is the most important long-term and effective strategy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of minimum wages should be examined issue by issue and sector by sector.  The current practice is that if the workers' representatives in a particular sector believe exploitation is taking place, those workers can apply to the Labour Court to establish a joint labour committee or they can make an employment agreement which is then registered.  That system has worked well <Col N="908" /> for unorganised workers and it is one I fully support.</P>

      <P>This company was unfairly treated in the amount of grant payments to it compared to other joinery companies.  It seems that Munster Joinery has a monopoly in this area. Many joinery factories in the west cannot compete with Munster Joinery because of the number of grants it has received for training and employment creation.  I do not understand the reason Munster Joinery received so many grants when other joinery companies did not receive any grants in the past 25 or 30 years.  Why was Munster Joinery paid so much money?</P>

      <P>Since 1985 grant assistance has been confined only to exporting companies.  The grant payments of approximately £270,000 made in 1990 and 1991 would have been related to export sales projections made by the company.  The IDA would have to be satisfied that the export sales projections were achieved and that normal claw-back clauses applied in relation to such grant approvals which would confine the continued payment of grants to <Col N="910" /> the achievement of the export sales performance.  The Deputy is right in saying that joinery companies operating only in the local market would not be eligible for grant aid and have not been eligible for ten years.</P>

      <P>I understand that joinery company does not export many products and yet it seems to have a monopoly in this area.  I am not aware of the quality of its products but the quality of joinery made in the west is excellent.  Some people set up factories in the west, particularly in my constituency, without any grant aid.  Some of them employ 25 or 30 people, others employ as many as 40 to 50 people.  The joinery factory I worked in, GWI in Collooney, County Sligo, had to close down due to a lack of Government finances.</P>

      <P>The payments to which the Deputy referred were not made while our party was in Government; indeed, the Deputy's party was in Government.  I repeat the point I made, grant aid is available on the same terms to all companies.  In this instance, it is only available in relation to export sales. That has been the policy for the past ten years under all Governments.  Companies must comply with that and grants will only be paid if they achieve export sales performance.  If they fail to achieve that, they will be subject to the normal grant claw-back.  I do not see any basis for claiming unfair treatment according to my brief.</P>

      <P>I do not know the firm to which my colleague, Deputy Brennan, referred but the general point he is making is one of great interest. Constituents often approach us and say that a particular firm is obtaining grants <Col N="911" /> while they cannot.  When we inquire on their behalf we are told it is a matter of displacement or there is already sufficient market for the particular product.  I have often thought that insufficient research is carried out into whether the product being made is comparable to others in terms of quality. That is the issue to which Deputy Brennan is referring.  What is the policy in regard to displacement?  What is the policy in regard to goods of a superior or inferior quality being grant aided and is there ongoing monitoring of such matters.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The position in relation to this sector is that a decision was taken ten years ago, and maintained ever since, that aid would only be given in relation to export sales.  It is not a question of the quality of individual products.  The broader issue of displacement is one which the IDA and Forbairt must always examine.  If there is a question that the grant aid of a particular project would adversely affect another operator, it would have to be taken into account.  However, this specific sector is one of such sensitivity that grant aid is confined only to export sales.</P>

    <Title>Dumping at Sea Bill, 1995: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.'</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill whose provisions extend the control of dumping of various toxic, harmful and noxious substances at sea and the <Col N="1061" /> implementation of the provisions of the Paris Convention with regard to the north-east Atlantic.  I also welcome the extension of the area to be covered by the provisions of this Bill from 12 to 200 miles and the Continental Shelf extending to some 350 miles.</P>
      <P>We are all aware just how important is the sea and its resources to animals, fish and people's health.  Its harvest is so rich that anything which threatens it endangers the food chain and may species of fish.</P>
      <P>Large consumption leads to much waste and disposal of harmful and toxic materials and substances.  The practice has grown up of a general usage of the sea for the disposal of materials which are not safe or capable of being disposed of on land.  The greatest concern surrounds the amount of radioactive materials being dumped in containers in deep waters which hopefully will remain undisturbed.  However, it carries the inherent danger of disturbance and remains toxic and dangerous for millennia.  This dumping must be carefully controlled monitored and, if possible, banned.</P>
      <P>In addition, there is greater recourse to the sea for oil exploration using various offshore installations.  The most recent example that springs to mind was the attempted dumping at sea by the <i>Brent Spar</i> until there was a huge international outcry against it.  Oil industrialists have begun to harvest the wealth under the seabed, with the consequent dangers of pollution.  Such operations must be regulated to ensure the prevention of dumping of potentially harmful materials at sea.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Two major factors warrant consideration with regard to dumping at sea, policing and the penalties to be imposed.  Recent events at sea highlight its perils.  Despite a widespread search, six fishermen and their trawler are still missing off the Donegal coast.  A Wexford fisherman died tragically off Howth harbour when his vessel hit the rocks and there was not a helicopter with night flying facilities on the east coast capable of coming to his rescue.  While <Col N="1062" /> there was an intensive and successful campaign for the location of such a helicopter on the west coast, whenever an emergency arises on the east coast, we must await the arrival of a helicopter from Wales which usually takes half an hour.</P>
    <P>Sea search and rescue is a difficult endeavour at the best of times in the case of any island nation.  We must also recognise the difficulty of detecting or policing dumping of noxious materials. An innocuous vessel may go to sea, perhaps a trawler or a factory ship, under the cover of darkness, bearing in mind the shortage of helicopters with night flying facilities capable of surveillance.  I predict that will be the greatest international problem, particularly for us as an island nation since it is more difficult for us to ensure comprehensive monitoring and policing of 200 to 350 miles off our shores.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will address the matter of penalties on Committee Stage because I consider a maximum penalty of £1,500 on summary offence or 12 months imprisonment to be inadequate, in view of the potential magnitude of such pollution and its attendant dangers to the lives of thousands of people as a result of the illegal dumping of radioactive waste off our shores without any licence from this State to do so.</P>
    <P>There is a series of offences which cannot be catered for adequately by the imposition of a maximum sentence because of the possible extent of extreme pollution caused by such illegal dumping.  Most illegal dumpers, if they could, would opt for a summary hearing. Very often, in order to eliminate the difficulties of giving and taking evidence, producing witnesses and so on, the courts will be anxious to dispose of a case by summary charge rather than going through the costly indictment process.  As a deterrent, it would not be sufficient for us to impose a maximum fine of £1,500.  I should like the Minister to re-examine that penalty with a view to substantially increasing it.</P>
    <P>Inshore dumping of waste, sludge and other substances has been taking place <Col N="1063" /> for millennia.  In addition to examining the control of pollution and penalising its perpetrators whenever an incident occurs, we must also ensure that noxious materials are not dumped immediately offshore or inshore areas.</P>

      <P>I thank all Members who contributed to this debate for their general welcome and support of the Bill.  First let me deal with the matter of penalties and fines, an issue raised by a number of contributors.</P>
      <P>The objective of the OSPAR Convention &mdash; which the provisions of this Bill will enable us to ratify &mdash; is to protect the marine environment by incorporating principles established in international environmental legislation.  One such principle is that polluters pay; they are held liable for damage caused.  That is the policy of this Government.  In respect of serious offences, the Bill provides for unlimited fines of such amount as the court deems appropriate on conviction on indictment, taking into account the cost of remedial action, five years' imprisonment, or both.  I specifically made a decision not to put a limit on fines in regard to serious offences because of the potential cost of rectifying any damage caused to the marine environment.  I hope that the possibility of substantial penalties on conviction will be an effective deterrent to would-be offenders.  It is our intention to invoke the full rigours of the law where offenders are not so deterred and the fines to be imposed could run to millions of pounds.</P>
      <P>The fine of £1,500 to which Deputies referred relates only to minor offences under the Bill.  It is in line with fines in comparable legislation and has been provided for in the Bill on the advice of the Attorney General's office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding enforcement, the Deputies will note that the Bill designates Naval Service personnel <i>ex officio</i> as authorised officers.  The Government is satisfied that the resources available to the <Col N="1064" /> Naval Service and Air Corps over recent years will enable proper surveillance and enforcement.  I assure Deputies however, that our operational capacity to carry out this work will be kept under constant review, with a view to ensuring that we meet all our responsibilities under the legislation and OSPAR Convention.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides for the appointment additionally of officers of my Department i.e. scientific personnel, marine surveyors, sea fisheries officers, staff of the Marine Survey Office and harbour masters generally to be authorised officers.</P>
    <P>Deputies generally voiced considerable concern in respect of three main issues: the impact on the Irish Sea of radioactive emissions from the THORP plant; the impact on local marine areas of chemical and other weapons dump sites in the Irish Sea and in the North East Atlantic generally and the alleged dumping of radioactive waste material in areas adjacent to the Irish coast.</P>
    <P>In relation to all three issues, Deputies expressed doubt about the comprehensiveness of the information given to us by the UK Government on locations, volumes and the nature of dumped materials; they were also concerned about whether we can be satisfied that monitoring and management of dumped materials and sites can be carried out in an effective and transparent way.  It was asked whether we will ever know the full truth.  That is a hard question to answer; however, I am hopeful that the opportunities afforded by the OSPAR Convention and the need to prepare quality status reports will allow for more active co-operation and better and more open disclosure of the facts.  In the meantime, we will maintain pressure on the UK authorities through political, administrative and scientific channels.</P>
    <P>I assure Deputies that we will be vigilant at all times in ensuring that all the facts are produced in an accurate and timely manner and that no attempt is made to withhold information.  I am reassured by the interest taken by <Col N="1065" /> environmental groups in the UK and Northern Ireland in bringing out the facts and lobbying for action.  We are beginning to see some results from this activity and no doubt from pressure put on the UK Government by the Irish Government.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that we are talking here about materials which have been dumped in the past &mdash; even before the Oslo and Paris Conventions were mooted.  However, much can be done through the OSPAR Convention.  The concept of the quality status report constitutes a very important means of affording a comprehensive check-up on the state of our seas and oceans.  It also has the advantage of being subject to standards and methodologies set by the OSPAR Convention.  The recent disturbance of munitions as a result of pipe laying by British Gas highlights the need for strict management and monitoring of the munitions dump sites used in the past.</P>
    <P>We will be pursuing a two-track approach of minimising, through more information, monitoring and management, the impact on the marine environment of materials already dumped, and ensuring that no new harmful materials and substances are added in the future.</P>
    <P>Deputies raised the point that opinions are divided on the ability of the sea to absorb dumped materials. Inevitably, interests will produce scientific evidence to indicate that adverse effects are minimal.  As I mentioned in my opening speech, our knowledge of the seas and oceans is limited and it behoves us to take no chances about things we dump.  Indeed, the OSPAR Convention enshrines this &ldquo;precautionary principle&rdquo; in its text.  The convention's clearly articulated approach is to take no chances; if there is a danger that sea dumping is likely to damage the marine environment, then the environment should be given the benefit of the doubt.  That is why we are banning outright the dumping of disused offshore installations.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1066" /> More specifically as regards Sella-field, I wish to inform the House that the Government is pursuing an energetic strategy on the whole nuclear industry.  One of the things we have to realise is that the British nuclear industry and the British Government will not close the plant, resulting in lost profits and more local employment, purely because of protests from this country.  It is a very big industry employing a large number of people.</P>
    <P>We must pursue this issue through the various international fora e.g. through the EU, IMO and the OSPAR Convention.  We have received wide support within the IMO for stricter control on the carriage of nuclear substances by sea; the OSPAR Convention prohibits the dumping of radioactive wastes resulting from the nuclear industry.</P>
    <P>An inter-ministerial committee on Sellafield and the Irish Sea has been established to progress Government policy in this area.  One of the initiatives of this Committee is to seek a review of the EURATOM Treaty which governs EU policy in relation to nuclear issues, to place greater emphasis on health, safety and environmental aspects.  High-level diplomatic approaches have been made to the authorities in countries where their utilities either have or are contemplating signing reprocessing agreements with THORP, expressing Ireland's concerns about the operation of this plant.  These contacts will serve as a foundation for ongoing high level diplomatic efforts on the nuclear issue with the countries concerned.</P>
    <P>I should remind Deputies that the Bill before the House deals only with dumping at sea issues i.e. dumping from vessels, installations and aircraft.  It will, however, prohibit the dumping at sea of radioactive waste resulting from the nuclear industry.</P>
    <P>Deputies raised a number of other issues, drugs, the state of our hydrographic charts, pollution from ships by oil and garbage and discharge of raw sewage in coastal waters.</P>
    <P>The National Drugs Co-ordinating Committee is energetically addressing <Col N="1067" /> the problem of drugs supply and the Department of the Marine will participate fully in this work.  My Department's input will be to assess how the assets and intelligence available to the Department of the Marine can be utilised and deployed to do just the kind of thing the Deputies suggest, i.e. to use all the eyes and ears available to gather intelligence on the activities of persons and vessels involved in this most despicable and damaging trade.</P>
    <P>On the question of the state of the hydrographical survey of the Irish coast, my Department asked the Marine Institute to address the issues raised in the submission to the seminar on marine policy in Cork.  The institute has produced a set of ideas to redress the situation and these are the subject of discussions between my Department and the Institute.  I hope to be in position to consider some solutions to the problems posed by the state of our navigational charts.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hugh Byrne raised his concern regarding pollution from ships by oil and garbage.  Ireland is a party to MARPOL 73/78.  The Sea Pollution Act, 1991, gives effect to MARPOL and this Act and its regulations prohibit or control the operational discharge of garbage, oil and noxious liquid substances from ships through the establishment of operational discharge criteria and vessel construction and equipment.  The marine surveyors of the Department of the Marine are empowered to inspect any vessel while it is in the State or within our territorial waters to make sure that it is in compliance with the provisions of MARPOL.  If a marine surveyor is not satisfied that the ship is in compliance with the terms of MARPOL, then he may detain the vessel until such time as any defect is rectified.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies raised concerns about the discharge of raw sewage to coastal waters.  I must point out to Deputies that the Bill before the House deals exclusively with the regulation and control of dumping at sea.  Dumping by <Col N="1068" /> Dublin Corporation.  Ireland's only authorised sewage sludge dumper, is being phased out and will be terminated by the end of 1998.  Alternative land-based methods of treatment and disposal are being developed by Dublin Corporation with that timeframe in mind.</P>
    <P>The Government is committed to tackling the problem of discharges of raw sewage to coastal waters by means of a major programme of investment in sewage treatment facilities around our estuaries and coasts.  Under the terms of the Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive, secondary treatment will be required in all cases by the end of the year 2005.</P>
    <P>The size of the task facing us is best illustrated by the fact that only 14 per cent of sewage discharges are currently connected to secondary treatment plants.  As some 80 per cent of sewage wastes discharge to the marine environment, the vast bulk of the £1.3 billion investment programme required under the Directive will be spent in estuarine and coastal areas.  Taken with the dispersed nature of our population, it is clear that a major programme of works covering numerous locations will be implemented over the next decade.</P>
    <P>The overall planning and financial framework for this is being established by the Minister for the Environment with the detailed planning and implementation being the responsibility of local authorities.  I am confident that the level of investment involved will lead to significant improvements in the quality of the waters around our coast.  Points made by Deputies on later Stages will be considered and any improvements proposed will be carried into the Bill.  It appears that all Deputies are united in the wish to enact legislation which will be seen by all as a progressive and effective means of discharging our obligations of stewardship of the marine environment.  I thank the Deputies who contributed to this very constructive debate.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I am honoured to move the Second Stage of this important and radical legislation.  It has taken much time to prepare and it will require detailed scrutiny by both Houses.  For that reason I have specifically requested my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Doyle, to undertake that task.  One of her responsibilities within the Department of Finance is to improve the relationship between the citizen and the institutions of the State.  This Bill is central to that mission.  Accordingly, she will reply to the debate on Second Stage.  She will also have responsibility for steering the legislation through the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any party coming into Government carries with it some vision of the direction which it wishes society to take.  In the case of my party, it is such a vision of the needs and rights of the public &mdash; ordinary workers and the underprivileged &mdash; which has animated our representatives, activists and core supporters since before the foundation of the State.  For most of us, when we come into Government that vision has been made real by the influence we bring to bear on expenditure decisions, spending programmes, tax strategy and instruments for the creation of employment <Col N="1070" /> and the alleviation of poverty.  Given the normal life span of individual Governments and the time-scale against which policies in those areas must be developed and implemented, it is, however, easy to overlook what may be called the essential underpinnings of government, the institutional framework of the public service and the machinery on which we as politicians rely to put our policies into effect and the web of custom, assumptions and practice which constitute the culture of those who work within those institutions and which, to some degree, can come to influence those of us who preside over it in a myriad of ways.</P>
    <P>I think no Minister has left Government for the Opposition benches without a sense of things left undone or things done less than well but time out of Government can be a learning process, a time to reflect upon and analyse the obstacles encountered and the improvements needed.  What I and others concluded during such a period was that our policy development, the awareness and responsiveness of our political and administrative system to public needs, could be improved, provided engines of change were incorporated into that system and that disasters could be avoided if the circumstances from which they ultimately sprang were known at an early stage outside the circle involved and were open to timely scrutiny and criticism.</P>
    <P>We recognised that monopoly of information, privileged access to material under the control of public offices, is power and that that power is as open to abuse as any other.  We noticed that those who came to our clinics and groups which approached us about their problems relied on us, as public representatives, to gain access to information affecting their daily lives, entitlements to benefits or public concerns.  We recognised that in an era of high State activity, of substantial regulation and of bureaucracy, unnecessary restrictions on access to information were as effective tools of disempowerment as denial of the vote was in <Col N="1071" /> another age.  Even within the organs of representative democracy we detected the same imbalance between the temporary custodians of Executive power and other representatives of people.</P>
    <P>I make those points to put the Bill in a wider perspective.  It is, in one sense, a stand alone measure to meet a need which has been acknowledged in recent years by all parties of this House.  On another level, it is a crucial part of a family of legislation which I and my colleagues determined should represent a wider and long-term response to the problem I have mentioned &mdash; a dramatic improvement in the transparency of the process of governance and in the accountability of office-holders and public servants.  Our commitments in this area, which are shared by our partners in Government, were set out explicitly in <i>A Government of Renewal.</i></P>
    <P>One such measure &mdash; the Ethics in Public Office Act &mdash; designed to protect the integrity of public decision making by politicians and senior officials has already been put in place and I expect it to be followed shortly by the freedom of information legislation on which my colleagues the Tánaiste, Deputy Spring, and the Minister of State, Deputy Fitzgerald, have worked so hard since coming into office.  Work is well under way in my Department on other measures in this series, for example, a new Ombudsman Bill to strengthen the defences available to the individual citizen in situations where he or she feels that some decision or action of an administrative body has been detrimental to them, and an administrative procedures Bill which will set out, in statutory form, the basic tenets of proper administrative practice to be followed by public servants.</P>
    <P>To put it succinctly, the Bill proposes to confer on those Oireachtas committees, whose terms of reference include provision for the calling of persons and papers, statutory powers to compel the attendance and co-operation of witnesses and the furnishing of documents. It further proposes to confer High Court <Col N="1072" /> privilege, virtually identical with the absolute privilege available to Members, on all witnesses giving evidence or, on direction, sending documents to such committees.  Both elements of the Bill are, of necessity, intertwined.  It would be manifestly unfair to compel witnesses to answer questions without according to them the safeguards essential to protect them from what might otherwise be the legal consequences of full and frank responses to the questions put to them.</P>
    <P>Before discussing the provisions contained in it in more detail, it is worthwhile to first place the Bill in its proper context, to note the relevant background to it and to discuss some of the issues which have arisen over the past number of years which, in turn and collectively, have contributed to the realisation that legislation of this nature was necessary.</P>
    <P>By articulating the important issues which in one way or another have given genesis to the Bill, all concerned here today will be better able to understand both the need for this type of legislation and the manner in which it is put before this House.</P>
    <P>The current situation regarding privilege, compellability and immunity of witnesses is as follows.  Under Article 15.13 of the Constitution, Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas have absolute privilege in respect of utterances in either House.  Since 1976, this has been extended by legislation to cover them at meetings of committees. On the other hand, witnesses appearing before such committees only enjoy &ldquo;qualified privilege&rdquo;.  This does not prevent legal action being taken against a witness for anything she or he says before a committee but it does provide them with a defence against libel or slander unless it can be proven that she or he was actuated by a motive not connected with the privilege, for example ill will, spite or any other improper motive. The possibility of legal action with the attendant costs of representation, even where a good defence exists, constitutes a serious hazard for any witness.  In <Col N="1073" /> addition, however, the privilege which they enjoy does not extend to other legal actions such as for breaches of confidentiality, breach of duty of care and so on which could result in their having to pay damages.  One of the two major thrusts of this Bill is to correct this situation.</P>
    <P>Certain Oireachtas committees include in their terms of reference provision for the calling of persons and papers.  While these requests to attend have in general been honoured, there have been well publicised incidents which showed, all too clearly, that they have no statutory power to enforce such provisions.</P>
    <P>It is also useful to bear in mind an important issue which has been raised in the past whereby witnesses have themselves felt unable to furnish specific information to Oireachtas Committees due to the lack of adequate privilege. While the sceptical among us may suspect that in some instances the legal ramifications provided a welcome shield for the reticent witness, the current state of the law undoubtedly provided genuine grounds to justify co-operative witnesses being cautious in the responses and comments they might offer to a committee.</P>
    <P>The introduction of legislation to overcome this &ldquo;democratic deficit&rdquo; in terms of the effective working of committees of the House representing elected representative has been mooted for well over a decade.  The Committee of Public Accounts recommended in 1988 that it should have the power to extend or withdraw privilege to witnesses appearing before Oireachtas committees.  A resolution of this House in 1990 sought legislation to clarify the position of witnesses, specifically with reference to the broadcasting of Oireachtas committees.  I think it is fair to say that many members of various committees have for some time been anxious to extend the success of the televising of the Dáil to committees, thereby having the deliberations of <Col N="1074" /> elected officials broadcast directly to the people who have elected them.</P>
    <P>However, the privilege which they enjoy does not extend to other legal actions such as breaches of confidentiality, duty of care and so on.  Committee members and witnesses do not, therefore, meet on a level playing field.</P>
    <P>The time and cost involved in the establishment and use of tribunals of inquiry to carry out investigations is another issue which again and again has caused great concern in the past.  While, of course, tribunals of inquiry have proved themselves incredibly useful in carrying out a wide range of investigations in the past, the length of time required for them to report, three years in the case of the beef tribunal, and the enormous costs associated with them, again in the case of the beef tribunal measured in millions of pounds, has understandably resulted in people asking if there is a better way?</P>
    <P>There has, I know, been a knee-jerk response to that question from Members of the House, particularly those who serve on committees, who feel that such investigations could more properly be carried out by committees at distinctly less cost to the public purse and with greater expendition.  I, too, think these would be desirable but my experience in getting the heads of this legislation transformed into the shape of the Bill before us at least provided me with a rudimentary and, at times, frustrating education in the requirements of our Constitution in relation to natural justice, constitutional justice and fair procedures.  The fruits of those lessons have been embodied in various sections of the Bill which have the effect of imposing restraints on the manner in which committees using its provisions will have to operate, providing detailed procedures and certain rights of reply and representation.</P>
    <P>The Bill gives committees strong coercive powers backed by serious penalties but there is a price to be paid for using them.  That price is the sacrifice of the free-ranging, often spontaneous and sometimes idiosyncratic questioning to <Col N="1075" /> which Deputies often productively resort.  That price may even be the replacement of the traditional chairpersons of committees by new chairpersons more disposed to restrict members to pre-ordained lines of inquiry.  I do not see the committees involved utilizing the powers this Bill contains at all times. It will be a matter for each committee to determine when it is desirable to do so and perhaps for the Committee on Procedure and Privileges to lay down some overall procedural guidelines about how the transition from traditional to &ldquo;compelling&rdquo; procedures should be activated.</P>
    <P>That said, I do expect that the strengthened role of the committees involved will restrict the need for future tribunals.  Evasiveness in parliamentary questions become a less attractive option when the possibility exists of frustrated Deputies or their colleagues looking behind the answer to the documentary and other information on which it was based.  I am reinforced in this belief by the judgment of the beef tribunal chairman, who said his inquiry might not have been required had fuller information been provided to this House.</P>
    <P>Before I speak about the specific proposals contained in the Bill, it is important to note that this Bill is not the first of its kind to be debated and enacted by the Oireachtas, although it is potentially more fundamental and wide ranging than its predecessors.  Once off legislation has been used twice in the past to confer absolute privilege for specific inquiries, most recently under the terms of the Select Committee on Legislation and Security of Dáil Éireann (Privilege and Immunity) Act, 1994, which investigated the fall of the last Government and under the terms of the Committee of Public Accounts of Dáil Éireann (Privilege and Procedure) Act, 1970 which investigated the arms crisis. That included a compellability provision, although as with the other provisions in the Act, this was confined to one specific inquiry.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1076" /> The specific provisions of the Bill are set out in the explanatory memorandum and I do not intend nor wish to confuse the Members of the House by now focusing on the minutiae of very complex legislation when the Members can read the detail for themselves.</P>
    <P>I refer to the major provisions contained in the Bill.  As I have already stated, the central aim of the legislation is to grant to those Oireachtas committees, who have contained in their terms of reference the provision to call for persons, papers and records, the power to call witnesses and evidence while also allowing those witnesses to speak or offer documents in evidence freely without fear.  The Bill does not specify which committees fall into this category.  It is for this House and the Seanad to determine individually or jointly, in framing the orders of reference of existing or new committees, whether they are to have the specific powers to send for persons, papers and records which automatically bring into play the powers conferred by this Bill.</P>
    <P>At present, the committees which fall into this category include the Joint Committee on Commercial State-Sponsored Bodies, the Joint Committee on the Family, the Committee of Public Accounts, the Joint Committee on Small Business and Services, the Joint Committee on Sustainable Development and the Joint Committee on Women's Rights.</P>
    <P>Under the terms of the Bill, virtually anyone a committee believes can provide information relevant to their mandate can be compelled to appear before them or provide evidence.  This applies to individual members of the general public.  The Taoiseach, the Tánaiste, Ministers, Ministers of State and their officials are all compellable.  In the case of civil servants, only one restriction applies &mdash; they are debarred in giving evidence from expressing opinions in relation to the merits of policy.  This restriction extends to the Garda Síochána and members of the Permanent Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1077" /> In keeping with convention, the President and members of the Judiciary are exempt from the application of this legislation.  There are two possible contentious additions to this list.  The Attorney General has, in addition to his role as legal adviser to the Government, other recognised functions which he exercises independently, for instance his role as defender of the public interest. As such, he and his staff will not, under this Bill, be compellable.  He is, however, responsible for the general administration of the State's legal offices and in that capacity will be compellable before the committee of Public Accounts.  A somewhat wider exemption is accorded to the Director of Public Prosecutions.  In the light of developments last week, I am less convinced that this should still apply.  The Taoiseach dealt with this matter at Question Time today.  It is our intention to bring forward amendments on Committee Stage to provide for compellability for the Director of Public Prosecutions and the details of that will be available in due course.</P>
    <P>There are, I think, two other elements of this Bill which will draw fire in this House.  The first of these is the list of matters to which compellability will not in any instance apply.  This list is short and, I think, focused with reasonable precision.  In preparing the Bill we did not find it easy to strike a universally agreed balance in areas where disclosure could in many instances pose unusual difficulties for sensitive Government operations.  What we have come up with incorporates into the proposed law the requirements of Cabinet confidentiality as they now stand, protection of State security and criminal matters as well as tax assessment information and matters <i>sub judice.</i></P>
    <P>I believe we have arrived at a reasonable balance and the <i>sub judice</i> exemption may illustrate the point.  This provision has already drawn the fire of some Deputies in the light of the relaxation of the <i>sub judice</i> rule in the House's own proceedings.  This Bill does <Col N="1078" /> not trammel the House or any committee in discussing matters which are the subject matter of court proceedings; what it does is preclude a committee from utilizing its powers of compellability to question a witness and force him or her to disclose information which could prejudice him or her in the context of such proceedings.</P>
    <P>A second category of exemptions which we have provided for deals in the main with issues of commercial or personal privacy.  We have provided two distinct mechanisms to deal with disputes as to whether particular information falls into this category.  One involves what, for convenience, I may term an &ldquo;official witness&rdquo;&mdash; a Garda, a member of the Permanent Defence Forces or a civil servant.  If they claim that the information falls into one of these categories and the committee disputes that claim, the matter is settled by the issue of a certificate by the Taoiseach, but the Taoiseach is entitled to refuse such a certificate on the facts of the case or, despite accepting that it falls into those categories, if he or she considers disclosure to be in the public interest.</P>
    <P>The second mechanism applies to other witnesses where the fact of the matter is determined by the High Court. Instances may arise where, while it is clear that the information comes within the specified categories, the committee is convinced that obtaining it is vital to its inquiries.  In that event, it is left to the Public Offices Commission to determine whether the balance of public interest warrants disclosure &mdash; with the possibility of an appeal by either party to the High Court.</P>
    <P>The core provisions on compellability and privilege have gone into this Bill &mdash; a battalion of ancillary provisions larger than I or any parliamentarian initially envisaged or wished for.  The provisions are essentially safeguards, there to protect witnesses' rights and the rights of third parties to whom there may be allusions in the course of a committee's proceedings and to give explicit statutory recognition to the right &mdash; already acknowledged by the courts &mdash; of a <Col N="1079" /> member of the Oireachtas not to reveal the source of information provided to him or her.</P>
    <P>While the focus of these safeguards is on those outside this House, they are intended to fulfil another and more vital function.  They are intended to arm the committees with an essential protection to ensure that nothing in their manner of proceeding will provide a weapon which can be successfully deployed in the courts to frustrate Members of this House in exercising, through a revamped committee system, their essential role as guardians of the public well-being.</P>
    <P>I do not claim the Bill cannot be improved and I know I speak for the Minister of State, Deputy Doyle, in this regard.  As it proceeds through the House, we will be open to suggestions as to how it might be perfected.  Subject to that caveat, I commend it to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this long awaited Bill. When I first read it I gave it a guarded welcome, but the more I examined its nuts and bolts the more I found it to be fraught with difficulties.  In his press release, and again today, the Minister at least acknowledged that it can be improved.  It is unfortunate, therefore, that he has passed what is, in effect, a poisoned chalice to the Minister of State, Deputy Doyle, to deal with in the House.  However, it is her responsibility to bring more transparency and accountability into public office and I wish her well in that respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was taken by a number of the Minister's comments.  He was a member of a previous Government but he appeared to come into this Government believing it would change the world and, to a large extent, that is what it led the public to believe.  However, in his speech he stated, &ldquo;when we came into Government, that vision was made real by the <Col N="1080" /> influence we bring to bear on expenditure decisions, on spending programmes, on tax strategy...&rdquo;  The Minister appears to acknowledge now that while it may be possible to seek changes while in Opposition, it is difficult to bring them to fruition when in Government.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Taoiseach's response to questions from Deputy Harney and me regarding the position of the DPP. However, if it were not for Marian Finucane's intervention in this matter, the Government would not have acceded to our request that the DPP should be treated in more or less the same fashion as the Attorney General.  It is obvious that in drafting the Bill it did not propose to allow the DPP to come before the Oireachtas committee.  However, because of the fortunate coincidence of the DPP going on &ldquo;Liveline&rdquo;&mdash; apparently unbeknownst to his political masters &mdash; the Government was caught in a bind in that it was ludicrous that a man of his stature, dealing with very sensitive matters, was able to go on a talk show but not able to come before a committee of the Oireachtas.  Hence, the Government's welcome conversion last week, but I await with bated breath the relevant amendment.  On Question Time today the Taoiseach appeared to suggest, at least by shaking his head, that it was not intended the DPP would come before the Committee of Public Accounts.  We will await the relevant amendment in that regard.</P>
    <P>The way in which this Bill has been drafted copperfastens the view that this is the most secretive Government in the history of the State, a Government that came into office on a wave of openness, transparency and accountability.  It gives me great pleasure to read the programme, <i>A Government of Renewal,</i> which the Government introduced at the fall of the last Government when members of some of the parties &mdash; Fine Gael and Democratic Left in particular &mdash; were surprised beyond their wildest belief that they were going into Government.  In the second paragraph of that programme it is stated:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1081" /> Government, too, belongs to the people.  But the relationship between Government and the people it served has been damaged by a lack of openness.  This relationship must be renewed.</P>
    <P>Those are great ideas but, unfortunately, in the past year we have witnessed obfuscation and a lack of openness at every turn.  While I accept the peace process is a sensitive matter, on Question Time today the Taoiseach, in effect, refused to answer merited questions on that subject.  The same applied to a question on the granting of indemnity to Ministers involved in legal proceedings.  In its programme the Government pledged to, &ldquo;reform our institutions at a national and local level to provide service, accountability, transparency and freedom of information.</P>
    <P>One example of how difficult this has made his situation is in regard to the Joint Committee on Commercial Semi-State Bodies.  Paragraph 23 of the programme for Government states this committee's remit will be widened &ldquo;in particular to enable the committee to investigate any matter involving unethical behaviour by a particular semi-State body in connection with its business or by any of its board members or employees.&rdquo;  What better vehicle for investigating the Lowry affair debacle than this committee?  If the Government had any willingness to have it properly investigated, it could have amended the terms of reference of that committee and not blocked everything.  It pledged to do this in its programme for Government.</P>
    <P>This Government also introduced a change to the repeat rule.  The Minister referred in his speech to the chairman of the Beef Tribunal, who said that if wider information had been given in this Chamber there might not have been any need for a tribunal.  That may be true but this Government introduced a repeat rule which, despite our objections, has made it more difficult for the Opposition to secure answers to questions instead of making the situation <Col N="1082" /> more open and transparent.  I challenged the Minister of State responsible for Dáil reform, Deputy Doyle, to bring this matter forward immediately.  It is acknowledged not only by those on the other side but also by the staff in the House that this change has made matters more closed and I await a Government amendment in that respect.</P>
    <P>The Government says it is bringing forward a referendum on the possible relaxation of Cabinet confidentiality. There is an exclusion in this Bill in relation to Cabinet discussions.  I understand &mdash; I stand to be corrected &mdash; that the Minister, in his briefing on this Bill to the correspondents, stated that in the event of this referendum passing and there being a relaxation of Cabinet confidentiality, this Bill may have to be amended.  The Taoiseach said no such thing to me last week and I will check the record.  There appears to be a conflict between the Minister, his Minister of State and the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>The Government has pledged to reform the Ministers and Secretaries Act to give more responsibility to secretaries of Departments.  Members and anyone with experience of Government acknowledges it is ludicrous and unfair to make Ministers responsible for every scintilla of correspondence and other matters that pass through Departments and there must be reform in that respect.  Heads of Departments or sections of Departments must be responsible for the work in their Department.  They are there every day and are getting paid for this.  It is their job to ensure matters are done properly. Politicians going into Government find it difficult to understand why they are responsible for every item that goes through other people's hands &mdash; there were examples of this last year. However, because of the hierarchical structure of our public service the Minister is ultimately responsible.  We put together a strategic management initiative when in Government which tried to address the matter in a broad way and see what changes could be made and I <Col N="1083" /> expect this Government to carry on with this initiative.</P>
    <P>This Government promised Oireachtas reform in its programme.  It said it would make the Dáil more effective, efficient and businesslike.  All we have seen, especially with regard to the questioning of the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, Deputy Lowry, is obfuscation and blocking.  It flies in the face of everything this Government has said.</P>
    <P>It promised to complete and publish this Bill in its programme for Government and did so.  However, it went on to say that &ldquo;following enactment of the Bill, a committee of investigation will be formed to investigate matters of serious public concern from time to time.&rdquo;  That flies in the face of what the Minister said today.  He seemed to say that type of response was a knee jerk reaction and it would be far better to leave it up to tribunals.  I have some sympathy with that statement, but the Government said when in Opposition that it would introduce a committee of investigation when it put this programme together. Where does it stand now?  When the Minister replies, perhaps he can say if a committee of investigation will be allowed to be set up from time to time to investigate these issues.</P>
    <P>I spent some time going through the debate on the once off Bill to which the Minister referred last year.  When we had the difficulty of bringing the then Attorney General, Eoghan Fitzsimons, before the Select Committee on Legislation and Security, we pointed out long before he came that any witness coming before this sub-committee would have difficulties with privilege and compellability.  We were accused at the time by some of the Minister's party members of filibustering, but we were proved right in the end when a Bill had to be put through to give some sort of protection to these witnesses.  Even then the Bill did not contain any provisions on the compelling of witnesses to come before that committee.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1084" /> The Minister of State at the Department of the Marine, Deputy Gilmore, made some interesting contributions on this Bill this time last year.  He stated:</P>
    <P>One of the reasons we have failed up to now to have the type of procedure in place in Ireland is that we have inherited the most centralised and most secretive systems of public administration anywhere in the world. Our entire public administration is surrounded by a culture of secrecy which promotes the idea that the people should not know, that they do not have the right to know and when they ask questions, they should be provided with the minimum of information.  What passes for public accountability when Ministers are asked parliamentary questions is an exercise in avoiding straightforward answers.  Replies to parliamentary questions are masterpieces in avoiding what is actually asked.</P>
    <P>Deputy Shatter referred to the speech made by the then Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Dempsey, by stating:</P>
    <P>He has failed to understand the central point which is the responsibility of a Government to be accountable to this House and the responsibility of the Taoiseach and Ministers, when asked questions, to give a full and truthful account of events in which they have been involved and for which they are constitutionally responsible to this House.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell said:</P>
    <P>A new position of inspector general or general accounting officer should be created.  Such persons would be accountable to the Ceann Comhairle and the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and they would have unimpeded access to even the most secret file, be asked to establish the truth of matters in cases where there are well established concerns and to report to the committee, who in turn would report to the House...</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1085" /> ... A Bill should be brought forward outlining the powers and duties of the Ceann Comhairle in ensuring that Ministers give comprehensive answers in the House and are not protected by outdated procedures or rulings.</P>
    <P>Where do Deputy Mitchell and his Government colleagues stand now?  The unfortunate Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, Deputy Lowry, did everything but answer the questions put to him in this House. There are 22 committees of the House, sub-committees and party committees. Sometimes I wonder how we manage to man all these committees and I pity some of the smaller parties in that regard.</P>
    <P>We must provide increased resources not just for Deputies but for committees as the more power we give them the more resources they need.  Unless we do so this legislation will be for nought. Those of us who sat on the sub-committee last year wondered whether we could employ a legal adviser.  Finally we were given that facility but it occurred to someone that the only person to whom we could go for advice was the Attorney General whose office was an issue in the committee's investigations. Committees that are given the facility to compel witnesses to appear before them must have legal advice available to them which is not from the Office of the Attorney General</P>
    <P>The Bill grants High Court privilege to witnesses which is a half-way house between qualified privilege and absolute privilege.  The Minister was correct when he said witnesses are at a disadvantage when they appear before committees in that the playing pitch is not level.</P>
    <P>Members of the House have absolute privilege under the Constitution which, unfortunately, was abused by some of those who are now in Government.  It happened recently when the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, Deputy Lowry, mentioned people who are not Members.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1086" /> As a result of the intervention of Marian Finucane the Government decided to include the Director of Public Prosecutions among those who may be called before a committee.  Why is the Director of Public Prosecutions treated differently from the Attorney General?  Obviously, the Attorney General had his hands on the Bill when it was drafted.  It is strange that although the two offices are somewhat similar they are treated differently.  The Attorney General has two separate roles and will come before committees to answer on his general administration of the office as legal adviser to the Government.  Yet he has another important role and that is overseeing the common good.  It is important that the Attorney General come before committees to answer questions on matters of public interest and the common good and I accept that the Government proposes to review this aspect of dividing the two roles.</P>
    <P>I am unhappy with the proposal to refuse to allow matters come before a committee which are <i>sub judice.</i> It is a blanket exclusion.  It should be up to the person alleging that the matter is <i>sub judice</i> to establish that it is the subject of proceedings and is at issue in those proceedings.  A person called before a committee need only issue a plenary summons and the matter will be before the courts.  It costs £55 to do that.  Alternatively they can put someone else up to issuing the plenary summons.  That may be a flaw in the Bill which should be amended on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>We changed the <i>sub judice</i> rule in the House, although it did not appear to be so in the controversy surrounding the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, so that it can be invoked only after notice of trial stage.</P>
    <P>I referred to the seeming difference of opinion between the Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, and the Taoiseach on the referendum on Cabinet confidentiality and Government discussions.  I await hearing the Government's response.</P>
    <P>Sections 6 and 7, and the other <Col N="1087" /> sections dealing with areas outside the scope of compellability but which may be included in certain circumstances, are convoluted.  I accept what the Minister said but I wonder why civil servants, members of the Garda Síochana and others are treated differently.  The Taoiseach is the final arbiter on such issues and I have difficulty with that.  If a commission was brought in as an appeals procedure there would have to be an appeal to the High Court.  Although this Government heralded change &mdash; openness, transparency, letting in the light and so on &mdash; this legislation is another example of its failure in that regard.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that if a person considers he or she has been impugned by something said at a committee, he or she can come before a committee to make a submission.  That is in line with the relaxation of the <i>sub judice</i> rule we brought in some time ago.  It would deal with situations like the recent one where the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, Deputy Lowry, said certain things about people outside the House.  It remains to been seen whether the procedures in relation to that incident will be borne out.</P>
    <P>I will go into more detail on the protection of people and fair procedures on Committee Stage.  Nothing in the Bill puts an onus on the committee to vindicate the good name of witnesses.  A section in the 1994 Bill, which related to the incidents which occured this time last year, obliged the committee to take all necessary steps to protect and vindicate the good name of witnesses.  This Bill is bald in that respect.</P>
    <P>The section 6 procedure differentiates between civil servants and others, which could cause constitutional difficulties.  If a non civil servant who appears before this committee believes he is in a quasi defendant situation, the only procedure to vindicate his name is through the section 6 procedure.  Yet under the Constitution, as interpreted in the Haughey case, he is entitled to cross-examine, get a copy of the statement and to a myriad of procedures which would allow his <Col N="1088" /> name to be vindicated.  A difference is being made between civil servants and non civil servants and, indeed, TDs and Senators who are being given more rights in section 5(2) &mdash; I suppose it has something to do with absolute privilege.</P>
    <P>While I welcome the Bill, it will be a grave disappointment to those who supported the change of Government. People who believed there would be a change for the better quickly began to realise this is the most secretive Government in the history of the State.  I look forward to Committee Stage where perhaps coincidental events, like the intervention of Marian Finucane, might prompt this Government, out of embarrassment, to change this Bill to something which it pointed to in <i>A Government of Renewal.</i> To a certain extent, the Government hoodwinked the public, but I suppose it will be given its answer at the next election, which I hope will be in the not too distant future.</P>
    <P>My party will not vote against the Bill on Second Stage, but we will put down substantial amendments on Committee Stage to tease out its provision to allow what most people feel is justified &mdash; opening up this House and the public administration of this State.  Unfortunately, the message must go out that this Government is not fulfilling the promises it made when it came into power. In a number of instances, it has tended to be more obstructive and secretive than any Government up to now.</P>

      <P>This Bill was long awaited.  It took a long time in the Departments and it was held up in the Department of Justice.  If it was properly laid before the House, it would change the nature of the Department of Justice and our democracy as it applies to Dáil Éireann and its committees.  It is clear the Bill was depleted by the Department of Justice because of the obsessive culture of secrecy which is <Col N="1089" /> part and parcel of the tradition in that Department.</P>
      <P>This Bill should be a major part of Dáil reform and the evolution of the committee system, which is only at a fledging stage.  We made a mistake allowing the committees to proliferate unnecessarily to 22.  The main legislative committees would deal well with Committee Stages of Bills and inquiries, should they be necessary.  The proliferation of committees serves to diminish the endeavours and time of Deputies and Senators.  The commmittee system is in need of a mid-term review.  As my party Whip, I will bring forward such proposals in the context of Dáil reform. We must look at committees to see how we can amend them.  While they are important they need to be looked at with review in mind.</P>
      <P>This long awaited Bill is intended to enhance the power of committees which have been disabled by not having the power to compel witnesses to attend or to offer them privilege as regards statements they may make.  Movitation for the Bill was the need to give power to the committees to take evidence and to compel witnesses to attend, yet a menu of issues and people who are exempt from the Bill are listed.  That is a negative way to approach what should be very positive legislation.  It places a gag on public servants, for example.  Section 14 prohibits a civil servant from expressing any subjective opinion on the merits of any Government policy or from producing or sending any document expressing such an opinion to a committee.  Even if a civil servant expressed an opinion, the committee is prohibited from disclosing such a breach of the Act except to the superiors of the civil servant.</P>
      <P>The Bill gives considerable powers to the Taoiseach which constitutes a type of veto on matters which can go to the committee.  If an application is made to the Taoiseach for a range of reasons, including the security of the state, the Taoiseach may place a veto on the committee dealing with that issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The rule on Cabinet confidentiality is <Col N="1090" /> expanded in this Bill.  The <i>sub judice</i> rule is also covered in the Bill.  Any matter that is <i>sub judice</i> may not be dealt with by an inquiring committee.</P>
    <P>It is very important that the inquiring role of the Dáil be extended.  The Dáil is a legislative body but the role of Parliament as a body to inquire into matters of public interest and make findings on such matters where the need arises is also very important.  That role is seriously hampered at present and is not very much helped by the Bill.  A wide range of issues, which should be properly included if the Bill is to have relevance in enhancing the inquiring role of the Dáil, is excluded.</P>
    <P>One of the office holders of the State excluded from the Bill is the DPP.  That exclusion is unacceptable and I said so when the Bill was published.  For two years I have put questions to the Taoiseach about the office of the DPP.  Currently that is the only mechanism of accountability, albeit limited, open to Members of the House.  The Taoiseach believes that raising questions on the office of the DPP causes the office to be overly politicised.  It is necessary in the public interest to pursue that matter if only to illustrate that the only way to elicit information on prosecution policy is by way of parliamentary questions.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Taoiseach's announcement today at Question Time that the Bill is to be changed to allow a greater degree of answerability and accountability on behalf of the Director of Public Prosecutions.  An annual report will be published and debated in the House. A welcome development is that the DPP is to be amenable to committees of the House.  I will immediately arrange for an invitation to be sent to the Director of Public Prosecutions to attend the Select Committee on Legislation and Security where issues of prosecution policy and statistical information on the operation of that office may be discussed.  There has been a lack of administrative accountability by the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions.  I said in the past and I reiterate that it is unacceptable that such an important <Col N="1091" /> arm of the criminal justice system operates almost as an independent republic.</P>
    <P>Today the Ombudsman, who has published an excellent annual report, willingly attended the Select Committee on Legislation and Security without prejudice to his independence &mdash; his is necessarily an extremely independent office.  The Ombudsman believes his independence is not prejudiced by providing for a degree of openness and accountability to the committee.  I look forward to the Director of Public Prosecutions and members of his office attending the committee to discuss modifications in prosecution policy, difficulties that may arise and proposals for reform.  Independence can survive a greater degree of answerability and I welcome the Government decision to allow for that.</P>
    <P>A range of issues is excluded from the Bill.  The exclusion of matters relating to criminal prosecution is unacceptable.  As I understand it, the position of the Garda Commissioner is not covered in the Bill.  A difficulty arose previously when the Garda Commissioner refused to attend a committee.  At a time when crime is a priority it is vital that every opportunity is taken to allow the Dáil to be effective in dealing with policy issues that directly affect crime.  There must be an ability to influence operational matters in terms of policing, particularly in urban areas in the context of the drugs crisis.  Many people believe that politicians have lost the war against crime and that matters are out of control.  That is very dangerous in a democracy.  The belief that there is inadequate contact between elected representatives and the people who make decisions on operational matters on the ground contributes to that perception.  There needs to be more accountability in regard to policing.  It is important that we debate policing and prosecution policies and other matters that impact on criminality. There are inadequate mechanisms in the House to bring about an impact on the escalating crime rate.</P>
    <P>Section 6 provides that a person is not <Col N="1092" /> obliged to give evidence or produce any document where the evidence or document relates to information specified in section 6 (9).  That information consists of information given to the witness in confidence by any other person without that person's permission; information relating to business, professional or occupational information which might prejudice the witness; information relating to the family life or other private affairs &mdash; whatever that means &mdash; of a person; and information which might be prejudicial to the State in its relations with other states.  A declaration by the Taoiseach made under section 7 effectively prevents debate on the issues on which it is made.  The Taoiseach is given a virtual veto over significant areas of potential investigation.  One can only imagine that invocation of the confidential clause in section 6(9) (a) will benefit any person who wishes to avoid giving embarrassing evidence.  Despite its controversial elements, Cabinet confidentiality protection is firmly established in this Bill.  That is a very dubious rule and one on which reform has been long promised.  It is extended in the Bill to proceedings at a committee appointed by the Government whose membership consists of public servants.</P>
    <P>The Select Committee on Legislation and Security is expressly prohibited from giving direction to any person to give evidence in respect of any matter regarding the security of the State.  The &ldquo;security of the State&rdquo; is a very wide, catch-all phrase which has been used down the years by successive Ministers for Justice to avoid giving information on matters they did not wish to be released into the public domain.  It is a very open-ended phrase.  The Government has a stated commitment to review the Official Secrets Act and bring in a freedom of information Bill.  The fact that there are so many exclusions from the Bill flies in the face of the commitment on open Government.  There should be a presumption that all information should be freely available unless there are particular reasons for doing otherwise.  At present, however, the <Col N="1093" /> Official Secrets Act imposes a blanket ban on most State information.</P>
    <P>The exclusion of the Attorney General may also be controversial.  I understand that a compromise was reached with the Attorney General whereby he would be accountable only for the operations of his office but not for any other matter.  Looking back at a recent controversy in the Office of the Attorney General, that would exclude calling the Attorney General or the chief legal assistant to discuss a matter such as not answering the letters relating to Fr. Brendan Smyth.  Does the Bill make that situation worse?  At least at that time there was the possibility of calling witnesses and hearing the evidence of senior officials in the Office of the Attorney General.  It appears that this Bill places a restriction on that.</P>
    <P>There is a reluctance throughout the Bill to offer real accountability &mdash; it will have to be comprehensively amended during its passage through the House &mdash; which is unfortunate because this was an opportunity for the Government to make a strong statement about its determination to change the administration of Government into an open system rather than a closed and restricted one. Apart from the publication of this Bill, there has been no effort to deal with the difficulties experienced by Deputies on a daily basis with regard to answering Dáil questions.  The only means available to a Dáil Deputy of holding the Government to account is through parliamentary questions.  My experience, as a persistent poser of such questions, is that the house is constantly misled by the manner in which parliamentary questions are answered.</P>
    <P>Mr. Justice Hamilton, in his report on the beef tribunal, placed much emphasis on the fact that the débâcle could have been avoided if parliamentary questions had been properly answered.  The lessons which should have been learned from the beef tribunal have been forgotten or not heeded and the standard and quality of parliamentary replies have <Col N="1094" /> deteriorated.  I have frequently been disappointed to receive one line replies to quite complicated parliamentary questions and thwarted &mdash; like many Deputies &mdash; by the repeat rule which is constantly used as a way to avoid awkward questions.  Another method by which parliamentary questions can be avoided is the transfer of questions from one Department to another.  A question that contains argument is likewise ruled out of order.</P>
    <P>If the Taoiseach and the Cabinet are serious about learning the lessons of the past about real accountability, the parliamentary questions system should be examined in a comprehensive way.  If necessary, the Civil Service will have to be retrained in how to answer such questions.  At present, the Government can hide successfully and mislead the Dáil through the many obstacles which are there specifically to confuse Deputies or to keep them in the dark. That is well known by Ministers, the Opposition and civil servants.  Each Government has the capacity to come a cropper as a result of the failure to reply properly to parliamentary questions.</P>
    <P>One section of the Bill provides for financial penalties in respect of any person who refuses to attend before a Dáil committee.  One can imagine wealthy members of society who would prefer to pay the fine rather than expose themselves to cross-examination by a Dáil committee.  What would happen if, for example, the Garda Commissioner, the Attorney General or the DPP refused to attend before a Dáil committee? Even though the Taoiseach has said that the DPP will now be amenable to a Dáil committee, there will still be opportunities under the Bill to rule out his attendance on the grounds that the committee is dealing with one of the excluded issues.  It might be a matter in respect of the security of the State or information kept for the purposes of preventing, detecting or investigating offences or apprehending or prosecuting offenders.  If it is something which he discussed with a civil servant and the Attorney General it could be excluded <Col N="1095" /> on the grounds that it is a Cabinet sub-committee.</P>
    <P>This Bill has an attitude problem.  Its stated task is to give powers to a Dáil committee.  It gives the power but quickly takes it away by excluding important office holders of State and a huge range of issues which may not be the subject of evidence given to a committee.</P>
    <P>The Ombudsman in his annual report and when he spoke to the Select Committee on Legislation and Security this morning dealt at length with the issue of administrative accountability.  That has not been discussed at great length in the House.  Members are very conscious of political accountability but administrative accountability has not matured well in this State.  There is a need for civil servants to be made more accountable for their work.  There is a need for maladministration to be identified and procedures put in place to address it when it occurs.  Many of our citizens, as evidenced by the number of complaints to the Ombudsman, encounter maladministration in the public service, the health boards, local authorities and wherever the State interfaces with the citizen.  The work done by the Office of the Ombudsman is crucially important in maintaining the goodwill of citizens for our democracy.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State is involved with public service reform and with the strategic management initiative which will go a long way towards increasing accountability and answerability and, we hope, improve administrative procedures throughout the public service. That work is long overdue and the Minister will have the support of our party in that regard.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for secret court proceedings.  There is a proposal to have High Court applications determined otherwise than in public.  That is a complex section and we will have to look at it in detail on Committee Stage.  We were extremely disappointed with the Bill when published.  As it stands it does not improve the position.  It needs to be <Col N="1096" /> drastically amended and we will be tabling amendments to it.  I do not see the point in putting a gag on public servants as it defeats the purpose of the Bill.  A prohibition on a civil servant from expressing an opinion on the merits of Government policy or from producing or sending to a committee a document expressing such an opinion flies in the face of the promised review of the Official Secrets Act and the introduction of a freedom of information Bill.  It is driving a coach and four through the provisions of the legislation. If we are serious about allowing a committee system a full inquiry capacity, we should not replicate in this Bill procedures and a culture of secrecy which we are trying to eliminate from other Bills by way of a promised reform of the Official Secrets Act and the introduction of a freedom of information Bill. On those scores we are highly critical of the Bill in that it reflects an attitude problem regarding promised open Government.</P>
    <P>Regarding the accountability of the DPP, I warmly welcome the Government's indication that it will amend the Bill as published to allow for an annual report from that office and for the DPP to be amenable to a Dáil committee. That is extremely important given the widespread dissatisfaction about the lack of accountability and the general lack of checks and balances on the exercise of the important discretionary power to prosecute.  It is a generally held view that the independence of the office will not be prejudiced by allowing greater checks and balances, an annual report and a much improved victim liaison service ensuring that the victims of crime will be elevated in status under the criminal justice system.  It must be fully recognised that the victim of a crime is as important as the accused.  We can start by reforming the Office of the DPP to reflect that sensitivity and the importance the State places on an individual who has been harmed by a criminal act.  That would go a long way towards improving the position.</P>
    <P>Given the announcement that the <Col N="1097" /> DPP will be amenable to a Dáil committee, I presume I may still table questions to the Taoiseach regarding the DPP's accountability.  During the past few months the Taoiseach has been reluctant to deal with issues relating to the DPP.  I have been accused of political sniping and of overly politicising the office of the DPP, but my efforts have been worth it.  I believe I had the support of the thousands of people who felt aggrieved by the operations of a high office of State which failed to adopt procedures sympathetic to the needs of the victims of crime.  The independence of that office can survive accountability, answerability and reviewability.  I look forward to the DPP coming into the House to answer Deputies' questions without fear.  There is nothing to be afraid of in measured accountability&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I give a qualified welcome to the Bill. I qualify it because I am here long enough to know that reforming legislation has come before the House in the past only to be buried somewhere along the line.  We will wait to see how the legislation will perform and how the Government of the day wants it to perform before we pass final judgment on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two main elements to the Bill, that of privilege and compellability, something we have been seeking for many years, but it has been sought more enthusiastically in recent months <Col N="1098" /> because we have seen the committee system virtually grind to a halt.</P>
    <P>The figure of 22 committees has been mentioned.  That reminds me of the famous parliamentary committee in Britain known as the Committee of 22. As I stated in a debate several weeks ago, it is my belief that we could do with as few as six or seven committees and that 22 is far in excess of what is needed. Most of the committees have become almost irrelevant and certainly do not justify their existence.  Perhaps this legislation will regenerate the type of enthusiasm that prevailed when the committees were originally mooted and formed.</P>
    <P>Politics is all about answerability, not transparency or accountability.  The public want answers to the questions they ask daily as a result of the problems that arise in society.  They want real answers to real problems.  What happens here is by and large irrelevant to the vast majority of the public; it is a cosmetic exercise.  That is why I give this legislation a qualified welcome.  If it works and we get answers and make progress as a result we will all applaud it, but we will wait to see if that will be the case.</P>
    <P>This House is seen by the public as not doing a meaningful job.  It is not seen to give answers or to solve the problems.  The main problem is the epidemic of violence on our streets and in our countryside.  It is not confined any longer to the inner city regions of Dublin, it is nationwide in every town, village and rural area.  It is not the fault of the present Minister for Justice.  It has been with us for years and has grown and spread like an epidemic disease which is eating into the core of our society.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate, as proposed in the Bill, that members of the Garda Síochána will not be allowed to express their opinions on matters when they attend these committees.  Of course, they should be allowed to do so as they are in the front line, they are harassed and insulted daily and are not protected by this House or by the laws which have <Col N="1099" /> been implemented over the years.  They see the breakdown of law and order daily at first hand.  Surely they are the people who, first and foremost, should be asked for an opinion as to how the problem should be solved and the root causes of the problem.  I take issue with that part of the legislation in particular.</P>
    <P>I would not be averse to having the Judiciary appear before the committees to express an opinion because they see how crazy some of the laws are and their ineffectiveness in controlling the crime epidemic.  The whole thing has resulted in a tremendous drop in morale.  People do not see the point in going to the Garda to complain about robberies, assaults, even serious assaults or serious crime, because they feel the Garda do not have the resources and the courts do not have the powers to solve their problems.  In other words, they feel the whole system has become irrelevant and that it is the case of &ldquo;look after yourself because nobody is prepared to take care of you&rdquo;.  That is a shocking indictment of the whole system and of this House.  If the powers, which are being introduced in this Bill, help the committees to improve the position we would all be delighted but my experience has been the contrary. We will await the legislation to see how it works in effect.</P>
    <P>In the past people &mdash; some of whom are employees of the State &mdash; who should have been delighted to come before the committees, give evidence and explain to the Members what they feel should be done have refused to attend.  I refer specifically to the Garda Commissioner who, last July, refused to attend a meeting of the Joint Committee on the Family which wished to speak to him about the drugs problem.  He said it was not a matter for him but a matter for the Department of Education.  I could not think of a more ludicrous answer to a very serious problem.  It is a shocking state of affairs that the highest preventative law officer in the country should decline to appear before a committee, which merely wanted to discuss <Col N="1100" /> a very serious problem with him.  It is indicative of the attitude in high places within the whole Civil Service and the State sector that you could thumb your nose at authority, politicians and the Houses of the Oireachtas and get away with it.  That should not be the case.  If we are to solve the problems of this country we must do so in unison.  We cannot be in conflict.  That type of refusal was petty, unnecessary and ill-thought of by the public in general.</P>
    <P>The Garda and their representatives at all levels should be asked to give their opinions, contrary to what is stated in the Bill, before the Select Committee on Legislation and Security.  The committee was set up to solve crime problems here.  If they cannot express an opinion their contribution would be limited.</P>
    <P>As a member of several committees over many years I have found that one does not get the end result one might hope for because, I suppose, primarily it has to do with Irish society and its parochial nature.  In other countries with large populations decisions are made on the basis of whether they are right or wrong.  In our society, far too often decisions are made on the basis of who you know rather than what you know.</P>
    <P>As a member of the Joint Committee on Commercial State-sponsored Bodies for several years, I found it a most frustrating experience.  I put it down to what I call parochialism and a large dose of the old pals' act.  It was not an investigative committee as its parameters would lead one to believe.  All the major issues seem to be sidetracked because of the fear of offending somebody in authority in a State or semi-State body.  That is a shocking indictment of the system.  I do not see how the legislation we are introducing will improve the position very much but, hopefully it will.  If people want to be evasive and if Members of the committee are willing to accept that, the new legislation will not achieve any additional purpose.</P>
    <P>There are tremendous problems within the State-sponsored bodies, many of which have come to the surface in recent times although we have known <Col N="1101" /> of their existence for many years.  There has never been any real attempt to solve them.  If the will is not there to pursue matters that need to be pursued the whole purpose of the committees and of this legislation will be defeated.  There is no point in bringing people in and giving them the softly softly treatment when there is a need to ask pertinent questions, for example, why they are losing tens of millions of pounds every year; why they are grossly overstaffed; why they should not be profit-making when they have every advantage in their favour, such as a monopoly.  Those pertinent questions are not asked and even if they are they are not answered.  My experience is that the majority of members of committees often go along with the softly softly approach and the easy way out.</P>
    <P>Some committee chairmen have shown a fine example in their leadership and in their investigative role.  I do not say this because Deputy Jim Mitchell is present.  His committees have always been a shining beacon when it comes to questioning and investigation of certain actions.  He has shown good example in not letting people off the hook by asking relevant questions and demanding relevant answers.</P>
    <P>The point has been made that if this legislation had been in place several years ago, the beef tribunal would not have taken place thereby saving the State at least £40 million.  That raises the question of whether witnesses will be allowed bring their legal representatives with them into the committee.  Will they be able to do what witnesses before committees in America do, namely, plead the Fifth Amendment if the question they are being asked is likely to indict them?  Will we see legal teams accompanying witnesses who have been compelled to attend before committees to answer pertinent questions?  Can they refuse to answer those questions on the basis that they might indict themselves?</P>
    <P>Will the Minister allude to that in her reply because there is a danger that legal teams will attend virtually all committee meetings, that legal fees will be <Col N="1102" /> enormous and that the High Court or the Supreme Court will find that the Oireachtas, and therefore the taxpayer, is liable for the legal fees in question.</P>
    <P>I can envisage a situation in which a series of tribunals would be held simultaneously.  Leinster House would become more like the Four Courts than the location of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Members would ask each other which committee they are attending, the witnesses appearing before it and the legal teams accompanying them.</P>
    <P>These issues will have to be teased out.  This House introduces legislation, and judges frequently complain that we do not do our job properly and, as a result, they are required to let murderers and others who have committed serious crimes go free.  We must tie up all the loose ends so that the whole system does not become a bonanza for legal eagles.  We must ensure it does not become unworkable because of High Court writs being issued.  This House must be supreme when it comes to law making and we must ensure those laws cannot be challenged or if they are, they will not be overturned in our courts.  I have no doubt this question has occurred to other Members.</P>
    <P>In his contribution the Minister stated the Bill does not trammel the House or any committee in discussing matters which are the subject of court proceedings but precludes a committee from utilising its powers of compellability to question a witness and force him or her to disclose information which could prejudice him or her in the context of such proceedings.  It is obvious, therefore, that if somebody is involved in litigation, we can forget about bringing him before committees of this House.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated also that evasiveness in answering parliamentary questions becomes a less attractive option when the posibility exists of frustrated Deputies or their colleagues looking behind the answer to the documentary and other information on which it is based.  That is laughable and <Col N="1103" /> is a clear admission that there is massive evasion when it comes to answering questions in this House.  That is nothing new; it has been true of Governments and Ministers for years.  There is not just evasiveness in answering questions but in getting to the point of the question. As I often pointed out here, if there is a question on the Order Paper which might be embarrassing to the Government or to a particular Minister, Members filibuster on the preceding questions to ensure that question is not reached.</P>
    <P>The whole structure of Question Time and the issue of openness must be addressed.  The Bill does not specifically refer to this but the Minister referred to it in his contribution.  Evasiveness must be eliminated from politics because it reduces our credibility in the eyes of the public.  It is one of the reasons the public is extremely cynical.</P>
    <P>I am anxious to see this legislation working but I have seen so much well meaning legislation come to nothing in the past that I am a little dubious about this Bill.  I will wait to see how it translates into action.  If it translates into action and witnesses are compelled to come before committees and tell the truth, thereby making this House relevant and this country a better place in which to live, the introduction of this Bill will have been a good day's work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Dáil is virtually dead.  It is ridiculous that we should conduct our business in this Chamber today the way we have done since 1921.  Every day Members address empty chairs.  In so far as the Bill before us is another step along the road to reform, I warmly welcome it.  The difficulty of introducing reform, however, is highlighted by the fact that between June and December of 1993, I asked the then Taoiseach, Deputy Reynolds, and the Tánaiste, Deputy Spring, when this promised legislation would be introduced and on every occasion, up to the week before Christmas 1993, I was told the Bill would be circulated before Christmas. <Col N="1104" /> The week before Christmas 1993 I was told it would be circulated during the Christmas recess.  After the Christmas recess I was told it would be circulated during that session.  Two years later, we have a Bill on privilege and compellability, a long overdue measure on the road to parliamentary reform.</P>
      <P>This Bill is a great opportunity for the Dáil to get its house in order but we must be wary because of many of the points referred to by Deputy Deasy. From my experience both as the former chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts and current chairman of the Select Commitee on Finance and General Affairs, I know there is a danger that the excessive number of Members could undermine the powers we now seek to give to committees.</P>
      <P>It is difficult for polticians to avoid making political charges in the House. That is accepted among politicians, but compelling outside witnesses to appear before committees will greatly undo the work of those committees if politicians act in breach of natural justice or act politically rather than with balance and good sense.  For that reason this Bill will almost certainly have to be followed by either another Bill or detailed procedures as to how committees conduct their affairs.  A vital component of this reform will be the appropriate staffing of committees, which is currently a disaster.  Committees must have the appropriate number of staff as well as the appropriate expertise to carry out necessary research and preparation. More importantly, this legislation will not work unless and until there is established a legal services office within the Houses of the Oireachtas.  We cannot run down to the Four Courts to seek quotations from three senior counsel each time we need legal advice on how we should proceed in order to observe the rules of natural justice.  Such a committee will have to be appointed if this legislation is to be effective.  Legal and, at times, procedural advice will have to be given on a daily basis.  Counsel may have to sit in on meetings if committees are to do their work properly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1105" /> When we talk about committees summoning and taking evidence from witnesses on oath &mdash; this is absolutely necessary &mdash; it has to be understood that they will remain political fora, not judicial fora.  It was evident when the subcommittee of the Select Committee on Legislation and Security was appointed to inquire into the events surrounding the fall of the previous Government that it would not work as it was a political committee representative of the composition of the Dáil.  This meant that the representatives of the outgoing Government were in a minority and were, in effect, to be investigated by the majority.  It has to be understood that committees of this House cannot expect to be treated seriously or as impartial assessors when they examine political questions.</P>
    <P>It is necessary and essential, however, that in future witnesses appearing before committees give evidence under oath.  For instance, witnesses appearing before the Committee of Public Accounts have never given evidence under oath.  It is, therefore, not an offence to give false or misleading evidence to the committee.  To do so under oath, however, is an offence.  If this is established the matter may be referred to the courts for decision and appropriate penalty.  As a former chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts and current chairman of the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs, I believe such a power is necessary to ensure committees are told the truth.</P>
    <P>The relevant provisions of the Bill appear to be wishy-washy.  I ask the Minister to clarify that in all cases witnesses appearing before committees will be expected to give evidence under oath.  This is fundamental.  If witnesses appearing before committees are allowed to be economic with the truth, to give misleading evidence or tell lies and get away with it because it is not considered to be an offence the committees will only be wasting their time.</P>
    <P>The party whip system, as we know it, will have to be eased.  This is an <Col N="1106" /> important consideration if the committee system is to work.  One of the reasons there are empty benches, even at Taoiseach's Question Time, is that everything is a foregone conclusion. This is destroying the House.  Even on minor matters Deputies are not allowed to think for themselves.  While Government and Opposition parties have to apply the whip on fundamental policy issues such as the budget the party whip system has been taken to ridiculous lengths.  If Deputies sneeze, they may lose the whip.  There was a time when this was withdrawn only where a Deputy voted against his party, but mere criticism or questioning of the line taken may now lead to expulsion.  This has deadened the House.</P>
    <P>The party whip system will have to be eased to liberate Members so that they may think for themselves and contribute to debates and the legislative process with greater freedom.  Not only would this not harm the Government, it would enhance it.  It must be remembered that the primary function of the Houses of the Oireachtas is to hold the Executive to account and keep it on its toes in the national interest.  If the Executive is able to exercise tight control of Parliament it will become lazy as it will not have to worry about Parliament.  Progressively, this is the trend in all parties represented in the House.  Another Bill should be introduced laying down guidelines under which Members would have liberty when it comes to voting on particular issues provided always that the party whip would be applied on fundamental policy issues.</P>
    <P>There is serious danger that a number of committees will cross each other's frontiers with the result that we may find ourselves in the ridiculous position where several committees want to summon the same witnesses thereby undermining the credibility of the Government.  There is a need to establish a co-ordinating committee to decide on the appropriate committee in the event of conflict.  I wish to give a case in point.</P>
    <P>The Select Committee on Finance <Col N="1107" /> and General Affairs is responsible for the Votes of the Office of the Attorney General and the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions.  The Attorney General appeared before the committee for the first time last week and the roof did not fall in.  The Select Committee on Legislation and Security may also want to question those two officers of State.</P>
    <P>The Joint Committee on the Family wanted the Garda Commissioner to appear before it.  I am sure, however, that the Select Committee on Legislation and Security believes that, if any committee is to have the power to summon the Garda Commissioner, it should fall within its remit.</P>
    <P>When I was chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts I recall that on one occassion I had to overrule the otherwise unanimous decision of the committee that it should summon witnesses from Telecom Éireann.  I ruled that it would be inappropriate for the committee to do so even though the matter did involve the expenditure of public moneys, that it would be more appropriate for the Select Committee on Enterprise and Economic Strategy which is responsible for overseeing the activities of the parent Department or, alternatively, the Joint Committee on Commerical State-sponsored Bodies to do so.  I had to stick firmly to this ruling.</P>
    <P>There is a danger that the committee system will be discredited if several committees try to get in on the action on a particular matter and summon the same witnesses.  There is a need to introduce either a new law or detailed procedures highlighting the need for co-ordination and stipulating the procedures to be observed in summoning witnesses.  I was very glad the Taoiseach said what he did at Question Time today in relation to the Director of Public Prosecutions.  I was astonished at the provisions in this Bill relating to the Attorney General and the DPP because for far too long there has been confusion in many people's minds, including those of Members of this House, about the concepts of independence and <Col N="1108" /> accountability.  Of course, the law clearly specifies that the DPP must have absolute independence in the conduct of his office but that does not mean he is not accountable for its efficiency, effectiveness and the moneys it expends which are voted by this House.  No public expenditure can be beyond accountability.  Therefore, I was glad to note that the Taoiseach, in replying to questions today, indicated that this Bill will be amended to ensure that the Director of Public Prosecutions, in respect of the general administration of his office, will come before a nominated committee of the House to answer for it, excluding any specific case.  That is, of course, correct.</P>
    <P>The Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs of which I am chairman decided some months ago to call in the Attorney General to discuss the general efficiency of his office and how priorities are determined.  With the exception of the inquiry held at the beginning of this year, no Attorney General had ever before come before a committee of the House.  There was an exchange of correspondence, the ultimate result of which was that the Attorney General appeared before a subcommittee.  I indicated that the Attorney General &mdash; even though not specified in any legislative measure or in the Constitution &mdash; had to be independent and was not accountable for his role as legal adviser to the Government because of the client-lawyer relationship rule, which was accepted.</P>
    <P>We recognise that the Attorney General, as guardian of the public interest, may have to maintain independence in the carrying out of that role, although that is not as clear-cut.  However, one matter for which he must be held accountable, as he has now accepted, is the overall efficiency of his office, how priorities are ordered, how fees are determined and his office performs generally.  I am glad that accountability has been established.  I hope that what the Taoiseach said today about the Director of Public Prosecutions will also apply to the Attorney General.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1109" /> I disagree with Deputy Deasy's claim that there are too many committees. With the exception of the Committee of Public Accounts, we should abolish all the specialist committees and establish one for each Department of State other than that of the Taoiseach, all answerable to the House in plenary session.</P>
    <P>Such departmental committees should be answerable for Estimates, all legislation and all policies of their respective Departments.  We should abolish Question Time which has become extremely dull as a result of well-meaning changes effected in recent years that allow Ministers to read very long replies, sometimes to 16 or 17 parliamentary questions grouped together, in the full knowledge that they will not have to answer questions for another six weeks.  Under the old system they had to continue to reply over three or four days until all questions had been disposed of.  The well intentioned reforms have turned out to be counterproductive.</P>
    <P>The transfer of parliamentary questions to departmental committees, where a Minister would have to answer questions posed by an individual Member pursuing a line of questioning before replying to another Member, would enormously enhance the effectiveness of this House in calling the Executive to account.  Estimates should be submitted to such departmental committees before the beginning of the financial year, with a strict rule imposed that none can be approved on the nod. All should be scrutinised in detail before being approved and the moneys expended.  This would be a necessary provision because successive Governments have got into the habit of submitting Estimates to this House very late and expecting them to be approved on the nod.  Many errors have occurred in that process.</P>
    <P>There is another essential feature of this overall reform.  In plenary session of the Dáil it must be recognised that the Leader of the Opposition occupies a special place because it is up to him, principally, to hold the Government to <Col N="1110" /> account.  He should be afforded much greater latitude than other Members. Likewise, in the course of committee deliberations, considerable latitude must be afforded the principal Opposition spokespersons.  This would enhance the power of this House and the effectiveness of Government, ensuring members of the Government are kept on their toes.  That is what parliament ought to be about.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill has had a long gestation, if I recall correctly, over some 20 years.  I do not think any Bill has taken so long to reach us.  If its provisions were simple it could have been introduced a long time ago.  My recollection is that the concept of a Bill such as this was first mooted in the period 1973 to 1977.  Since then many different shades of Government have come and gone.  The introduction of this Bill resulted from the developments of this time last year, so it is pertinent that we should be discussing it one year later.</P>
      <P>Deputy Jim Mitchell claimed that some Members had lost the party whip in very dubious circumstances.  Two Members present on this side of the House lost the party whip in somewhat dubious circumstances, myself and Deputy O'Dea, so I can agree with Deputy Mitchell's comments in that respect.</P>
      <P>Probably the most significant change that has occurred in recent years has been our greater use of the committee system, on which I gave my opinion when we were establishing new committees at the beginning of this year.  My greatest complaint was that the House would eventually find itself with less work to perform, with less attention being paid to its deliberations and a greater number of Members spending more of their time participating in committees, which would not be covered by the media as adequately as the proceedings of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because of our electoral system, my concern was that public representatives would be running around in circles without the necessary expertise and back-up <Col N="1111" /> to deal adequately with the powers vested in them.  Within this session much of what I predicted has come to pass.  While I am in favour of the committee system &mdash; given our multi-seat electoral system, the demands it places on public representatives and the limited back-up facilities available to them &mdash; it is difficult to operate and would be more appropriate to a parliament with a different electoral system from ours.  I have been one of the most outspoken critics of our multi-seat electoral system without specifically advocating its replacement.  There should be a debate on that matter at some time in the future.</P>
    <P>These new committees are proving to be worthwhile and this Bill must be viewed in that light.  Nonetheless, given my earlier comments, all Members should be aware of the restrictions and drawbacks to the further development of that committee system.  I am all for openness, transparency and accountability, but in speaking about that topic, some of us might be at cross-purposes. It is not always possible for a Minister, with no bad intentions on his part, to answer completely because it might have ramifications for the national interest or be unfair to other people who are not in a position to defend themselves.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill attempts to provide minimal assistance for the victims of crime.  It is not perfect; it contains a number of technical errors some of which I may not have detected.  I freely acknowledge that.  There are also what might on the <Col N="1112" /> surface appear to be two serious omissions in the Bill.  It does not provide for a better system of compensation for victims; neither does it provide a sanction for non-observance of the statutory rights which we are attempting to give to victims.  There are reasons for these omissions with which I will deal.  I would, however, ask the Minister not to waste the time of the House tonight by indulging in a long discourse about technical flaws the Civil Service managed to find in it.  My intention in drafting the Bill is to attempt to persuade the Government to accept it in principle, allow it to pass Second Stage, and have it sent to the Select Committee on Legislation and Security where we can work together to iron out technical difficulties and discuss changes which will improve it.  This side of the House will be amenable to accepting amendments from the Government side which will strengthen and improve this necessary and long-overdue legislation.</P>
    <P>I deplore the attempts of Ministers in successive Governments to justify their non-acceptance of Private Member's Bills by reliance on drafting difficulties. Drafting difficulties are inevitable in Private Members' Bills, especially given that the Attorney General admitted last week when questioned before the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs that it takes at least eight years to produce a fully-fledged parliamentary draftsman.  The Government has a number of these rare creatures at its disposal; even they sometimes get it wrong. I recall that on one occasion when I had to reply to a debate on a Private Members' Bill which we were not accepting I excised a large chunk of my speech dealing with technical drafting difficulties.  I did so because I consider it rank hypocrisy for any Minister to seek to justify a refusal to accept a Private Members' Bill on the grounds of technical error, particularly a Bill which is designed to assist a large and growing proportion of our citizens.  I hope the Minister of State, Deputy Currie, will <Col N="1113" /> resist the temptation to act like a political woodpecker picking technical holes in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Our country has had a troubled and violent history.  This largely relates to our struggle for independence. However, we are learning that 75 years after Independence, the level of violence in Irish society is arguably greater than it has ever been.  Recent Garda statistics show that robberies have increased by two thirds in the past six years.  Aggravated burglaries increased by 85 per cent in the same period. Crimes categorised as offences against property with violence increased by more than 70 per cent in the past 12 years.  Last year's crime statistics show that for the first time in the history of this State the number of reported indictable, crimes exceeded 100,000 or almost 300 serious crimes a day.</P>
    <P>I deliberately adverted to the fact that this is the level of crime being reported. A large and growing proportion of even indictable crime is not being reported. Estimates for non-reported indictable crimes naturally vary, but, even taking the lowest intelligible estimate which I have, it would appear that it is quite possible, even probable, that about 120,000 indictable crimes were committed last year.  On the other hand, the detection rate of reported crime has fallen to below one in three.  Therefore, only about one in four indictable crimes were detected last year.  It must also be borne in mind that the perpetrators of detected crimes often walk away from court unpunished because the prosecution cannot prove its case.  In a criminal case guilt must be proved beyond reasonable doubt, a difficult burden to discharge.  It is, therefore, valid to ask how much indictable crime went unpunished last year.  The answer is certainly more than three out of four.  It may be at least four out of five, or possibly seven out of eight, and that is a startling statistic.</P>
    <P>For every crime there is a victim and it is axiomatic that there is no such thing as victimless crime.  Many crimes generally categorised as white collar crimes <Col N="1114" /> are committed against financial institutions such as insurance companies and banks.  Today we also have to face the growing phenomenon of computer-related crime, or the use of technology to perpetrate fraud.  The customers of such institutions are the public who suffer for these crimes, albeit indirectly. What I am seeking to address in this Bill, however, is the plight of individuals, particularly the young, the elderly, the vulnerable, and not just those who, through no fault of their own, become victims of crime.  Under our criminal justice system it is not left to an individual crime victim to vindicate his or her rights.  The State does so on their behalf. As the burden of vindicating the rights of the victim falls upon the State the victim is entitled to expect that the State will do so efficiently and sympathetically.  If it fails to do that the victim becomes disillusioned with the system, and this disillusionment is not confined to the victim alone.  It spreads like a virus and infects all who become aware of how the victim was treated by those charged with vindicating his or her rights.  I refer to the victim's family, friends, neighbours, acquaintances and all who, for whatever reason, become aware of the circumstances.</P>
    <P>If the system operates in such a way as to cause these ripples of disillusionment, obviously it follows that the greater the number of victims, the greater will be the number of people in society who are disillusioned with the entire system of criminal justice.  Widespread disillusionment with a system of criminal justice can have potentially devastating consequences in a democracy.  The Irish Association for Victim Support demands that the victims of crime be treated with sympathy and respect and here the victims are shown neither sympathy nor respect.  Precisely the opposite is almost invariably the case.  In the interests of fairness and balance I wish to say I am not blaming the Minister for that.  This did not arise as a result of a conscious decision by any politician or Government; it evolved.</P>
    <P>We inherited our legal system from <Col N="1115" /> the British.  Up to the early part of the 19th century in Britain the responsibility for prosecuting offenders lay generally with the person who had been harmed by the offence.  The victim usually had to assemble the evidence or pay a lawyer or other official to take a case for him or her and was responsible for the presentation of the case in court and for the costs if the case failed.  This burden of responsibility must have weighed very heavily, particularly on inexperienced citizens who had no legal education and, most especially, on those with slender financial resources.  It resulted in the undesirable situation whereby many cases which should have been prosecuted in the public interest never saw the light of day.</P>
    <P>There was a further problem related to the imbalance of power which lay at the heart of such a system.  A victim with power or financial resources could exact disproportionate revenge against a weak or impecunious offender.  On the other hand, a powerful offender could obviously intimidate a vulnerable victim.  The gradual introduction of local police services during the 19th century provided an opportunity to redress this imbalance and a situation gradually evolved whereby the State took responsibility and interposed itself between the victim and the offender. However, acceptance of this responsibility by the State introduced a new imbalance of power and the accused invariably became the weaker and more vulnerable party faced with defending himself against the power, might and majesty of the State.</P>
    <P>In order to restore that balance and protect the alleged offender a series of rights were evolved to enable defendants to properly present their cases and to protect themselves from unfair prosecution and punishment.  For example, strict rules were developed on the way in which evidence could be brought. Owing to the severity of the punishment in the 19th century it was said it was better to acquit 99 guilty people than to <Col N="1116" /> convict one who was innocent.  The victim then became regarded as an ordinary citizen with a responsibility to assist the police by providing evidence and to act as a witness when the evidence was needed as part of a prosecution case in court.  No special status was granted to the victim in respect of his or her special interest in the case.  In cases where evidence was not required it was not considered necessary even to provide information to the victim about, for example, the arrest of the offender or the intention to prosecute or not to prosecute as the case may be.</P>
    <P>In attempting to protect the victim from unwanted responsibility the State, therefore, pushed him to the margins of the system where he became practically irrelevant to the procedures in the eyes of the professionals who operated the system on behalf of the State.  Evidence of this first began to emerge from research studies in the early 1980s.  For example, a survey of buggery victims carried out in 1982 by the Oxford Centre for Criminological Research showed that 25 per cent of victims interviewed were dissatisfied with the response they received from the police after reporting a crime.  The main problems cited by those victims included a lack of contact with the police, a lack of information and a general feeling that they were regarded as unimportant.  A follow-up survey carried out in 1985 in relation to victims of violent crime who had passed through the criminal justice system showed a dissatisfaction rate of 38 per cent.  Many of these victims again stated that they would not even report a crime in the future.  Once again, the complaints related to a lack of information and a general feeling of being accorded low status by the authorities.</P>
    <P>It has to be said that there was no evidence in either study that victims wished to resume responsibility for decision-making in the criminal justice process. However, these and some subsequent studies showed clearly that what the victims mainly wanted was recognition of their experience and the effect it had on their lives.  They concluded that the <Col N="1117" /> State's concern to deal with the offender while at the same time protecting his or her human rights needed to be matched by a similar concern for the victim. There should be a separate relationship between the State and the individual victim who has been harmed given that a crime has been perpetrated against him or her.  The victim should not be seen as ancillary to the criminal justice process.</P>
    <P>In the present criminal justice system the victim is largely a pawn in the contest between the prosecution and defence.  He is a weapon to be used if necessary by the prosecution if and when it suits its purpose to do so.  He is then peremptorily discarded.  For the vast majority of victims the experience of being a State witness &mdash; usually the principal one &mdash; in a criminal trial will be entirely new.  However, during the period leading up to the trial his contact with the police will be at best perfunctory.  He will have no occasion to meet the State lawyers who will have the task of vindicating his rights and the State will make no effort to provide him with any advice about trial procedures or his duties or responsibilities as a witness. He will find the court room atmosphere as strange as Gulliver found the land of Lilliput when he was cast ashore there.</P>
    <P>The reality of courtroom facilities is such that on the morning of a trial&mdash;I have witnessed this &mdash;the victim will often find himself waiting cheek by jowl with the person accused of battering, maiming or sexually assaulting him or her.  He will often be subjected to searing cross-examination by the defence which will involve questioning his character, motives, bona fides and details of his recollection of the event in question and often incidents from his past life.  The fact that he is still severely traumatised from his experience will count for nothing.  When the ordeal is over he is told he may leave.  He is not entitled to even one penny in compensation for the pain, suffering and trauma he has endured.  He will have no subsequent contact with the State except perhaps through his solicitor who will be <Col N="1118" /> engaged in the long and rather undignified process of trying to extract the minimal compensation payable from the criminal injuries compensation tribunal. The victim will receive no counselling, sympathy or support except perhaps from the Victims Support Group, a voluntary organisation struggling financially to survive.  This is not hyperbole or exaggeration.  These are the facts and the Minister and every Member of the House knows this.  Facts do not cease to exist simply because they are ignored.</P>
    <P>I have omitted including in the Bill a provision to allow for the payment of compensation to victims of crime for pain and suffering.  I have done so because I was not entitled to impose a charge on the Exchequer in a Private Members Bill.  I had included this provision in the Bill as originally drafted but the officials in the Bills Office informed me, as is their duty, that it would have to be deleted on the basis that it was out of order.  However, this should not be taken to mean that I do not support the principle of the restoration of compensation for pain and suffering.  On the contrary, the absence of such compensation is a blight not only on the entire criminal justice system but on our value system as a society.  That is why I strongly urge the Minister to prevail upon his colleagues to restore compensation to the victims of crime for pain and suffering.  The opportunity to do this exists as the Estimates for expenditure in 1996 are now being discussed. I ask the Minister to refer specifically to this point in his reply.</P>
    <P>The present law relating to compensation for the victims of crime challenges our claim to be a Christian society.  Regardless of the atrocity perpetrated on him, all a victim who is lucky enough to be working and, therefore, not in receipt of a medical card will be entitled to is a loss of wages, less social welfare payment and more medical expenses.  Even in the calculation of medical expenses the State has shown itself to be a veritable scrooge.</P>
    <P>Until last year the plight of victims was compounded by unjustifiable and <Col N="1119" /> unconscionable delay in payment.  The unfortunate victim had to wait for years to be paid even the paltry provision the system had made for him.  He was, in effect, forced to act as an unwilling lender to the Exchequer.  This was brought to the attention of the then Minister for Justice, Deputy Maire Geoghegan-Quinn, who provided the resources to substantially reduce these delays and for that she deserves our gratitude.</P>
    <P>If the victim is unlucky enough to be one of the large and growing army of the unemployed and consequently has a medical card then the compensation to which he is entitled from the State, regardless of his injuries, is zero.  He would, of course, have a right to take a civil action against the perpetrator of the crime but we need not waste much time on that as we know what it is worth.  On the other hand if somebody is injured in a road traffic accident or an industrial accident or simply falls into a pothole he will be entitled to thousands of pounds in damages for pain and suffering.  I recall the case of a young man of 23 whose leg was cut by falling glass at his place of work.  It left a scar which was almost invisible some months later but much to my surprise &mdash; I did not know as much then as I know now &mdash; we managed to do a deal with the insurance company and he received £4,000 net for pain and suffering.</P>

      <P>Another young man of 21 who was unemployed and had a medical card was violently assaulted and as a result he is now confined to a wheelchair for the rest of his life.  I will quote from a copy of the Garda report:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This patient was admitted to the Limerick Regional Hospital at 2.10 a.m. on 21.12.'93 following an assault. On admission he was shocked and had multiple stab wounds to his chest wall with deep lacerations on the left <Col N="1120" /> and right arm with amputation of his right index finger.</P>
    <P>He describes his injuries in his own words:</P>
    <P>I suffered the following injuries, multiple stab wounds to the head, stabbed in the left eye, stab wounds on the left arm, the front portion of my right underfinger severed from the second joint, stab wounds to the other three fingers of my right hand. Stab wounds under right wrist, stab wound to left abdomen, multiple stab wounds to the upper and lower back.</P>
    <P>The stab wounds to my lower back have resulted in paralysis from the chest down and this condition is permanent.  I also have stab wounds to my chin, lower lip and forehead and also on my neck.</P>
    <P>That young man was assaulted by members of the criminal fraternity who lived all their lives on social welfare. They have since been convicted.  His right to take a civil action against them is not worth very much and he is not entitled to one penny from the State, never mind that his life has been destroyed and his employment prospects have been obliterated.  In all sincerity is this justice?  The Minister knows it is not Christian.  In fact it is the anthititis of Christianity, fairness and justice.  We like to decry the Godless unchristian society of the United Kingdom but their system is better.  I will not go into detail on it but suffice to say that last May the Home Secretary introduced legislation in the House of Commons to replace the system of compensation for the victims of crime by a tariff system, which sets a definite amount for each category of injury. There are 25 categories of injuries.  In addition the victim will be paid for loss of wages, medical expenses and there is provision for the relatives of deceased victims.  The tariffs ranged from £1,000 at the lower end of the scale to £500,000 at the upper end.  That is a disimprovement on what preceded it because the financial memorandum to the Bill states <Col N="1121" /> that the objective of the change is to reduce the projected payments from an estimated £500 million to £260 million at the turn of the century.  Even in its reduced form the scheme is infinitely better than what operates in this so-called Christian country.  I look forward to the Minister's reply on the question of compensation for pain and suffering.</P>
    <P>The system in other Commonwealth countries is outlined succinctly in a report called &ldquo;Financial Provisions for the Victim of Crime &mdash; A Comparative Study in Five Commonwealth Jurisdictions&rdquo;.  It was produced by the Commonwealth Legal Advisory Service in January 1990.  In each country mentioned needless to say the provision for victims is infinitely more generous than it is here.</P>
    <P>This Bill provides the minimum necessary to meet the legitimate demands that victims of crime be treated sympathetically and with respect.  I have studied the report of the European Forum for Victims Services which represents victim service organisations in 15 European countries.  I have noted what they say but I have not gone nearly as far as they would have wished me to go.  I feared that because of our long record of totally ignoring the victim, the radical changes suggested by that forum would be too great a shock to the system if introduced all at once. Therefore, I have provided the minimum necessary to compel this State to show the sympathy and respect which the victim legitimately demands and deserves.  The report of the European forum is based on the United Nations Declaration on the Basic Principles of Justice for Victims of Crime and the European Convention on the Compensation of Victims of Violent Crimes.  It takes into account the reports and recommendations of the Council of Europe on the Position of the Victim in the Framework of Criminal Law and Procedure and on Assistance to Victims and Prevention of Victimisation.  The forum document states:</P>
    <P>Professional experience in victims' <Col N="1122" /> services and recent research has demonstrated beyond doubt that crime can have long-term and detrimental consequences for victims and their families, not only for their physical, financial and emotional well-being, but also for their attitudes towards society as a whole, and to the criminal justice authorities in particular.  Uninformed or insensitive treatment by the criminal justice process, or by individual professionals within that process, is likely to increase or prolong these negative effects.  By contrast, victims who are given proper recognition and respect are more able to make a healthy and informed adjustment to their experience of crime, to understand the crime in its proper context, and to be reassured by the experience of solidarity within their community.</P>
    <P>It is against that benchmark that the forum makes its recommendations.  It seeks to define the essential prerequisites which must be in place before a criminal justice system can claim that it is treating its crime victims with sympathy and respect.  It goes on to say:</P>
    <P>Victims have a right to be recognised and acknowledged as having legitimate interests which must be taken into account at all stages of criminal justice proceedings.</P>
    <P>All victims when reporting a crime, should have the right to `opt in' to procedures for being kept informed of all developments relating to their case &mdash; e.g. the arrest of the offender, the decision to prosecute, dates of hearings, bail, final decisions and any release from a custodial sentence.</P>
    <P>This Bill seeks to meet some of those criteria although admittedly in a limited and conservative way.</P>
    <P>Section 1 defines the term &ldquo;victim of crime&rdquo; and is based on the suggested definition from the Irish Association for Victim Support and if we have missed anything we will be amenable to amendments to improve the definition.  Section <Col N="1123" /> 2 (a) gives the victim the right to be consulted by the prosecution in relation to any pre-trial procedures.  This is in line not only with the recommendations of the Irish Association for Victim Support but also the combined European associations as can be seen from the forum report which I have just quoted. Section 2 (b) allows the victims of crime the right to legal advice in certain situations.  That right will be extended to a victim only where he or she is a witness and where the offence for which the accused is charged is indictable, involving violence or the threat of it, as a result of which the victim suffers either physical or psychological injury.  On page four of the European Forum report it is stated that legal advice should be available to all victims regardless of their means, and section 2 (b) provides accordingly.</P>
    <P>As I stated earlier, being a witness for the State in a criminal trial will be a new experience for most victims.  It is a travesty to expect victims, especially a victim still traumatised by the experience, to face such an ordeal without knowledge of trial procedures or his or her duties or responsibilities as a witness. Nobody is suggesting that witnesses should be coached in the evidence they must give, but surely the minimum to which they are decently entitled is some knowledge of the system in which they are expected to play a central role.</P>
    <P>Section 2 (c) states that the victim will be entitled to counselling, but this entitlement will not be open-ended. Victims will be entitled to counselling only for the psyschological effects of a crime which involves violence or the threat of violence, as a result of which the victim suffers mental or physical injury.  The procedure for applying for counselling, and the mechanism for providing it, will be the subject of regulations which the Minister will be given six months to draft, more than adequate time.</P>
    <P>Section 2 (d) deals with victim impact reports which a judge will be obliged to consider in respect of each victim before <Col N="1124" /> imposing sentence.  Section 3 contains a number of provisions concerning information that a victim should be entitled to obtain from the gardaí on written request.  The gardaí will be obliged to provide the information only when a written request is submitted and received.  As I do not wish to impose too great a burden on the gardaí, whose primary responsibility is to investigate crime and bring perpetrators to justice, I have not gone as far as victim support organisations would like.  However, the information I am obliging gardaí to provide on written request is the minimum to which a victim should be decently entitled.  For example, victims are surely entitled to know the name and station of the investigating member of the Garda Síochána as well as a telephone number at which he or she can be contacted.  Nobody can dispute that the victim is entitled to know whether a person has been charged following the Garda investigation of the crime.  Neither can anyone quibble with the obligation placed on the gardaí to tell the victim whether a person is charged and, if so, whether he or she is in custody or out on bail and the date on which the case is expected to commence.  Surely the victim is also entitled to know at the earliest possible stage whether he or she will be required to give evidence.</P>
    <P>Section 3 (i) requires the authorities to inform the victim of the impending release of the offender.  I know victims who were severly traumatised by meeting people on the street who had committed a violent crime against them, often having served only a fraction of their sentence.  Many unfortunate victims only discover their offenders are back on the street when they meet them.  Common justice demands that the victim should be warned about the offender's release before it takes place.</P>
    <P>It is probably true that the victim of a sexual offence has a right to bring a civil action for trespass to the person against the perpetrator of that offence. However, as far as I am aware, the matter has not been decided by a court. <Col N="1125" /> although various out of court settlements have been made in that regard. Section 4 puts in statutory form a right which probably already exists in common law but it puts the matter beyond doubt and nobody could argue rationally against that.</P>
    <P>I do not have time to deal with the details of section 4 (2), suffice it to say that it gives the same right or an extended period of limitations to a victim of sexual assault as to a plaintiff in an ordinary negligence action.  Common justice demands that and nobody could quibble with it.  I changed the wording somewhat from that contained in the Statute of Limitations (Amendment) Act, 1991 but, unfortunately, I do not have time to explain the technical reasons.</P>
    <P>The Government stated in its programme for Government that it intends publishing a charter for victims of crime. It is now 12 months since that programme was published and I have not yet seen the charter.  I urge the Minister to abandon the notion of a charter for the victims of crime, they deserve to have whatever remedies are introduced to alleviate their plight placed on a statutory basis.</P>
    <P>Some years ago the Department of Health introduced a charter for hospital patients.  It has proved to be like Sam Goldwyn's description of a verbal contract, not worth the paper on which it is written.  It is worthless.  A headline on page 4 of <i>The Irish Times</i> of 17 November states that &ldquo;Coroner criticises hospital admission policy.  Inquest told injured man was left on trolley for hours&rdquo;.  So much for the charter of rights for hospital patients.  As it is not grounded in legislation it does not give them any legal rights and, for that reason, it has been strongly criticised in the <i>Irish Medical Times,</i> the <i>Irish Medical News</i> and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners also published a charter of taxpayers' rights. As one who works in this field I can testify that it has not had effect in practice. I have experience of cases where the official conducting an audit commences <Col N="1126" /> by reading out the charter of taxpayers' rights, sometimes in a loud intimidating fashion and sometimes mantra like.  The Revenue Commissioners make it clear that they regard this as nothing but jargon imposed on them by meddlesome politicians which they must read out.</P>
    <P>In 1987 the Government published what could be called a charter and the Minister of State knows a good deal about this.  It is a series of voluntary guidelines directed at organisations coming into contact with children.  I need not waste the House's time explaining how that has not worked in practice.  A charter of rights for crime victims in the UK has also been criticised on the grounds that it has not been placed in statute.  For example, in an article at page 843 of the 1995 Criminal Law Review, Helen Fenwick, a lecturer in criminal law at Durham University, stated that as the crime victims' charter in the UK did not have a statutory basis it had no legal status.  She also stated that criminal justice agencies are under no legal duty to ensure that victims have access to services under charter rights.</P>
    <P>I do not have time to explain why I am not including a sanction.  It will not be necessary because in most cases it will be a matter of internal Garda discipline and would also serve to prejudice a trial if victims do not get the rights attributed to them by statute.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to accept the Bill and allow it to go to the Select Committee on Legislation and Security.  Last week the Minister for Justice accepted a Bill proposed by Fianna Fáil dealing with paedophiles who carry out their nefarious activities abroad, usually as part of an organised scheme.  If, as a result of that enlightened legislation, a person is brought before the courts in six weeks or six months' time, convicted and rightly punished, the media will hardly waste time singing hymns of praise to the Bill's originators, Deputies Ryan and O'Donoghue.  The names of those responsible for that Bill will probably not even be remembered, <i>sic transit gloria.</i></P>
    <P>In asking the Government to accept <Col N="1127" /> the Bill I am not seeking personal glory. I doubt whether, if this Bill becomes law, every victim entitled to information from the Garda about when a trial will commence or when a person will be charged will say a silent prayer of thanks for me or Fianna Fáil, not that we do not need prayers.  In a few weeks time nobody will remember who proposed the Bill, nor do I wish them to. Neither is my party seeking party political advantage from it.  The rights of victims are surely above party politics. Graham Greene once stated that any victim demands allegiance.  The growing army of crime victims surely demands the allegiance, sympathy, respect and support of the Government.</P>
    <P>The Government must act now to assist the victims of crime.  It must do so not only because of the allegiance it owes to the victims but because of the wider consideration of a growing lack of respect for the criminal justice system which has potentially devastating consequences in a democracy.  The Government must act immediately to restore faith in our creaking and crumbling system of criminal justice and acceptance of the Bill would be an excellent place to start.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. Currie) Austin Currie">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. Currie)</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Minister for Justice, Deputy Nora Owen, who is engaged on other urgent business, I would like to commend Deputy O'Dea for his efforts in producing and publishing this Bill.  The Government appreciates the arguments he has made for it which I know are motivated by a concern to advance the rights of the victims of crime.  I am afraid, however, for reasons I shall explain to the House, that the Government cannot accept the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before I outline in detail why the Government believes it must oppose the Bill.  I think it would be appropriate to deal with a matter we all agree upon, that is the need for us to demonstrate in a practical way our real and genuine <Col N="1128" /> sympathy and support for the victims of crime.  We all know how important the issue of crime is to the public and the anger they feel at those who commit crime, especially crimes involving violence or crimes directed at particularly vulnerable sections of our society. Increasingly, there has been a recognition that the focus should be more on the victims of crime and that the effect crime has on victims should be a central consideration in criminal proceedings. As Deputies will be aware, a significant amount of work has been undertaken in that area and a great deal has been achieved in terms of bringing our law and the criminal justice system into line with the deep public concern which is felt on this issue.</P>
    <P>One of the most significant developments has undoubtedly been the establishment of the criminal injuries compensation tribunal in the 1970s. Since then, a total of around £45 million has been paid to compensate victims of crime.  While long delays in the payment of accepted awards did build up over time, these have now been virtually eliminated.  In addition, the tribunal has recently made significant progress in reducing delays in hearing appeals and is currently planning further measures to improve efficiency.  I have no doubt that all Deputies will welcome these operational improvements as being not just important in themselves but also as providing valuable food for thought in the review of the scheme of compensation for personal injuries criminally inflicted which is currently being carried out in the Department of Justice in accordance with a committment in the Government of Renewal policy agreement.</P>
    <P>Another, more recent improvement in the position of crime victims has been the expansion of services provided by the Irish Association for Victim Support.  The association, which is an entirely voluntary group, has seen its public funding rise from £18,000 in 1993 to £130,000 this year.  The services offered by the association range from the support of listening to crime victims <Col N="1129" /> talk about their experiences to practical advice on compensation, legal aid, court procedure, home security, insurance, health service entitlements and so on.  In addition, of course, the association fulfils an invaluable role in articulating the viewpoint of victims of crime in the media and in national debate.</P>
    <P>As I have mentioned, members of the Irish Association for Victim Support receive no payment.  They give freely and generously of their time and much more to assist persons who have been the victims of crime.  As Deputies may be aware, many association members have themselves suffered very seriously at the hands of criminals.  I know I speak for all the Members of this House when I say that the association and all involved in it deserve our special thanks and praise.</P>
    <P>Alongside the development of support services for victims of crime, there have been corresponding improvements in the law.  A number of potential obstacles to the fair treatment of victims of crime have now been removed.  For example, it used to be the case that in trials of sexual offences the judge was required to warn the jury about the danger of convicting the defendant on the uncorroborated evidence of the complainant.  That clear danger of unfair prejudice to a victim of a sexual offence was removed by the Criminal Law (Rape) (Amendment) Act, 1990, which abolished this requirement.</P>
    <P>The 1990 Act also contains specific measures to prevent a defendant seeking to undermine the testimony of a rape victim by inquiring into the previous sexual history of the complainant. In addition, the rape Acts now provide for the anonymity of a rape victim.  Similar provision was made in relation to the victims of incest in the Criminal Law (Incest Proceedings) Act, which was enacted earlier this year.</P>
    <P>Deputies may also recall that certain further aspects of the law of evidence were regarded as unsatisfactory when it came to securing justice for victims.  In particular, I refer to the rules governing children's testimony.  Under the legal <Col N="1130" /> rules which operated here since the foundation of the State, children were not allowed to give evidence, however clear and truthful it might be, unless they could understand the nature of an oath or affirmation.  That was changed by the Criminal Evidence Act, 1992, which enables children to give evidence in a criminal trial without having to take an oath, provided the court is satisfied that they can give an intelligible account.  The 1992 Act also abolished the rule of law which required the unsworn evidence of a child to be corroborated.</P>
    <P>One of the most important features of the 1992 Criminal Evidence Act is that it has made it much easier for young persons and other vulnerable witnesses, such as those with a mental handicap, to give evidence in cases involving violence or sexual abuse.  Giving evidence in a courtroom, especially in the presence of the accused and with all the formality involved in a criminal trial, is difficult for most people but it can be truly traumatic for witnesses in these cases and can result in prosecutions not being taken in the first place or else failing because a witness is unable to give his or her evidence to the court.</P>
    <P>This problem has been dealt with by making provision in the 1992 Act for evidence to be given by live television link.  The procedure is that the witness is located in a separate room outside the court and communication is undertaken by way of special television monitors. The witness only sees the person who is speaking to him or her &mdash; the judge or one of the legal representatives &mdash; and there is no contact, either direct or indirect, with the accused.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the Act provides that where evidence is being given via a television link and the witness is under 17 years of age, wigs and gowns, which could frighten a child, will not normally be worn by the judge or the barristers or solicitors involved.  Questions to a witness may be conveyed through a competent person appointed by the court.  In addition, where the evidence of such a witness for a preliminary <Col N="1131" /> examination has been video recorded, he or she may not have to give evidence at the trial.  In addition, a video recording of statements made during interviews with a garda or other competent person by victims under 14 years of age of physical or sexual abuse may be admitted in evidence.</P>
    <P>In addition to the specific and important developments I have already referred to, a number of major advances in improving the situation of victims in the criminal process were made by the Criminal Justice Act, 1993.  This is significant legislation and it will be familiar to many Members of this House, especially Deputy O'Dea, who was involved in piloting it through the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The 1993 Act ensures that our criminal justice system is victim-orientated in three main ways.  First, it enables the Director of Public Prosecutions, in a case where there is a conviction on indictment, to appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal against an unduly lenient sentence, with the court having the power to quash the original sentence and substitute a more appropriate sentence.</P>
    <P>Second, the 1993 Act has extended the powers of criminal courts to award compensation to all cases where the victim has been caused personal injury or loss.  Previously that power was only available in a small number of cases.  In addition, a court is empowered to order compensation to be paid to the dependants of a person whose death resulted from an offence.  Such compensation includes provision for funeral expenses and distress.  Furthermore, the Act allows a court to give preference to making a compensation order rather than imposing a fine where it considers that the means of an offender are insufficient to pay what the court would consider to be an appropriate fine and appropriate compensation.  The making of a compensation order does not prevent a victim from seeking compensation from the offender in the civil courts but the amount of the order must <Col N="1132" /> be deducted from any civil award made to the victim.</P>
    <P>Third, the Act enumerates the important principle that when imposing a sentence for an offence involving violence or the threat of violence against a person a court must take into account the effect, including any long-term effect, of an offence on the victim.  For that purpose, courts have been empowered to receive evidence or submissions such as victim impact statements.  They are also required to hear evidence offered by the victim of a sexual or violent offence as to its effect on him or her.</P>
    <P>In this summary of recent developments, we should not overlook improvements in Garda procedures which are designed to assist victims.  All members of the Garda Síochána now follow a victim support code of practice whereby a crime victim is always given the name and number of a member who can be contacted for information.  Under that code of practice, a victim is contacted regularly in the course of an investigation in order to be reassured on progress and is informed about key information, such as when a suspect has been charged, the date and the outcome of court proceedings or, indeed, if a decision is taken not to prosecute.</P>
    <P>In considering the proposals in the Bill it is important to bear in mind all the legislative and other developments I have outlined.  I appreciate the difficulties Deputies face in preparing Private Members' Bills.  Legislation is always a complex matter and it is obviously more difficult to draft a Bill outside of Government without the legal and administrative support available to Ministers.  With that in mind, I will discuss the provisions of the Bill without dwelling on minor drafting points.</P>
    <P>Section 1 defines what is meant by a victim of crime for the purposes of the Bill.  This appears to be quite straightforward but it raises a major question in terms of the scope of the Bill.  The section states that a victim of crime includes, &ldquo;where appropriate, the immediate family or dependants of such persons&rdquo;.  But what is meant by &ldquo;where <Col N="1133" /> appropriate&rdquo; and who is to decide?  This is not simply a drafting quibble but a basic question concerning the intention behind the Bill.  Nor does the rest of the Bill provide an answer as it seems to apply only to direct victims of crime and not their dependants.</P>
    <P>Section 2 is one of the main sections of the Bill and sets out what are expressed to be the legal entitlements of victims of crime.  It is worth spending a little while trying to tease out the principles the Bill seeks to establish with this section.</P>
    <P>I am not sure what the phrase &ldquo;as a matter of law&rdquo; adds to the statement that a crime victim shall be entitled to certain things.  If a statute provides for an entitlement then presumably that means the entitlement has been conferred as a matter of law.  Perhaps the phrase is meant merely to add emphasis to the absolute requirements of the section and in order to make it clear that they can never be departed from under any circumstances.  If that is the case, the question arises as to what would happen if the requirements, or any of them, were not met in a particular case.  For example, would a victim whose entitlements were not made available to him or her have a legal remedy to enforce his or her entitlement or to seek compensation from the State? How would such compensation be assessed or by what court?  These are crucial issues on which the Bill is silent.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice would be opposed to the imposition of the legal burdens provided for in the Bill on the grounds that they could have very serious implications for trials.  As the Bill is drafted it is not specified whether, in the event that the section were breached, the relevant court procedures would be invalid.  I am sure that is not the Deputy's intention but it is a consequence that can be implied from his Bill.  If, however, that is his intention the result would be, for example, that where a victim could not be contacted, perhaps because he or she was out of the country on holiday, the court could not deal with the matters in question.  Such a situation <Col N="1134" /> could not be tolerated and would inevitably mean that prosecutions would be abandoned.</P>
    <P>As regards the right to be consulted by the prosecution in relation to pre-trial procedures, I can see the argument for a victim being kept generally informed of progress in the preparation of a case for trial.  The difficulty is that the Bill prescribes an absolute requirement in a way that is more rigid and less flexible than seems wise.  The requirement for consultation applies to &ldquo;any pre-trial procedure&rdquo;.  There are many purely technical pre-trial procedures which would be of no real interest to a victim and where an absolute obligation to consult would bring about no real benefit to any party and could actually delay progress in the hearing of a criminal case by imposing excessive demands on the prosecution.  Furthermore, the provision in the Bill has clearly failed to take account of where an urgent application has to be made to a court because of some development that was not foreseen and in such circumstances it simply would not be practicable to &ldquo;consult&rdquo; or even contact a victim.</P>
    <P>I use the word &ldquo;consultation&rdquo; in this context because that is the word used in section 2.  This is a word that requires some consideration.  Consultation would appear to mean something more than providing information and, in its ordinary meaning at least, implies the possibility that a victim could have an input into procedures undertaken by the prosecution, in other words that he or she could in some way become directly involved in the conduct or taking of criminal prosecutions.  Such a course would be completely unrealistic.</P>
    <P>Section 2 also seeks to entitle a victim of crime involving violence or the threat of violence to free legal advice in relation to the trial.  As Deputies will recall, the current Civil Legal Aid Bill provides for legal assistance for a person who has been the victim of rape and certain other offences.  In that respect, the Deputy's proposal might be said to be an extension of the provisions in that <Col N="1135" /> Bill but it goes much further in every respect.</P>
    <P>The provision in the Deputy's Bill is completely silent on the extent of the assistance or how it would operate in practice.  These are matters that are specifically covered by the Civil Legal Aid Bill.  In particular, the question arises as to whether there would be any limit to the amount of assistance a crime victim could seek.  Would such assistance be made available through solicitors in private practice and would there be any restriction on the employment of barristers?  None of these issues is addressed in the Bill and Members will appreciate that the Government, and in particular the Minister for Finance, could not accept that a blank cheque of the kind that the Deputy has proposed should be enshrined in legislation.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, there is an additional matter that I am not sure the Deputy has considered.  I note that the relevant portion of the Bill refers to indictable offences.  On the face of it, Deputies might assume that what would be involved were cases dealt with before a judge and jury.  That would not be the case as the overwhelming majority of indictable offences are disposed of in summary proceedings in the District Court.</P>
    <P>Section 2 (c) is unusual for a Private Members' Bill in that it seeks the establishment of a new service, psychological counselling, free of charge, with all of the resource implications which that involves.  I have already outlined the excellent work done in this area by the Irish Association for Victim Support, and the significant increase in its funding which has enabled it to expand its services, including the provision of counselling.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that the Deputy has attempted to make more specific provision for counselling than he has for legal assistance and has stated that regulations must be made by the Minister in that regard.  However, no guidance is offered as to what those regulations should contain.  The overall result is that <Col N="1136" /> the points I have already made in relation to the provision of legal advice as proposed under the Bill apply equally in the case of the subparagraph on counselling.  There is quite simply no way in which any Government could agree to such open-ended proposals with the very significant financial burdens that would be involved.</P>
    <P>Section 2 also provides for victim-impact reports and for the effect of a crime on a victim to be taken into account in deciding the appropriate sentence.  This essentially builds on what is already provided for in the Criminal Justice Act, 1993, as I mentioned.</P>
    <P>Section 3 sets out the information which must be given by the Garda Síochána to victims of crime.  The Minister has no difficulty with, indeed she fully supports, the idea that victims of crime should be kept informed of important developments in their cases, but the Minister is not convinced that this section goes the right way about it. In some ways it seems to go too far in that it imposes inflexible requirements on the Garda Síochána, and in other ways it seems not to go far enough, in that the obligation on the gardaí to give information arises only when a victim of crime submits a written request.  Indeed, this could be seen as a step backwards from the existing Garda procedures which I outlined.</P>
    <P>Section 4 deals with the right of a victim of a sexual offence to bring a civil action for damages against the perpetrator of the crime.  Of course, that right already exists, but what is at issue here, if I understand the proposal correctly, is the time limit within which such an action may be brought and the degree to which this may be extended by the discovery of damage which subsequently comes to light.</P>
    <P>It has long been accepted that there should be some time limit on civil actions so as to provide some degree of certainty in the law and to avoid any injustice associated with long delays in hearing actions.  The difficulty has been to balance the right to take an action with the need for fairness.  The law on <Col N="1137" /> this has been changed as recently as 1991, when provision was made for extension of time where damage is not immediately apparent.  Section 4 raises complex issues in this regard which would need the most careful consideration, particularly as we are talking about incidents going back over many years and even decades.  It is the Minister's view that important changes of this kind to the civil law should be considered in a civil law context and not in a criminal justice Bill.</P>
    <P>Sections 5 and 6 have broadly similar purposes.  Esentially these sections are concerned with ensuring that funds realised from offenders will be made available to the Criminal Injuries Compensation Tribunal.  Section 5 provides, in effect, that when an offender is being fined in respect of an offence which results in physical injury to a victim the judge will deduct a sum to be paid to the State in connection with the administration of justice and order the balance to be paid over to the Criminal Injuries Tribunal.  Section 6 requires that any funds or assets seized by the State under the 1994 Criminal Justice Act shall be passed to the tribunal.</P>
    <P>The funding of the Criminal Injuries Compensation Tribunal is an issue that has given rise to difficulties for successive Governments since its establishment.  As Deputies may be aware, a special Supplementary Estimate of £3 million was introduced last year to enable the arrears of awards that had built up in the tribunal to be cleared. This is a project that was initiated by the Minister's predecessor, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, and I am happy to acknowledge the contribution she has made in that area.  The granting of the Supplementary Estimate has enabled the tribunal to pay out all the awards that have been accepted.  In addition, the 1995 allocation has been fixed at £4 million which is the total of the funds provided in 1994.  A sum of well over £2 million has been paid in awards to date <Col N="1138" /> in 1995 and as matters stand all the indications are that the tribunal will have paid a further £1 million in awards before the end of the year.  Obviously that is a vast improvement on the situation which pertained and I am sure it will be welcomed by all Members of this House.</P>
    <P>On sections 5 and 6, most Deputies would accept that serious difficulties can arise in practice for organisations where there is no certainty about the funding arrangements.  If there is a case to be made for a State body to be funded for a particular purpose then it would seem to be appropriate that this should be done by the Exchequer rather than relying on some sort of other arrangement where the income would not be known from one year to another.  From an administrative point of view, it would be extremely difficult to make plans on the basis of estimates of receipts that could be unpredictable and could fluctuate significantly.</P>
    <P>I should also mention that in sections 5 and 6 the Deputy has failed to address what would happen if the funds paid over to the tribunal in a year were not fully spent.  Furthermore, at what point, if any, could surplus funds be released to the Exchequer?  On the other hand, however, the Deputy may have assumed that the arrangements he has proposed would be sufficient to meet all the claims payable by the tribunal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>To my mind, that would be a very dangerous assumption and I am glad he is not assuming that.  It also raises the question of whether specific provision would have to be made to top up the `income' the tribunal would receive under the sections.  All in all, the Minister does not believe the Deputy's proposals would improve the operation of the tribunal and she would be concerned that in fact the reverse would be the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1139" /> Section 7 purports to amend paragraph 21 of the criminal injuries compensation scheme.  I am sure on reflection the Deputy will appreciate that it would not be appropriate that a non-statutory text such as the scheme should be the subject of a specific statutory amendment.  Paragraph 21 of the scheme provides that applications for compensation shall be made not later than three months after the event giving rise to the injury.  In addition, however, the scheme allows claims to be considered out of time &ldquo;in circumstances determined by the Tribunal to justify exceptional treatment&rdquo;.  I understand that the tribunal has been prepared to interpret its power to extend the time within which a claim should be made in a flexible manner and I understand that paragraph 21 has not in practice given rise to difficulties for claimants.</P>
    <P>Given that position, the Minister has no specific proposals to alter paragraph 21 of the criminal injuries scheme along the lines suggested by the Deputy.  That being said, however, she is prepared to have the matter examined in the context of the review of the operation of the scheme that is currently under way.</P>
    <P>The Minister has been as constructive as possible in her approach, but despite the good intention behind it, the Bill would not deliver on what it promises. What is needed is a package of measures which will help victims of crime and that is what the Government is committed to in its preparation of a charter for victims of crime.  Work on the charter, which is promised in the Government's policy document, is under way and involves a comprehensive examination of existing services for victims of crime together with the formulation of proposals for development of those services.  This detailed work is necessary to lay the foundation for the kind of improvements in services we all would like to see, and I can assure the House that it is a priority for the <Col N="1140" /> Minister for Justice and the Government.</P>

      <P>I congratulate Deputy O'Dea, our spokesman on law reform, for bringing forward this important caring legislation.  I commend him on his initiative.  This Bill demands that we as legislators face up to one of the gravest injustices of our time &mdash; I regret this was not adverted to by the Minister &mdash; the manner in which the State has treated the tens of thousands of victims of crime in recent years.  The nature and quality of such treatment by successive Governments can best be described as abysmal, insensitive, uncaring and, in some respects, downright irresponsible.</P>
      <P>Since 1986 there has been no provision in Irish law for compensation for pain and suffering for the victims of crime.  The only financial provisions for such circumstances are for out of pocket medical and other expenses.  Every country in Europe which I checked, even the UK, has some provision for damages for pain and suffering.  The UK looks after victims, but sadly we do not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With the frightening increase in the level and viciousness of many crimes, our failure as law makers to take a significant legal step in favour of victims is unpardonable.  Such a failure has played a part in undermining public confidence in our system of justice.  As the people and victims of crime witness the numerous debates about law and order and the important essential changes in the laws on crime, they are bewildered and let down by our failure to focus on the <Col N="1141" /> victims and their rights.  It is our duty to ensure that those rights are clearly and unambiguously vindicated in our laws. This Bill effectively addresses that matter.  It will be a source of profound regret to victims to learn of the Government's shameful response to it.  The Minister of State referred to the commitment in the programme for Government to a charter of rights.  Legal advice is that a charter of rights would simply contain a detailed catalogue of highfalutin' aspirations.  In that context the response of the Government to the genuine need for justice is not only inadequate but shameful.</P>
    <P>I wish to pay tribute to the Irish Association for Victim Support, a voluntary, community-based organisation founded about ten years ago by Mr. Derek Nally.  Its workers, who are dedicated to the service of all victims of crime, express sympathy on behalf of the community and offer emotional and practical support to those affected by crime.  As a non-statutory body it provides a very valuable service throughout the country.  It plays a very important role in increasing awareness among the Legislature and Judiciary of the needs of victims of crime and the issues affecting them.  As one of the pioneers in this area it is entitled to credit for the recent development in our courts where members of the Judiciary seek victim impact statements prior to sentencing. The Minister of State said that happens in almost all cases.  The impression I got from his statement was that it is mandatory, but my information is that victim impact statements are not sought in all cases.  I would like clarification on whether there is a mandatory or legislative obligation on the Judiciary to take full account of a victim impact statement before passing sentence.</P>
    <P>This Bill provides a welcome opportunity for legislators immediately to redress injustice and show care for victims of crime.  In many cases the witness for the prosecution, who is the victim, may never have been in court before, may not be properly prepared for the <Col N="1142" /> case, may not meet the prosecution lawyer before the case and, contrary to what the Minister said, may have had contact with the Garda on only one or two occasions.  The person who is already traumatised from the crime suffers further trauma as a result of the strange court surroundings and cross-examination by defence counsel.  He is totally unfamiliar with the court and is devastated.  His family is affected, as is his work and social life, but our legal system provides no compensation for him.  A person who suffers a broken leg in a car accident may receive £15,000 to £20,000 but a person battered almost to death by a criminal and confined to a wheelchair for the rest of his life receives no compensation.  Is that justice?  How can people who find themselves in such circumstances have confidence in our justice system?</P>
    <P>Sections 2 and 3 provide legal entitlements for victims of crime and define in law the information and support to be provided by the Garda Síochána.  Those provisions are imperative.  Section 2 provides that a victim impact report must be produced and makes it mandatory on the judge in deciding the appropriate penalty to take into account all the effects on the victim.  It is widely believed by those who have carried out research on this matter that the introduction of a victim impact statement by all trial judges would be of great psychological benefit to victims.  It would provide an opportunity for victims to participate in their own case, which would help them better understand the proceedings and feel more satisfied with the outcome.  It would also help restore the victim's self esteem and sense of control, which are often the first casualties following serious crime.  Studies carried out in other jurisdictions clearly indicate that victims excluded from participation in their own case take longer to recover from the effects of their experience.</P>
    <P>The Law Reform Commission, when referring to victim impact statements in their document on sentencing, stated that studies of victims show that contrary to the fears of the opponents of <Col N="1143" /> victim participation, they are not always motivated by vengeance.  It states that it is likely there will be a wide variety of victim responses but as the courts become more familiar with individual variations they become more adept at judging the weight to attribute to the victim's response and at discriminating between the probative and prejudicial elements in the evidence.  What we are talking about here is minimalist involvement in the criminal justice process, merely a tempering of the defendant-orientated process nurtured and encouraged over the years, thereby showing concern for the economic loss and psychological trauma suffered by victims.  It is widely believed by those who have researched this matter that victim impact statements go a long way to restore victim confidence in themselves and the criminal justice system.</P>
    <P>One of the cornerstones of a caring democracy must be protection of children from abuse.  The recent flood of revelations of child abuse, many of them going back years and even decades, presents an enormous challenge to our limited civil law and the ability of the judicial system to administer justice fairly in such circumstances.  It poses a number of fundamental questions which I do not have time to deal with now but which I hope to take up in another forum.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a growing public perception that the criminal justice system favours the criminal at the expense of the victim.  A correct balance needs to be restored.  This Bill is an attempt to do that and I congratulate Deputy O'Dea on bringing it forward. All victims of crime suffer trauma, but it can be just as traumatic to appear as witness in a court of law.  Gardaí, barristers, solicitors, judges and, at times, even defendants fully understand the court procedures, but that may not be the case for the victim who may find the whole procedure intimidating and frightening.  They perceive that the system of justice has forgotten them, and <Col N="1144" /> on occasion they may be right.  They may be overlooked by all concerned in enforcing the law.  This Bill is welcome in that it proposes practical measures to improve that position.</P>
      <P>I wish to pay tribute to the Irish Association for Victim Support, a voluntary organisation that offers emotional support and practical help to crime victims and their families.  Listening to the Minister's response tonight it seems he is prepared to rely on voluntary organisation and non-legislative codes of practice to alleviate difficulties for victims.</P>
      <P>I wish to draw attention to a submission by the Irish Association for Victim Support received in the Department of Justice on 6 November 1995 concerning identification parade procedures. Present arrangements for identification parades are unacceptable in that they require a witness to physically touch an alleged offender by way of identification.  The Irish Association for Victim Support suggests that this is wrong and that identification should be by way of numbers.  This matter is being reviewed by the Garda Síochána and the Minister.  However, it must be obvious that it is a daunting task for a witness to physically touch the person they know to be the criminal.  It is an archaic system and must go.  I support the Irish Association for Victim Support in that regard.  Perhaps that submission could be dealt with by amendment on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome section 4 which deals with the right of victims in sexual offences cases and clarifies the situation regarding civil actions for damages.  Child sexual abuse is a despicable act.  As a society, by doing nothing in the past, we have tolerated these hideous crimes. That is no longer the case; the carpet has been lifted.  More and more victims are coming to terms with what has happened to them and are brave enough to come forward.  This provision allows them to sue some years later by amending the Statute of Limitations (Amendment) Act, 1991.  Unfortunately, recent scandals have highlighted <Col N="1145" /> the need for this amendment.  When the social history of Ireland in the 20th century is written, the hidden crimes of domestic violence and child sexual abuse will be clearly evident.  I hope we can now put this painful episode behind us given the welcome new openness in our society.</P>
    <P>Violent crime against women is on the increase.  It is unacceptable in a modern society that more and more limits are being placed on a woman's right to move freely.  Rape is now a common crime and women are afraid to travel alone late at night.  This is a challenge for legislators and law enforcers.  It is something we should address at a later date in a serious way.</P>
    <P>The Second Commission on the Status of Women suggested that the victim of rape should have separate legal representation.  However, it believed that such an approach would not work in an adversarial legal system.  Nevertheless, the Rape Crisis Centre argues strongly in favour of separate legal representation for rape victims.  Surely the victim has a right to put forward his or her case and interests if he or she wishes.  Perhaps the Minister would give his views on that matter.  Many of the provisions of this Bill will help to alleviate the fears and anxieties of rape victims in particular who are to be called as witnesses.  That is most welcome.</P>
    <P>The Minister outlined the Garda Síochána victim support code of practice whereby a victim of crime is always given the name and number of a member who can be contacted for information.  Under that code of practice a victim is contacted regularly in the course of an investigation in order to be reassured on progress and is informed about key information such as when a suspect has been charged, the date and the outcome of court proceedings or if a decision is taken not to prosecute. However, as Deputy O'Dea pointed out, that is merely a code of practice.  In my experience, it is not happening.  The victim is often completely forgotten, probably due to pressure of work as the gardaí get on with their inquiries.  We <Col N="1146" /> need something more definite than a code of practice, legislative measures are required.</P>
    <P>I regret the Minister's response to the Bill.  He has attacked it and ruled out many of its provisions purely on technical grounds despite his assurance not to do that.  I welcome the Bill's provisions in relation to the Criminal Injuries Compensation Tribunal.  The delays taking place in that regard are unacceptable.  It is important that there be guarantees about annual funding for the tribunal.  This Bill attempts to deal with that situation and if there were any other ways in which we could do that we would be prepared to consider them.</P>
    <P>Many speakers have paid tribute to the Irish Association for Victim Support. It is a voluntary organisation. although it is funded by Government.  It has filled a vacuum by providing a first class service for victims of crime.  One of the organisation's leaflets quotes a number of comments made by people who were victims of crime: &ldquo;I was bitter and uptight.  I wanted to scream, shout and cry out.&rdquo;  The victim continued: &ldquo;The full impact didn't hit me until the first night I was on my own.  I began to get bitter about the person who burgled my nice home and then at the police for not having phoned to see how I was. Friends and family tried to help out but they got tired of me going on and on about it.  They wanted to change the subject or said &ldquo;it's time you pulled yourself together&rdquo;.  One can see vividly the trauma experienced by the victim of a house burglary even though no physical violence was involved.  The victim can become completely traumatised.</P>
    <P>This association is vitally important and it now needs statutory support.  It provides a helpline, advice and counselling.  Many people are left distraught following a crime.  This organisation has made a start in helping them; it has identified the needs of the victim in the criminal process.  Now it is up to the Government and the Oireachtas to bring forward practical measures to help this organisation in its work.  This Bill is <Col N="1147" /> an attempt to do that.  It outlines a number of practical suggestions to help the victim and show him or her that he or she is the most important person in the process.</P>
    <P>I regret that the Minister has ruled out many of the Bill's provisions.  He has said that it is well intentioned.  However, many of these practical suggestions could be implemented; there is certainly public demand for them.  The criminal justice system is perceived to not favour the victim and there is a real sense of unhappiness in the community as crime figures spiral and more people become victims of crime.  Given that the Minister has said he will not accept the Bill. I hope many of its provisions can be introduced in a Government Bill.</P>
    <P>An additional provision should deal with the question of identification parades.  The Irish Association for Victim Support has launched a national campaign which involves community and voluntary organisations throughout the country to lobby to have that situation changed.  The Minister should deal with that issue and this side of the House will help him in that regard.</P>

Rud a bhfuil géarghá leis ná córas éifeachtach glantacháin agus cothbhála.  Ba chóir go bhfostófaí daoine sa bhreis ionas go mbeadh an fhoireann glantacháin in ann coinneáil suas leis an <Col N="1149" /> obair agus a chinntiú go mbeidh caighdéan árd glantacháin ann i gcónaí.</P>
    <P>Tá brú mór ar spás sa scoil do scóláirí agus do mhúinteoirí.  Scór bliain ó shin ní raibh ach tuairim is 50 scoláire sa 4ú/5ú blianta.  Faoi láthair tá tuairim is 160 scoláire i mblianta 4ú/5ú, meadú de 300 faoin gcéad.  Níl an spás ná an treallamh sa scoil in ann freastal sásúil a dhéanamh ar na scoláirí ar fad.  Tá práinn dá bhrí sin le hathchoiriú ar an Chlochar agus chomh maith leis sin, tá gá le 3 sheomra breise sa tseanscoil.  Ó thaobh seomra na múinteóirí dhe, tá athchóiriú ag teastáil go géar; tá cófraí feiliúnacha agus seilfeanna de dhíth agus gá le bord beag, cathaoir agus áit staidéir do chuile múinteoir.</P>
    <P>Sa halla agus seomraí gléasta tá gá le deisiú proifisiúnta a chur ar na ropaí, na barraí, na biomaí, an urlár agus marcáil cheart a chur air le haghaidh na gcluichí éagsúla.  Tá gá le hathchóiriú ar leithris na mbuachaillí agus na gcailiní, cithfholcadh agus tá uisce te agus cuirtíní de dhíth.</P>
    <P>Muna gcreideann an tAire an pictiúir atá á tharraingt agam den scoil, mar atá sí faoi láthair, molaim dí cuairt a thabhairt ar an scoil chun a fheiceáil dí féin cé chomh dona is atá rudaí.  Níl sé féarálta do na scoláirí ná do na múinteoirí go bhfuil siad fágtha mar atá le scoil nach bhfuil cóirithe i gceart agus de réir an méid a chonaic mé ar mo thuras tríd an scoil, táim den tuairim go gcaithfidh go bhfuil sé an-deacair do na scoláirí agus na múinteoirí a ndícheall a dhéanamh.  Más sampla é seo de shuim an Roinn Oideachais i scoileanna Gaeltachta taispeáineann sé gur beag an meas sin ag an Roinn ar oideachas sa Ghaeltacht.</P>
    <P>Tá súil agam go dtabharfaidh an tAire freagra sásúil don impí atá mé ag déanamh uirthi anocht agus go mbeidh cúis dóchais againn go ndéanfar rud fiúntach don scoil seo go luath agus go gcinnteoidh sí go gcuirfear airgead speisíalta ar fáil i Meastacháin 1996 le hathchóiriú iomlán a dhéanamh ar Scoil Chuimsitheach Chiaráin sa Cheathrú Rua.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Export Refunds.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I raise this issue because <Col N="1151" /> of what is happening in relation to export refunds and the impact it will have on beef prices.  As late as last week my colleagues and I in the Opposition with responsibility for the Agriculture portfolio raised the crisis which has enveloped the sheep sector.  I pointed out on Question Time last Thursday the serious implications of a reduction of 7.5 per cent and 5 per cent, respectively, on export refunds for the beef and live trades.  In his reply, the Minister confirmed that he was concerned about this matter and that he would take up the case with Commissioner Fischler as a matter of urgency and would do all he could to alleviate the difficulties that the reduction in export refunds is having on Irish exporters.</P>
      <P>On the following day we had the extraordinary situation where the EU Beef Management Committee, at its meeting on Friday, 17 November, decided to cut export refunds further in respect of live cattle and beef by 25 per cent with immediate effect.  This is an outrageous situation which the Minister has allowed to happen.  It is obvious he does not have the clout to deal with the issue.  This is the fourth reduction in export refunds since September.  Since then export refunds for live cattle have been cut by 45 per cent, which represents a drop of £29.50 per hundred kilogrammes while refunds on beef have fallen by almost 40 per cent or 47.5p per kilogramme.  This is an unprecedented attack on the export refunds system which particularly affects the Irish agriculture and beef sectors.  Our beef sector is dependent on 70 per cent to 80 per cent of its produce being exported.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the most successful means of maintaining confidence in the market has been the competition between the live and processed trade and the ability of our processors to get markets outside the EU which has allowed for the payment of export refunds.  In terms of the industry the refunds are worth £300 million per year.  The fact that the Minister.  Deputy Yates, has allowed a 45 per cent reduction in export refunds on live <Col N="1152" /> exports since 1 September and a 40 per cent decrease in export refunds in our meat trade since 1 September will mean a loss of £120 million to the Irish cattle and beef industry for the coming year.</P>
    <P>We have had silly statements from the Minister, Deputy Yates, since then stating that he did not expect the refunds in cuts to have an immediate impact on the export trade or cattle prices.  These statements are mindboggling in their naivety.  To suggest that the live trade will not be affected immediately is not facing up to reality.  The Minister deplored the cuts in export refunds when the reduction was 7.5 per cent and 5 per cent, respectively, for the live and beef trades.  This huge reduction of 25 per cent for both the live trade and the meat trade means, to quote the most recent statement from the Minister, that he is &ldquo;incensed&rdquo;.  If the Minister is not careful, he will be heading for an act of self-emulation shortly because he has had no influence whatsoever in dealing with this matter in a coherent fashion when the beef support regime for Third World markets had been practically dismantled under his stewardship since September.</P>
    <P>I sympathise with the Minister of State, Deputy Deenihan, that when there is bad news too often he has to face the music.  It is the responsibility of the Minister, Deputy Yates, in the Council of Ministers to fight the case for Irish exporters involved in the live and processed trade.  Too often the Minister has been seen to create a distance between himself and the tragic situation which is the result of his mishandling of this affair.  The fact that the rhetoric does not relate to reality is coming home to roost.  We are dealing with a crisis in the sheep sector against the most benign background that any Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry could come into office: within 12 months the sheep trade is in crisis, and now the beef sector is in crisis because of the mishandling by this Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Deenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue this evening because it <Col N="1153" /> affords me the opportunity first to explain in some detail the background to the Commission's decision and, second, to assuage farmers' concerns about the implications of the decision.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, one of the more important aspects of the GATT agreement is that a progressively declining ceiling has been placed on subsidised cattle and beef exports from the European Union to third countries.  The ceiling for the current GATT year is 1.19 million tonnes and it will decline to just over 800,000 tonnes by the year 2000.  Compliance with this ceiling is controlled on the basis of export licences issued rather than on the basis of actual physical exports in the course of the GATT year, which runs from 1 July to the following 30 June.</P>
      <P>In view of this the European Commission monitors the level of export licences issued on a regular basis in order to ensure that the overall ceiling on subsidised exports is not breached. Over the past few months, the Commission has taken the view that the level of licences issued was excessive and it adopted a number of measures during that period in order to discourage exporters from taking out export licences too far in advance of physical export.  These measures included cuts in export refunds and a very substantial increase in the rate of security for export licences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, these measures failed to stem the level of demand for licences with the result that by 15 November applications for licences had reached 650,000 tonnes or 60 per cent of the annual GATT ceiling in spite of the fact that we were only one-third of the way through the GATT year, which as I have said ends on 30 June 1996.  The Commission took the view that the approach it had adopted over the previous two months had failed to restore order into the export licensing system and that a new approach was required. Accordingly, the Commission put a proposal to the Beef Management Committee last Friday for a 25 per cent cut in <Col N="1154" /> export refunds, which they made clear was not based on a technical assessment of the level of refunds required for trade with third countries to take place.</P>
    <P>This decision has effectively suspended the export refund system and is designed as a temporary preventative measure to enable the Commission to review the operation of the export refund and export licensing system and to introduce a number of technical adjustments in order to bring about a more orderly approach on the part of the trade to the taking out of export licences.</P>
    <P>My Department has continually opposed the Commission's approach on this issue in the Beef Management Committee over the past few months.  In addition, the Minister, Deputy Yates, raised the matter with Commissioner Fischler at the meeting of the Agriculture Council last month.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. H. Byrne Mr. H. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>What good was that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>During the meeting, the Minister made it clear to the Commissioner that he strongly opposed the Commission's approach and he put forward a number of suggestions for technical adjustments to the licensing arrangements which he believed would more effectively achieve the Commission's objective of bringing about an orderly allocation of export licences. Those suggestions included the shortening of the validiy period of export licences and the introduction of an optional non-transferable licensing system which would encourage genuine exporters and effectively discourage speculators.  I understand that these proposals are now being examined very seriously by the Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that exports to third countries are not possible at the current rates of export refunds and that the effect of the Commission's decision is to suspend the operation of the export refund system.  However, I also believe that this situation cannot be permitted to persist for very long and the Minister, Deputy <Col N="1155" /> Yates, will be writing to Commissioner Fischler over the next day or so, first, to outline in more detail the proposals he put forward at the last meeting of the Council and, second, to emphasise the importance of introducing these technical adjustments as a matter of urgency so that the recent cuts in refunds can be reversed at the earliest possible date. The Minister, Deputy Yates, will also raise the matter at the next meeting of the Council which takes place in the middle of next week.</P>
    <P>The Commission's decision to cut refunds last week was a total over-reaction to what were essentially technical problems with the administration of the export refund system.  However, I am satisfied that the decision will not have any effect on the cattle and beef trade over the next few weeks.  It is clear from the volume of export licences for live cattle and beef in recent months that there are sufficient licences in the hands of the exporters to enable the export trade to continue as normal for some weeks.  During that period my Department will be in regular contact with the European Commission to ensure that export refunds are restored to normal levels as soon as possible in order to minimise disruption to the trade.</P>
    <P>I want to assure the House that we are fully conscious of the importance of this issue and no effort will be spared to get the Commission to take the necessary corrective action and to have normal trading arrangements restored quickly.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Wexford):</i> I am happy <Col N="1156" /> to share my time with Deputy Byrne.  I thank you for allowing me raise this matter on the Adjournment.</P>
      <P>The terrible tragedy which occurred at Howth last week and the ongoing search for the missing boat in Donegal has once again opened up the debate on our sea rescue services, or the lack of them, around our coastline, particularly on the east coast.  The tragic death of one of the trawlermen, Tim Currid, has shocked the community of Wexford, where he lived, and I would like to extend my deepest sympathy to his wife and family and to all the many fishermen who worked with him for many years.</P>
      <P>Talking to fishermen over the past few days I found they are angry because they feel this death should not have happened.  They are angry about the lack of rescue and search facilities. Indeed, in one of last Friday morning's newspapers, the secretary of the Howth Lifeboat Service, Rupert Jeffares, is quoted as saying he had no doubt that if a helicopter with night flying capabilities were available at Baldonnel, the four trawlermen would have been off the wrecked trawler within 30 minutes. When a person in such a responsible position makes a statement like that we must all listen and be prepared to act. That is one of the reasons so many fishermen are angry at present.</P>
      <P>Why must we wait for people to die before we consider taking action to deal with the lack of adequate search and rescue services for fishermen and others using our seas, rivers and waterways? The Minister has ordered a review and I welcome that but can we afford to wait for the findings and recommendations of this review group when one considers how long it usually takes for governments to act upon such reviews?  Perhaps the Minister might clarify whether he has put a time limit on the review. Does he expect a quick response and will he be putting an action plan into operation immediately?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We cannot wait any longer for action. No more lives must be lost and no more families devastated by the loss of loved <Col N="1157" /> ones because we do not have a helicopter with night flying capabilities on the east coast.  It is a national scandal that such a situation exists on a sea corridor which has two major ports, Dún Laoghaire and Rosslare, carrying a huge volume of shipping and thousands of passengers every day in addition to the hundreds of people engaged in sea fishing.</P>
    <P>I call on the Minister to consider expanding the search and rescue services on the east coast immediately and to put in place a proper helicopter service capable of operating on a 24 hour basis.  We do not need a review to do that.  Action must be taken immediately and I call on the Minister to provide the appropriate funding for this service.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. H. Byrne Mr. H. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Far too often I have sympathised with widows, consoled parents and comforted children of fishermen and seafarers.  I did so again last Saturday morning when Timmy Currid, who lost his life at Howth, was laid to rest.  His family and many friends were devastated.  There was anger among his friends who felt that if a helicopter with night flying equipment were available on the east coast, Timmy might still be alive.  Timmy was a married man with four children and, like many other fishermen, he had a mortgage on his new house.  His wife, Carmel, must now come to grips with this terrible tragedy and get on with her life.  She will do that; she is a strong woman and she has promised to dedicate herself to a campaign for improved life saving services to reduce the risk for other fishermen. This generous woman wishes to meet the Minister in the immediate future and I am sure he will agree to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is well known that Timmy Currid had a safe pair of hands.  His every move was measured and calculated.  He and his crewmen were taking the best option when the accident occurred &mdash; they were heading for Howth Harbour.  Their Mayday was received and reacted to promptly.  A helicopter was generously sent from Wales and arrived approximately one hour later.  One hour is a <Col N="1158" /> long time to spend in the sea when there is a ferocious storm.  Helicopters were available at Baldonnel, and private helicopters are based in and around Dublin city, but they were all grounded because they do not have night flying equipment.</P>
    <P>We should hang our heads in shame. We must give a commitment to those who use the sea.  I ask the Minister for a minimum of one helicopter with night flying equipment to be provided urgently on the east coast.</P>

      <P>I wish to preface my response by sympathising with the families of the fishermen lost in the recent tragedy in Howth and those still missing from the fishing vessel <i>Carrickatine</i> off Donegal.</P>
      <P>I am sure this House will wish to mark with respect and appreciation the unstinting contribution of all persons, communities and authorities involved in these two sad incidents.  In particular, the ready response by colleagues and friends of the crew of the <i>Carrickatine</i> reflects the close ties in any fishing community faced with such a tragedy.</P>
      <P>Following every search and rescue operation an internal review into the actual operation is carried out with the intention of identifying any areas where improvements may be achieved in equipment, deployment, personnel, response times and procedures.  The two recent incidents will be treated accordingly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have deliberately refrained from making any wild statements or trying to play politics in dealing with this sad occurrence.  Unfortunately, some of the remarks that have been passed here this evening are unwarranted and will be very much resented by a group of people in the Irish marine emergency service who have spent the past five or six days working around the clock. Without any fear of contradiction I can say that the level of service we have received from these people is remarkable.  Wild statements were made this evening that helicopters were idle on <Col N="1159" /> the ground which, had they had night flying equipment, could have saved lives without waiting to hear the full circumstances.  It is wrong to come in here and criticise those involved in this service. They are professional people and I respectfully suggest that the Deputies should stop playing politics.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to place on the record that in co-ordinating marine emergency response, the Irish marine emergency service of my Department draws on the many resources which are dedicated to marine emergency purposes on a 24 hour basis, including the Co-Ordination Marine Radio and Communications Network, the IMES Sikorsky helicopter based in Shannon, the Air Corps Dauphin based at Finner, County Donegal, the 50 coast and cliff rescue service units, the many purpose built lifeboats operated by the Royal National Lifeboat Institution and the six units of the Community Inshore Rescue Service.  Each of these declared resources has signed agreements with IMES for operation, standards and response and agree that their facilities can be co-ordinated by IMES; at times one and at others a combination of all are used, as is considered necessary. Ireland has responsibility under international maritime conventions for a search and rescue region that extends to <Col N="1160" /> 200 miles off the west coast, 30 miles off the south coast and divides the Irish Sea in half.</P>
      <P>The statement that we have to wait for Britain to supply us with a helicopter service is unfounded.  There is a bilateral agreement under which Ireland will facilitate Britain when requested to do so.  From memory, the statistics for 1994 recently made available to me show that under this agreement facilities were made available to Britain on over 100 occasions.</P>

      <P>This helicopter is based at Shannon which is more than 65 miles from Dublin.  Up to the end of October 1995, the contracted helicopter service carried out 571 missions and saved 377 lives.  To ensure that we continue to deploy our search and rescue resources to the highest international standards I have asked my Department to address the issue of the adequacy or otherwise of coverage of the east coast in the context of the system to be put in place after the expiry of this contract.  If this review indicates that a long-term change is necessary I will ensure that the necessary steps are taken so that the safety of our seafarers is fully protected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government decided in 1991 that the option of a medium range search <Col N="1162" /> and rescue helicopter service being provided by the Air Corps after 1996 should be examined and costed.  That option is being evaluated.</P>
    <P>The Air Corps has a fleet of five Dauphin helicopters, two of which are designed to operate with the Naval Service vessel <i>le Eithne.</i> These are used for a number of tasks, including the provision of a 24 hour, 365 day, search and rescue service based at Finner Camp, County Donegal, and have provided a satisfactory service.  In addition, should the need arise when a Dauphin helicopter is on fishery patrol with the Naval Service vessel <i>le Eithne,</i> it is made available for search and rescue.</P>
    <P>Over the past two and a half years each of the Dauphin helicopters has undergone a major overhaul by the manufacturers in France.  This, in effect, reduced the number of helicopters available to four.  The final helicopter returned to Ireland on Saturday last having completed its overhaul.</P>
    <P>Now that the five Dauphin helicopters are again available to the Air Corps I have asked for an immediate report on the feasibility and consequences of a 24 hour, 365 day, search and rescue service being provided by a Dauphin helicopter based at Baldonnel.  This would be in addition to the service provided from Finner Camp and the helicopter on board the <i>le Eithne,</i> and would be an interim measure pending the outcome of the more general review I have mentioned.  There are many countries in Europe which would look with envy at what Ireland has provided to its maritime users in search and rescue response.  This can be seen from the facts I have given.</P>
    <P>While internationally marine safety is constantly under review Ireland's maritime safety policy is a process where we plan to prevent, predict and pre-empt. We also plan for successful intervention in and management of a casualty and its consequences.  We are aware that maritime safety policy must constantly evolve and roll forward.  That is the reason I have directed that the possibility of providing a Dauphin helicopter <Col N="1163" /> at Baldonnel be investigated and that the issue of east coast coverage be assessed in the longer term.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, his question covers a wide range of Ministries and Departments outside of my control.  Primary responsibility for the conduct of Ireland's foreign policy is vested in the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  The Minister for Tourism and Trade is responsible for trade policy and I am responsible for the promotion of overseas investment in Ireland.  There is close co-operation between our Departments on the question of the external promotion of trade and investment.  This co-operation extends to a number of other Government Departments, including the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, and to those State bodies actively engaged in overseas promotion, such as An Bord Tráchtála, IDA Ireland, Forbairt, SFADCo, Bord Fáilte and An Bord Bia.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="913" /> The relevant Government Departments and the promotional semi-State bodies are represented on the foreign earnings committee, which is chaired by the Minister for Tourism and Trade, and which has as its primary task, to examine, in line with the relevant recommendation of the second report of the task force on Culliton, the question of putting &ldquo;enhanced effective co-ordination mechanisms in place to achieve the necessary single-minded pursuit of Ireland's economic and commercial interests abroad by all our agencies and programmes including the diplomatic service&rdquo; and, through the Minister for Tourism and Trade, to make recommendations in this regard.  As part of its remit the foreign earnings committee has drawn up a draft medium-term plan designed to improve the operational effectiveness of representation overseas concerned with Ireland's economic and commercial interests, mainly in those markets where the bulk of promotional moneys is spent, encompassing a strategic approach, practical initiatives for implementation and, where appropriate, operational targets; and will monitor and review the operation of the medium-term plan and modify it, where necessary, in the light of changing circumstances.</P>
    <P>Finally I would like to assure the Deputy that there is a high degree of co-operation on the ground and our promotional bodies share accommodation and administrative resources in numerous locations where circumstances permit.  Furthermore, the chief executives of the IDA, Forbairt and ABT are on the board of Forfás, whose responsibilities include co-ordinating the work of those agencies and providing policy advice.</P>

      <P>The agencies charged with assisting enterprises to improve their competitiveness and job creation capacity which operate under the aegis of my Department are as follows: Forbairt, IDA Ireland, Shannon Development, and the county enterprise boards.  In addition, Forfás is responsible for the development and co-ordination of enterprise policy.  However, with the exception of its industrial property function, it does not have a direct involvement with firms.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the creation of Forbairt and IDA Ireland stemmed directly from the recommendation in the Culliton report that there should be a separate focus on the development of indigenous industry and the attraction of foreign direct investment.  It is now clear that the restructuring has achieved this goal of allowing each agency to focus on their distinct missions.</P>
      <P>In the case of IDA Ireland, its strong performance in attracting projects from companies like Intel and APC, which were won in the face of ever increasing competition, is a testament to the effectiveness and clarity of mission which the restructuring has brought about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The creation of Forbairt has brought to the fore the continuing challenge of indigenous development.  The fact is that indigenous industry faces huge strategic challenges.  Many firms continue to operate in segments and sectors which are increasingly subject to low cost competition and which are more and more dependent on economies of scale for survival.  Even those companies who have positioned themselves in more attractive niches face a major challenge in developing the competencies and acquiring the necessary funding to support their growth.  The creation of Forbairt has helped to focus on the key developmental issues facing these companies.  My Department and Forbairt are working closely together to formulate a new strategy for indigenous development.  This will form part of the <Col N="915" /> review of enterprise strategy which I intend to publish shortly.</P>
    <P>Both Shannon Development and the county enterprise boards are addressing regional development needs.  In addition to its remit for the promotion of the Shannon Free Zone, Shannon Development operates under delegated authority from Forbairt in respect of its industrial development activities in the mid west region.  There is thus no duplication of functions between Shannon and Forbairt.  The Deputy will be aware that Shannon Development also exercises other regional development responsibilities which fall outside the aegis of my Department.</P>
    <P>The county enterprise boards are addressing a need to stimulate enterprise, and the creation of new enterprises particularly.  They have a broader remit than Forbairt in terms of the types of enterprise they may assist. This is consistent with, and appropriate to, their mandate to maximise the potential for development of very small enterprises at local level.  The establishment of the county enterprise boards is also having the benefit of allowing Forbairt to focus more closely on the developmental needs of its core group of clients in the over ten employees range.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, the agency structures which I have outlined have addressed the key Culliton recommendation on the need to create a separate focus on the development of indigenous industry and the attraction of FDI.  Culliton also recommended that greater attention should be given to indigenous development.  The combined resources of Forbairt and the CEBs, with each focusing on different clients and different needs, is ensuring that the more intensive efforts called for by Culliton in respect of indigenous development are being made.</P>
    <P>The new agencies have been in operation for less than two years and much remains to be done in terms of refining both strategy and operations.  I am, however, fully satisfied that the agencies <Col N="916" /> which I have just described are addressing genuine and distinct needs and I have no plans to rationalise them.</P>

      <P>The commission is independent and consists of 20 members under the distinguished chairmanship of the former Chief Justice, Mr. Thomas Finlay.  The terms of reference of the commission are to examine, report and make recommendations on a broad range of issues affecting the newspaper industry, including the correct balance between privacy and press freedom including consideration of the desirability of a mechanism for complaint and adjudication and of changes in the libel laws. I have asked the commission to undertake its work speedily.  I know that the chairman and members of the commission appreciate the importance and urgency of their work.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 33 and 55 together.</P>
      <P>During the initial phase of the county enterprise initiative, the limit on approval capacity for project supports was provided to the CEBs on the basis of equal shares for each board.  In practice, however, the level of approvals and the level of funding drawn down varied from CEB to CEB depending on the level of activity under way in each board area.  I am at present examining a number of options for producing a system of differentiated allocation of enterprise support capacity between county enterprise boards based on a broad band of criteria, which will balance the need to treat all areas of the country fairly with the need to secure the maximum possible effectiveness of the county enterprise initiative nationwide. Among the factors which will be taken into account in weighting the funding will be the relative size and population of each CEB area, the level of disadvantage in each area and the capacity of each area to create new enterprise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The county enterprise boards have been operating on an informal basis since they were established in late 1993. <Col N="918" /> Their activities to date have consisted of the provision of advice and grants for small businesses starting up or expanding.  Based on returns supplied by the 35 CEBs for 1994, their first full year of operation, the boards assisted in the creation of some 1,776 full-time and 263 part-time jobs.  In total, over 4,000 projects have been approved by the boards since their establishment, involving grant approval of over £35 million, which are projected to lead to cover 6,000 full-time and 1,500 part-time jobs.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied with the performance of the county enterprise boards to date, the more so since the boards have until recently been operating on a relatively limited interim basis.  I expect to see this performance enhanced in future years by the wider range of enterprise development supports available to the boards under the Operational Programme for Local Urban and Rural Development, 1994-99.</P>
    <P>I have no plans to alter the present arrangements for the operation of the county enterprise initiative.  I consider that with their broad basis of participation including local elected representatives, the county enterprise boards represent effective structures to secure the optimum focus of all available resources in the promotion of employment through enterprise at local level.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>In response to the Deputy's question, let me first say that my Department and its industrial development agencies, as well as other public and private organisations, have been working hard for many years to <Col N="919" /> promote development in the Border counties.  I am pleased to say that there have been some notable successes recently &mdash; particularly in the inward investment area &mdash; which I will mention in a moment.  The Deputy will, of course, appreciate that it is somewhat difficult to assess how much of the development is due to the peace process alone, or to say precisely how many jobs have been created as a direct result. There is no doubt, however, that the benefits of the peace process, in terms of improved stability and economic confidence, have contributed greatly to recent developments and I expect that this trend will continue.</P>
      <P>Within the last few weeks, I have announced two major new inward investment projects for the Border counties.</P>
      <P>The American Power Conversion Corporation which manufactures power supply devices to protect computer equipment from power distruptions, has completed negotiations with IDA Ireland for a £14 million investment in Drogheda, County Louth.  The project will create 300 new jobs within three years and over 150 of these will be for skilled or semi-skilled operators who will be trained by the company.  Recruitment is expected to commence in mid-1996.</P>
      <P>In addition Boston Brace International Inc. of Massachusetts is to establish its European manufacturing location for spinal bracing products in Dundalk.  The project represents an investment of £800,000 and the company is expected to employ 30 people, which it is already recruiting.</P>
      <P>The developing peace process was also of enormous benefit in securing the Masonite project in County Leitrim, which otherwise might have gone abroad.  This project involves an investment of approximately £90 million and will lead to direct employment of over 300 people as well as resulting in major spin-off benefits for the region in terms of local purchases and services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a result of the peace process a <Col N="920" /> number of pan-Atlantic partnership programmes have been funded through the US Department of Commerce, the International Fund for Ireland and Forbairt with the objective of helping Irish firms, particularly in the Border counties, to grow through technology acquisition and/or strategic alliance with US partners.</P>
    <P>The programmes, which include the Forbairt-IFI North American Partnership Programme, the Forbairt-Small Business Administration (US) Partnership Programme and the American Management and Business Internship Programme, were all launched during 1995 and I anticipate that they will contribute to the growth of participating companies from the Border counties in the medium to long term.</P>
    <P>There are, in addition, a number of initiatives specific to the Border area in which Forbairt is actively involved. Recently the US Assistant Secretary at the Department of Commerce, Mr. Chuck Meissner, led the Business Matchmaker Mission to Northern Ireland and the Border counties of 16 US companies who were seeking Irish partners.  During their visit they met a range of companies from the Border counties and I have no doubt that positive results will emerge from this initiative.</P>
    <P>In the past few months there have been active visits by companies and representatives from Omagh and Coleraine Chambers of Commerce into our northwest region &mdash; Counties Donegal, Sligo and Leitrim.</P>
    <P>In the opposite direction a number of smaller Republic of Ireland companies are now beginning to focus their attention on markets in Northern Ireland. This, they would claim, is an area which they would have neglected in the past.</P>
    <P>I should also add that 26 Irish companies from the software, electronics, engineering, healthcare and food sectors were in the US last week meeting with 100 American companies on a trade mission which I led.  The visit was organised by Forbairt and co-ordinated by the US Small Business Administration. <Col N="921" /> Each of the Irish companies met a number of US companies which had been pre-selected, pre-screened and contacted by Forbairt and the SBA over the past few months.  During last week's visit, three companies from Border counties established strategic alliances with US companies involving five separate deals in all.  Details of these were given in the newspapers last week.</P>
    <P>Subsequent to this initial visit, both Forbairt and the SBA will support the companies on both sides of the Atlantic to finalise negotiations and implement business deals which will, I have no doubt, prove mutually beneficial.  In spring 1996 the SBA will lead a similar group of dynamic US companies on a visit to Ireland to meet with Irish companies.</P>
    <P>This initiative builds on the announcement made by President Clinton during the Washington conference earlier this year.  On that occasion a commitment was made that the Irish and US Governments would work together to promote strategic alliance and business partnerships between Irish and US companies.</P>
    <P>Finally, I might add that the county enterprise boards in the Border counties have also been very active since their establishment in 1993.  Grants worth more than £5.5 million have been approved by the Border boards for small business projects, of which over £2 million has been drawn down to date. These projects are projected to create over 1,000 full-time and 275 part-time jobs, of which over 200 full-time and 40 part-time jobs had been created by the end of 1994, according to figures supplied by the boards.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have recently received representations from the Deputy on behalf of a manufacturer in County Monaghan outlining difficulties he is experiencing in recruiting staff.  I take it this is the complaint the Deputy is referring to and I have based my answer on the representations expressed in that submission which I have examined.</P>
      <P>The correspondence outlines a situation which, given our real unemployment problem, must be considered as perverse.  A manufacturer whose output is almost entirely exported has created real jobs but finds it very difficult to fill them.  It is of real concern to me that the company has such difficulty in filling these jobs.  Clearly we must find ways of incentivising people to take-up such employment.</P>
      <P>There are four specific areas of policy which Government is addressing to help further incentivise the uptake of employment.</P>
      <P>First, we are improving the after-tax income for workers, and in particular, workers on low income.  In this context the general tax and PRSI position of the low paid has been improved in the last two budgets.  Provisions introduced in the '94 and '95 budgets:</P>
      <P>(a)  exempted low incomes from health and employment levies;</P>
      <P>(b)  increased standard rate income tax bands;</P>
      <P>(c)  increased personal income tax allowances;</P>
      <P>(d)  introduced a PRSI allowance of £50 per week for full rate contributors so as to focus relief on low income earners.</P>
      <P>These measures were introduced to increase the net take home pay of workers, particularly targeting the low paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Second, along with seeking to improve the after tax income of low paid workers, the Government has made considerable progress in reducing <Col N="923" /> the cost of employing people through the introduction of a new lower contribution rate for employers PRSI in 1994, as amended in 1995.  These measures were specifically introduced to reduce the costs of employing staff and consequently ease the competitive difficulties of business.</P>
    <P>Third, the expert working group on the integration of tax and social welfare systems, which is considering the interaction of the tax and welfare systems, is due to report soon to the Minister for Social Welfare.  The interaction of these systems can produce serious unemployment and poverty traps and as Minister for Enterprise and Employment I will clearly be very interested in both their analysis and policy prescriptions on this important issue.</P>
    <P>Fourth, the welfare system comprising of direct payments and secondary benefits, can blunt the incentive for certain groups to take up employment.  The measures taken to alleviate poverty can perversely contribute to unemployment which is in itself the greatest single cause of poverty.  This problem is most severe for those with families.</P>
    <P>In the context of the above, a number of the measures announced in the 1995 budget improved the take home pay position of workers generally.  Furthermore, the income of families with dependent children have also improved irrespective of whether the parents are employed or unemployed, through the increase in child benefit of £7 per month per child as announced in the 1995 budget.</P>
    <P>A back to work scheme introduced in 1993 by the Department of Social Welfare provides a tax free income support for lone parents and those unemployed for more than 12 months to re-enter employment or become self-employed through a business start up.  Participants under the scheme are allowed to retain a certain percentage of relevant social welfare payments for three years.  They also retain secondary benefits, such as medical cards, rent allowance etc. where total of income from employment and <Col N="924" /> the back to work allowance is less than £250 per week.  Certain conditions are attached to this scheme by the Department of Social Welfare including the condition that the employment proposal involved creates a new job either in paid or self employment.  This scheme is focused on reducing the participant's exposure to loss of social welfare income on changing employment status. As such, this scheme provides an incentive to avail of employment opportunities where additional staff are being taken on by employers.</P>
    <P>Clearly, given the existence of both considerable unemployment and disincentives to accept employment when offered, there are serious problems with the operation of the labour market.  My Department is currently reviewing policy in relation to the operation of the labour market in the context of a wider pro-employment policy review.  In addition my Department is also, along with other relevant Government Departments, overseeing the preparation of a comprehensive strategy to deal with unemployment for Government to implement over the coming months.  The four specific areas I have referred to above will be considered in that context and I and my Department will examine any reasonable proposals to encourage the unemployed to seek and accept employment.</P>

      <P>The following further measures are being taken to improve customer service and operational efficiency at the Companies Registration Office: In line with an IT plan recently approved in principle, <Col N="925" /> improvements to the CRO computer systems are being implemented, involving further significant investment over the coming years.  Improvements are being made in working methods under a business process re-engineering project.  A search for new accommodation for the CRO in Dublin is currently in progress following a decision announced by the Minister of State at the Department of Finance in his reply to a question on 10 October, 1995 (cf. Official Report Vol. 456, No. 6, Col. 1483-1484).  The new premises should, <i>inter alia,</i> permit the creation of a more customer friendly public office. Additional staff approved by Government will be appointed in the near future.  I am also setting up a users council which will provide a forum to formalise dialogue between the CRO and its various customers.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the measures I have listed will result in significant improvements both in customer service and in the operational effectiveness and efficiency of the CRO.</P>
      <P>With regard to the organisational status of the Companies Office I can confirm that, following careful consideration, there are no plans to turn it into a fully autonomous agency outside the structures of the Civil Service.  However steps have been taken over the last year or so which, when combined with the measures I have listed earlier, will result in a more commercial and services oriented structure as recommended by the Culliton report.  Reference was made to such developments by way of reply to questions on 8 February 1994 (Vol. 438, No. 4, Col. 848-852) and 23 February, 1994 (Vol. 439, No.3, Col. 520-521).</P>
      <P>The CRO has worked very effectively in recent years with the resources at its disposal and I would like to take this opportunity of paying tribute to all the staff involved.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 40 and 58 together.</P>
      <P>The county enterprise boards are a mechanism through which local communities.  State development agencies and local authorities are involved in developing and implementing enterprise development strategies in general.  The composition of the CEBs represents a partnership between elected representatives, State agency personnel, the social partners at local level and local business and voluntary sector representatives. The inclusion of local elected representatives on the CEBs involves those representatives in a central role in the development of locally-based strategies for the promotion of employment through enterprise.</P>
      <P>I have no function in relation to the funding of local authorities, which come under the aegis of the Minister for the Environment.  County enterprise boards are the vehicle through which the Minister for Enterprise and Employment provides assistance at local level to individuals such as those referred to in the Deputy's question.  As the Deputy is aware, local authorities are directly represented on county enterprise boards by elected members of the relevant city or county council.</P>

      <P>I have no plans to regulate the no claims bonus and loading schemes operated by insurers. Insurers maintain that the no claims discount system encourages safe driving.  It provides the incentive of reduced premiums for claims-free driving on the one hand, and the system of loadings acts as a disincentive to accident claims, on the other.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may be aware that the use of no claims bonuses and loadings by insurers is universal throughout the EU and is not subject to State regulation.  In the EU single insurance market the determination of insurance premiums is based on insurers' underwriting and claims experience and the need to provide funds to meet claims as they arise.  My primary responsibility in relation to insurers is to ensure that they meet their statutory solvency and reserving requirements.  In that regard, my Department's financial supervision of insurance companies influences the setting of premiums inclusive of no claims bonuses and loadings at adequate levels to comply with the insurer's statutory financial guarantees.</P>

      <P>The question of setting targets to implement more of the recommendations of the small business task force is a matter which I keep under regular review.  In fact, I have recently completed a review of the main priority areas and targets of my Department and many of my top priorities relate to small business.</P>
      <P>The systematic examination and implementation of the recommendations of the small business task force is being pursued by the small business and services division of my Department which has assessed all of the recommendations and priority areas identified.

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="929" /> On the question of costs, a large percentage of the recommendations impact either directly or indirectly on fiscal policy and the cost of implementation has to be balanced by the Government against other demands for Exchequer funds.  Nevertheless, I consider that substantial progress has been made and I plan to continue to press ahead with the development of new proposals and initiatives for the small business sector.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>The NOW programme has been operational in two phases.  The first phase, from 1992 to 1994, involved thirty three pilot projects working with partners in other member states of the European Union.  These projects piloted innovative approaches with the objective of improving the vocational prospects of women on the labour market.  They encompassed areas such as training, community and enterprise development and childcare provision.  Project promoters received 65 per cent of eligible costs from the European Social Fund.  The NOW programme was considered, through independent evaluation, to have been highly successful and benefited a wide range of community and voluntary groups throughout the country.  It has been renewed by the European Commission and will operate again in the period to the end of 1999, with an EU budget provision of approximately £14 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A national information campaign was undertaken by my Department to publicise the NOW programme at the start of this year.  As a result, over 200 applications were received.  Thirty seven of these were provisionally approved through an independent selection procedure.  They have been given grants to develop particular aspects of the projects and to formalise the transnational <Col N="930" /> partnership arrangements which apply. Final approval for the projects to operate in 1996 and 1997 will be notified shortly.  In this new phase projects will receive 75 per cent of eligible costs from the European Social Fund.  Half of the total budget allocation has been assigned to the 1996-1997 period.  New applications will be sought in 1997 for projects which will operate in the period 1998-1999.</P>
    <P>I am particularly anxious that the positive lessons learned through the operation of pilot projects under the NOW programme should inform national policy and provision.  My Department and the European Commission will be paying particular attention to that aspect.  A representative monitoring committee has been established to oversee the implementation of the programme and this will ensure that the successful outcomes are main-streamed to the greatest possible extent.</P>
    <P>I am also aware that particular difficulties have been experienced because of delays in payments from Brussels. The final 20 per cent payment owing on the last NOW programme has been outstanding for far too long and, as a consequence, individual project promoters have had to arrange interim borrowing and pay interest charges arising.  My Department is actively pursuing this issue with the European Commission.  I have taken steps to ensure that this will not arise in the future, when payments will be made by reference to annual expenditure returns, rather than through achieving expenditure targets over a multi-annual period as applied in the past.</P>

      <P>Procedures for the handling of insurance complaints within the single market have been under discussion since 1994 by the conference of EU insurance supervisory authorities at which all member states are represented.  Recommendations have been agreed which would allow non-established insurance undertakings to participate in the complaints arrangements which apply in the policy-holder's member state, including the possibility of joining insurance ombudsman schemes and which would allow a high level of co-operation and bilateral contacts between insurance supervisory authorities in order to ensure that complaints are dealt with expeditiously in cases of difficulty.</P>
      <P>Under policy-holder disclosure rules contained in the European Communities (non-life insurance) Framework Regulations, 1994 and the European Communities (life assurance) Framework Regulations, 1994, all insurance undertakings and intermediaries are bound to inform policy-holders of the arrangements for handling policy-holders' complaints including the existence of a complaints body, without prejudice to a person's right of recourse to legal proceedings.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>The functions of Forfás are set out in Section 6.-(1) of the Industrial Development Act, 1993.  The section provides that the functions of Forfás shall be to advise the Minister on matters relating to the development of industry in the State, to advise on the development and co-ordination of policy for Forbairt, IDA Ireland, An Bord Tráchtála and such other bodies as the Minister may designate; to encourage the development of industry and technology in the State; to encourage the establishment in the State of industrial undertakings from outside the State; and to advise and co-ordinate Forbairt and IDA Ireland in relation to their functions.</P>
      <P>Forfás came into being in the context of an overall restructuring of the industrial development agencies on 1 January, 1994, which of course predated my coming to the office in the Department. Its structure emerged as a response to recommendations of the review group on industrial policy (Culliton) in the area of policy formulation and also as a result of the need to address the issue of co-ordination among the various development agencies.  The establishment of a specialist unit within the Department as an alternative to Forfás may have been an option, but the fact is that the decision to set up Forfás was the one taken at the time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A central theme of the Culliton report was that industrial policy must go beyond a narrow focus on the interventions of the industrial development agencies and concern itself with the wider environment for enterprise.  Since its establishment, Forfás has been <Col N="936" /> instrumental in providing my Department with the data collection and analytical support necessary to develop this wider focus.  Among the areas in which Forfás has carried out or commissioned research are telecommunications, transport and logistics, technology trends and innovation activity, and the cost competitiveness environment for industry. In addition, Forfás has established advisory groups on taxation, commercial telecommunications, and transport and logistics which bring together relevant experts from the public and private sectors thus ensuring that the developmental needs of Irish enterprise are fully articulated in the development of policy in these areas.</P>
    <P>In the area of research and development (R &amp; D) Forfás carries out an important co-ordinating role in respect of the EU-funded framework programmes for R &amp; D.  These programmes cover a wide range of technological activities which are crucial to the competitiveness of Irish enterprise and of relevance to various Departments of State.  Among the programme areas covered are agriculture and food; health; energy; and environmental protection.  The Science and Technology Division of Forfás has also provided substantial analytical support to the Science, Technology and Innovation Advisory Council (STIAC) which reported recently.  The recommendations of the council are currently being considered by a committee under the chairmanship of the Forfás chief executive officer.</P>
    <P>Forfás also monitors the impact of the activities of the industrial development agencies.  The surveys of employment, Irish economy expenditure and research and development provide the essential base of quantitative data from which to assess the performance of manufacturing and internationally traded industry.</P>
    <P>In carrying out these functions, Forfás complements the policy formulation activities of my Department and works closely with it.  Indeed the complementary structure of Forfás and the Department has many advantages.  Because the <Col N="937" /> staff of Forfás working in the areas I have just described are not involved in the day to day activities of the Civil Service, they are in a position to provide the in-depth analytical support which my officials require in order to exercise the wider policy role envisaged by Culliton.  In addition, Forfás is well positioned to act as facilitator, bringing together public and private sector experts in the various advisory groups which I have described.</P>
    <P>The board of Forfás also plays a vital co-ordinating role by bringing together with experienced industrialists and other business people, the chief executives of Forbairt, IDA Ireland, FÁS, An Bord Tráchtála and the secretary of my Department to help achieve a co-ordinated approach to development policy across the agencies.</P>
    <P>In addition to its policy advisory role, Forfás has been undertaking an imporant co-ordinating function in respect of certain management issues which cut across the development agencies &mdash; for example, in the administration of the industrial property portfolio which involves both indigenous and overseas companies.  This function will shortly transfer to IDA Ireland as already announced.  Another important cross cutting management area is that of personnel.  Under the provisions of Paragraph 2 of the Second Schedule to the Industrial Development Act, 1993, Forfás is the employer of all staff within the three agencies.  While the Act provides for the secondment of staff to Forbairt and IDA Ireland, Forfás retains overall statutory responsibility for the staff so seconded.  Forfás has responsibility for the National Standards Authority of Ireland (NSAI) which publishes national standards and provides a comprehensive certification service for products, quality and environmental management systems and for the National Accrediation Board which accredits certification and testing bodies.  Forfás is also the body within which the powers and functions contained in the Industrial Development Acts, the Industrial Standards Acts and the <Col N="938" /> Science and Technology Act, 1987 are vested and devolved to Forbairt and IDA Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Deputy has asked whether the functions carried out by Forfás could be carried out at a great saving to the taxpayer by my own officials.  I do not believe this to be the case.  Even if Forfás had never been created, my Department would have required extra resources to carry out the wider policy role which was called for by Culliton. Within the existing structure, the division of functions between the two bodies is, as I have described, a complementary one.  And even if it were possible to dismantle Forfás and transfer its staff and functions to my Department, the likelihood is that there would be an extra cost to the taxpayer in the short-term without there necessarily being a prospect of savings in the longer term.</P>
    <P>However, all of this does not mean that we should be <i>blasé</i> about the question of value for money.  I am committed to the ongoing monitoring of activities of Forfás to ensure that its performance justifies its budget &mdash; as I am for the other State agencies for which I have responsibility.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department monitors, on a continuing basis, a broad range of data from FÁS relating to expenditure and levels of activity achieved on its various programmes, numbers placed in employment having completed FÁS programmes and so on, and compares such data with the performance levels of previous years with a <Col N="939" /> view, in particular, to identifying any areas where improvement might be merited.  Programmes are also monitored by FÁS itself and through my Department's European Social Fund Evaluation Unit.</P>
      <P>International monitoring includes studies by FÁS of its own performance levels, the attitudes of its clients to the various programmes offered, the numbers who are in employment one year after completing FÁS training programmes, and various other studies on individual programmes conducted either internally or with the assistance of outside organisations.  I understand that, following a recent review of performance indicators, the FÁS board decided that the considerable efforts it has been making to assess its performance should now be further intensified. Work is in hand to implement this decision.  I will also ensure that any recommendations made by my Department's ESF Evaluation Unit, which will approve the quality and relevance of training provided, will be acted on.</P>
      <P>In the Operational Programme for the Development of Human Resources, base-line indicators were set in 1994 and targets to be achieved by 1999 have been established.  In accordance with the programme, all training measures implemented by FÁS are monitored by reference to four basic performance indicators.  These indicators focus on placement rates following completion of training; progression rates from lower level to advance level training; recognition of standards achieved through the certification of courses and the provision made for training of trainers to ensure that their own standards are at least adequate to meet current industrial and technological needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All training and employment courses provided by FÁS are supported by the European Social Fund, as well as by the Exchequer.  The impact of the very significant investment levels involved is regularly reviewed by the monitoring committee set up under a human resources operational programme, by <Col N="940" /> reference to the impact indicators I have already outlined.  That committee is representative of a very wide range of interests, including members from employer and trade union organisations, the community and voluntary sectors and organisations dealing with equal opportunities policy.  In future, the continuation of training and employment programmes delivered by FÁS will be determined by the extent to which they are achieving the specific objectives which have been set down for them.</P>
    <P>Having said all that, I accept that more may be required.  In this context, my Department has, in the context of preparing the forthcoming White Paper on Training, been looking very carefully at the issue of how FÁS performance should be measured.  This work includes, <i>inter alia</i>, an assessment of the suitability, quality and value for money of existing FÁS programmes.  Decisions on proposals emerging from the process will be made by Government in due course.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton) Richard Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 53 and 60 together on the basis that Deputy Harney has asked whether the impact of the State agencies <Col N="941" /> on the creation of employment in the Irish economy can be quantified, and whether there are any mechanisms for measuring such impact in the Irish economy and Deputy Quill has asked what performance indicators are in use to measure the efficiency and effectiveness of Forbairt and IDA Ireland.  Both agencies have employment creation as a key objective and, as such, the employment performance of the firms assisted by the agencies is one of the main measures of agency effectiveness.</P>
      <P>In response to the first part of Deputy Harney's question, I would confirm that there are well established procedures for quantifying the impact of the state agencies on the creation of employment in the economy.  The primary mechanism is the annual survey of employment which records the actual numbers employed in each company assisted by the agencies.  The annual survey is supported by interim quarterly estimates of employment, given by the agencies.</P>
      <P>The employment survey provides information on the permanent and part-time employment levels in the companies involved.  By comparing the employment survey results with previous years, the following information can be obtained: the number of jobs created; the number of jobs lost; and, the net change in employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The employment survey results for the agencies are reported in the Forfás annual employment survey report.  The 1994 survey was published in July of this year and I have arranged to have copies transmitted to Deputy Harney and Deputy Quill.  In summary, the main findings set out in the document are: in 1994 overall permanent full-time employment in the portfolio of companies dealt with by the agencies increased by 6,057 jobs to 218,138 jobs; IDA Ireland companies accounted for 5,208 of the 6,057 net employment increase, with Forbairt companies contributing a net 202 jobs and Shannon development companies accounting for the balance of 647 jobs; the gross job gains in 1994 was 20,795 jobs &mdash; IDA Ireland companies <Col N="942" /> accounted for 9,764 jobs, Forbairt companies accounted for 9,147 jobs and Shannon development companies, 1,877 jobs.</P>
    <P>A further means of assessing the impact of the increased industrial activity within the economy is through the annual Irish economy expenditure survey which is conducted by Forfás. This survey gathers data on: expenditure on wages and salaries; purchases of Irish manufactured raw materials; purchases of Irish Services; and profits retained in the economy.</P>
    <P>The most recent survey published covers 1993 and I am arranging to have copies of this survey transmitted to the Deputies also.  In this context, research work undertaken by the Economic and Social Research Institute and Forfás indicates that expenditure by manufacturing companies within the economy leads to nine additional jobs in services for every ten jobs in manufacturing, thus demonstrating the importance of manufacturing as a stimulant to overall employment levels in the Irish economy.</P>
    <P>Analysis of grant cost per job sustained provides an indicator of the efficiency of the agencies in assisting job creation.  State grant cost per job sustained is defined as the sum of all Forbairt and IDA Ireland grant payments over a seven year period divided by the number of first time jobs created and still in existence at the end of that period.  For the purposes of this calculation, a first time job is defined as the increase in employment in a company over and above the peak employment level in the previous five years and related to a specific investment programme agreed with IDA Ireland or Forbairt.  The grant cost per job sustained for the seven year period 1988 to 1994 was £9,930 for Forbairt companies and £12,786 for IDA Ireland companies, giving an overall average of £11,409.</P>
    <P>Historically, there has been a tendency to consider the impact of the industrial development agencies only in terms of employment in firms.  In the light of the current unemployment situation we <Col N="943" /> need to continue to focus on this area. However, I believe that we also need to look at other indicators of industrial performance such as sales, exports, profitability, productivity and R&amp;D spend. This is particularly important in the case of indigenous industry whose historically poor employment performance can only change for the better if substantial improvement in all of these areas is achieved.  I have asked my Department, in conjunction with Forfás, to give increased attention to this wider set of indicators as part of its monitoring of the performance and impact of the agencies, and proposals in this regard will be included in the enterprise strategy which I intend to publish shortly.</P>
    <P>We must, of course, acknowledge that the agencies are contributors to, as opposed to determinants of, industrial performance, whether it be measured in terms of sales, employment or any of the other indicators I have outlined. Ultimately, the performance of Irish enterprise depends on the ability and willingness of Irish people to take the risks associated with entrepreneurship and to develop the competencies to manage growth in an increasingly competitive world.  It also depends on the creation of a favourable environment for enterprise which supports firms in improving their competitiveness.  By addressing these issues we will improve the performance of enterprises themselves and also add value to the developmental actions of the agencies.</P>

      <P>The number of proposed redundancies notified to my Department during the first nine months of 1995 was 9,509.  The total for the corresponding period in 1994 was 11,843.  The figure for the first nine months of 1995 represents a decrease of approximately 20 per cent on the figure for the corresponding period in 1994.  It is projected that the annual total for 1995 will be the lowest annual total for many years.</P>
      <P>While many factors have contributed to the reduction in the number of redundancies, the figures undoubtedly reflect the effectiveness of measures taken to date to protect employment.  Further initiatives currently under way as part of the strategic management process in my Department include the preparation of a series of medium term strategy papers on all aspects of enterprise development and the labour market as well as a white paper on training.  The thrust of these initiatives is to achieve a further improvement in the climate for enterprise, raising labour force skills and promoting the employment intensity of growth.  Such developments will clearly impact on the level of redundancies and on the prospects for re-employment where redundancies are unavoidable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions No. 57 and 61 together,</P>
      <P>The information technology industry encompasses a number of closely related yet different sectors, particularly electronics, software, telemarketing and multimedia.  Ireland has already established itself as one of the most attractive locations in Europe for investment by companies in these sectors.  Since the beginning of 1994 IDA Ireland has secured investment totalling £1.468 billion in 45 companies.  As a direct result of this investment, 13,000 jobs will be created over the next three years. Shannon Development has approved grants of £5.83 million for 21 companies involving 595 jobs during this period.</P>
      <P>Over a similar period, Forbairt approved support for 133 indigenous software companies involving an investment of £14.1 million.  A total of over 1100 jobs should be created as a result of this.  Also, on the indigenous side, a very positive development has been the emergence of Irish-owned companies which design and manufacture their own proprietary electronics products primarily for export markets.  Some of these companies have significant growth potential.</P>
      <P>Funds are also being provided under research and development programmes to strengthen our technological base.  In particular, our participation in EU information technology research programmes, where in 1995 Irish firms have secured contracts worth £26 million of EU funds, helps develop the technological capability of the sector in general.  I am confident that we can look forward to significant further employment creation opportunities in the overall IT industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, as regards the information society in general, I would like to point out that initial steps have already been taken to plan for the impact of the information society on Irish enterprise and employment.  It is important that an Irish Information Society Strategy is put in place, and, with this in mind, I am pursuing the establishment of a task <Col N="946" /> force/co-ordinating committee to elaborate on, and manage an overall information society initiative.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of representations have been made to the British authorities in the case of the person referred to by the Deputy since he was involved in an escape attempt last year.  When he complained of being ill-treated by prison staff following his recapture, the matter was immediately taken up by the Irish Embassy in London and a full medical examination was arranged.  An official of the Embassy visited him shortly afterwards.</P>
      <P>Subsequently, and following the prisoner's transfer to another prison in Britain, he was visited again by an Embassy official earlier this year.  At that time he complained about his conditions of imprisonment and in particular about difficulties surrounding family and other visits.  These matters were taken up with the British authorities and some improvement resulted for a time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regrettably the prisoner, who is currently classified as Category A &ldquo;Exceptional Risk&rdquo;, has since June of this year again been subject to a regime of closed visits for family members and others. The Deputy will be aware that this regime was introduced by the British authorities for the small number of Category A prisoners following the security review which followed on earlier escape <Col N="949" /> attempts.  The Government has continued to make known its concern about the hardship which this imposes on the Republican prisoners involved and their families.</P>
    <P>The person in question was again visited by an Embassy official in July and he has also been visited by a number of Oireachtas members in recent months. The Embassy is arranging another consular visit to take place shortly.</P>
    <P>Regarding the Deputy's reference to a legal submission, I understand that the prisoner's legal representatives have prepared a submission seeking to reopen his case which was provided to the British Home Secretary last year.  I further understand that this submission has now been formally acknowledged and that the Home Office have commenced enquiries into certain aspects of the case.  The Deputy will appreciate that it is for the prisoners' legal representatives to pursue the matter at this stage.</P>
    <P>I will continue to emphasise to the British authorities the critical importance of a positive approach to dealing with the conditions of the prisoner named by the Deputy, and of the other Republican prisoners in Britain, in the overall context of the peace process.  For our part, the Government have made clear that we stand ready to implement the provisions of the Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons for those Republican prisoners who have applied for a transfer to this jurisdicition.</P>

      <P>As doubts have been raised about this person's real identity and his entitlement to an Irish citizenship, the Passport Office is reviewing the question of his entitlement to carry an Irish passport.  I am aware that this man is suspected of having been involved in criminal activity in the UK and elsewhere.  However, suspicion of involvement in or convictions of crimes is not normally sufficient reason in itself for Irish passport facilities to be denied to Irish citizens.</P>

      <P>The new context created by the cessation of violence has transformed the potential for economic development in the entire border region.  The Government wishes to see full advantage taken of the significant new opportunities which arise in this context for North-South trade and economic co-operation.</P>
      <P>It is difficult at this early stage to quantify, particularly on a geographical basis, the precise economic benefits which have accrued to specific areas since the cessation of violence.  Reports from both the private and public sectors indicate that on an overall level there has been substantial increased economic activity in all main sectors such as tourism, services and the industrial sectors. Counties Cavan and Monaghan are strategically placed to benefit from this increased economic activity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 68 and 69 together.</P>
      <P>The special EU Support Programme for Peace and Reconciliation in Northern Ireland and the Border counties provides for a new five-year Community initiative, with funding of 300 MECU of (IR£240 million approx.) allocated for the first three years (1995-97) of the initiative.  The special support programme is designed to complement existing EU and national programmes and the funding provided is entirely additional.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Northern Ireland and the Border counties will receive respectively, a maximum of 80 per cent and a minimum of 20 per cent of the total funding.  For the six Border counties of Cavan, Donegal, Leitrim, Louth, Monaghan and <Col N="952" /> Sligo this will amount to EU funding of 60 MECU.</P>
    <P>In the joint Operational Programme adopted by the Commission on 26 July 1995, five priority areas were identified for support namely: employment; urban and rural regeneration; cross-Border development; social inclusion; productive investment and industrial development.  Within each of the five priority areas there are several sub-programmes.</P>
    <P>The total funding involved for each sub-programme, (i.e. EU, public and private funds), North and South, and the delivery and monitoring arrangements for the disbursement of financial assistance in the South are set out in summary form in the following annex. Further details of all arrangements can be found in the operational programme, a copy of which was sent to all Oireachtas Members in the Border region shortly after its adoption.</P>
    <P>As of yet, no disbursements have been made by either intermediary bodies or Government Departments under the EU special initiative.  This has been primarily due to the difficulties in finalising administrative arrangements, which are quite complex and innovative. It is expected that all the necessary arrangements will be completed in the very near future by the Department of Finance.</P>
    <P>EU Special Support Programme for Peace and Reconciliation in Northern Ireland and the Border Counties</P>
    <P>The following Table details the delivery mechanisms and responsible Departments in respect of the Border counties and for cross-Border activities in respect of the above Programme.  The total funding (EU, public and private) in millions of ECU for each of the sub-programme measures, North and South, is also shown.</P>

      <P>I presume that the body referred to by the Deputy is the VIMA branch of the Revenue Commissioners, which is located in Dundalk.  That branch is responsible for important new work which the State, in common with the <Col N="958" /> other member states of the European Union, assumed responsibility for implementating on completion of the Single Market on 1 January, 1993.</P>
      <P>The VIMA branch administers the VAT information exchange system, it collects the national statistics of foreign trade, including trade with other EU countries, and it is also responsible for operating EU mutual assistance arrangements in relation to VAT.  The VIES system involves the collection and exchange between EU tax administrations of information about intra-Community trade for the purposes of ensuring that value-added tax is properly accounted for and to help prevent Exchequer losses through evasion of that tax.</P>
      <P>The statistics of trade between the EU countries are gathered through the INTRASTAT system which in this country is managed by the VIMA branch on the basis of periodic returns by some 6,000 traders.  The branch also collates the third country trade figures on the basis of data contained in import and export customs declarations.  The mutual assistance arrangements administered by the branch are also governed by EU law and provide a framework for co-operation between member states to prevent and detect VAT fraud and evasion in intra-EU trade.</P>
      <P>Many of the officials currently serving in the VIMA branch were formerly employed as Customs staff on the land frontier.  Their traditional work disappeared following the removal of internal frontiers as a consequence of completion of the Single Market and they were redeployed by the Revenue Commissioners to carry out the vital work now performed by the VIMA branch.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The primary role of the Revenue Commissioners in combating drug trafficking is played by the Customs Service, which is responsible for deterring and preventing smuggling of illicit drugs.  As I informed the House on a number of occasions, the Revenue Commissioners have allocated very substantial resources to this task and, in particular, they set up the Customs <Col N="959" /> national drugs team (CNDT), comprising over 70 staff, specifically to tackle drug smuggling.  The CNDT has been responsible for many major seizures of illegal drugs and has contributed significantly to curbing the flow of drug smuggling.</P>
    <P>While the investigation of persons suspected of dealing in drugs is primarily a matter for the Gárda, the Inland Revenue side of the Revenue Commissioners has also an important role to play arising from its duty to recover tax from all persons who make taxable profits and gains.  The tax code provides for the assessment of profits or gains from an unlawful or unknown source under the description &ldquo;miscellaneous income&rdquo; and where Revenue obtain hard information from their own investigations or from the Garda which indicates that individuals have accumulated assets and have a lifestyle which cannot be reconciled with declared income, the relevant provisions of the Tax Acts are used to establish tax liabilities.  The Revenue Commissioners are satisfied that appropriate resources are committed to this work.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> The criteria governing the reappointment of nursing staff who are returning from career breaks are the same as for other health service staff. Staff on career breaks are required to give at least three months notice of their intention to return to work.  The person returning from the career break is then <Col N="960" /> entitled to the first suitable, fillable vacancy which arises following the due date of his or her return.  In the event that such a vacancy does not arise in the employing agency on the termination of the period of the career break, the person is guaranteed re-employment within the health services within twelve months of the date which had been notified as the desired date of return.  In instances where a return to duty does not coincide with a vacancy in the employee's previous grade, the person could be offered, on a temporary basis, a lower graded post, with appropriate lower graded pay, pending the occurrence of a vacancy in the grade formerly held.</P>
      <P>Employing agencies must bear in mind this obligation to re-employ persons within 12 months of the expiry of their career break when filling posts in a permanent capacity, particularly in grades and in agencies where there is not a high level of staff turnover.  Their recruitment process with regard to the advertising of vacancies takes this into account.</P>

The Eastern Health Board's methadone programme has been in operation for two and a half years now and a clinical audit of patients who have received treatment has been carried out.  The audit has shown that, of those attending for methadone treatment, 10 per cent are opting for detoxification and a further 60 per cent have improved their quality of life to such an extent that they are classified as stable and are ready for discharge to the community.

The exact number of community drug centres, the location and the capacity of each of the services to be provided, will depend on local needs, the availability of suitable premises and on the outcome of detailed discussions which are being conducted between officers of my Department and the health board's management.  While the submission provides for six additional centres, the number and type may vary depending on the discussion and the consultations outlined.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the serious problem within the North Eastern Health Board in County Meath, whereby many medical card holders must wait approximately two years for sight test appointments; if he will encourage the health board to quickly develop the choice of optician scheme in view of the fact that this would help cut back the waiting list.</Quest>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> The provision of ophthalmic services for eligible persons in <Col N="970" /> the Meath area is the statutory responsibility of the North-Eastern Health Board.  In the provision of services the North-Eastern Health Board gives priority to applicants with special needs such as persons with certain medical conditions, and every effort is made to ensure that urgent cases are processed without delay.</P>
      <P>I am concerned with any undue delay in the provision of sight testing and spectacles.  Accordingly, I made available an additional £95,000 this year to the North-Eastern Health Board for the provision of sight testing services to adults on their waiting lists.  I understand that the board has allocated £38,000 of this money to the Meath area to carry out sight testing and supply spectacles to those on their waiting lists. The health board expects that this additional allocation will have a considerable impact on the waiting list in the Meath area.</P>

      <Quest>the proposals, if any, he has under the Powers of Attorney Bill, 1995, regarding current powers of attorney where the patient has a progressive illness and would be unable to execute a new power of attorney; the effect of the enactment of any new legislation or the existing Act on current powers of attorneys in these circumstances; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>Under the present law a power of attorney is automatically revoked upon the donor of the power becoming mentally incapable.  In the type of case mentioned by the Deputy, where the donor has a progressive illness and is unable to execute a new power of attorney, the existing power would therefore have already been revoked.  These revoked powers cannot be revalidated retrospectively by legislation.</P>
      <P>I should add that the Powers of Attorney Bill 1995, which is now before the Seanad, provides for powers of attorney that come into force on the donor becoming mentally incapable. However, an essential condition for enabling such powers of attorney to be granted is that adequate safeguards are provided against possible abuse both at the stage when they are being granted and after they have come into force.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the fact that, under current regulations in relation to public service vehicles, many people who currently hold hackney licences in newly designated taxi areas will be put out of business; and if he will consider amending the fifth schedule to the regulations to give greater weight in the points system to existing hackney owners.</Quest>

      <P>I have no proposals at this stage to amend the Road Traffic (Public Service Vehicles) (Amendment) Regulations, 1995.  These regulations provide that, where the number of applications for taxi licences in a new taximeter area exceeds the number of licences to be granted, an assessment based on a points system specifically designed for such areas is to be made.  The system gives priority to holders of hackney lic ences providing a service in the area based on the number of years the licence has been held.  Points are also available to holders of licences to drive public service vehicles, and to holders of ordinary driving licences.</P>
      <P>The creation of a taximeter area and the determination of the number of taxi licences to be granted are matters for the decision of the members of the local authority concerned.</P>

      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 106 and 108 together.</P>
      <P>In deciding on the application of the free fees initiative I must have regard to the cost implications as well as criteria which require institutions to be recognised for the purposes of third level student support and to be part of the CAO entry system.</P>
      <P>The Royal College of Surgeons is not at present part of the CAO entry system.  The college has indicated its intention to join the CAO system but I understand that the earliest academic year in which it could participate in the system at this stage would be 1997/98.</P>
      <P>It would also be necessary to consider the implications of extending the initiative in the context of the existing quota on medical places.</P>
      <P>My Department is in consultation with representatives of the college regarding these issues.</P>

      <P>The regulations governing exemption from the study of Irish contain provision for children of returned emigrants who enroll in primary and second-level schools.</P>
      <P>At primary level, a pupil whose primary education up to the age of eleven years was received in Northern Ireland or outside Ireland may be granted exemption by the Department from studying Irish, provided that the parent or guardian was permanently resident in Northern Ireland or outside Ireland during the pupil's period of education up to that age.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At second-level, pupils in the following circumstances may be allowed to substitute any other approved subject <Col N="993" /> for Irish in order to make up the minimum number of subjects to be studied: pupils whose primary education up to the age 11 years was received in Northern Ireland or outside Ireland; and pupils who were previously enrolled as recognised pupils who are being reenrolled at second level after a period spent abroad, provided that at least three years have elapsed since the previous enrolment in the State and the pupils is at least 11 years of age on reenrolment.</P>
    <P>Information concerning the conditions which apply to the granting of an exemption is circularised to schools. Applications for exemption at primary level are dealt with centrally in the Department.  The managerial authorities of second-level schools have been delegated authority by the Department to grant exemptions in accordance with prescribed procedures and criteria and subject to regular monitoring by the Department.</P>
    <P>The criteria providing for exemption are kept under review and are updated periodically to take account of new circumstances.</P>
    <P>There is no formal appeal procedure against decisions in this matter. However, the Department considers fully the views of parents dissatisified with decisions regarding exemptions and endeavours to ensure that exemption criteria are applied equally and fairly throughout the school system.</P>

      <P>The site at Scholarstown Road remains in the ownership of the Department of Education.  South Dublin County Council offered to maintain the site until it was required for building purposes if my Department allowed the local community to avail of it as an amenity area.  The Department agreed to this on condition that vacant possession would be available to the Department when this was requested.</P>
      <P>Some 194 pupils left sixth class in St. Colmcille's primary school at the end of June 1995.  My Department is not aware of Knocklyon pupils who could not be accommodated in postprimary schools within a reasonable distance.  The bulk of the primary school leavers enrolled in Sancta Maria Convent and Coláiste Éanna, Ballyroan, Our Lady's school, Templeogue, Templeogue College and Terenure College.  Precise details of the number of places made available by the schools in question are not readily available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am satisfied that, with the provision <Col N="996" /> of the additional accommodation proposed for Coláiste Éanna and Templeogue College, the Knocklyon primary school leavers can be accommodated both now and in the long-term.  I will ensure, however, that the position is kept under regular review.</P>

      <P>In the context of my Department's post-primary building programme, a contract is a legally binding agreement between the Department and a building contractor to undertake construction work.  Once signed, a contract may only be reviewed or amended strictly in accordance with the terms of the contract.</P>
      <P>I understand that in this instance the Deputy is referring to accommodation being provided for students from Knocklyon in schools outside the immediate Knocklyon area.  Additional accommodation is being provided at Coláiste Éanna, Ballyroan and Templeogue College, some of which is intended to cater for pupils from the Knocklyon area.  Construction is at present under way on the first phase of an extension project at Coláiste Éanna which will cost approximately £465,000; the second phase is at an initial planning stage.</P>

    <P>Architectural planning for an extension to Templeogue College is well advanced and the question of allowing the project to proceed to the construction stage will be considered in the context of the 1996 allocation for post-primary building purposes.

      <P>The White Paper on Education, &ldquo;Charting our Education Future&rdquo;, stated that programmes will be developed relating to tobacco, alcohol, substance abuse and the promotion of healthy lifestyles.  These programmes will support schools in promoting the social, personal and health education of pupils.  Where classes in the general life-skills area are provided in schools at present, my understanding is that substance abuse prevention education is included.</P>
      <P>Initiatives are being taken in respect of substance abuse prevention education.  A major programme of substance abuse education for second level schools has been developed jointly by the Departments of Education and Health in conjunction with the Mater Dei Counselling Centre.  This programme was launched in October, 1994. It is being disseminated to second level schools generally with associated in-career development for teachers.  At the end of the school year 1994-95 the programme has been introduced to about 50 per cent of all second level schools and the dissemination and in-career development continues during the current school year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is hoped that details will be given in the near future of a substance programme for primary schools.  In primary <Col N="1000" /> schools, education on substance abuse is part of the health education which is included in the overall physical education programme.  The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment is reviewing the provisions of health education in primary schools, including substance abuse education.</P>
    <P>In second level schools, education on substance abuse may be included as part of a social, personal and health education programme or integrated with other relevant subject areas.  The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment is currently examining the issue of the introduction of social, personal and health education to second level schools generally.</P>

      <P>I have no immediate plans to proceed along the precise lines suggested by the Deputy.  However, my Department is conscious of the necessity regularly to review developments in computer and communications technology and of the merit in exploring alternative modes of service delivery.</P>
      <P>At present, the national distance education centre provides a range of education courses for approximately 3,000 students through the use of facilities which include telecommunications, information technology and local support centres providing tutor support.  It also engages in research and development initiatives which explore the use of IT and telecommunications in supporting education programmes.</P>
      <P>My Department will be keeping developments in the field of new learning technologies under regular review.</P>

    <P>The post leaving certificate course in journalism and publishing was sanctioned in the school in question each year since 1989/90, and is funded by the <Col N="1005" /> Department of Education with assistance from the European Social Fund. There are at present 10 staff involved in teaching the programme, eight of whom were selected and appointed by the school board of management, and approved by the Department of Education in accordance with normal practice.  The remaining two were selected by the principal and appointed by the school board of management as hourly paid part-time teachers, in accordance with normal conditions governing such appointments.  In addition, a part-time teacher was previously employed on the course, having been selected by the principal and employed as replacement for a teacher absent on leave, also in accordance with normal conditions.</P>
    <P>There is no formal link between the Institute of Journalism and Theatre and the programme in the school in question which is certified by the National Council for Vocational Awards.  However, two of the lecturers in the institute also taught elements of the PLC course, and some of the materials used on the institute's courses were used on the post leaving certificate course.</P>

      <P>An application has been received for funding towards the provision of a PE hall for the school in question under the post-primary schools capital programme.  Due to the demands on capital resources available, priority has to be given to the provision of essential teaching accommodation.  As a result, it is not possible to make funding available at this stage for the provision of a PE hall at the school in question. The position in relation to sports facilities is that, in general, school projects are not eligible for national lottery funding under either the major sports capital programme or the recreational facilities scheme administered by the sport section of my Department.  However, a limited number of school sports facilities have been assisted under the schemes where the project is being undertaken by a local community group in co-operation with a school.

There is no cost in 1995 arising from the free fees initiative as non grant-aided students pay the first half of the fees themselves in 1995.  The estimated cost in 1996 is approximately £3.2 million.</P>

      <P>My Department provides annual funding for the support of national voluntary youth organisations and their services, special projects for disadvantaged young people, youth information centres as well as other youth related activities.  Funding in 1995 is £12.615 million.  Funding is not provided, as such, for youth services under the EU-aided operational programmes. However, the measures funded by my Department under the operational programmes for human resources development, tourism and industrial development contribute significantly to the enhancement of educational and vocational training services for young people.  The overall funding available to the education sector under these operational programmes is set out in the following table.</P>
      <P>The community initiatives are intended to support measures which will help solve problems having a particular impact at European level.  They support the development of transnational, cross-border and inter-regional co-operation and provide for a &ldquo;bottom-up&rdquo; approach to implementation.  Youth organisations and groups are eligible to apply for funding under the following Community initiatives: the employment community initiative (Horizon, NOW and Youthstart); the adapt community initiative; the INTERREG community initiative (Cross Border and Maritime); the special community initiative in support of the peace process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the Youth for Europe 3 programme youth organisations and groups <Col N="1008" /> may apply for funding to participate in transnational exchange activities.  The programme is operated on behalf of my Department by Leargas &mdash; The Exchange Bureau and will run from 1995-99.  There are 5 different actions in the programme, with action A dealing with the core area of youth exchanges. Funding available to Ireland in 1995 under action A alone will be over £250,000 approximately.</P>
    <P>The Socrates European community action programme for transnational co-operation in the field of education aims to help improve the quality and relevance of education for children, young people and adults by enhancing European co-operation and increasing access to the range of learning opportunities available across the Union.  The funding available under this programme is not allocated on a national basis.  Proposals for funding for the different actions must be submitted to the European Commission in accordance with the guidelines for applicants.  The guidelines also outline the activities that will be supported by the Commission.  The national agencies responsible for the implementation of Socrates in Ireland are the Department of Education, the Higher Education Authority, Léargas &mdash; the Exchange Bureau, the National Distance Education Centre and the Linguistics Institute of Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Leonardo da Vinci programme is a new vocational training programme which consists of a set of transnational Community measures covering both initial and continuing vocational training.  The programme aims to sustain quality and support innovation in member states training systems through transnational pilot projects, transnational placement and exchange programmes, surveys and analyses, and complementary actions.  As in the case of the Socrates programme, funding is not allocated on a national basis, rather it is allocated on the basis of established criteria by which projects are considered. <Col N="1009" />  The programme is managed by the Leonardo da Vinci National Co-ordinating <Col N="1010" /> Unit based in Leargas &mdash; the Exchange Bureau.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 142 and 143 together.  Earlier this year, I allocated an additional ten resource teacher posts to primary schools.  This brings the total of such posts allocated to the primary school sector to 36.  The role of a resource teacher is to act in support of ordinary teaching staff in dealing with children with disabilities who are fully integrated into ordinary primary schools.  I also allocated an additional 55 remedial teacher posts to the primary sector with effect from September, 1995.  This allocation brings the total number of remedial posts in the primary sector to 1,188.</P>
      <P>These remedial and resource posts were allocated on the basis of priority of need following the collection of data by my Department's primary inspectorate.  I will continue to review needs in this area and consider how best these needs can be addressed within available resources.  The needs of all schools, including the primary schools in the Kenmare area, will be considered within this context.</P>

I understand that the owner has assured the Garda that the allegations are unfounded and that he has consistently refused to sell alcohol to any person whom he suspects of being under-age, or whom he suspects is purchasing alcohol for provision to under-age persons.

      <P>Arrangements, which will enable individuals who were availing of a recognised methadone maintenance programme immediately prior to committal to prison to continue to receive such programmes following committal, are at an advanced stage of preparation.  I want to emphasise, however, that the prescription of methadone is in every case a matter for a medical practitioner and that strict medical and other criteria must govern any such arrangements in a prison setting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1017" /> At present drug addicted prisoners may, following committal, avail of limited detoxification programmes where appropriate in individual cases.  In addition there is in place at present a comprehensive range of services for prisoners with drug addiction problems. These include addiction counselling courses, a comprehensive education programme which highlights in particular the risk of contracting communicable diseases, including HIV and hepatitis C from drug abuse, and a full range of medical, psychiatric, and psychological services.  In addition there are arrangements in place with several community based drug treatment agencies for the assessment of drug addicted prisoners and, in suitable cases, the continuation of treatment with such agencies in the community following release.</P>
    <P>Further proposals which are now at an advanced stage of preparation will provide for: the creation of a detoxification facility in the medical care unit in Mountjoy Prison; and the establishment of a secure drug free unit.</P>
    <P>These facilities will be put in place as soon as practicable and will enable the prison authorities to accommodate those prisoners who do not have a background of drug abuse or who have decided to opt out of the drugs culture in a totally drug free environment within the prison.  On the other hand those who are suffering from acute drug addiction problems and who show the necessary commitment, will be afforded an opportunity to avail of a humane detoxification programme on a par with the best available in the community. The question of providing a needle exchange programme to prisoners was considered in detail by the advisory committee on communicable diseases in prisons which reported in 1993.  The committee &mdash; the majority of whose recommendations have now been implemented &mdash; concluded that &ldquo;such an approach would be inappropriate in the context of ... safety and security&rdquo; and I concur with that view.</P>

      <P>Where the quantity seized is such to suggest that the drugs are for immediate personal use of the possessor, a charge under section 3 of the Acts may be appropriate unless there is evidence of intent to supply or sell.

A new Garda station is being built in Drogheda at present as a divisional headquarters.  The transfer will take place when the necessary work at Drogheda Garda station, which is currently in progress, is completed early next year.</P>
      <P>The deployment of manpower and resources to individual areas is a matter for the Garda authorities.  They inform me that there will be no reduction in the operational policy services in Dundalk or the Border areas within the Louth/Meath division as a result of the relocation of the divisional headquarters to Drogheda.  The divisional officer is satisfied that the move is a necessary and logical administrative one.  I believe that the relocation of the divisional headquarters in Drogheda will have the advantage of placing it nearer to all major population centres within the division and this will enhance the effectiveness of policing in the division as a whole.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to my reply to Question No. 156 of 20 June, 1995.  I indicated in that reply that, particularly given the complexities of the issues which arise, I was looking at proposals by which the working of the group would be enhanced by the provision of additional resources.  I have decided that membership of the group &mdash; which is at present confined to a representative of my Department, the Department of the Environment and Threshold &mdash; should be expanded particularly to include members with relevant legal and commercial expertise in the area.  I expect to finalise these appointments very shortly and I propose to ask the reconstituted group to report to me not later than 31 March next.  Meetings of the group &mdash; of which there have been three to date &mdash; are likely to take place much more frequently and more benefically once the group has been expanded.</P>

      <P>The person concerned was entitled to unemployment benefit but opted not to avail of it in accordance with the legislative provisions which provide that assistance may be claimed where this is more beneficial.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, he was paid unemployment assistance, including an increase for an adult and one child dependant, with no means assessed against him from 19 September 1994.</P>
      <P>The claimant's wife became self-employed and as she was earning over £60 per week he was no longer entitled to the adult dependant allowance and was entitled to only half the child dependant allowance.</P>
      <P>The legislation provides for the assessment of any benefit or privilege, including any benefit derived from income earned by a spouse from employment or self-employment.  The person concerned was accordingly assessed with the benefit of his wife's income from self-employment.</P>
      <P>Where the spouse of a person in receipt of unemployment assistance takes up insurable employment as an employee, the first £45 of weekly income is disregarded in recognition of the costs associated with going out to work.  Where the spouse is employed three days or less each week, the disregard is £30.</P>
      <P>In self-employment cases no specific disregard is allowed but full account is taken of all work-related expenses incurred by the spouse in operating the business.  Such expenses would include all costs such as those relating to the hire or maintenance of premises, power and light, hire of staff, transport, materials, special clothing etc.  The balance is assessed as means which in this case were assessed at £72 a week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where an increase is not payable in <Col N="1024" /> respect of a person who is one of a couple, the legislation provides for the halving of means assessed.  Accordingly, the means were halved from £72 to £36 per week.  This left the person concerned entitled to £33.10 per week, being the maximum rate appropriate to an individual plus half a child dependant allowance £69.10 less £36 means.  This change was implemented on 8 November 1995. The person concerned has appealed against this decision.</P>
    <P>A person who opts to claim unemployment assistance instead of unemployment benefit may revert to claiming unemployment benefit if this is more beneficial.  The person concerned has exercised this option and will be paid unemployment benefit at the weekly rate of £69.10, being the personal rate of £62.50 plus half rate increase for one child.  If the person concerned remains unemployed his entitlement to unemployment benefit will expire six weeks from 8 November.</P>
    <P>While there is an overall reduction in assessed net family income in this case, nevertheless it primarily arises because of the present assessment of the wife's means arising from self-employment, an assessment which can vary from time to time.  If this latter income increases, only one half of it will be reckonable as means, thus maintaining a worthwhile incentive.</P>
    <P>I am anxious to ensure that the rules and regulations do not cause difficulties for a claimant or his-her spouse getting back into employment, and I will be looking at this aspect again in the light of the circumstances of this and similar cases.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>The development of indigenous industry is one of the major priorities of my Department, and in this context the provision of <Col N="1028" /> appropriate seed or early stage development capital is vital to the ultimate success of many fledgling companies.</P>
      <P>I note that the Deputy asks whether further incentives might be provided to those wishing to invest in seed companies and I believe the Deputy's question recognises that a number of incentives already exist to facilitate investment in seed type ventures.  In this regard I would mention the following; the 1993 Finance Act widened the scope of the business expansion scheme to provide a refund of a specified number of years income tax already paid by an individual who sets up and takes employment in a new qualifying business.  The business must be set up with the intention to carry on BES qualifying trading operations and must otherwise comply with the requirements of the BES.  This new relief is known as the seed capital scheme.</P>
      <P>The business expansion scheme has and continues to be a substantial contributor towards the provision of seed and early stage capital.  This is evidenced by the fact that since the inception of the scheme in 1984 and up to the end of tax year 1994-95, 1,017 of the 2,001 investments made, that is just over half, were for sums of less than £50,000.</P>
      <P>The countrywide network of county enterprise boards have responsibility for promoting enterprise in their local areas by the provision, among other things, of grant support to individuals and local community groups to assist the establishment and development of commercially viable small enterprise projects</P>
      <P>Although not strictly seed capital, the access to finance scheme was launched in August and will, I am sure, be of considerable financial benefit to many early stage ventures.  Under this scheme, just over £200 million in loan finance is available to SME's at a very competitive fixed interest rate of 6.5 per cent.  The minimum loan is £20,000 and the duration of the loans will be seven years. This is the successor to a previous scheme administered by ICC under which £100 million in low interest loans was lent to SME's.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1029" /> The provision of seed and early stage capital is not and should not be the sole responsibility of the Government or public agencies.  For this reason I am glad to note that a number of private sector initiatives have been set up in the past few years to provide much needed equity and other financial support to young and emerging companies. Amongst these important initiatives are first step, the Bolton Trust, the business innovation fund and the Smurfit job creation enterprise fund.  I am also aware of other initiatives which are being contemplated in this area.</P>
    <P>As regards the question of further incentives raised by the Deputy, within the past week, I announced a very important new seed-venture capital measure which I anticipate will become operational early in the new year. Under this measure a £60 million fund is to be set up which is designed to promote greater investment in seed and early stage companies which can demonstrate their commercial potential.  The funding is being provided jointly by the EU and private institutions.</P>
    <P>Forbairt, the State agency for the development of indigenous industry has recently made known its intention of establishing a venture capital fund, which, when established, will provide a further source of funding for the development of early stage indigenous industries.  I am looking forward with enthusiasm to the establishment of this fund as an addition to the existing range of seed-venture facilities.</P>
    <P>I am confident, therefore, that appropriate mechanisms and incentives for the provision of seed and early stage finance are either in place or are contemplated in the near future.  These should be built upon.  The provision of early stage finance is high risk and for that reason its supply needs to be continually monitored.</P>
    <P>As to the targeting of such incentives at unemployment blackspots, all of the measures I have outlined are targeted directly at promoting enterprise and employment.  Initiatives such as the county enterprise boards operate at the <Col N="1030" /> local level.  A good mix of incentives is in place, spread nationally, and available to those wishing to promote employment in their local areas.  I feel that this broad approach is the appropriate basis to proceed on this issue.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the above, I am always prepared to consider new ideas and new approaches where circumstances suggest the need for additional incentives, and to this end my Department is continually monitoring the availability of early stage development funding for indigenous industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>There have been a number of studies and working groups over the past number of years that have examined the possible impact of <Col N="1031" /> employer PRSI reductions on employment.</P>
      <P>Generally, there is broad agreement in the available research and among business and industry representatives and commentators that a reduction in employers' PRSI would probably have a positive impact on employment, although it is difficult to quantify the impact.  Given that employers' PRSI has a proportionally greater cost impact on lower paid employments, reductions in employers' PRSI are likely to have a proportionally greater beneficial impact on lower paid employments.</P>
      <P>In its 1993 report on a strategy for competitiveness, growth and employment, the NESC looked into the issue of PRSI and stated that, viewed as a tax, there were a number of aspects to PRSI which were unsatisfactory and which merited attention in an employment strategy.  Broadly speaking the NESC conclusions in regard to employers PRSI contributions could be summarised as follows:</P>
      <P>(a) The structure of PRSI means that it is regressive, increasing the cost of low paid labour more than high paid labour.  This has, according to the NESC, a distinct disadvantage from an unemployment viewpoint as workers classified as unskilled are over represented on the live register, and, secondly, firms which employ low paid labour generally compete primarily on cost.</P>
      <P>(b) The base for PRSI is limited. This implies that it strengthens the incentive to substitute capital for labour, it is a greater burden on firms in labour intensive sectors and by directly increasing the cost of labour it has an adverse impact on competitiveness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(c) Employers' PRSI is not related to the employers' ability to pay and it may be negatively related.  Labour intensive firms tend to be less profitable so their PRSI liability will tend <Col N="1032" /> to be a higher proportion of their profits.</P>
    <P>The NESC was of the view that a restructuring of PRSI can contribute to improving employment performance and that that employment impact could be maximised if the restructuring was focused on achieving greater reductions at lower income levels.  I would agree with the analyses and conclusions outlined above, bearing in mind that the quantitative impact of PRSI reductions is difficult to assess accurately.</P>
    <P>The 1990 report of the Interdepartmental working group on PRSI-income tax and the lower paid and the 1993 report of the interdepartmental working group on employers' PRSI both examined the available research data on this issue.  While recognising that PRSI reductions would have a favourable employment impact, in quantitative terms both reports found that the available research data tended to be problematic as regards quantifying that employment impact, as it had proved difficult to measure accurately.</P>
    <P>I endorse the changes to the PRSI system announced in the 1994 budget whereby a new reduced rate of 9 per cent employers' PRSI would be levied on incomes up to £173.00 per week.  In this year's budget the Minister for Finance announced an increase in the income threshold to £231.00 per week, and stated that the increase would assist employers in maintaining or creating employment.  I readily supported this change and endorsed that view.</P>
    <P>Employment data published by the CSO provide evidence that the change to the employers' PRSI system, together with the Government's other employment policies, are bearing results.  The CSO Industrial Employment bulletin for June 1995 (Provisional) reports that employment in all industries was 227,000 in June 1995, an increase of 10,900 on the June figure.  Employment in manufacturing industries increased by 11,400 over the same 12 month period.</P>
    <P>The 1995 labour force survey preliminary estimates state that the number of <Col N="1033" /> persons at work is estimated to have increased by 49,000 by comparison with 1994.  Included in these estimates is an increase in industrial employment of 12,000 and an increase in service employment of 39,000.</P>
    <P>In summary, therefore, I believe that reductions in charges or taxes on labour will both help to maintain existing employment, particularly in low margin labour intensive sectors of our economy, and provide an incentive for employers to create new employment opportunities.</P>

      <P>In general, industrial sectors which are labour intensive, for example clothing and textiles and sub-sectors in areas such as electronic and automotive components, are at greater risk of employment decline because of cost competitive pressures, especially from lower cost locations in Europe and elsewhere.</P>
      <P>The industrial development agencies administer a wide range of support programmes to facilitate restructuring and repositioning by firms in vulnerable industries with a view to meeting increasing cost and other competition and, consequently, to safeguard employment and minimise potential job losses. Programmes by the agencies to assist such industry include R and D and innovation, capability development in management, marketing, training and other areas, quality and sub-supply to multinational firms.  These programmes are being regularly reviewed and refined to meet the changing requirements in the marketplace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have indicated in an oral reply to Deputy O'Rourke today, I expect to <Col N="1034" /> launch formally within the next few weeks a &ldquo;Change Management Programme&rdquo; to facilitate companies in implementing initiatives to increase competitiveness.  Forbairt and SFADCo will administer the programme for which EU Structural Funds are available.</P>

      <P>The numbers placed in employment following completion of FÁS mainline training programmes is very encouraging.  FÁS estimate, for example, that around 70 per cent of those who completed specific skills type training during 1994 have since secured employment.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will, no doubt, be aware that a smaller proportion of FÁS training programmes are geared towards more vulnerable groups such as early school leavers and other disadvantaged groups.  The intent of such programmes is to provide foundation training for participants which, in fact, often serves as a launching pad to more advanced training.  Accordingly, one would expect that the numbers place in employment following completion of such training would not be as high.  FÁS estimates 48 per cent of participants on these programmes during 1994 have since been placed in employment.</P>

      <P>It was important in designing the scheme to reduce the minimum loan size from the £40,000 level which applied under the small business expansion loan scheme in order to allow smaller borrowings to be eligible.

      <P>EU legislation provides an option for member states to change the system of compensatory payments for producers of arable crops under the national base area system to one based on individual base areas. Arable aid was introduced as part of the CAP reform to compensate cereal producers for reductions in EU support prices.  Under EU legislation only farmers who had land in set-aside during the 1989-91 period or who were producing arable crops in that period on owned or rented land would be entitled to IBAs. The current legislation does not provide for a reserve to deal with the legitimate claims of other farmers, whether or not they are existing land owners.  I have been seeking to have introduced EU legislative and administrative arrangements, including provision for a reserve, which would open the possibility of IBAs being implemented.</P>
      <P>I am not in a position to say when such arrangements might be introduced but in any event, it is not my intention to apply IBAs unless the eligible land rule is changed and there is a danger of an overshoot of the national base area which would trigger penalties for existing producers.</P>

      <P>I know that some farmers in County Kerry have not been paid under the 1995 headage and premium schemes for various reasons such as late submission or non-submission of area aid applications, not having the minimum 7.5 statute acres needed to obtain disadvantaged areas grants, not having suckler cow quotas, or not having any animals eligible for payment on special beef premium applications.  Notwithstanding the fact that applicants under the various schemes were advised on application forms and help sheets and by way of press advertisement and other means of the detailed requirements attaching to each scheme, it is clear that a number of farmers throughout the country have either failed to submit area aid applications or submitted them after the closing date.  At my request my officials are in contact with the European Commission to see if a solution to this type of problem is possible.</P>

      <P>There are currently no national regulations regarding electromagnetic emissions from mobile telephone base stations. Regular monitoring of radio frequency emissions from such stations does not take place and there is no information available on the base station mentioned by the Deputy.  Eircell's base stations are designed in the first instance to comply with guidelines on limits of exposure to radio frequency electromagnetic fields issued by the International Non-Ionising Radiation Committee of the International Radiation Protection Association (IRPA).  Telecom Éireann has, from time to time, commissioned independent monitoring tests on selected Eircell base stations.  I am informed by the company that it is satisfied, as a result, that these base stations are operated in continuing compliance with the IRPA guidelines.</P>
      <P>In the context of the forthcoming second GSM mobile telephone licence, I will shortly be bringing forward regulations governing the use of radio transmissions by mobile telephone base stations.

    <P>There is no EU regulation pertinent to such emissions other than that relating to electromagnetic compatability or EMC.  Council Directive 89/336/EEC, as amended.  It requires that electrical and <Col N="1044" /> electronic equipment must meet harmonised EMC standards designed to ensure that such equipment has basic immunity from electromagnetic disturbance and that it does not cause electromagnetic interference to other equipment.

      <P>The factors that influence Ireland's energy policy objectives are distance, size, isolated location, energy import dependence, unemployment and a developing economy.  As such, Ireland's energy policy aims to assure security of energy supplies by reducing dependence on imported oil and developing indigenous resources, to improve energy efficiency in all sectors and to meet environmental standards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the end of January this year the European Commission published a Green Paper entitled &ldquo;For a European Energy Policy&rdquo;.  The key aspects of the <Col N="1046" /> Green Paper are an examination of the principal challenges with which the Community will be confronted in future. In essence, these involve resolving the conflicting demands of security of supply, competitiveness and the environment.</P>
    <P>The objective of the Green Paper was to launch an energy policy discussion and allow all interested parties to contribute to the debate.  As a result of this debate, the Commission proposes to publish a White Paper in the near future which will establish a working plan for energy in the Community.  Ireland welcomes this approach and participates at all relevant European meetings on the matter.</P>
    <P>In the discussions to date one of our objectives has been, and will continue to be, to embrace Irish energy policy goals within the overall European energy framework.  On publication of the EU White Paper, my Department will examine its implications for Irish energy policy and I will then decide if we need to redefine our own energy policy goals in a White Paper on Irish energy policy or if the EU White Paper can be adapted as appropriate to meet our needs at a national level.</P>

      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 196 to 199, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The Deputies will be aware that the High Court judgment to which they refer was delivered only on Friday, 10 November last, and is reportedly among the longest High Court judgments ever. Given this fact and the complex and difficult issues which were put before the court, I welcome the speedy decision in the case.  However, they will appreciate that I will have to consider the judgment carefully and take legal advice on it before any definitive comment or decision on the question of an appeal can be made.  It should be noted that a final written and approved copy of the judgement has not yet been made available by the court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would, however, like to point out that the High Court in affirming the statutory basis for radio frequency licensing, including the validity of the exclusive MMDS licences, confirmed my duty to regulate the use of the radio spectrum in the national interest.  An important consideration is the quality of services to television viewers.  This places a demand on frequency space. However, I must also have regard to Government policies and objectives in <Col N="1048" /> the broadcasting area, which will require frequencies for a third independent television channel, as well as an Irish language channel.  Teilifís na Gaeilge, both of which are to be provided on a nationwide basis.  Provision will also have to be made in the near future for frequencies to broadcast programmes in the new digital format.</P>
    <P>The judgment went on to affirm the right of South Coast Community TV to have the case for licensing their system in the UHF broadcast band reconsidered by me, but it does not predicate what the outcome of that reconsideration should be.  As soon as my Department receives a detailed licence application from South Coast it will be fully examined in a process that is fair and impartial but which takes account of all my responsibilities.  The implications of the judgment for the provision of similar services in other parts of the country will be considered.  In the meantime, I am prevented by the continuing injunction from taking any action against South Coast pending further consideration of the matter by the court.</P>
    <P>Turning to the question of equipment held by my Department, the Deputy will be aware that this was voluntarily surrendered although its return was subsequently sought.  The equipment was retained on the basis that it would have constituted an offence to possess it without an appropriate licence.  That situation does not appear to have been altered by the judgment, although this issue will be further considered in the context of my examination of the South Coast application.</P>

In accordance with the terms of that agreement, designated airlines of both countries are free to operate air services on specified routes between the two countries.  There are no limitations on capacity offered by airlines on such services and airlines are free to determine air fares in accordance with their own commercial judgment.</P>
      <P>In relation to scheduled air services, Irish airlines currently enjoy access rights to four US points &mdash; New York, Boston, Chicago and Los Angeles &mdash; while US airlines may serve Ireland from any US point.  In relation to charter services, both Irish and US airlines can operate from any point in the US to Ireland.  Both scheduled and charter services must operate in conformity with current policy in relation to Shannon which is that airlines must maintain the same level of direct flights to Shannon as to Dublin.  However, in relation to charter services to Cork or Connaught Regional Airport, there is no requirement to serve Shannon.</P>
      <P>Currently, Ireland has services from New York and Boston in the north east provided by Aer Lingus and from Atlanta in the south by Delta.  I should, of course, also mention that Aeroflot has been granted traffic rights between Shannon and Chicago, Washington, Miami and Tampa.  Aer Lingus recently anounced its plans to develop its transatlantic scheduled services in 1996. These plans include the provision of new year round direct services between Chicago and Ireland and significant increases in capacity between Boston and Ireland and New York and Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a matter, in the first instance, for airlines to decide whether to operate services between the US and Ireland based on their own commercial judgment but, of course, every opportunity is taken to encourage US airlines to commence new services to Ireland.  In this regard, my Department from time to time approaches US airlines regarding opportunities for new Ireland-US services as do other State agencies. <Col N="1050" /> Indeed, only last month I met with US based aviation interests who are seriously examining the possibility of starting up new transatlantic services to Shannon and I gave them every encouragement in this regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Lowry)</NameTxt>
      <P>The policy of my Department is to actively encourage and welcome new services on all routes to and from Ireland.  The regional airports are owned and operated by private undertakings and, as such, the developmental plans, traffic potential and viability of these airports are primarily matters for the individual airport companies.  However, the Deputy will be aware that, in order to improve access to the regions from abroad through the network of air services operating to and from Dublin, my Department, this year, introduced a programme of essential air services in accordance with EU Council Regulation 2408/92.  This programme, which covers services between four regional airports &mdash; Kerry, Galway, Sligo and Donegal &mdash; and Dublin, is designed to guarantee a minimum level of air services to the regions.  So far, operating contracts have been awarded for Kerry/Dublin and Galway/Dublin routes.  This programme applies to routes within Ireland only, as international services must be operated on a fully commercial basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should also point out that since the establishment of the Single Market on 1 January 1993, all member state airlines are free to operate on any international European route without any restriction on frequency, provided slots are available at airports.  The question of <Col N="1051" /> whether any airline wishes to exercise such rights is, however, entirely a matter for the airline to decide on the basis of its own commercial judgment.</P>

ARI's main <Col N="1052" /> income from overseas activities is by way of management contracts which require minimal investment.  ARI's total overseas assets are currently £2 million approximately.</P>
