      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Before coming to the Order of Business I propose to deal with a notice of motion under Standing Order 30 from Deputy Mary O'Rourke.  I now call on Deputy O'Rourke to state the matter of which she has given notice to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I request leave to adjourn the Dáil under Standing Order 30 for the purpose of discussing an issue of great importance, namely, the need for the Government to accept the proposal it has received to give designated status to a part of Athlone wherein is based the Silverlea Plant.  This bestowal of designated status, if urgently executed, will initiate a major developmental process which will not alone help to maintain the 170 jobs there but will have the potential to create more jobs. I understand that a Deputy of the Minister's party has initiated a major debate with the Labour Party on this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy may not now elaborate on the notice she conveyed to me.  Having considered the matter fully I do not consider it to be one contemplated by the Standing <Col N="1182" /> Order.  Therefore, I cannot grant leave to move the motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 2, 8, 9 and 10.  It is also proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that No. 2 shall be decided without debate; that the following arrangements shall apply in relation to No. 10: (i)  the opening statements of a Minister or Minister of State and of the main spokespersons for the Fianna Fáil Party and the Progressive Democrats Party shall not exceed 30 minutes in each case; (ii)  the statement of each other Member called upon shall not exceeds 20 minutes; and (iii) a Minister or Minister of State shall be called upon not later than 15 minutes before the debate is due to conclude to make a statement in reply not exceeding 15 minutes.  Private Members' Business shall be No. 15 and the proceedings thereon shall be brought to a conclusion at 8.30 p.m.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Order of Business yesterday the Taoiseach seriously misled this House when responding to a question raised by Deputy Harney, the Leader of the Progressive Democrats, in which she stated that the Minister for Justice was working with a blank piece of paper which she inherited from her predecessor, myself, on the Juvenile Justice Bill.</P>

      <P>If Deputies are <Col N="1183" /> dissatisfied with replies from Ministers, the Tánaiste or the Taoiseach, there are many ways open to them to deal with the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not correct to use the metaphor of a blank sheet of paper because obviously considerable work had been done on the subject.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Given that the core issues as to which Department is responsible for children in difficulty had not been dealt with, the Bill could not proceed.  Since the previous Taoiseach had said repeatedly that this Bill was at an advanced stage, the incoming Government was surprised to discover that the core issues, without which the Bill could not proceed, had not been settled.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday our Party Whip raised the issue of legislation for the next session.  The Taoiseach will appreciate that having no idea of proposed legislation creates difficulties for the Opposition.  When in Government we always tried to keep the Opposition accurately informed about business for the following session.  Last week occupiers liability legislation was debated late at night&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I must dissuade the Deputy from making a speech.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying to get an assessment of what legislation is likely to be dealt with between mid-April and the end of the next session.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will answer a parliamentary question about this matter this afternoon.  I will arrange for the Government Whip to give to the Opposition, on an informal basis, the best possible estimate of the legislation in the order in which it is likely to be taken.  However, I will not do what has been requested by the Fianna Fáil Whip and set up a rigid priority list of legislation indicating the order in which Bills will be introduced because, as anybody who has been responsible for the management of parliamentary business will understand, that would be neither prudent nor possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter should not lead to argument.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>We have changed our procedures in that we now have a huge number of committees in the operation of which the Opposition parties are supporting the Government.  However, if we have legislation&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <P>When is it proposed to introduce the higher education grants (amendment) Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That legislation is at an early stage of preparation and likely <Col N="1185" /> to be presented in the House in the latter half of this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for clarifying the matter I raised yesterday although I gave him three opportunities to comment on the juvenile justice Bill.  The Government has promised to hold referenda on the issues of Cabinet confidentiality &mdash; I am not sure what the position is on the question of bail &mdash; and voting rights for emigrants.  When will we see the legislation to facilitate the holding of these referenda?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Not for some time yet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it proposed to hold a composite referendum on a number of issues when the referendum on divorce is held, I understand, later this year?  Is that still the Government's position?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a possibility; it is desirable, if possible, to hold a number of referenda on the same day from the point of view of saving time and resources.  I am not in a position at this stage to give an answer to the question of whether a number of other issues will be decided with the divorce issue because we have to advance the consideration of the legislation in question to a point where we can make a decision.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <P>&ldquo;(2)  This Act shall come into operation on such day or days as the Minister may appoint by order or orders either generally or with reference to any particular purpose or provision and different days may be so appointed for different purposes and different provisions.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the amendment is to enable the Minister to provide that the Act or parts thereof shall come into effect on a day or days specified by order. My disposition is to allow the various providers of credit, credit and mortgage intermediaries and the officer of the Director of Consumer Affairs a period in which to make the necessary preparations to comply with the provisions of the legislation.

      <P>I support the amendment. Will the Minister give an assurance that before the provisions of the Bill are implemented adequate resources will be made available to the office of the Director of Consumer Affairs?  Will the promise made by the previous Minister that four regional offices would be set up in conjunction with the implementation of this Bill be met?  Consumer credit law has been put forward as a <Col N="1199" /> charter of consumers' rights and in that context it is most important that from the outset consumers are in a position where they can fully vindicate their rights at no cost, by availing of the office of the Director of Consumer Affairs rather than going through the courts, thereby engaging in expensive litigation. That is an option that will become available to consumers when this Bill is enacted, but there is no point making that option available on paper if resources are not made available and the services of the office of the Director of Consumer Affairs made accessible to consumers who have grievances and want to vindicate their rights under the provisions of this legislation.  Will all these things happen at the same time and will we have a Bill that is fully enforceable?</P>

Everybody agreed that adequate resources should be made available for the Director of Consumer Affairs and particularly for the four regional offices as laid out in the previous Programme for Government.  Will the Minister say what progress is being made on the setting up of these offices and the staffing of them?  I understand he wishes to have the Bill speedily implemented and adequate resources should be made available to the Director of Consumer Affairs to ensure it is implemented in a transparent fashion.</P>
      <P>When we debated this Bill on Committee Stage Deputy Rabbitte insisted that great resources would be made available to the Director of Consumer Affairs and that he should report speedily to the Dáil.  Will the Minister give a detailed account of how the Director will implement the Bill, the resources that will be made available to him, the system of regional offices, the source of information to consumers and how the legislation will affect their daily lives?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies for agreeing to amendment No 1 as this is the most prudent way to implement the terms of the Bill.  I am conscious of the fact that the moneylenders licences expire on the last day of July and I hope there will be adequate time between finalising the Bill and allowing the various credit institutions and others to prepare for a date in and about that time.  It has been represented to me that it would be important prior to the issuing of new licences that the Director of Consumer Affairs would have an opportunity to examine the situation and make the decisions about new licences. It is a very long and detailed Bill and its passage through the other House may take some considerable time but I accept the views expressed in representations from the Irish Bankers Federation that some time ought to be given to enable them to tee up their systems to prepare for the coming into effect of this fairly complex and extensive legislation.</P>
      <P>Both Deputies opposite raised the question of resources.  I accept that when I was on the other side of the House I made those points and it is true that the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs must be resourced in a manner compatible with his new duties which are extensive and onerous in respect of some provisions of the Bill and arrangements for additional staffing and resources will have to be made.  I appreciate that both parties in Opposition are very concerned about public spending and the fiscal implications of any overrun, notwithstanding that I have taken time out since I became Minister to ensure that when we enact this Bill the Director will not in any way be hampered by a shortage of resources. Accordingly, I am making arrangements over the next two years that the staff of the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs will effectively double.  In addition I am conscious of arguments made directly by the Director about the suitability of staff and the particular expertise required if he is to discharge his duties efficiently and without delay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1201" /> It may be necessary to look at the particular needs of his office in terms of skills and expertise.  Over the period the staff complement will be increased to 60, which is effectively an increase of 30.</P>
    <P>Some later amendments have already been discussed on Committee Stage. For example, the fee levied on financial institutions seeking to increase their charges will make a contribution towards defraying the very extensive costs of the Director of Consumer Affairs in discharging his functions.  It is right and proper that the financial institutions ought to be asked to make a contribution towards these costs.  It is a very important dimension.  There are several other areas of public policy where institutions or private individuals are required to make a contribution rather than the Exchequer bearing the entire cost.  The modest charge of £25,000 for each application to bring in a new charge or increase an existing charge is eminently reasonable and will contribute to the costs I have spoken about.</P>

That is expensive but the Government is committed to putting it in place.  It goes some way towards filling the gap that exists in terms of a network of advice bureaux that can advise people of their rights as citizens generally. We are dealing with consumer rights and I can confirm that an office of the Director of Consumer Affairs will be opened this year in Cork and over the two year period it is my intention to ensure that resources will be provided so that offices will be opened in Limeick, Galway and Athlone.</P>

We agreed on Committee Stage that there is little point enacting very extensive legislation inspired by various European Union directives if it is not communicated to the people who are supposed to be the beneficiaries under the Act.  It is important that consumers should be aware of the new rights conferred on them and of the remedies and redress open to them.  We are all agreed that the present Director does an exceptionally good job and is very committed to the discharge of his functions.

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 9, to delete lines 62 to 65, and substitute the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;APR&rsquo; means the annual percentage rate of charge, being the toal cost of credit during the currency of the credit agreement and comprises total repayments of interest and charges, <Col N="1203" /> expressed as an annual percentage based on the number and frequency of repayment instalments and calculated in accordance with section (11);&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This is a definition of APR which featured in much discussion on Committee Stage.  APR means the annual percentage rate of charge being the total cost of credit during the currency of the credit agreement and comprises total repayments of interest and charges expressed as an annual percentage based on the number and frequency of repayment instalments and calculated in accordance with section 11.</P>
    <P>At the conclusion of Committee Stage, I indicated I would revert to this question.  The present formulation of words is intended to give clearer expression to this concept.  Although it is increasingly in common usage I doubt if the vast majority of consumers fully comprehend its meaning and effects. This definition is intended to give more precise expression to what the total cost of credit means as the present wording is somewhat loose and could leave the consumer confused.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's remarks.  This is a confusing area for many borrowers.  Bankers are in the business of making money, a banker usually talks about the wholesale rate and there are a number of options available to borrowers.  The wholesale rate is the rate at which bankers borrow and they retail the money out at the margin. On top of that there are two other systems, the Dublin inter bank rate and the inter bank rate.  I do not understand how they can add charges to the interest rate and roll up on APR because, in many cases, the charges are variable. The interest charge is most confusing for many borrowers.  The fixed rate plus the charges on APR is fairly simple but where there is a variable rate, by and large in rolling that over, the banks charge different rates of money on the borrowing.  That should be foolproof as <Col N="1204" /> interest rates are calculated on a daily basis and the formula used for charging creates confusion.  I am no expert in this field but I am aware of the differences that arise between different institutions in the rolling over which brings about the APR rate.</P>
      <P>Advertisements usually contain the APR rate but I do not understand how the rate can include charges because the bank cannot add the charge until they know the transaction involved.  Are all charges included in the APR rate and, if so, how does that happen?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Keeffe has quite properly identified this as a major issue.  Since he raised it last Thursday I have looked at it further and I agree with him.  It is fundamental to what we seek to do in the Bill.  He says he is no expert but my observations are that he knows a great deal more about it than most of us.  The previous Minister is on record as saying on Committee Stage that she did not understand it and most of us said we did not understand the mathematical calculation on page 82.  I am committed to looking at this when the Bill goes to the Seanad and at the point raised by Deputy O'Keeffe regarding charges and whether they should be included.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know what Deputy O'Keeffe would say if I asked him to ruminate on the following definition: &ldquo;APR is that effective rate of interest quoted as an annual rate which, when expressed as a decimal and used to discount repayments made by the borrower over the term of the loan, gives a total present value of such repayments equal to the amount of the loan advanced&rdquo;.  That has the merit of being brief and concise.  I do not want to go into the mathematical <Col N="1205" /> equation on page 82 and whether it is accurate or intelligible.  That is for another day.  It is necessary at this stage to give verbal expression to that mathematical formula.  That is what the Deputy seeks to achieve so that consumers who borrow from banks or building societies know that APR means the same thing and that there is a common and accurate definition of what it means.  As the Deputy said, products are advertised in the public press apparently at different interest rates but the APR could be the same, alternatively, you could have different APRs but when you look at the rate of frequency, discounting and so on, the situation is not as it seems.</P>
    <P>It ties into the area of misleading advertising.  In indicating to Deputy O'Keeffe that I am having this fundamental area of the Bill examined, if we agree on a single, uniform, consistent definition of APR I do not see any good reason advertisements should not be required to express what they are offering in terms of the true APR rate.  Consumers could make a real judgment between one offer and another.  At present it is immensely confusing.  If we carried out a <i>vox pop</i> in the street few people could say precisely what APR means.  In trying to work out something accurate it was suggested to me that the true rate of interest is the rate of discount expressed in annual percentage terms, in other words, the annualised percentage rate of APR which when applied to the total sum of repayments made on the loan over its lifetime including the repayment of principal but excluding any sums payable as a penalty, compensation or damages or, as Deputy O'Keeffe said, other charges unless required by regulation.  In the moneylending business collections are made at the door and, therefore, collection charges are an issue.  This equates the total amount of repayments made to the original value of the loan extended taking account of the amounts, timing and frequency of the debiting of instalments of amounts due for repayment <Col N="1206" /> and crediting of repayments made to the running account of the borrower.</P>
    <P>I am determined to ensure only one definition of formulation of APR is used throughout the Bill.  That may be expressed in long or short form as appropriate, but it is always the same definition.  The expression of the mathematical formula must be consistent with this formulation.  In other words, the formulation is no more than the mathematical formula expressed clearly in words.  That would mean that charges which can vary from one lending institution to another would have to be expressed separately.  The formula or formulation should concentrate on the financial APR.  In other words, charges and so on should not be included as they can vary from one lending institution to another.  In this regard and equally important, the APR should be the only rate a lending institution should be allowed to quote in publicity, advertisements, brochures and contract forms. No other rate should be allowed to be quoted or used thus enabling the consumer to compare like with like.  I will table an amendment to give expression to this critical change.  Furthermore, the APR used by lending agencies should be the only formulation contained in the Bill, no other formula or formulation should be allowed.  That approach would allow total transparency and enable consumers to make real comparisons.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1207" /> If my memory serves me right this matter was raised on Committee Stage by Deputy McDowell.  It is intended now to correct an inadvertent omission in the present and earlier text of the Bill.

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding the supply of services, I wish to raise an issue about which I am sure the Minister would share my concern and that of my colleagues on this side of the House.  I refer to additional hidden costs imposed for concert and theatre tickets.  I understand this subject has been dealt with in the media.  As the Minister is no doubt aware, a handling fee of approximately £2 is added to the cost of concert and theatre tickets when customers book their tickets by credit card or through a selling agent.  If a customer calls into HMV or another ticket outlet and it is necessary to telephone the theatre in question, an additional hidden cost of approximately £2 is added to the price of his or her ticket.  This additional charge is grossly unfair to the consumer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Booking tickets by telephone is in the interests of the efficient running of major events and is surely in the promoters' interests and in the interest of security.  At a time when there is concern about security surrounding concerts, theatre performances and so on, it is important that we should be conscious of security aspects.  It is incredible that patrons are singled out for exploitation in such an opportunist way.  I am sure the Minister will agree it is unacceptable that this practice is taking place at a time when the artistic life of the country, especially this city, is flourishing.  I appreciate that I may have sprung this matter on the Minister, but it is one of which I am conscious not only because I am a theatre-goer.  Young people are being exploited by this hidden cost and the cost of tickets for many performances are exorbitant.  When considering the Bill at this Stage, will the Minister <Col N="1208" /> take some account of this exploitation of patrons of artistic events?</P>

      <P>Out of courtesy to Deputy Kitt, I will reply to the matter he raised.  This phenomenon was referred to in the media, but it has not intruded into the discussions on the Bill until now.

      <P>It may indeed be and the Director of Consumer Affairs may have a role in that regard.  I will be happy to ask him to consider it.  I do not believe this matter is within the scope of the legislation.  The handling fee to which the Deputy referred may well be an agreement between the promoter and, say, a credit card company.  It requires some study to ascertain if that is where the agreement exists, in which case it would not be within the remit of this Bill or be a credit agreement in the terms defined in it.  I am glad to reassure the House that when Deputy Kitt and I attended the &ldquo;Dermot Morgan Show&rdquo; in the Olympia last week we were not fleeced in this manner and no extra handling fee was imposed and we both enjoyed the night immensely.</P>

If people purchase their tickets at the Olympia or any other theatre they pay the set price, but if they book their tickets by telephone and collect them on the night of the performance, which makes matters more convenient for the promoters, they must pay an additional charge.  I thank the Minister for responding to this matter.

      <P>As Deputy O'Rourke <Col N="1213" /> knows, this amendment concerns the accurate definition of &ldquo;credit intermediary&rdquo;. If one does not insert the words &ldquo;or a mortgage lender,&rdquo; Irish Life Home Loans, for example, would not be encompassed by the definition.  It does not take deposits but it advances loans. It is ingrained in my memory of the 1992-93 currency disturbance when it was in that unique position of not taking deposits but of advancing loans, that people who happened to have their mortgages with Irish Life Home Loans were especially penalised during that difficult period.  The purpose of the amendment is to make it as watertight as possible from the point of view of the Minister for the Environment.</P>

      <P>I take it that a &ldquo;credit intermediary&rdquo; is a person who provides a facility for credit on the purchase of goods and that a service or credit charge is imposed after a certain date.  For example, if I buy goods from a merchant and do not pay within 30 days a charge of, perhaps, 2.5 per cent may be added per month.  I do not see anything about mortgages or other forms of lending in the Bill.  A business person who imposes a charge when payment is not made within a prescribed period is entitled to protection.  All businesses today, due to tight margins and lower profits, avail of a credit charge. The consumer is more open to exploitation by banking institutions because everyone seeks more time to pay their bills.  These charges in many cases can amount to 18 per cent to 24 per cent per annum.  This is another type of moneylending which has existed for some years and is becoming more prevalent. That would be my definition of a credit intermediary.  Will the Minister say why he proposes to delete the two lines from the definition?  What is the official definition of &ldquo;credit intermediary&rdquo;?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>The definition is set out in the amendment.  If Deputy O'Keeffe can suggest improvements on it I am willing to hear them.  Deputy O'Keeffe may be under a misapprehension.  A <Col N="1214" /> credit intermediary is a person who arranges credit.  It does not have anything to do with default, penalty fees and so on.  It is a person who sets himself or herself up as one who can arrange credit.  The latest version of this, as a result of the discussion on Committee Stage, is that a credit intermediary means a person other than a credit institution or a mortgage lender &mdash; not the bank or the building society &mdash; who in the course of his business arranges or offers to arrange for a consumer the provision of credit or the letting of goods in return for a commission payment or consideration of any kind from the provider of the credit or the owner as the case may be.  I would be reasonably satisfied that that definition will stand the test of time.  It ensures there are no loopholes such as those I have instanced in the case of Irish Life Home Loans.  I am not implying in any way that Irish Life Home Loans would want to escape the terms of the Bill.  It is the best formulation we have.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1215" /> In page 12, between lines 5 and 6 to insert the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(b) the loan is made for the purpose of refinancing a loan within the meaning of paragraph (a). or&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment was also proposed to me by the Minister for the Environment. It stipulates that refinancing loans, secured on the principal residence of the borrower or his dependants, will be regarded as housing loans in the context of the Bill.  The definition of &ldquo;housing loan&rdquo;, which I am proposing should be substituted for the present one in the Bill, differs in two respects from the existing version.  First, there is a new paragraph (b) which reads: &ldquo;the loan is made for the purpose of refinancing a loan within the meaning of paragraph (a) ...&rdquo; This amendment is designed to ensure that where a borrower refinances his existing housing loan either with his or her existing lender or with another lender, the new loan is still regarded as a housing loan. It would not make sense that a housing loan cease to be classified as a housing loan simply because the borrower had renegotiated his or her loan with their existing mortgage lender or had switched lenders.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 12 which seeks to insert the words &ldquo;or to continue to be used&rdquo; after the word &ldquo;used&rdquo; in paragraph (b) of the existing definition in the Bill and which would now become paragraph (c) of the definition to be substituted, clarifies the intent of the existing text by making it clear that it is not necessary to commence the use of the house as a principal residence for the first time after the loan has been advanced for the loan to be classified as a housing loan.  For example, it will often happen that a person will raise a new mortgage on his or her principal residence to pay for education expenses. This has been brought to our attention by the Minister for the Environment but it is eminently sensible because we all <Col N="1216" /> know that this type of refinancing package is frequently resorted to by consumers. As I understand it, it applies only to the principal residence.</P>

      <P>The amendment is designed to ensure that where a borrower refinances his existing loan, either with his existing lender or another lender, the new loan is still regarded as a housing loan.  This will have implications outside the scope of this Bill in terms of the tax laws, etc.  It would not make sense for a housing loan to cease to be classified as a housing loan simply because the borrower had renegotiated his loan with his existing &mdash; or another <Col N="1217" />&mdash; mortgage lender.  The person may have good reason to renegotiate his loan having regard to the packages on offer etc.  It is prudent that people who reach that stage should look at the packages on offer as another building society or credit institution may offer a better refinancing package from the point of view of the consumer.  It would be manifestly unfair not to allow people to do this.</P>

      <P>I have grave reservations about refinancing.  Some people who have repaid a substantial amount of their mortgages refinance their loans to avail of the tax reliefs available for educational purposes, etc.  Many financial institutions offer seemingly attractive refinancing packages which claim to clear all the person's debts and pay off their original loan and outstanding bills, that with one payment they will pay less. However, I know two gullible families who took out a refinancing loan in the belief that all their bills would be paid and that they would have less to pay but who now find they have to pay more. When I examined the terms of the credit agreement I found that they had been done, had not been given the loan at a decent rate and were now much deeper in debt.  I wish to issue a warning about the refinancing of mortgages. While many financial institutions offer genuine packages, some rogue operators trap gullible people who do not know much about finance, thus putting them in debt for many years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the points made by Deputy O'Rourke.  We cannot legislate to stop people from taking out refinancing loans, as under the Constitution, they are entitled to take out loans with the financial institution of their choice.  It has been said that people <Col N="1218" /> remortgage their houses for educational purposes, which does not meet the criteria under the Act.  People usually remortgage their houses because the value has increased and the extra money can be used for other purposes.</P>
      <P>It must be pointed out that there are substantial costs involved in moving from one mortgage house to another for the purposes of refinancing.  For example, the title, insurance and many other details must be dealt with again. Similar problems arise in respect of APR as in respect of clearing bank institutions. In many cases, the loan originally agreed in respect of refinancing is not the final package because of the large number of deductions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Whatever one may say about the phenomenon of refinancing, it takes place extensively and for a variety of reasons.  The proposal in my amendment merely tightens the Bill to ensure the definition of &ldquo;housing loan&rdquo; still obtains.  What Deputy O'Rourke said merely points to the urgency of the Bill. The discussion on the APR terms, the different presentation of these products and the discussion which will follow the fact that the consumer may not readily understand the concept &ldquo;APR&rdquo; and misleading advertising in respect of these products, underlines the necessity to regulate credit and mortgage intermediaries. Deputy O'Keeffe may be correct in regard to educational expenses.  It was not intended as a glib remark but, if I may now make one, it will not be necessary under the new Government because we have provided for that.</P>

I accept this is not taxation legislation, but the fact that a mortgage resulting from refinancing is included under the definition of a housing loan <Col N="1219" /> does not necessarily mean it would qualify for the reliefs available under the taxation code, other rules would apply. Why did the Minister refer to taxation? Is there something in the Bill about which I am not aware?</P>

      <P>There is not, I was responding to Deputy O'Rourke's point about whether it applied to the principal residence only.  If that were the case obviously it could have financial implications because if one can demonstrate to the Revenue that the purpose of the refinancing loan is specifically to improve one's principal residence, that can be compounded in terms of mortgage interest relief, but in this case, as the Deputy correctly pointed out, that would not necessarily follow.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Line 34 refers to one of the categories of exclusion under the definition of a moneylender.  A moneylender is defined as a person who carries on the business of moneylending or who advertises, announces, or holds himself out in any way as carrying on that business, with the exception of a number of categories <Col N="1221" /> which are listed in that section, for example, a pawnbroker, a society registered under the Industrial and Provident Societies Acts, etc., and a credit institution.  The effect of this amendment will be to delete &ldquo;mortgage intermediary&rdquo; from the list of excluded persons who would not be regarded as moneylenders for the purpose of the legislation.  The potential for abuse associated with the inclusion of mortgage intermediaries in the list of excluded persons was brought into sharp focus on Committee Stage.  We were all agreed that it was relatively easy to circumvent the definition of a moneylender as it stood by, for example, making a mortgage loan to one's aunt.  This amendment is necessary to close that loophole.</P>

      <P>I note that the Minister has had extensive discussions with his colleague, the Minister for the Environment.  Perhaps I should say that the officials on both sides have been very busy and the heavier hand of the Department of the Environment is obvious in the Bill.  When I was dealing with this Bill the Department of the Environment was very anxious about particular sections of the housing loans. It now clearly has a much stronger input, but I have no objection to that.</P>

      <P>I do not see it that way. The involvement of the Department of the Environment in regard to its business is entirely justified, and the definition is the better as a result.  On Deputy O'Rourke's general allegation that the Department of the Environment is stronger in its presence now than when she was in my position, the opposite is the case and we will come to an amendment which, for the first time in the history of the Bill's progress, brings local authority loans within its remit.</P>

Contrary to what she says, this shows a greater willingness on the part of the Department of the Environment during the term of this Government to acknowledge that if it is logical to include something in a consumer Bill that it will not be arrogated to the Department of the Environment purely for jurisdictional purposes.</P>

      <P>It seems superfluous to introduce the Minister for the Environment into this Bill, especially when one considers that all that is being proposed is that this Minister shall consult with the Minister for the Environment but does not have to take heed of what the Minister for the Environment says. The Minister's explanation so far does not make clear why this is necessary.  If we are to have tidy legislation it is difficult to justify the introduction of this requirement.  On the making of a housing loan, surely the Minister's advisers are capable of making a determination. This seems to be tipping the hat in the direction of the Minister for the Environment. Perhaps the Minister can give strong justification for this proposal, but so far he has not stated any specific reason for including this consultation process.  If it is not necessary it should not be in the Bill.</P>

      <P>This section deals with interpretation.  If by redefining &ldquo;mortgage lender&rdquo; one improves clarity, that is desirable.  If there is anything in the clarification which Deputies find undesirable, that is a different matter, and they can oppose it.  The original wording of the definition was too narrow. The Minister of State is now extending it to cover institutions as well as &ldquo;any other person&rdquo;.  Reference is also made to the local authorities, in the form of the Department of the Environment. It is desirable that we give recognition to local authorities which are now becoming more involved in housing loans.  I am satisfied that this amendment is required to extend the definition to the credit institutions and the persons involved in them.</P>

It is right that the Minister of State should include paragraph (b) which reads &ldquo;Any other person of a class prescribed after consultation with the Minister for the Environment, for the purposes of the Act&rdquo; because of the Department's involvement in this area.  The amendment is worthy of support.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised that Deputy Molloy, who is a former Minister for Local Government, finds it difficult to understand why there is a need for co-operation between my Department and the Department of the Environment which is responsible for housing <Col N="1225" /> policy, on a matter relating to definitions. This is only prudent.  It would be a sorry state of affairs if we legislated and provided definitions under the heading of &ldquo;consumer affairs&rdquo; which posed difficulties and obstacles subsequently for the Department responsible for housing policy.  The Bill includes several references to the Minister for the Environment.</P>
      <P>Deputies followed what was essentially a mischievous point by Deputy O'Rourke.  If her original definition was included the banks would not be classed as mortgage lenders.  I respectfully suggest that that would be ludicrous.  Having quickly passed over some important sections I am disappointed Deputies started to hare after what was essentially a mischievous point.  It would be preposterous to leave open the possibility that the banks would not be classed as mortgage lenders.</P>
      <P>The points made by Deputies Costello and Byrne are correct.  The role of the Department of the Environment in this area is changing.  It is reasonable that the amendment should require me in making regulations to consult the Minister for the Environment.  Deputy O'Rourke referred to the shared ownership scheme but there are several other areas where it is important that close contact be maintained between the officials of my Department and those of the Department of the Environment to ensure that policy on this matter is aligned.</P>
      <P>The original definition of &ldquo;mortgage lender&rdquo; would have left open the possibility of abuse in that anyone could have set himself up as a mortgage lender. Trends in the market place may change. As a result of the inclusion in the definition of paragraph (b) which reads &ldquo;Any other person of a class prescribed after consultation with the Minister for the Environment, for the purposes of the Act&rdquo; I fail to see how anyone could escape.  We will now have the capacity to follow people up by way of regulations in full consultation with the Department of the Environment.  This proposal makes good sense.</P>

    <P>This amendment derives from the earlier debate on the fact that &ldquo;hire purchase agreement&rdquo; was removed from the definition of &ldquo;credit agreement&rdquo;.

This amendment would excise the term &ldquo;credit&rdquo; and was suggested by the Office of the Attorney General.  The need for the amendment arises because of the earlier deletion of &ldquo;hire purchase agreement&rdquo;<Col N="1231" /> from the definition of &ldquo;credit agreement&rdquo;.

      <P>Deputy McDowell put forward a different amendment on Committee Stage to deal with this issue, but other Deputies were of the view that it would be very dangerous to legislate for no go areas, which is what we would be doing if we accepted his amendment.

      <P>I was glad to accept the amendment put forward by Deputy Richard Bruton on Committee Stage. Section 3 states: &ldquo;It shall be an offence to discriminate on grounds of sex, sexual orientation, belief, social status or <Col N="1232" /> area of residence in the offering, negotiating or granting of a credit agreement&rdquo;. We had a lively debate on this issue on Committee Stage.  We are all aware of people who seek loans from credit institutions but on the basis of the address at which they reside they are discriminated against.  To prove discrimination on the grounds of sex or religious belief is straightforward, but how would one prove that a person is refused a loan because they come from terrace A in a particular town?  The person will be told the loan is refused because they do not have the necessary financial clout to repay it, but in reality they are discriminated against because they come from a particular address. The same applies particularly to young people looking for jobs &mdash; if they come from a particular area they are discriminated against.  I accept the amendment but I would like the Minister to say how it will be monitored so that people are not discriminated against in the granting of a loan because of their address.</P>

    <P>Section 3 which is being transferred to Part X is of vital importance.  In urban Ireland &mdash; I am sure the same applies in rural Ireland &mdash; there is a segregated and tiered society.  In my early days in political life I was horrified to learn that very well known electrical companies in a large shopping centre about 500 yards from an inner city local authority flats complex refused credit terms and hire purchase agreements to the tenants of the flats complex.  At the time I pursued a company on behalf of a constituent who was discriminated <Col N="1233" /> against solely and exclusively because of his address.  The man had permanent and secure employment in CIE and was earning an extremely good salary, but because he lived in an inner city flats complex he was discriminated against.</P>
    <P>If the Progressive Democrats had its way many families on limited income and dependent on social welfare who would require hire purchase facilities&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I support these amendments and this is an opportune time to reflect on what exactly we are doing. Section 3 states: &ldquo;It shall be an offence to discriminate on grounds of sex, sexual orientation, belief, social status or area of residence in the offering, negotiating or granting of a credit agreement&rdquo;. It is important to reflect on the Bill arising from debates that took place on Committee Stage.  This is a consumer protection Bill, introduced with the specific aim of protecting the rights of consumers regardless of whether they live in upmarket or poor housing estates.  Consumers should not be discriminated against in seeking credit, as is the practice in many companies.  I agree with the amendments and remind the House of the Progressive Democrats position as put forward on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I concur with the remarks of Deputies O'Rourke and Byrne.  This is an important issue that must be addressed in legislation such as this.  I would like clarification of the term &ldquo;social status&rdquo;.  Does it mean one's <Col N="1234" /> standing in society?  There is no doubt there is discrimination against people from disadvantaged areas and people of a particular background such as travellers who are regarded as having a low credit rating.  Does the term apply to marital status as distinct from social status?  Perhaps there is need to insert a section to cover the marital relationship. That is an area in which there has been great discrimination in the granting of credit.  To my mind the financial institutions discriminate on the basis of marital status and the broader social status when deciding to grant a loan.  To ensure that a person's marital status is not a discriminatory factor we might consider making provision for it as a separate category.</P>
      <P>The word &ldquo;credit agreement&rdquo; is in this.  I have not yet seen the amendment that is intended for Part X but I presume the word &ldquo;agreement&rdquo; will be deleted because we have already deleted it in various amendments.</P>
      <P>There is a broad discrimination based on one's address.  As somebody who lives in the inner city I know how difficult things are for somebody with an inner city address, whether on the north or the south side.  Depending on the particular street a mythology about it has been built up that remains in public consciousness. A person applying for a job from a certain address or residence is automatically at a disadvantage.  If there is a surplus in the labour market, the last person to be employed will be someone who comes from a certain area.  It is one thing to make provision to counteract this in legislation but it is difficult to address.  The only way that a person in such an area can address it is by giving a false address.  However, if he is found out he is automatically disqualfied. Will the Minister elaborate a little further on how we can implement the legislation with the rigour that would be required?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On a broader aspect, businesses operate in areas that may not have top rating. I am well aware that insurance companies will not give a quote to an <Col N="1235" /> applicant from a certain area.  Insurance companies have in all instances to provide a motor insurance quotation but in the commercial world, for example, it is impossible for the proprietor of a small business such as a shop, a pub, a restaurant or other small operation in certain urban areas to get a quotation and on the odd occasion they get one the figure is astronomical.  There is no policing of how insurance companies deal with the insurance needs of businesses at certain addresses.  We have a major problem of discrimination on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that everybody in this House is committed to eliminating discrimination but it is extremely difficult to find the exact mechanism that will provide the protection and ensure that companies do not discriminate against the person on the basis of their address, social status, sex, sexual orientation or beliefs or others as mentioned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. B. O'Keeffe Mr. B. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>How does one monitor the provisions of the Bill?  For example, if Deputy O'Rourke and I go to the same financial institution to seek a loan and I am granted a loan and she is not, have I been given the loan because I am a man?  How can one claim that she was discriminated against?  If we compare notes what explanation can I give and if she brings the matter to the attention of the Director of Consumer Affairs how will he find out why one of us was refused the loan and the other was not?</P>
      <P>When a financial institution refuses credit one is not supplied with the information why the loan was refused.  The financial correspondents who write the business sections in newspapers believe that people should be informed of the grounds for refusal.  It can have quite an effect on a person in business or even the private borrower to be refused a loan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have referred to the status of residential areas.  Let us take the example of an area that is rumoured to be associated with drugs, it may be a fairly <Col N="1236" /> reasonable residential area but because it is identified with drugs &mdash; which are rampant in our society &mdash; the financial institutions will shy away.</P>
    <P>Family history will be taken into account.  I disagree totally with the credit bureau which records all transactions and knows a person's repayment capacity.  I understand the clearing banks are not registered under this area but it is quite likely it will happen.  With modern technology one can press a button and have his or her credit rating quickly.  One's rating may change from time to time.  While we welcome this section we wonder how it will be monitored. If a constituent who feels he has been treated unfairly comes to me how do I find out if he was discriminated against on the basis of where he lives, his beliefs or something else?  The Minister would want to clarify the monitoring procedures that will be in place.</P>
    <P>We have appointed a bank Ombudsman but the procedure has not been satisfactory.  I wonder if the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs and the banks Ombudsman's office will co-operate because they could help people. People are always disillusioned when they are refused a loan or a credit facility and they feel it is unfair.  They may develop an inferiority complex because they do not know why they have been refused.  Perhaps the Minister will clarify the matter.</P>

      <P>This is an excellent section to insert in any Bill.  It has been the practice for a number of years for a percentage of the mortgate repayments on local authority mortgages to go towards a mortgage protection policy.  I have one and it is an excellent policy. Unfortunately it is negotiated centrally though, for administrative purposes and from the point of view of getting the best deal, perhaps that is the way it should be done.  Since 1987 this practice has been compulsory for those taking out a local authority mortgage, which is as it should be as all mortgages should be protected.</P>

      <P>It is compulsory for those who have a mortgage from a local authority to have a mortgage protection policy.  Everyone should have such a policy.  The policy excludes people infected with HIV and explains that they contributed to their own disease. However, it does not exclude people, for example, with a heart condition or those suffering from cancer on the basis that they contributed to their own condition.</P>
      <P>I regard it as a direct reference to someone's sexual orientation.  For the majority of those infected, their sexual orientation had nothing to do with it as it was caused by circumstances beyond their control.  I hope this section of the Bill will cover the matter and that people do not find their mortgage protection policy is null and void on the basis of what is presumed to be their sexual orientation.  As it applies to all local authorities it shows our attitude towards sexuality as opposed to health, mortgage protection or lending institutions. Will the section make it illegal for this element to be included in a mortgage protection policy?</P>

      <P>Section 3 states that it shall not be an offence to discriminate on certain grounds.  Deputy Costello referred to marital status.  I am aware of a practice in a certain large retail store <Col N="1240" /> which has branches nationwide, including my own town, which refuses participation in its credit arrangements to the lady of the house or housewife and only extends credit where the husband is the person to whom the credit facility is extended.  In the case I am aware of, it caused much anger and resentment to the women who were refused.  Will the Minister assure me that the terms of the section as outlined will exclude that type of discrimination on marital grounds? Credit facilities were refused on the grounds that they could not be extended to the wife.  In the case of which I am aware the husband and wife had a joint bank account and there was an equal risk irrespective of which of them signed the agreement.  Will the Minister assure me that there is no need to write in the words &ldquo;marital status&rdquo; and that it is covered by the section as outlined?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think I can give that assurance as the section stands. Deputy Costello raised a valid point. The section is a necessary and good one. It was as easy to insert &ldquo;it shall be an offence to discriminate on grounds of sex, sexual orientation, belief, marital or social status&rdquo; as &ldquo;on grounds of sex, sexual orientation, belief or social status etc.&rdquo;  If it is permissible for Deputy Costello to move such an amendment I am amenable to accepting it.  Alternatively, I assure the House that I will bring it forward in the Seanad.</P>
      <P>Deputy Molloy has given a practical example of the type of circumstances in which the point raised by Deputy Costello could matter.  As we have sought to insert a section in the Bill that seeks to prevent discrimination &mdash; I would not put it further than that, although Deputy O'Keeffe asked some hard questions which I will deal with later &mdash; the section should be comprehensive.

I will proceed with what Deputy Molloy seeks to have done at that stage.  Since we are deleting this section, it would not make much sense to deal with the matter here. Therefore we will include the words in amendment No. 100.</P>

      <P>On the substantive debate, Deputy O'Keeffe put hard questions about how the matter would be monitored and how it could be established whether somebody was being discriminated against and on what grounds.  The Deputy instanced the grounds of sex and the male being successful in securing a loan and the female being unsuccessful.  It is directly analogous to the employment area in terms of the corpus of labour law where a woman is passed over for promotion.</P>

      <P>She must establish under equality and discrimination legislation that the facts of the case support the charge.  The position in this case is the same.  It is important that a section is included which expressly seeks to outlaw this type of discrimination.  We were all agreed on Committee Stage, even though it was not included in the original Bill, that it was wise it should be expressly stated in the Bill.  I do not want to be misinterpreted on this, but if our consideration of the Bill is restricted to the moneylending section, there can be justifiable fears that somebody is being discriminated against because of social status or on other grounds.  That would be the final irony having regard to the fact that the people who keep the legal moneylending industry in business are those caught in a social category who by definition cannot gain access to credit from conventional financial institutions.</P>

      <P>Very frequently they are women trying to maintain households, sometimes with little support from their male partners.  In that sense they are the people who have the greatest resort under the Bill.  If they seek credit from a conventional financial institution for a special occasion, such as a first Holy Communion, or Confirmation, they are likely to be refused, hence there is an alternative moneylending industry in existence.  Therefore, this section is necessary and the fact that it is an offence to discriminate on the grounds specified means that a case will either lie in the courts or the Director of Consumer Affairs will act to deal with it.</P>

      <P>I met the President of the European Commission, Mr. Jacques Santer, on Thursday, 30 March 1995.  I was accompanied at the meeting by the Minister of State for European Affairs. Deputy Gay Mitchell.</P>
      <P>I had a wide-range discussion with President Santer.  The main items of discussion were the current agenda of the European Union with particular reference to the June European Council in Cannes, the 1996 Intergovernmental Conference, the Irish Presidency of the European Union in 1996 and of course Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>I took the opportunity to stress to President Santer items which will be of concern to Ireland in the context of the 1996 Intergovernmental Conference.  I especially underlined the importance which Ireland attached to the role of the Commission in European institutions and our desire that this role should not be diminished but, if possible, enhanced as a result of the Intergovernmental Conference.  In this regard I also stressed that Ireland would not in any circumstances surrender its right to appoint a member of the Commission. In addition I expressed my concern that ways be found to reinforce the democratic mandate of the Commission.</P>
      <P>Overall I had a most useful exchange of views with President Santer.  I look forward to receiving him in Dublin on 11 April for further discussions.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I discussed it with a representative of the Commission.  It was discussed over that two-day visit. Ireland is not the only country which has come under notice because of irregularities, which I deplore and which took place here in 1990 and 1991. Obviously, those who were responsible, including those politically responsible, have a lot to answer for.  Its consequences are potentially serious but I can assure the House the Government is doing everything it can to minimise the level of fine to be imposed and is using all influence available to it to so ensure.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is referring to the well known Schengen agreement area which is of concern to us because it means we are in a different position to other European countries.  If we were entirely free agents in this matter I have no doubt we would be part of the Schengen area.  We did not want to create circumstances in which there would be the possibility of people having to produce passports to travel from say, Dundalk to Newry, a possible consequence of Britain remaining out had we gone in.  Here I must emphasise the word &ldquo;possibly&rdquo;.  This is a matter we must keep under review.  It is desirable that Ireland be part of a passport-free area within Europe.  One of the ways in which Europe was and is sold to its people is on the grounds of free movement within the Continent &mdash; that is the concept of a people's Europe.  It is regrettable that, because of the decision of another member state, with which unfortunately, or fortunately, we have a land boundary, and through which we share a lot of contacts cross-Channel, we were not in the position to be among the early members of the Schengen area.  I hope that policy will change and that soon we will be able to be part of the passport-free area.</P>

      <P>Your restrictions are very judicious in this matter, a Cheann Comhairle, since I could be drawn into commenting on everything reported in yesterday's newspapers if this precedent were to be allowed.  If the Deputy has concern about that I suggest that he either take it up with some members of the European Parliament of his party who will be able to raise it in the appropriate place.  It is not an appropriate matter for discussion here.  I would not care to make any comment without notice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Since it has been reported that the Taoiseach correctly raised the issue of co-ordination of efforts to combat drugs and the trafficking in them, did he consider President Santer was supportive of that endeavour? I am aware from meetings of ECOFIN Ministers that for a long time they have been endeavouring to devise methods of progressing on this issue. What was the conclusion of the Taoiseach's discussion, or are such discussions continuing?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very important matter, ours being a country with an extensive coastline, an area within which there is the possibility of drugs being imported for onward shipping to other parts of Europe.  It is my view that there should be a co-ordinated European approach, not merely in the matter of detection and sharing of information, but also in the guarding of our coasts.  It is an issue that should be looked at in the context of the intergovernmental conference where the powers of the Union come up for discussion again.  It would be useful for us to discuss this matter publicly as well because it is an issue of considerable public importance.  One of the difficulties is that it is felt that Europe frequently is seen as remote from the daily concerns of people.  Obviously, if <Col N="1249" /> Europe can be seen to take effective action on drugs on an agreed basis that will help create a greater identity between the citizens of Europe and the European institutions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Belgian Government supported Ireland's request for aid.  It comes down to the cost of trying to protect and defend our coastline against drug smugglers and the huge lucrative market for them.  Has progress been made on that issue?  Does President Santer agree it is a European issue which requires funding?  Certainly the issue received substantial support from three or four countries in the past.</P>

      <P>I do not want to mislead the Deputy.  This is a matter I raised generally and publicly and about which I am concerned but I did not raise this specific question in my meeting with President Santer.  I cannot give the Deputy an answer to a matter I did not raise with him specifically at that meeting. It is a matter the Government intends to pursue.  I would welcome parliamentary questions from the Deputy either to me, the Minister for Justice or an appropriate Minister about this matter because it is an issue we should follow up.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Given that the question of economic and monetary union will be high on the agenda when Ireland holds the Presidency during the second half of 1996, did the Taoiseach avail of the opportunity to raise this matter in his discussions with the President of the Commission?  Furthermore, did he discuss the possibility of the President of the Commission initiating some international action which might benefit Ireland which has problems when speculators attack our currency?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of economic and monetary union was discussed in general terms.  There was not any specific discussion about what can be done to limit speculation in currencies. <Col N="1250" /> The Deputy will recognise that one of the realities of removing exchange controls &mdash; a decision taken by a Government which I believe he supported at the time &mdash; is that money can move freely across the exchanges.  One of the concepts that underlies the European Union is the free movement of currencies. Once there is free movement of currencies the almost inevitable next step is a move to a single currency. Europe has agreed to free movement of money across the exchanges but it has not yet taken the next logical step which is a single currency.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>While I agree with much of what the Taoiseach has said about exchange control would the Taoiseach in his discussion with the President of the Commission consider it appropriate, as do other countries that the President of the Commission would initiate some international action with other countries throughout the world? As I and the Taoiseach know it is not possible even for members of the Community to guard against speculation as this is truly a global issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure Deputy McCreevy is aware that the Prime Minister of Norway suggested in regard to this matter at the World Poverty Conference, some form of transactions tax. I have doubts about that proposal, but it is one that could be looked at.  In deference to Deputies raising the matter I give an assurance that I will raise this issue with President Santer on 11 April when he comes to Dublin.  When the traditional question is tabled by the Deputy's leader after that meeting I will be able to let him know the position.</P>

      <P>The Schengen agreement points out the reality for Ireland in dealing with practical matters.  In regard to monetary union, it points out the reality of our relationship with the United Kingdom.  In the context of discussions <Col N="1251" /> with President Santer or directly with the British Prime Minister has the Taoiseach any plans to point out the realities of co-operation for this country with regard to our full participation within the European Union, for example, that matters to which the United Kingdom are not committed have an effect on our ability to be practical participants in the EU?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I discussed this matter at considerable length with the President and it would be fair to say the lead-in to the Intergovernmental Conference it was probably the principal item on our agenda.  I would make the point that the Reflection Group is just a reflection group.  It will not make decisions but obviously there will be plenty of opportunities for the Dáil to <Col N="1252" /> be kept up to date about ongoing preparations for the Intergovernmental Conference. We will avail of those to give the House the latest information at all times.  Indeed, we would welcome suggestions from other parties in this House as to how the treaties can be improved.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 and 3 together.  The Tánaiste and I had a routine meeting on 28 March with a Sinn Féin delegation headed by the party leader.</P>
      <P>We reviewed a number of important issues relating to the peace process, and exchanged views on how best to advance matters to the next stage.  Thus, the early commencement of talks involving the British Government and Sinn Féin featured prominently in our discussions.  I believe both sides are sincere in their efforts to agree a basis for such talks.  The Government has been endeavouring to assist those efforts and I hope talks will commence soon.</P>
      <P>With regard to so-called punishment beatings, the Government abhors and unreservedly condemns such acts.  Sinn Féin and indeed the loyalist representatives are well aware of our strong views and both should use whatever influence they have to put an end to attacks of this kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Every week we go through the same procedure.  Last week the Taoiseach was close to believing that the commencement of talks was just a day or two away but that does not seem to be the case this week.  From <Col N="1253" /> where we sit, it seems that for four weeks in a row there was very little between the sides.  First it was a case of the decommissioning of arms which Sinn Féin wanted to bring into the broader picture of demilitarisation but that was not acceptable.  Now, it is ordering an agenda that will allow Sinn Féin to include other issues, along with decommissioning which will be the central issue on the agenda.  The Americans, John Major and the Taoiseach say that.  We always agreed that it should be item No. 1 on the agenda.  Is there any way this House can stop what seems to amount to playing around with a dangerous game?  Yesterday's incident concerning the successful work of the Garda shows that danger is not far away.  Instead of repeating what has been said during the past four weeks, will the Taoiseach say if anything can be done to move the process forward so that a meeting can be held?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that there are intensive contacts between Sinn Féin and the British Government with a view to resolving the remaining obstacle to the commencement of full ministerial talks.  I am very anxious that those talks take place as soon as possible and both parties know that we will provide whatever help we can in resolving the remaining difficulties.  I would not like the House to form the opinion that time is being lost at present.  While the discussions about the ordering of the agenda, the words to be used, etc., may seem semantical to some, they carry with them real fears and concerns.  Time spent now in allaying those fears and concerns and on getting the agenda right may well prove to be time saved later on when the talks begin at ministerial level.  I wish to pay tribute to both sides on their serious and intensive efforts to resolve the remaining difficulties. From time to time accusations of bad faith have been made but, having spoken directly to the principals on both sides, I believe a sincere effort is being <Col N="1254" /> made to resolve the remaining difficulties. The House can be assured that this is the case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I join Deputy Ahern in complimenting the Garda on intercepting those arms yesterday.  I hope the Government will continue to make every effort to ensure that arms in this jurisdiction are either decommissioned or taken out of circulation.</P>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach state if the Leader of Sinn Féin believes that punishment beatings are wrong?  Does the Taoiseach believe that neither side is placing unsurmountable obstacles in the way of these talks?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Neither side is placing obstacles in the way of these talks merely for the sake of it.  There are genuine concerns on both sides and these lie behind the apparently semantic and arcane arguments about the agenda and the wording to be used to denominate certain items on it.</P>
      <P>On the question of punishment beatings, I have made it abundantly clear both publicly and to Sinn Féin that these are wrong in all circumstances and represent an incursion on human rights of an appalling kind.  It would not be appropriate for me to speak for anybody else on this subject but it is my view that Mr. Adams also believes that punishment beatings are wrong.  I intend to use all the means available to me publicly to continue to put moral pressure on those who may be involved in punishment beatings or those protecting them to put an end to the beatings and the protection of those involved from the full rigours of the law.  People who engage in this sort of activity should be brought before the courts and dealt with in the appropriate way, nobody should protect them from the rigours of the law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many other problems in this area need to be sorted out and while my condemnation of punishment beatings is unreserved this is not to be taken as a statement that there are no other areas where improvements can be made.  For <Col N="1255" /> example, there is room for movement in such areas as policing in Nationalist and some loyalist areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>

Will he also agree that it would be sensible at this stage to place that issue with an independent third party country or international agency such as the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe which would consider it in detail so that the important political aspects of concern to both Governments and all the political parties in the North can immediately be discussed and a settlement reached?</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;which would only require outside advice.  There is a very clear political dimension to this matter both in terms of the requirement to get the organisations associated with those who hold the arms to make a clear political statement that they want those arms put out of commission and that as long as they remain in commission there is political suspicion and it is difficult to get certain people to sit down with them.  This is a political question and we hope to achieve a serious political engagement on the issue of decommissioning by all those concerned.  We have gone a long way towards achieving that.  While important difficulties remain these are not unsurmountable.  Even as we speak serious and sincere ongoing efforts are being made to overcome these difficulties.  There is no logjam; rather there is a process of teasing out certain difficult issues which could lead to serious misunderstandings if they are not teased out before the talks begin.</P>

      <P>In Washington on 28 February the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs said that taking the attitude that nothing will happen unless arms are decommissioned or surrendered is a formula for disaster. Obviously he believes there has to be a more comprehensive agenda.  The process of trying to get both sides to agree the agenda and ensuring that everything is in order would be the correct one if the parties involved held all the cards.  I do not want to pursue this issue further but clearly the negotiators do not hold all the cards.</P>
      <P>Last year the British Prime Minister, Mr. Major, said that peace cannot be finally assured until the paramilitaries on both sides hand in their weapons.  We seem to be trying to prohibit Sinn Féin from raising issues such as the Crossmaglen GAA pitch, west Belfast, etc., by first requiring discussions on decommissioning.  This is not in the spirit of what was said prior and post the ceasefire last autumn.  I accept that the Taoiseach is involved in contacts and may not be able to answer my question, but will be unequivocally ask the British Government and Sinn Féin to resolve this minor issue which is in their hands? Yesterday's events show that this might not always be the case and Sinn Féin has repeatedly made this point at the forum and in private.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no difficulty asking the British Government and Sinn Féin to resolve this issue.  In saying that, however, I recognise that the issues involved are genuine and sincere efforts are being made to overcome them.  It is not simply a question of saying we can start the talks tomorrow morning.  Some minor difficulties still remain to be resolved.  In dealing with matters such as this, particular words can often carry threatening emotional baggage for some communities and a totem pole status for others.  The practical day to day concerns about troop levels, deployment and so on can be discussed in the normal way, but it is difficult to describe <Col N="1257" /> that process of discussion without some community feeling threatened.  Nothing would be gained by starting talks on one side of the divide in Northern Ireland if the price to be paid was more difficulties on the other side.  The efforts being made by Sinn Féin and the British Government are sincere and I urge the parties concerned to bring discussions to a conclusion as soon as possible.  In saying that, I am not making little of the genuine concerns on either side.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach stated that there are still legitimate differences between the two sides.  In speaking in Oxford last Friday night, the Tánaiste stated that as far as he was concerned there were no differences between the two sides and that the talks should proceed. How does the Taoiseach reconcile those differing comments?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have outlined the position as I understand it.  Some minor issues remain to be resolved between the parties regarding the agenda, the words to be used to describe items on the agenda and how the meetings are to be founded.  They are minor issues in comparison to the total agenda, but they are still of some consequence.  As I have stated repeatedly, sincere and intensive efforts are being made by both sides to resolve the remaining issues and regardless of how the question is put I do not propose saying anything what would suggest a lack of regard for the concerns of either side in this issue.  I am not in a position to comment on the speech to which the Deputy referred.  I would need to scrutinise it before I could do so.</P>

      <P>It is a matter of considerable importance if the Taoiseach is saying one thing and the Tánaiste another about what are described as minor issues.  There are guns stocked in Balbriggan, Belfast and elsewhere which I am thankful are not being used. Surely minor issues should not be allowed delay substantive talks to build <Col N="1258" /> on the process which began on 31 August last.  Surely it should be a matter of priority for the Taoiseach not only to contact the British Government and Sinn Féin, but to take a proactive role in bringing the two sides together in regard to an agenda so that the talks can proceed.</P>

      <P>Eight Bills have been published since the Government took office on 15 December 1994.  I am arranging to have a list of those Bills and the dates of their publication, as well as a list of 13 Bills which were carried over from the previous Government, circulated in the Official Report.  The legislative priorities are identified by the Government at the commencement of each session and a programme is circulated by the Government Chief Whip at that stage. This practice will continue to be observed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In accordance with the commitment in the Government's programme, a list of promised legislation to assist the Ceann Comhairle and Members was published by the Government Chief Whip on 14 February 1995.  It is intended that this list will also be <Col N="1259" /> updated at the commencement of each session.</P>
    <P>The legislative programme is discussed by the Whips on a regular basis. From time to time matters arise which <Col N="1260" /> require urgent attention and while the Government, in the main, works to a planned programme, account must be taken of developments as they arise. Any changes to the programme are, of course, also discussed in advance with the Whips.</P>

      <P>There are now 17 committees of the House.  Deputies are meeting themselves coming back.  We can make up our minds later about whether this is a good system, but we need to know the legislation that will be taken next session.  I was long enough around the Cabinet table to know that legal, drafting and other difficultes can arise in respect of some Bills.  As the Bills to be taken in the next session should be almost complete, will the Taoiseach tell us what they are?  Will he ask his Cabinet colleagues to stop the practice of tabling a large number of amendments the night before Committee Stage of a Bill is taken in the House? While I acknowledge this may have happened occasionally when we were in Government, it leads to constitutional challenges, difficulties, arguments and an impossible position for an Opposition not to mention a Minister.  Will the Taoiseach ensure that there is not a recurrence of what happemed recently in regard to a Bill introduced by the Minister for Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Taylor?  It is understandable that it might be necessary at a late stage to table some technical amendments to <Col N="1261" /> a Finance Bill, but it should not happen with a Bill that was drafted months earlier. It is unacceptable that, say, 60 amendments should be tabled at 10 p.m. which the Opposition are expected to debate the following morning.  That is not proper parliamentary procedure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not favour the practice of tabling amendments late on the night before a Bill is taken in Committee Stage.  That is bad parliamentary practice and I would actively discourage Ministers from doing that.  I hope all those involved in preparing amendments will note what I have said.  If amendments are to be considered properly it is important that sufficient time is available to Members to consider them. Occasionally it will be necessary to table amendments at a late stage and we are working with limited resources.  It is, however, undesirable that amendments should be presented to the Opposition or other Members the night before Committee Stage is taken in the House. I will do everything I can, within reason, to overcome that difficulty.  Perhaps the Whips could communicate in this regard.</P>

Would the Taoiseach elaborate on the Government's attitude on the forthcoming constitutional referendum on divorce?  Is it the intention to publish proposals fairly soon after the hearing of the case in the courts?  Are those proposals being prepared?  Is it still the Government's intention to hold a referendum in 1995?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated in my reply to the Deputy of 22 March, the council is currently pursuing two major work programmes.  The first is to undertake Phase II of its work on Output and Employment, entitled &ldquo;Enterprise in the Irish Economy&rdquo;.  In the context of this work, I have asked that the Council take into account the following four key inputs: the recommendations of &ldquo;The OECD Jobs Study&rdquo; published in June 1994; the recommendations contained in the EU White Paper on Growth, Competitiveness and Employment; the EU White Paper on Social Policy; and the Government's new approach to industrial policy set out in the response to the Moriarty Task Force.</P>
      <P>I have also asked that the Council indicate to what extent, and how, the recommendations in the OECD study and the EU White Paper should be implemented in Ireland so as to have maximum effect on employment and growth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Council proposes to undertake four studies in Phase II of its work programme on Output and Employment as follows: (i) Ireland's investment performance; (ii) statistical analysis of firm <Col N="1263" /> and sectoral data; (iii) organisational patterns and capabilities of Irish firms and (iv) public policy in dynamic, high employment regions.</P>
    <P>The studies are being carried out from October 1994, to December 1995 and the results will be published during 1995 and 1996.</P>
    <P>As I have also previously indicated, in relation to the NESC's second major work programme on economic and social strategy for the 21st century, I have asked that as a part of this work and as a part of the Government's general programme of preparation for the millenium, that the Council prepare by end-1996 a series of reports outlining the economic, social and demographic profile of Ireland in the year 2000 and beyond.</P>
    <P>I would remind the Deputy that I have asked that the Council explore the possibility that the Northern Ireland Economic Council would join in this analysis on either an integrated or complementary basis and that greater co-operation be sought in relation to other studies of mutual benefit to both Councils, as they arise.</P>
    <P>An analysis of economic and social policy issues arising in the EU and likely to be relevant to the Irish Presidency and the Intergovernmental Conference to revise the Treaty on European Union, both of which will occur in 1996, is currently being undertaken by the council and is set to be completed by end-1995.</P>

      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for his detailed reply.  We on this side of the House, as always, support the ongoing studies of NESC.  Will the Taoiseach ask NESC to undertake a detailed study of the implications of the European Monetary Union?  Some independent groups, including the IEA, are working on European Monetary Union and most EU member states are undertaking detailed work on European Monetary Union, although the Governor of the Central Bank, answering questions to a Dáil committee, said that European <Col N="1264" /> Monetary Union would not be achieved before 1999.  No work is being undertaken within Government Departments at present on European Monetary Union but it would be beneficial if we were to undertake a detailed study, and NESC has the appropriate experience and contacts to do that work.</P>

On assuming office I decided to take this further and I have now included the representatives of the unemployed among the Government representatives on the NESC.  This represents a step forward and a sensible move on my part, one which shows that the unemployed, many of whose views are of equal value to those of the employed, need to contribute to social dialogue in a comprehensive way.

I understand that the invitations are being confined to the Heads of State and Government of those countries which played a significant part in the war in Europe. However, our Ambassador in London will be invited to a number of ceremonies on 7 May, including a Thanksgiving Service.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9 and 10 together.</P>
      <P>I set out in this House on 7 March last the Governments' general approach to the 1996 intergovernmental conference. At this stage Ireland has made no formal proposals for the Intergovernmental Conference.  It is important that the Intergovernmental Conference be preceded by a widespread public debate on possible ways of improving the democratic mandate and accountability of all European institutions.  My speech in Brussels on 29 March to a conference of European Prime Ministers, party leaders and parliamentarians, was designed to encourage such a debate.</P>
      <P>Ireland's general approach to the Intergovernmental Conference negotiations will be to equip the Union, institutionally and otherwise, to meet the challenges of the 21st century, including further enlargement, in a way that will retain the adherence of its citizens and ensure that Ireland's vital national interests are fully protected.</P>

      <P>Last week in Brussels the Taoiseach suggested that the President of the European Commission should be directly elected by the people and that commissioners should be answerable to national parliaments. Does this mark a change in policy?  Is this a proposal that the Minister of State, Deputy Mitchell, will present to the committee of wise men or one that Ireland will submit for inclusion on the agenda of the intergovernmental conference? Such a proposal would completely alter the constitutional balance in the European Union.  Currently, small countries like Ireland can express their views at the European Council at <Col N="1271" /> which the Taoiseach has an equal voice&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying to save time.  Either the Taoiseach forgot last week that these issues were of importance to the country or he has some other agenda.  Did the Government discuss these proposals?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We are now in a phase where we are preparing a possible agenda for the intergovernmental conference. There should be widespread debate on the various options which might be considered for increasing the democratic accountability of European institutions.  I strongly support Ireland's position as a member of the Council of Ministers and nothing I have said would imply a diminution.</P>
      <P>The Commission must retain the sole power of initiative in the European Union.  If the Council of Ministers or the European Parliament were given the power of initiative, in European terms literally everybody's business would be nobody's business.  The reason the European Union has been such a success is that the Commission has the sole power of initiative &mdash; the original founding idea of Jean Monnet.  It was considered acceptable at the time that the Commission would not have a direct democratic mandate because many of its powers and the issues dealt with were limited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now that the range of issues upon which the Commission might take an initiative is being widened the argument might be advanced that there is a case for enhancing its democratic mandate. Many of those opposed to a deepening of Europe use the lack of a democratic mandate falsely and unwisely as an excuse for not giving the Commission more powers or diminishing its powers. Anything which reduces the dynamic role of the Commission is not in the interests of either European intergration <Col N="1272" /> or Ireland.  During the years the Commission has been a very good friend to smaller member states.</P>
    <P>We should have a discussion on how the Commission can be brought closer to the people.  One of the suggestions I made in a political context at a political meeting for consideration by my colleagues, not as a formal Government position, was that an opportunity might be sought at some stage &mdash; perhaps not at this intergovernmental conference but a later one &mdash; to consider whether the President of the Commission should be elected in much the same way as the head of the executive branch of the United States Federal Government is elected, directly by the people.  This is an issue which at least should be in people's minds, if not on the formal agenda at this juncture.</P>
    <P>On the question of accountability of the Commission to national parliaments, I was not suggesting that national parliaments should be involved in nominating it.  I was suggesting that it might be the responsibility of a Commissioner to be accountable on an ongoing basis and to meet with a parliament of a member state other than his or her own.  For example, the Swedish Commissioner might regularly appear either before the Dáil or before the EU committee of the Dáil so that a personal relationship would build up between individual members of the Commission and Parliaments of member states.  I believe that would bring the Commission closer to the people and would create a greater opportunity for its work to have public support.  However, I make no claim for exclusive wisdom in regard to the proposals I am making.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>While the Taoiseach is perfectly entitled to put forward his view I do not think it is appropriate to make a comparison with the United States, which is essentially unitary territory. Will the Taoiseach not agree that it would be better to have a popularly elected Commission or that in each member state the Commissioner might be elected?  That might be a more effective way of enhancing the democratic mandate.  Having a German, a Frenchman or some other person standing for election in Ireland would not do anything to enhance the democratic mandate of the Commission.  Does the Taoiseach intend putting forward his view as a Government view in the context of the Irish Presidency and, in particular, of the Intergovernmental Conference meeting during the Irish Presidency?</P>

      <P>The election of individual Commissioners, as Deputy Harney suggested, would not achieve the objective I am seeking which is that people should vote on one issue at one time in all parts of Europe.  Individual election of individual Commissioners in different countries would not meet that requirement.  We need to create a sense that the European people, whether they live in Sicily or Belmullet, are together on the same day deciding on a single question.  We have not yet achieved that and until we do we will have this sense that the European institutions do not fully have a democratic mandate from the united people of Europe speaking with a united voice.</P>
      <P>As to whether the proposal would be included in the Government's formal proposals to the Intergovernmental Conference, it is far too early to say that.  It may well not be included on this occasion on the basis that there may not be sufficient support for it at this stage throughout Europe.  However, I will be making any contacts I can that would be useful to explore the level of support for this or for other ideas that might enhance the democratic accountability of European institutions, without which we will not achieve the full potential of Europe.  In almost every sense Europe has been an outstanding success and yet it would appear that the European public does not fully realise that.</P>

      <P>I am conscious of the time but we will return to this matter <Col N="1275" /> again because a number of my colleagues have many questions to ask.  I am glad the Taoiseach has clarified the issue that this is not a Government proposal but one he made at a political meeting.  We look forward to a useful discussion on the agenda for the Intergovernmental Conference.  However, the Taoiseach's proposal, even in the political context, is very unwise because the balance for the small countries is vital.  From our point of view, that balance is favourable.  The Taoiseach's proposal is very similar to an earlier French proposal that the President of the Commission should be elected and, having been elected by popular mandate, he or she would then choose the Commissioners.  Earlier today the Taoiseach said that during his discussions with President Santer the one issue he would not move away from was the fact that the Irish Government would choose its Commissioner.  If one goes down that road, which is similar to the French proposal, one could quickly find oneself isolated, from a political point of view.  I suggest that the Taoiseach should forget about that proposal because I believe it is a bad one.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 15 and 40 together.</P>
      <P>The judgment of the High Court in relation to the entitlements of women under the Equal Treatment Directive was delivered on 3 February this year. The Government announced recently that it was accepting the judgment and we committed ourselves to paying the £260 million involved as quickly as possible, given that these payments are legally due.  In the current year payments to the women affected will amount to approximately £200 million.</P>
      <P>As I have already provided £60 million towards the cost of such payments in the budget, further expenditure this year will be limited to £140 million.  I propose to finance this additional expenditure from the proceeds of the disposal of a portion of the local loans fund loan portfolio.  Sales of these assets will be limited to the amount needed to cover the additional Exchequer cost arising from the decision to accept the court judgment.</P>
      <P>The local loans fund is a statutory fund under the control of the Minister for Finance.  It has assets of about £550 million, of which £490 million are fixed rate loans made to local authorities which the authorities used to advance mortgage loans to persons who satisfied a means test.  The local authorities make capital and interest payments on these loans to the fund twice a year.  Almost all of these loans were made prior to 1 July 1986 and since then most of the capital required by local authorities to finance their mortgage lending activities has been provided by the Housing Finance Agency at variable rates of interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Two avenues for disposal of part of the assets of the fund are being examined at present.  One would involve a securitisation by the National Treasury Management Agency and the other would be by the activation of section 15 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1992 which allows the sale of local loans fund assets to the <Col N="1278" /> Housing Finance Agency.  The comparative merits of each course are being examined at present by officials in my Department who are being advised by the two agencies.  I expect to make a decision on the route to be followed in relation to the sale of the assets in the near future.</P>
    <P>The income from the local loans fund forms part of the general receipts into the Exchequer.  The extent of loss of income to the State, if any, will depend on the route to be followed in relation to the sale of the local loans fund assets and the timing of the sale.</P>
    <P>The increase in current Government spending underlying the budget was 5.8 per cent.  The increase of £140 million in spending to which I have already referred will result in the increase in 1995 current spending compared with 1994 being 7.1 per cent.  However, as the additional spending now envisaged is exceptional and once-off, it will not be taken into account in determining the 2 per cent target for non-capital spending in 1996 and 1997.</P>
    <P>When I addressed the question of providing the resources to pay the legally determined entitlements of married women to social welfare equality payments in my 1995 Budget Statement, I indicated that &ldquo;should it prove necessary to spend more on these exceptional payments this year, there are funding possibilities open to me through the disposal of State assets&rdquo;.  I also stated that &ldquo;my target for the EBR would not then be increased by making further payments&rdquo; and that &ldquo;the assets I will consider disposing of are not in commercial semi-State bodies&rdquo;.  The assets I was referring to were, of course, the loans made by the Exchequer to the local authorities via the local loans fund, which were in turn used by the local authorities for their mortgage lending activities.</P>
    <P>As my Budget Statement sets out the Government's budgetary and economic policy, its contents, including the extracts from it which I have just quoted, have the unequivocal support of the entire Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>Lest there be any misunderstanding, my party is not opposed to the payment of the outstanding money to the women concerned.  The Minister put great emphasis on the equality payments and I do not want anyone to think this party is questioning the right of those entitled to that money to receive it.  I am questioning the way the Minister proposes to raise the funds. There are two clear options: to sell it to the private sector to raise the money or to allow the Exchequer to borrow the money, increasing the public sector borrowing requirement for this year.  Which of those options will be taken?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I would have thought my reply was self-explanatory.  I intend to dispose of a certain amount of assets within the local loans fund, which will raise approximately £140 million and will help make up the total amount of £200 million required this year.  We are talking about the disposal of assets, not extra borrowing.  I made that very clear in my budget speech and I have repeated the precise quotation from the Budget Statement of 8 February.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>To whom will the Minister sell the fund?  Will the privatise it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to that question cannot be given because the exact route &mdash; by way of section 15 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1992, through the Housing Finance Agency, or alternatively by way of securitisation through the National Treasury Management Agency &mdash; has not been determined, but there will not be extra borrowing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the assets be sold in the State or is the Minister considering selling them to an interest outside the country?  Does he accept that if he takes the route of the Housing Finance Agency he is simply trying to hide the fact that further borrowing is required, but rather than the figures showing up <Col N="1280" /> under the Exchequer borrowing requirement they will appear under the public sector borrowing requirement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be preferable in the overall strategic management of the nation's finances, if the assets were retained by Irish rather than foreign holders.  The disposal of the assets will not affect the Exchequer borrowing requirement.  I am determined to ensure that whatever route we ultimately choose, a number of factors will be taken into account but the dominant factor for evaluation will be the effect on the Exchequer borrowing requirement. I am committed to, and figures published yesterday confirm we are on target this year for, an Exchequer borrowing requirement of 2.4 per cent and I do not intend to do anything that will alter that figure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is trying to be clever.  We know he does not wish to alter the Exchequer borrowing requirement as that would give rise to concern in the marketplace.  That was stated by the Minister's officials at the committee meeting on this matter.  If the Minister takes the route of the Housing Finance Agency he will simply transfer the borrowing to another area, but it will be ultimately part of total borrowing.  He did not answer my questions on the present income from the local loans fund, how that income is being dispersed by the State and what will the position be in the event that part of the fund is to be solid.  When will we receive answers to those questions?  There is a possibility that these assets will be sold outside the State.  Will the Minister clarify that the option of these assets being sold outside the State still exists although it is not a preference?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy, in his assertions as much as in his questions, has indicated the desirability of taking the National Treasury Management <Col N="1281" /> Agency route as distinct from the Housing Finance Agency route.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has clearly made that point.  In so far as I have choices, they will be dominated by my commitment to ensure the Exchequer borrowing requirement does not exceed the target set.</P>

      <P>It is not at all optical.  I am constrained by time in answering the question but I will be happy to answer any additional questions the Deputy puts down.  On the question of when we will make the decision, it is currently under active consideration and it will be made fairly soon.  It will not be possible to make these payments before July this year for administrative and procedural reasons.  There is provision for £60 million in the Estimates and therefore there is not any pressure to make the decision to have the money in place to meet the commitments made.  I am taking the time available to me to ensure I make the right decision.</P>

      <Quest>the percentage increase in supply services spending, including the proposed £140 million for equality payments, between 1994 and 1995; the percentage increase if the proceeds of the tax amnesty were excluded from the 1994 figures; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 16 and 42 together.</P>
      <P>Total gross supply services expenditure in 1995, both current and capital and including the £140 million payments for social welfare equal treatment arrears, is estimated, on a post-budget basis, at £12,928 million, an increase of 7.8 per cent on the 1994 provisional out-turn figure of £11,997 million.  If the proceeds of the tax amnesty, which amounted to £230 million, are excluded from the 1994 figures, then the increase in gross supply services expenditure in 1995 is estimated at 9.9 per cent.  The amnesty proceeds were used, in part, to fund on-going expenditure such as pensions liability in An Post and Bord Telecom. Deducting amnesty proceeds from 1994 expenditure to calculate a base for measuring the increase this year is not wholly valid, for that reason.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the Government's policy on public expenditure is to moderate the growth in non-capital supply services spending over the period 1995 to 1997.  In the budget, I provided for an increase of 5.8 per cent in 1995 in gross current supply services spending, below the 6 per cent limit we set ourselves. The budget expenditure figures included a provision of £60 million for equal treatment payments this year.  If the additional £140 million in equal treatment arrears payments, which the Government has now decided should be paid in 1995, are added to the budget figures, the increase in gross current supply services spending in 1995 will be 7.1 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the equal treatment payments, the Government has announced that it is accepting the judgment of the High Court on to the entitlements of the women affected and has committed itself to paying the full amount involved, estimated at £260 million.  These payments, awarded by the court, are a legal obligation which was not created by any <Col N="1283" /> act of this Government.  The £200 million in 1995 and the balance of £60 million to be met subsequently are an extraordinary, non-recurring item of expenditure.  Meeting these exceptional liabilities does not indicate any weakening of the Government's resolve to contain public spending.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that the increase in current spending this year which on its own figures is 9.9 per cent is absolutely monstrous given that inflation is running at 2.5 per cent or thereabouts; that this kind of expenditure will grind this country into the ground once again from which we will have to painfuly extract ourselves? Is he further aware of the contents of a recent article by a former Taoiseach, Dr. Garret FitzGerald, drawing attention to the fact that the Minister's method of describing current expenditure this year is faulty and understates the position because he is referring to gross rather than net expenditure for the first time and that the actual expenditure is one percentage point higher? As a result we are now facing an increase in current expenditure of 10.9 per cent, which is monstrous and unacceptable in the management of this country's financial affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept that public spending &mdash; which is the political point the Deputy is trying to make &mdash; is out of control or that this Government made up of three parties is not committed to ensuring that expenditure in the public supply of services is contained and restrained in order to improve our overall economic performance.  There are once-off exceptional items for last year and this year which when added together and presented in the manner the Deputy has just done would suggest that the figure is of the order of 7.1 per cent.  If you include the base from last year &mdash; which I do not accept is acceptable arithmetic in this regard &mdash; you could arrive at a higher figure.  It is <Col N="1284" /> important to have regard to the overall trend and, as far as I am concerned, when you take the Exchequer borrowing requirement and the commitments in the programme for Government, this Government is clearly committed to the responsible management of the nation's financial affairs, including growth in public expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that the PSBR will be significantly increased as a result of this manoeuvring and creative accounting he is now involved in irrespective of its effect on the EBR?  Would he tell the House how he can reconcile that this year's equality payments to married women are a once-off factor but he seeks to represent the amnesty proceeds of last year as being the norm although they were every bit as much a once-off factor as the payments being made in this present year?  He seeks to include the amnesty proceeds from last year in order to try to make the overall figure look lower than it really is in order to hoodwink the public that public expenditure has not gone out of control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me assure the Deputy that the Exchequer borrowing, which is one of the critical Maastricht criteria, will be maintained at 2.4 per cent and, possibly, less depending on the outcome at the end of the year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked the Minister earlier if he had familiarised himself <Col N="1285" /> with the contents of an article by the former Deputy, Dr. FitzGerald.  Since he has not rebutted what Dr. FitzGerald wrote I presume he accepts his analysis of the change in the way these figures are presented this year, by expressing them in gross rather than in net terms and by excluding the appropriations-in-aid. Will he agree with me that the actual increase in current public spending this year is, therefore, 10.9 per cent which is monstrous?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that Dr. Garret FitzGerald is a very eminent commentator and one who has always commanded the respect of Deputy O'Malley with regard to his control of national economic and budgetary matters.  In this instance the figures we have presented are transparent, known to everybody and we have not tried by any method of creative accounting to hoodwink anybody. We have clearly indicated the position.  Once again may I reaffirm my commitment to ensure that public expenditure is kept to the limits we have <Col N="1286" /> set for ourselves in the programme, <i>A Government of Renewal,</i> which was published on the formation of this Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I explained to Deputy Molloy why we were not persisting here. It was proposed to delete the section from its present position in the Bill and incorporate it more appropriately under the miscellaneous provisions.  We will deal with the amendment regarding marital status at the appropriate time.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Keeffe said we have enshrined in the Bill provisions to outlaw discrimination but asked how we can be sure it will achieve its purpose. Each case must be made on its merits. It will now be an offence to discriminate on any of these grounds, including marital status, colour, creed, social status, location or whatever.  I refer Deputy O'Keeffe to section 5 (d) which gives the director power to institute proceedings in the High Court for an order requiring any person engaged in practices contrary to the obligations imposed on him by the Bill to refrain from such practices.  I would have thought that is a fairly compelling sanction. We are talking about the lender refusing credit to someone on one of these grounds.  The simplest sanction is that the Director could discontinue a lender's licence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The lender would not say that was why he refused.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>No, he would not but that matter would have to be established in court.  It is like discrimination in employment.  Just because a woman is not promoted does not <i>de facto</i> amount to a case for discrimination. However, the reason she was not promoted and a male colleague was may <Col N="1363" /> establish the fact that she was discriminated against because she was a woman. Section 5 (e) is also relevant since it gives the Director power to investigate complaints concerning possible breaches of the provisions of the Bill and in deciding whether to conduct such an investigation the Director may have regard to other dispute settling procedures.</P>
      <P>Deputy McDowell raised a related point on Committee Stage.  He argued that it could conceivably be dangerous in certain parts of the city for those collecting payments on behalf of moneylenders to carry out their duties.  I do not think anyone is challenging the provision in the Bill which makes it an offence to discriminate on grounds of belief, race, colour or location.  As regards the argument made about drugs, I agree it could be a factor in terms of safety and so on as it is a common phenomenon in many cities and towns.  Collecting local authority rents can be a hazardous occupation. However, it would be a very dangerous precedent to legislate for no-go areas.</P>
      <P>The Bill does not oblige the lender to make credit available.  However, if he refuses it on the basis of any of the considerations here it could be an offence. If that can be established on the merits of the case then the lender would suffer the consequences.</P>

      <P>Yes.  Section 4 (2) (a) (iii) states that the Bill shall not apply to various categories outlined in the section including a society registered under the Provident Societies Acts and a registered society under the Friendly Societies Acts and a local authority.  The main thrust of this amendment is to excise that reference to local authorities and to bring them within the scope of the Bill.</P>
      <P>The substantive amendment would require the following insertion:</P>
      <P>The provisions of this Act may only be applied to housing loans advanced by local authorities, within the meaning of the Local Government Act, 1941, by regulations made by the Minister after consultation with the Minister for the Environment, and different provisions may be applied at different times to different classes of loans, by reference to such matters as the Minister considers appropriate.  A loan, not secured by mortgage, made by a local authority for the purposes of carrying out improvement works (within the meaning of section 1 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1979), to a house shall be regarded as a housing loan (within the meaning of this Act) for the purposes of this Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am pleased to tell the House that I now propose to bring local authority housing loans within the scope of the Bill.  I have consistently held the opinion &mdash; and argued in Opposition &mdash; that this legislation presents an ideal opportunity for introducing a uniform and consistent system for the regulation of all housing loans, irrespective of the <Col N="1365" /> character of the lender.  I could not see then and cannot see now, and I suspect Deputy O'Rourke would be sympathetic to this point of view, why we should make a distinction between a local authority and a building society, a local authority and banker or whatever.  Until now the view on this matter regarding certain requirements of the Bill relating to the disclosure of commissions, fees and endowment mortgages was that that prohibition on the linking of services were not relevant to local authority lending.  Also, it was intended that my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, as a result of Deputy O'Rourke's efforts, would make certain provisions&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>He sent us a letter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;appropriate to local authorities, for example, the disclosure of total cost of credit and the number and amount of instalments that would apply to such loans.  However, I argued then and argue now that a major adverse implication of the exclusion of such loans from the scope of the Bill would be that the Director of Consumer Affairs would not have any role in ensuring that local authorities comply with the requirements of the Bill.  Moreover, aggrieved local authority borrowers would have to seek redress from the Ombudsman.  Such fragmentation is contrary to the unified approach to consumer credit underlying the legislation and would place those who rely on local authority finance in a disadvantaged position <i>vis-à-vis</i> other borrowers in that they would be denied recourse to the Director of Consumer Affairs and his office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Harping back to the earlier discussion about the diversity of proposals available to house purchasers resorting to their local authority, it is more important than ever that local authorities should be required to explain to would-be purchasers, in the simplest most intelligible form, the implications of the various packages available.  The shared ownership to which Deputy <Col N="1366" /> O'Rourke referred is a complex instrument.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not mad about it either.  I believe some consumers enter into it because they see no other prospect of getting housing and they do not understand the imposition of the remaining half of the equity that must be purchased 20 or 25 years later.  I understand the Department, local authorities and so on have been working on various policies that will afford them protection in that regard, but whatever about the merits of shared ownership or any other measures involved in social housing, it is not an argument against local authorities being subject to the requirements imposed by this Bill.  It is all the more important that local authorities should have the access provided under the Bill.</P>
      <P>The effect of the amendments being tabled is that there will be greater clarity in the relationship between local authorities and members of the public with whom they deal.  The consumer who deals with a local authority will now be entitled to the same protection as will apply if they were to deal with another institution.  Access to the Director of Consumer Affairs will be available and consumer protection in this area is being legally underpinned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister won on this amendment but not on an earlier one.  As he generously acknowledged, I had undertaken considerable work in securing recognition from the then Minister, Deputy Smith, that the provisions of the Bill would apply to local authorities and apply to their loan applications. The Minister is correct in saying that the housing loans issued by local authorities should be covered by the Bill and be under the remit of the Director of Consumer Affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A good deal of my constituency work relates to housing matters including people seeking council housing and other various loans.  Those of us who are <Col N="1367" /> extensively involved in constituency work are aware that the arrangements for the repayment of HFA loans are unsatisfactory.  If the Consumer Credit Bill had been in place when the HFA was being promulgated HFA loans would not have been provided.  The manner in which repayments rise is horrendous. If people become social welfare recipients their repayments are supposed to be reduced to be compatible with the rate of social welfare benefit they receive, but that takes some time to achieve and a good deal of correspondence and dealings with local authorities. At the end of an inordinate number of years such borrowers owe huge amounts of money and, having regard to how the HFA operates, they may never own their houses.  I have been alarmed by cases brought to my attention and particularly alarmed by the manner in which HFA loans are sold as a panacea for all difficulties.  I am aware that the Department of the Environment is seeking to devise various strategies to deal with different situations as they arise.</P>
    <P>I have dealt with many applications for shared ownership loans and it is only now that their implications are coming to light.  I understand that after 15 years, although the Minister said 25 years, borrowers, who are already paying low rents towards the local authority portion of shared ownership loans, must increase their repayments to include the additional council portion of those loans.  I have yet to hear a satisfactory explanation of that loan facility.  I am not directing those castigating remarks at the officials present because I support the amendment.  Rather I am explaining that the complexity associated with house purchase loans to which we referred earlier extends very much into the local authority arena also, particularly in regard to the various loans on offer, which I am sure derive from the imaginative proposals put forward by Ministers and officials at the time.  I do <Col N="1368" /> not believe, however, that their implications were thought through, particularly in respect of the HFA because it was established at a time of high inflation and spiralling increases and was ill-conceived.  Amendment No. 23b states:</P>
    <P>A loan, not secured by mortgage, made by a local authority for the purposes of carrying out improvement works (within the meaning of section 1 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1979) to a house shall be regarded as a housing loan (within the meaning of this Act) for the purposes of this Act.</P>
    <P>They used be termed &ldquo;reconstruction loans&rdquo; on the application form, within which category can be included many improvement works such as central heating, additions, kitchens, bathrooms and so on.  It was an effort on the part of local authorities to cater for people who would otherwise be unable to obtain the money.  From my dealings with constituents it was my understanding that such a loan could be added to one's SDA or other local authority loan, forming a composite loan.  Reconstruction or home improvement loans are regarded as housing loans but their amount and tenure are more limited than in the case of SDA loans.  To the best of my recollection a reconstruction loan is repaid over 15 years whereas an SDA one can be repaid over, say, 20, 25 or 30 years.  This distinction should be explained to prospective applicants.</P>
    <P>In my dealings with local authority officials on housing loans over the past 12 months I have found them to be much more helpful, explaining all of the terms in greater detail to applicants. Heretofore their attitude was: &ldquo;Here is the application form, fill it up and your application will be processed&rdquo;.  I am very appreciative of the approach of the Urban District Council in Mullingar which goes through every line of an application with the applicants who must now sign application forms before <Col N="1369" /> an official, stating they have read the terms and fully understand their meaning and implications.  That practice has been built up in regard to housing loans over the past four or five years and represents a definite improvement.</P>
    <P>I strongly support the Minister's objective in this amendment.  However, I urge that there be no delay in dealing with applications for housing loans. Local authority engineers must inspect sites and draw up reports, which must be accompanied by an applicant's P60, a copy of his or her weekly wage slip and the £25 fee.  Very often an applicant will have supplied his or her P60 but not the wage slip.  The local authority will not send out its engineer until all the documentation has come to hand and this can result in a long delay.</P>
    <P>There have been court cases on this matter.  When an applicant applies for a local authority housing loan, an engineer is sent out to inspect the relevant property but the applicant should not then assume that to be proof that the property is structurally sound in every respect.  I have come across people who were fooled into so believing.  They should be aware that the engineer merely inspects the property to verify that there is the wherewithal within that structure to call down that loan in the event of default in payment.  The motto is <i>caveat emptor</i>&mdash; one should also engage one's own engineer or consultant to inspect the house to ensure it is sound in all respects.</P>
    <P>When replying I should like the Minister to confirm what I have said because I am aware of a pending court case.  I always advise applicants to engage their own engineer to have their property thoroughly inspected so that they will have some redress in the case of faults being discovered later.</P>
    <P>I regard those amendments as worthy of support.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;without whose involvement and enthusiasm this section would not have been included.  Very often the attitude adopted to people who live in local authority houses is that they are second-class citizens who do not deserve the type of attention given to a comparable working-class family who may obtain a loan from a building society.  Those ably assisted by a Housing Finance Agency or SDA loan or who have acquired their first home through the relatively new shared ownership scheme are obliged in law to repay those loans like any other citizen. A well kept secret is that, when one calculates the total cost of repaying such a loan, the poorer sections of our society &mdash; those who have recourse only to schemes administered by local authorities &mdash; pay more than others with savings or on a better footing with, say, a building society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's new subsection which will be of enormous benefit to people with relatively low incomes, many of whom are subjected to the ordeal of first having their applications rejected by a financial institution, usually a bank or building society, which tends to regard them as financial liabilities and will not provide the requisite loan.  In fairness to the State, it conceived the notion there was another band of people the financial institutions were not serving and introduced a range of schemes to assist them.  The reality is that low income earners tend to pay <Col N="1371" /> more in repayments on borrowings than do people who can afford building society loans.  We are all aware that many people are using the Department of the Environment shared ownership scheme to escape from the housing waiting lists.  They have such low incomes that they are not eligible for loans from banks or building societies.  Young married couples in desperate need of accommodation are attracted to the shared ownership scheme.  It is very difficult to explain to a young couple anxious to be accommodated that following 20 years of paying the shared ownership repayment they will have to enter into an agreement with the local authority to purchase the house.</P>
    <P>Nowadays people are entering their first home at the ages of 20 or 25.  After 15 or 20 years they are confronted with a half mortgage.  I am quite sure the 200 to 300 people who purchase from Dublin Corporation do not look further than their immediate demand to have a roof over their heads which they can afford. I see problems down the road for many of these people.</P>
    <P>I have read the documentation that goes with the shared ownership scheme and I am worried that the vast bulk of people do not fully appreciate the financial implications of what they are entering into.  It is interesting to note that if the local authority funds 50 per cent of a £30,000 house, because of the tax relief families are allowed to claim, local authorities are not allowing tenant purchasers to purchase the State's portion of the loan first.  Tenant purchasers who want to buy out the State's 50 per cent are restricted from entering into an agreement.  This should be modified. The end result is that there are difficulties for the consumer.</P>
    <P>I have every confidence that the legislation debated today, in its amended form, will substantially educate the public on the financial deals they are entering into and compel local authorities and the Department of the Environment to be explicit and fair in the way they present the potential <Col N="1372" /> repayment of these loans.  I fully support and endorse the amendment.</P>

      <P>Subsection (3) (a) of amendment No. 23b is not the great liberal step forward one might imagine. It does not say the provisions of this Bill will apply to SDA loans: quite the reverse.  It states they will not apply to such loans unless regulations are made by the Minister, after consultation with the Minister for the Environment and that then he can apply it as he wishes, by regulations, to different classes of loans to different extents.  This is by no means a self executing ordinance.  It will not extend all these rights to SDA borrowers. This measure provides that the Bill does not apply to them unless and until two Ministers say it should apply to them and, then, only to the limited extent the Ministers provide in the regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am merely pointing this out to show it is like the Regulation of Information (Services Outside State for Termination of Pregnancies) Bill which was trotted out as a great liberalising measure but it consisted of a series of new crimes and restrictions.  This measure now being heralded as the extension of this Bill to SDA loans is a prohibition on its extension unless a Minister or two Ministers get together, one of whom has a vested interest in obstructing the application of the loan because it will require extra expense and new procedures for his Department.  Before the canonisation process goes too far there is room in this House now and then for a devil's advocate. We will need more than this to canonise the Minister, we will need a <Col N="1373" /> certified legislative miracle or a few first class relics before I will accept that the paeans of praise coming from behind him are justified.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>We are talking strictly about accountability.  Local authorities have been even handed and fair in their assessment of clients and of people who experience difficulties. There have been very few anomalies and they have not acted mischievously in any application I have seen or in the termination of loans.  Where people wished to redeem loans and move to another finance house they were always given a fair hearing and a fair settlement.</P>
      <P>The local improvement scheme and the local authority loan are worthwhile initiatives but what good is a local authority loan of £25,000 when a local authority three bedroomed house costs in the region of £30,000 to £35,000?  Who could build a new home with £25,000? When expenses are deducted the figure would be nearer to £21,000.  That figure must be increased.</P>
      <P>I urge the Minister of State who has an input at Cabinet to give local authorities permission to advance larger loans for housing for people who will not be financed by the major financial institutions.  The availability of £10,000 for an SDA loan is excellent and as my colleague, Deputy O'Rourke has said, both loans can be linked for payment purposes.  That has worked well.</P>
      <P>The loan with a horrendous cost which put many people in difficulty was the Housing Finance Agency loan.  That was bad value for money.  Whoever thought it up did not research it very well and many people redeemed the HFA loan when we had a more favourable climate for obtaining loans during the last few years when the economy picked up and a different line was being adopted by building societies and lending agencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1374" /> The shared mortgage scheme should be re-examined at Cabinet level.  It is bad value for money.  The ceiling is £50,000 and many people will not live to see the day when it is repaid.  Repayments will go on forever.  When their own portion is paid they will have to take up the local authority portion. Nowadays the shared mortgage option has become more popular with people and families experiencing difficulties with other agencies but when they try to redeem the loan they go from the frying pan into the fire.</P>
    <P>Local authorities have treated their clients in a fair manner and there was no need to deal with them in a consumer credit Bill.  In future a person will only be able to apply to the local authority for a loan if they have been refused by two financial institutions. They will also have to meet other criteria and if their income is in excess of a certain amount it is possible that they will not be granted a loan.</P>
    <P>Credit unions have been a great help to people in all strata of society.  This morning the Taoiseach told us that a Bill dealing with credit unions would be introduced around June and I do not want to pre-empt any of its provisions. One of the best credit unions is located in my constituency.  The applicants are assessed fairly by a local committee and even though there is little emphasis on security the credit union has a 98-99 per cent success rate in securing repayments. Consideration should be given by other financial institutions and local authorities to the system operated by credit unions.  The major problem with local authorities is that they place too much emphasis on security, which is not much good if one cannot pay.  In many cases the cost of this security is horrendous.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Will loans advanced under the Friendly Societies Act come within the scope of the Bill?  Reference has been made to the tontine society which gave rise to much difficulty. Friendly societies have expanded their <Col N="1375" /> activities and I am not completely satisfied that they have done this in a satisfactory manner or that they provide proper information to people.</P>

      <P>As Deputy O'Keeffe rightly pointed out, people who apply for local authority loans must first have been refused a loan by both a bank and a building society.  It is only after going through this tortuous procedure that they can apply to the local authority for a loan.  Local authorities deal with the public every day on various issues and they are very good at what they do. However, people who have to apply for a local authority loan are made to feel like second-class citizens because no one else will give them the money.  It is essential that these people are protected under the legislation.  If we fail to do this we will reinforce the image both they and others have.  It is very important that these people are treated in the same way as other borrowers.</P>
      <P>Local authorities operate in much the same way as private lending institutions in that their rates of interest can fluctuate and they look for proof of earnings and certain securities.  Local authority engineers inspect houses to ensure that the value is correct and, as Deputy O'Rourke correctly said, it is essential that borrowers also hire engineers to assess whether the house is in a proper condition.</P>
      <P>It is important to include in the Bill a provision which protects this sizeable number of people.  Purchasing a house is the single biggest purchase most people will make during their lives.  If they are not protected under the Bill, who will protect them?  Local authority consumers are as important as private sector consumers and it is essential that we do not reinforce the misconception that these people are not as worthy of protection as other borrowers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy O'Rourke for her gracious acknowledgement that the measure will strengthen the Bill in terms of local <Col N="1376" /> authority consumers.  It is only correct that it does this.  She has been a Minister and knows that under our system it certainly helps to be at the Cabinet table. This provision will give local authorities a great impetus to operate a uniform system.  Deputies have praised local authorities and many people will say that this is only to be expected as all of us were or are members of local authorities. However, it cannot be argued in the modern world that giant corporations in the private sector ought to come within the scope of this Bill while public sector organisations ought to be excluded.  It is as incumbent on organisations within the public sector as it is on private sector corporations to observe good consumer standards and operate uniform regulations for dealing with the public.  In future local authorities will have to have regard to the provisions in the Bill before granting loans, which has become a very complex area.  There is now a diversity of housing options available to people and it is only correct that local authorities should be brought within the scope of the Bill.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Rourke raised a number of valid points and broadened the scope of the debate into the area of housing policy. In some ways these two issues are inextricably bound together.  A number of the Deputy's concerns were echoed by other Members.  This is probably not the forum where we should debate the pros and cons of the shared ownership scheme.  It is a housing policy matter and more appropriate to the Minister for the Environment.  I have always been somewhat uneasy about that scheme.  Some consumers do not have their eyes fully open when they enter the scheme and do not appreciate that, unless they take alternative measures, there could be an albatross around their necks in 20 years' time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Rourke referred to the delay in processing applications under the scheme.  In most local authorities there are inexplicable delays in that regard.  While many applicants are satisfied within a reasonable period, that may only prove that those people do not <Col N="1377" /> have alternative housing options.  I understand some local authorities are contracting the legal work outside their law departments in order to deal with the backlog and the delays in the processing of the loans.  I hope that will speed up matters.</P>

I am happy with the position, it is a major step forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Rourke, who never forgets anything, correctly reminded me that when we were dealing with this matter <Col N="1378" /> I raised the question of the Transport Employees Tontine and Benefit Society. She raised the matter in regard to exclusions under section 4 (2) (ii) of the Bill and asked if what happened to the tontine savers could happen again and why we are excising a provision in that regard from the Bill.  The argument is similar to that pertaining to credit unions.  Deputy O'Keeffe instanced credit unions as a good example of how credit can be extended at local level with a unique knowledge of local circumstances, administered by a local committee that knows the applicants and so on.  I will introduce legislation on credit unions this year, it is being drafted.</P>
    <P>Friendly societies, such as credit unions, are based on mutuality, non-profit making and ownership by the members, with loans being given only to members.  They are also governed by legislation and regulation, but new legislation is being drafted.  They are not included in the wider consumer area simply because of the requirements regarding membership.  I refer Deputy O'Rourke to a letter of 3 April I received from the Registrar of Friendly Societies, the relevant section of which states:</P>
    <P>The Friendly Societies Regulations of 1988 and 1992 put in place certain safeguards which were designed to address some of the weaknesses in the Friendly Societies Acts which were highlighted by the collapse of the Transport Employees Tontine and Benefit Society, which is now in liquidation. Under the Regulations, friendly societies and specially authorised societies are required to have a supervisory committee.  They are also confined to investing their funds in trustee authorised investments and their accounts must be audited by a public auditor.</P>
    <P>I am currently examining the legislation relating to friendly societies to determine whether any further amendments are required to protect the interests of members of friendly <Col N="1379" /> societies and I hope to be in a position to submit proposals to the Minister in this regard later this year.</P>
    <P>The amendments to which the Registrar referred appear to be a considerable improvement on the position that obtained at the time of the Tontine tragedy when low earning workers suffered a very grevious blow because of the manner in which the Tontine society operated.  Given the changes that have been introduced, not least the requirement that accounts must be audited by a public auditor, it does not appear possible that such a tragedy could recur. Since taking up office I have not been able to meet the Registrar of Friendly Societies, but I propose to do so and to talk to him about that matter and his conclusions about whether new legislation in the area of friendly societies is necessary.</P>
    <P>The regulation route I propose is designed to ensure that the relevant provisions of the Bill are applied to local authority housing loans in a flexible manner so as to avoid undue administrative difficulties for local authorities. It is important that we do not cause problems for schemes that are particular to local authorities, such as the shared ownership and tenant purchase schemes.</P>
    <P>The second amendment is necessary to provide that local authority unsecured house improvement loans are treated as housing loans as defined in the Bill.  The amendment will ensure that the appropriate provisions of the Bill to apply to local authority mortgage housing loans will also apply to those unsecured house improvement loans. Without this amendment, inappropriate provisions of the Bill which apply to non-banking or building society lenders, such as unenforceability and power of the courts to review the interest rate, would apply to local authority unsecured house improvement loans.</P>
    <P>This Bill has been a testament to the procedures of the House since the day it was initiated.  It was subjected to very <Col N="1380" /> careful scrutiny on Committee Stage resulting in a better Bill, partly because of the receptiveness of the Minister to the arguments by the Opposition.  This further strengthens the Bill in an important area.</P>
    <P>Valuations are carried out on behalf of the mortgage lender to ensure that the value of the house to be mortgaged is adequate relative to the size of the loan.  Borrowers are well advised to arrange for a survey to check the structural soundness of the house and, as Deputy O'Rourke concedes, the principle of <i>caveat emptor</i> applies.  It may contribute to slowness in processing applications particularly to local authorities. Nevertheless it is a prudent measure and borrowers would be well advised to have regard to it.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 27:</P>
      <P>In page 15, between lines 45 and 46, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3)  The Director shall, not more than 3 months after the end of each year, present a short report to the Minister of the Director's activities in that year in relation to the performance of the Director's functions under this Act and the Minister shall cause a copy of the report to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas within 2 months of receipt of it.</P>
      <P>(4)  The Director shall furnish to the Minister such information regarding the performance of the Director's functions under this Act as the Minister may from time to time require.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>It is not clear, but I will not re-open the question, how the amendment did not qualify under the normal procedures because I thought it was raised on Committee Stage.  However, it must not have been raised properly.  I distinctly remember the discussion about how we would monitor the performance of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought so too, but let us not invite procedural problems.  The question is how we measure the performance of the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs in terms of implementing, overseeing and supervising the provisions of the Bill.  On Committee Stage I emphasised the importance of the Director of Consumer Affairs reporting to the Minister and the Houses of the Oireachtas on an annual <Col N="1383" /> basis on the many and varied tasks which this legislation will require him to perform.  The amendments proposed are designed to achieve these objectives.  To avoid any delay, strict timetables are being stipulated in my amendment for the presentation of these reports to me and, after that, their being laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The Director's present reporting obligations under section 12 of the Consumer Information Act, 1978, will be aligned with the present provisions and form an amendment later on Report Stage.</P>
      <P>This is designed to give the Director a mechanism whereby he can report to the Minister who in turn, can report to the House on the performance of the Bill.  The Minister might require information on a particular aspect at any given time, and under subsection (4) the Director is obliged to furnish him with such information as he requires from time to time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am puzzled because I have a clear recollection that this was accepted on Committee Stage and the Minister is also of that opinion.  This is one of the amendments to which I gave assent and why it has to be produced again now I cannot quite make out.  It is right and proper that the Director of Consumer Affairs should put forward his report on how people have been affected by the Bill and gained by it. The arrangements proposed are proper. I am puzzled but, in the interests of getting the Bill through, I see no point in labouring the issue.  I was in favour of it last May and I am still in favour of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of laying a copy of the report before each House of the Oireachtas, these are fine words; it is as if someone comes in solemnly and places a report on the table and we all gaze at it.  As we all know, reports are placed in the Library and one has to poke about to find them.  As this Bill is so important, we should debate the reports of the Director of Consumer Affairs on the year's activity during which he will conduct a nationwide tour, <Col N="1384" /> organise information seminars and devise colourful explanatory leaflets.  In the first year two consumer offices will be set up in Cork and, I think, Limerick.</P>
    <P>My second point relates to education. It struck me when the Minister of State mentioned that Mr. Fagan and his officials will travel throughout the country that there is a need to make consumers aware of their rights.  This is a major task.  Legislation, regulations, seminars, leaflets, booklets and reports only form part of the overall picture; we need to make young people aware of their rights from the very beginning that they do not have to beg or be submissive in seeking information, that they have the right to receive information about financial institutions, and, if they do not receive it, that they have the right to complain.</P>
    <P>Each one of us is guilty when the waiter in a restaurant asks loudly if everything is all right, of saying submissively that it is, even though the meal was rotten or cold, simply because we do not want to cause a fuss.  As a young girl I was embarrassed and wanted to run away and hide behind the coats when my mother complained at Clerys or some other store.  I thought she was making an exhibition of herself; she was not, rather she was getting value for money.  Because she had been reared in rural Ireland in straitened circumstances she valued every penny and watched what she spent and so did not buy blindly.</P>
    <P>I had preliminary discussions with Peter Prendergast of the European Commission Office and proposed that whoever had responsibility for consumer affairs should adopt education as a theme when Ireland holds the Presidency of the European Union during the second half of 1996 and should use the special funds made available to the country which holds the Presidency to introduce a nationwide programme to make consumers aware of their rights.  I urge the Minister of State, if he has a good relationship with the Minister for Education to encourage her to introduce such an awareness programme, perhaps in the civics class, to make <Col N="1385" /> young people aware of their rights to eliminate our craven characteristics when paying for something.  When buying a product on credit people are usually so glad to receive the loan that they fall on their knees and thank people instead of saying &ldquo;I am paying for this, what does it cost?&rdquo; When I wrote to the Minister for Education about this matter she did not take any great interest in it.  Perhaps the Minister of State will be more open to persuasion and now that he has been beatified he will have a clear opportunity to use his sanctity to ensure that the rights of consumers become a tenet of education.</P>

      <NameTxt>Kathleen Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Knowing that Deputy O'Rourke is a practical woman I find it hard to believe she did not agree to insert this provision.  It seems obvious it should be included.  It is essential to monitor the operation of the legislation.  To a great extent, we will depend on the public making complaints and the Government responding to them and this appears to be an excellent mechanism.</P>
      <P>I assume that the report will be published in the same way as the report of the Ombudsman and will be the subject of debate not just in Dáil Éireann but in the public arena.  Only by adopting this course will we discover if legislation needs to be amended if difficulties are being encountered with and how we should police it.  I hope the person who will have responsibility to address any difficulties identified will be the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte who is doing an excellent job.</P>
      <P>The value of Committee Stage debate has been highlighted in the contributions of members of the Opposition who have studied the legislation in depth and identified loopholes and areas where the Bill needs to be strengthened.  This proves that the system works to a great extent.  Perhaps we should&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I welcome this amendment.  It is important that there is a friendly atmosphere in the consumer offices to encourage people to make complaints.  They should also be user friendly.  Laying a report before the House does not mean much to the public. It is just another report but by law we must do it that way.  We are here to help the consumer and to encourage the consumer to defend his or her position. Many consumers are shy people who may be in difficulty and, for that reason, we must have some mechanism in place that will encourage those people to avail of this facility.  I welcome the regionalisation of the consumer offices, particularly the office in Cork.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1388" /> On the question of Dáil reform, there is a committee of the House appropriate to the area.  I cannot see why the Director of Consumer Affairs should not be invited to present herself before that committee after a reasonable period.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>He would welcome that opportunity because he is someone who takes a passionate interest in his work, who has an encyclopaedic knowledge of consumer affairs and who has shown himself &mdash; before this Bill is even enacted &mdash; to be teeing up his in-house procedures in order to implement it.  It is unfortunate that reports come into this House, albeit late, are laid in the Library and are never debated on the floor of the House.  One of the reasons is that they are brought before the House at a late stage.  The practice up to now, in the case of the Director of Consumer Affairs, has not been any different; his reports have been presented to the House approximately a year and a half late.  The requirement in this amendment is that he would report within three months of the end of the year.  That would make the matters that he is seized of topical and, therefore, may provide an added impetus for the House to discuss his annual report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There may well be cases under subsection (4) where the Opposition, for example, may demand of the Minister of the day that some particular aspect of the Bill be invoked to cause the director to investigate.  In that case, the director can do so and must report to the Minister. This is a fairly significant section that gives us the opportunity to assess the work of the director and monitor the performance of the Bill, which is breaking new ground.  Irish consumers, as Deputy O'Rourke says, are not particularly assertive for various reasons; I believe they are becoming more assertive.  With some of the pressures that are being brought to bear as this Bill goes through the House, and Deputies are subjected to high powered <Col N="1389" /> representations on some aspects of it, one would get the impression that it will be the end of civilisation as we know it if certain sections are enacted.  I am reluctant to believe that that will be the case.  I do not think the sky will fall if we proceed but, if it does, we can monitor the position and this section will help us.  I agree with Deputy O'Rourke that there is a huge education task involved.  It is not enough for us to enact legislation that confers additional rights on consumers if we cannot convey that information to the consumer.  That will involve a massive education programme. I am not sufficiently familiar with education to know whether this is provided for in the civics course, for example.</P>

      <P>Finally, Deputy O'Rourke has so frequently stitched into the record that there will be an office in Athlone that it would make it very difficult for me &mdash; not that it would ever cross my mind &mdash; to transfer that office from Athlone to another area.</P>

      <P>This amendment seeks to amend subsection (6) and to insert after &ldquo;District Court&rdquo; the phrase &ldquo;under subsection (9)&rdquo;.  Subsection (9) provides that a person shall not obstruct or interfere with an authorised officer in the exercise of his powers under this Bill or give to an authorised officer information which is false or misleading.  In other words, a decision on subsection (6) must be made on the basis of whether there is permission to enter a private dwelling as provided for and as protected under subsection (9).</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 29 seeks to insert a new subsection.  It sets out the specific terms under which an authorised officer may enter a premises.  Amendment No. 30 states:</P>
      <P>In page 17, between lines 49 and 50, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(9)  If a judge of the District Court is satisfied on the sworn information of an authorised officer that there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that there is information required by an authorised officer under this section held on any premises or any part of any premises, the judge may issue a warrant authorising an authorised officer, accompanied by other authorised officers, at any time or times within one month from the date of issue of the warrant, on production if so requested of the warrant, to enter, if need be by reasonable force, and exercise all or any of the powers conferred on an authorised officer under subsection (5).&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(3)  The Director shall, from time to time, publish guidelines to explain the method of calculation of APR under this Act.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment seeks to insert a new subsection.  I dealt with this matter at some length this morning.  The amendment provides that the director shall <Col N="1394" /> publish guidelines to explain the method of calculation of APR, giving further expression to my intention that the term should be easily understood by all persons.  To some extent it is retracing the ground already covered. To go back to the point made by Deputy O'Rourke about public awareness, public education and so on, it is right to require the Director from time to time to publish guidelines to explain the method of calculation of APR.</P>
    <P>Colleagues on all sides of the House agree that it is not readily understood by consumers and that it would greatly help the process if a uniform method of calculation was agreed.  We should translate that calculation, which is a mathematical one, into words that the ordinary consumer can understand when choosing products on sale so the same APR must be applied by every company.  Therefore, the consumer would know they are comparing like with like and can make up their minds on that basis.  The Director is being required to publish this from time to time &mdash; the situation may change for whatever reason &mdash; to bring afresh to the attention of the public the method of calculation of APR.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I remain highly sceptical that APR is ever going to be understood by the ordinary punter.  Regardless of the enthusiasm and vigour of the Director of Consumer Affairs, Mr. Fagan, the concept of APR is very difficult to explain to ordinary consumers. Last week and this morning we had a detailed discussion on APR and I am still none the wiser of what APR effectively means.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment seeks to apply the detailed explanation of APR in a general sense to APR under the terms of this Bill and that the Director of Consumer Affairs must from time to time issue guidelines to explain the method of calculation of APR under this Bill. We await those guidelines with great interest.  If this amendment will give the Director of Consumer Affairs some divine guidance as to what APR means and <Col N="1395" /> he can publish the information on a regular basis, it will be quite useful.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this amendment as there is a mystique attached to APR.  One can draw comparisons between the different APRs in the advertisements of the various financial institutions.  Will the Minister clarify what is meant by the phrase &ldquo;from time to time&rdquo; in this amendment?  When the Bill is finally enacted does the Minister envisage that one of the first exercises of the Director of Consumer Affairs would be to try to clarify for the public the meaning of APR?  It is stated that if the guidelines change for APR there is a further necessity to clarify the situation. Would the Minister envisage that the Director of Consumer Affairs would do so initially on publication of the Bill and then six months, 12 months and 18 months later?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>We seem to be agreed that understanding the concept of APR is fundamental to the Bill.  Members, as well as the public, have convinced themselves that they cannot understand this concept and, therefore, pass over it.  It is critically and centrally important to understand it if we are to change the attitudes of consumers because if they conclude that they cannot figure out what the financial institutions are offering them, they are at a serious disadvantage. There are any number of examples.  I understand the intention where we started from, that is the European directive was to have a uniform APR across the European Union. However, any of the Sunday newspapers from Britain or here show the variations in advertisements in terms of how this is communicated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I have in mind is that the Director, apart from the critical question of the method of calculation could express the APR in terms of how many pounds in a thousand so that people would know exactly where they stood.  Deputy Finucane asked if I envisaged that the <Col N="1396" /> Director of Consumer Affairs would publish an explanation of the APR immediately on enactment of the Bill and the answer is &ldquo;yes&rdquo;.  I envisage that as his first act he will publish an intelligible, simple, at least as simple as you can make the concept, message and promulgate it as his definition and his understanding of the method of calculation of APR.  That is critical.  I believe that the Director of Consumer Affairs sees it in that light and he will recognise the central importance of it.  It seems to me that he could publish it annually.  It goes back to the question as to how we communicate what we have enacted in this House.</P>
    <P>We, and the Director of Consumer Affairs, will have to work at communicating a single true APR to the public. If we can give that concept expression in simple language so much the better. For example, in terms of defining it, it could read: the true rate of interest is the rate of discount expressed in annual percentage terms that when applied to the total sum of repayments made on the loan over its lifetime equates that amount to the original value of the loan, taking account of the amounts, timing and frequency of the debiting of instalments of amounts due for repayment and crediting of repayments made to the running accounts of the borrower.  It is a very difficult concept.  Let us look at the savings side &mdash; a financial institution, in this case An Post, is running advertisements &mdash; do not hold me to the figures &mdash; offering 40 per cent if one leaves their money in for three years or whatever it is.  That simple advertising bauble is misleading.</P>

    <P>This amendment relates to line 11 on page 22 where the reference should include section 100 (1).  This would make it a summary offence rather than an indictable one.  Line 21 on page 22 would have the effect of deleting section 100 (1) and the word &ldquo;or&rdquo;.  This is to provide for a summary offence in regard to a person or persons engaged in the business of mortgage intermediary without authorisation.  Contravention of this requirement was originally an indictable offence but, for reasons of consistency with the offence raised in respect of credit intermediaries, it is being changed to a summary offence.  It is linked to an earlier amendment and deletes the reference to section 100 (1) from the list of indictable offences.  In other words, in the case of a credit intermediary it was a summary offence so I do not see how it should be an indictable offence in the case of a mortgage intermediary.  I am seeking to make them compatible.</P>

The Minister may review the matter after 12 months and he is wise to make it a summary rather than an indictable offence.</P>

      <P>We had an argument this morning on an earlier amendment about the word &ldquo;purports&rdquo;.  Deputy Lynch became ecstatic about the wonderful work achieved by deleting the word &ldquo;purports&rdquo; and substituting it with, as far as I recall, the simpler word &ldquo;offers&rdquo;.  These amendments relate to the deletion of the words &ldquo;an offence under&rdquo; and their substitution by the word &ldquo;contravening&rdquo;.  I cannot see how that makes the Bill more open to anybody. While the Minister was speaking, I sniggered and said to myself <i>plus ca change, plus ca la même chose</i>.  The Attorney General could not keep his pokey nose out of this Bill and I presume the new Attorney General must have an equally pokey nose because, despite the best efforts of our parliamentary draftsman and officials, the Attorney General appears to have a fetish about scrutinising every word and decides that the words in this section have to be changed.  It reminds me of some character in <i>Alice in Wonderland</i> who asked, &ldquo;why?&rdquo; and the other character replied &ldquo;because I said so&rdquo;. Having regard to the recent change of Ministers, Governments, coalitions, honey pots, Attorneys General and so on, it is funny that the new Attorney General wants these changes because he says so.  I am not going to enter into an argument about these amendments at this hour but they open one's eyes to how &ldquo;official dum&rdquo; and &ldquo;official dee&rdquo; get on; they will get their way.

      <P>Deputy O'Rourke's point was well made.  She referred to Deputy Lynch who said that perhaps it is healthy for Members to spend some time in Opposition before they become Ministers.  Similarly it is healthy for those who have had the honour of serving as Ministers of State to spend some time in Opposition to see the other side of the coin.  Deputy O'Rourke made a straightforward point that nothing changes for those who serve the Ministers. The Minister was honest enough to say he was not sure what all this was about, but that it makes better law.  It was refreshingly honest of him to say that.  I support the point made by my colleague.  Perhaps it would be appropriate for this Minister or any Minister &mdash; I appreciate it is a complex Bill &mdash; not to take the pat answer that such amendments make better law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a lay person, the words &ldquo;contravene&rdquo; and &ldquo;does not apply with&rdquo; mean the same.  The lesson to be learned from this exercise regarding protecting the consumer is that legislation should contain user friendly language.  Deputy O'Rourke, and others, referred to the need to educate people to make them more forceful about making complaints and I support that.  One of the areas for which I had responsibility when I was Minister of State was European affairs and the Communicating Europe initiative and we undertook some work to get the message effectively across.  I hope the Government will pursue that agenda also.  The lesson to be learned regarding the language in legislation is that we should not abide by old traditions for the sake of legal pettiness and include certain language for which there was a <Col N="1404" /> precedent.  The point was well made by my colleague whom I support.</P>

      <P>Some interesting points have arisen from what appears to be a straightforward textual amendment.  To the lay person sections of legislation can appear gobbledegook, but the fact that they appear so does not mean they are wrong.  It is difficult to give expression in legal terms to some concepts and at the same time be simple.  That is precisely where the role of the Director of Consumer Affairs comes into play.  It is correct for the parliamentary draftsman to make corrections as he sees fit where the wording is sloppy, imprecise or whatever.  However, the Director of Consumer Affairs has a different task, that of managing to communicate in a simple intelligible form to the consumer. They are two distinct roles.  I am sure the present Attorney General would not thank me if I said I had formed the view he is a man with a safe pair of hands because in the case of the last Attorney General about whom that was said &mdash; perhaps it was an epithet that was earned, depending on one's point of view.</P>

It is not every Attorney General who has managed to switch power in the House in the course of the lifetime of a Parliament without a general election, for which the former Attorney General has earned his footnote in history. However irksome it is for us legislators that these things are picked up.  I sometimes wonder if there were, say, ten stages to processing a Bill rather than five whether we would continue to have these textual type&mdash;&mdash;</P>

While the process may be irksome, I hope the Bill will be all the better for it.</P>
      <P>These tidying up amendments are no more than that; in the view of the parliamentary draftsman they constitute a more economic expression of the law.  It is the separate, different and distinct task of the Director of Consumer Affairs to translate that into language that the ordinary man and woman in the street can understand.</P>

      <P>In page 27, to delete lines 33 to 39, and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(b)  contain a statement that the consumer&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I refer Deputies to Part III which deals with the form and content of credit agreements.  I think Deputy O'Rourke promised to table an amendment on Report Stage which is why this one has been tabled.  This is a redraft of the provisions regarding the right of a consumer to a ten-day cooling off period; the intent is not changed in any way, merely the wording.  On Committee Stage we all agreed that this was one of the attractive provisions of this Bill in that, if and when one was entering into a credit agreement, one would have ten days in which to reflect on whether or not to proceed.  This subsection merely specifies how a consumer can secure that protection &mdash; the consumer can walk away from the agreement, without penalty, provided he or she gives written notice to this effect to the creditor <Col N="1407" /> within a period of ten days.  In all the circumstances that is reasonable.  The consumer's explicit right is enshrined in the Bill.  To paraphrase the old adage &mdash;&ldquo;marry in haste, repent at leisure&rdquo;&mdash; in this case &ldquo;enter into a credit agreement in haste&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>My colleague, the Minister for Equality and Law Reform, is dealing with that possibility.  While I am not sure it would be covered by the provisions of this Bill, there are certain circumstances in which he can be legally jettisoned, of course, assuming that Deputy O'Rourke brings the remainder of her great party with her.  In the meantime, we are restricted to consideration of this Bill which affords the consumer ten days protection if a creditor is given written notice.  The intent is not in any way to diminish the right or change its import but merely to change the wording.</P>

      <P>This is very serious. If a person makes a substantial agreement with a trader or a business person and ten days later withdraws from that agreement it could result in extra costs for the business person.  Insincere agreements made over a pint or several pints could put a business person in serious <Col N="1408" /> difficulty.  What protection is provided for the business person who does not accept the breaking of the agreement? The Bill must protect both sides.  We are here to legislate in an even handed and honourable fashion.  A small firm, business or sole trader could easily be put out of business by the availability of that provision.  He may order an item from a trader who would not accept a cancellation of the order.  He could be left with an item on his shelf valued at say £10,000 due to agreement being withdrawn. A person who may be a valuable asset to the community could be put out of business.  I would like to think we were even handed in our approach to the legislation.</P>

The ten day period in which an agreement may be withdrawn applies across the board so that no person is put at a competitive disadvantage.  Having regard to the type of agreement we are talking about, provided everybody is playing on the same level playing pitch, I cannot see how one creditor would be disadvantaged since the same rule applies for all.</P>

    <P>That Dáil Éireann calls on the Minister for Education to bring forward a comprehensive package of measures to ensure equity for all students attending third-level education courses in this country and specifically calls on the Minister to</P>

    <P>&mdash;increase the rates of student maintenance grants under the higher education grants scheme,</P>
    <P>&mdash;provide equal treatment for evening students in respect of fees, grants and access to facilities,</P>

    <P>&mdash;introduce specific measures to assist women returning to higher education</P>
    <P>and furthermore calls on the Minister to prepare a strategic plan for the future development of third-level education which would ensure that extra places and adequate facilities are provided to accommodate the projected expansion in third-level enrolments.</P>

    <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann commends the Government decision to abolish tuition fees for undergraduate students and for Post-Leaving Certificate students as the first response to the commitment given in the A Government of Renewal policy document that there will be new support mechanisms to increase participation by third level students from low-income backgrounds, including the abolition of third-level fees, a comprehensive reform of the Higher Education Grants Scheme, the introduction of support for students on Post-Leaving Certificate courses and an increase in the number of third level places.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share time with Deputy O'Keeffe.  I congratulate our Front Bench spokesperson, Deputy Martin, for tabling this comprehensive motion.  I wish to refer specifically to the question of equality and access to education, not only for existing but future students.</P>
      <P>During a Dáil debate on the Mayo regional technical college in March 1993 the Minister announced the setting up of a study group to report on the need for additional third level places up to the year 2010.  The study group presumably took into account the Minister's remarks in her speech to the Dáil on 23 March, particularly the six items she claimed must underpin future decisions on investments in higher education, one of which was the contribution such investment would make to regional development and overall economic welfare.</P>
      <P>To survive, a county like Mayo needs investment to fuel economic growth and job creation and this depends mainly on having a highly qualified workforce in the area.  Population trends in towns with regional technical colleges showed growth rates in population from 18 per cent to 93 per cent between 1971 and 1991, the growth rate in Waterford was 18 per cent while in Letterkenny it was 93 per cent.  Counties with regional technical colleges are considerably smaller in landmass size than Mayo.  For example, Louth is only 15 per cent of the size of Mayo while Counties Westmeath, Sligo and Waterford are each approximately 35 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mayo is the third largest county and this simple statement of fact could be easily disregarded as yet another irrelevant statistic.  However, when viewed against the size of counties in which regional colleges are located its significance and the scale of the inequality is startling.  The entire cumulative area of Counties Louth, Carlow, Sligo and Westmeath &mdash; all with fully fledged independent regional technical colleges <Col N="1413" />&mdash; is substantially less than that of County Mayo.  If County Waterford were included the size of the combined areas would only be a little more than that of County Mayo.</P>
    <P>The technical working group's report published in January 1995 recommended against the establishment of a full regional technical college in County Mayo.  The Programme for Government does not contain a commitment in that regard, but it contains a commitment to provide third level institutions in Dún Laoghaire and Thurles.  I call on the Government to formally reject immediately the findings of the technical group's report.  This should not present a difficulty as it has already discredited the report by overruling its findings on Finglas and Thurles.  The Minister, Deputy Kenny &mdash; and Deputy Ring &mdash; both representatives of Mayo, stated publicly that the study group's findings will be rejected.</P>
    <P>The findings of the technical group's report are based on projected numbers and are fundamentally flawed because the group assumes students come only from within a regional technical college's catchment area, ignoring the reality in the case of many regional technical colleges.  For example, less than 40 per cent of the student population in Waterford, Galway and Letterkenny come from within their respective areas.  The technical group does not allow for the fact that new courses developed in the Castlebar campus will be innovative and multidisciplinary and are not likely to impact on existing regional technical colleges in the region as they will attract students from other areas and create new markets.</P>
    <P>As student population projections indicate an increase of 30,000 additional places between now and the year 2010 all locations and facilities must be assessed with a view to providing them. Castlebar is in an ideal position to provide those places since it already has space which it can expand into at minimal cost.  Its existing 3,900 square metres was refurbished at approximately half the cost of an equivalent <Col N="1414" /> new building while the cost of developing the remaining space available on the campus would be half that again because much of the necessary work &mdash; roofing, services and so on &mdash; has been done.</P>
    <P>A Government decision to provide sufficient funds in the 1996 budget to allow work to proceed on the next phase will be required in due course and I ask the Minister to give permission, when sought, to allow a feasibility study for the completion of phase two of the development to be carried out.  All the academic planning has been undertaken.</P>
    <P>One is conscious, however, of an irony when reading the technical group's report.  If County Mayo students had demonstrated a lack of interest in third level education in recent years and had low levels of uptake similar to other regions there would now be, on the reasoning used in the report, a strong case for a Mayo regional technical college.</P>

      <P>The education grant scheme is a case in point.  She chose to ignore the Clancy report and many others.  The tunnel vision displayed gave no forethought to the consequences of her decision, for example, what would happen to universities, the regional technical colleges and their funding.  She will go down in history as the Minister <Col N="1415" /> who pulled the financial rug from under the feet of third level institutions and in doing so replicated the dilemma that has faced local authorities for many years, namely, a lack of Exchequer funding. She will certainly be known as the Minister who made access to third level education for the less well-off in our society more costly and practically impossible. We have not received a commitment from either the Taoiseach or the Minister that when additional students take up third level education the Exchequer will ensure the colleges are properly funded.</P>
      <P>The Minister in the smoked salmon socialist mould pandered to the rich by giving them a blank cheque in respect of entry to third level institutions.  One could be a millionaire, but not benefit from such education.</P>
      <P>The Minister chose to ignore students on PLC courses making it more costly for them to undertake such courses than an enrolled student at a regional college, even though research has shown that a high percentage of those students come from less well off families.  She has also thrown the regional colleges in particular into disarray with her diktats, particularly on the curtailment of degrees.  She has paid scant regard to the provision of additional places to meet the demand of students for more third level places and has added to student stress and trauma because of the rat-race they face in looking for entry to third level colleges.</P>
      <P>Why has the Minister not shown initiative in places like Cork, and demanded out-centres to ease the accommodation problem?  Why has she not upgraded the status of those regional colleges which can, by the excellence of their degrees, add significantly to research and development which would add to the potential of job creation in our economy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's performances could be categorised by that well known saying &mdash; the longest tree from foot to crown, ideas flow up and vetoes down.  We have seen many vetoes from this Minister. <Col N="1416" /> She attends conferences and makes speeches but, for some reason or other, she has not yet developed the ability to listen to what people say about framing an overall ambitious plan for education in the 2000s.</P>

      <P>Go raibh maith agat. Nuair a chonaic mé an rún seo an chéad uair bhí sé deacair dom mo shúile a chreidiúint.  Tá gach uile shaghas rud istigh anseo.  Gach aon deasmaoineamh, gach aon mhilséan i gcúrsaí oideachais ag an tríú leibhéal gur féidir a shamhlú, tá sé istigh anseo.  Ach níl aon rian ar an rún seo gur fhiafraigh an triúr Teachta a chuir a gcuid ainmneacha leis an rún cad é an costas a bheadh ar na rudaí atá istigh anseo, cén am a thógfadh sé iad a chur i gcrích nó cén ord in a gcuirfí i gcrích iad.  Níl aon slacht nó eagar ar an rún seo.  Níl ann ach liosta milseán sa chóras oideachais atá ag teastáil ó na Teachtaí sin thall.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Agus tá sé i bhfad níos greannmhara ná sin mar bhí mé ag iarraidh m'aigne a chaitheamh siar agus smaoineamh ar chuala mé nó an bhfaca mé aon fhianaise ar chor ar bith go raibh na rudaí seo ar intinn ag muintir Fhianna Fáil le dhá bhliain go leith anuas go dtí deireadh na bliana seo caite.  Níl aon rian de sin le feiscint.  Níl anseo ach pleidhcíocht polaitiúil. Tá siad tar éis bailiúchán breá milseán a chur isteach sa mhála anseo agus tá siad ag iarraidh iad a chur amach anois os comhair an phobail chun cur-i-gcéill a dhéanamh gur féidir na rudaí seo go léir a dhéanamh anois díreach agus gan aon cheist a chur faoin gcostas. Seo an páirtí go bhfuil a n-urlabhraí Airgeadais, an Teachta McCreevy, ag gabháil timpeall agus ag rá go bhfuil sé buartha faoi chaiteachas an Rialtais. Agus sin an páirtí atá ag cur i gcoinne airgead a dhíol le mná a raibh airgead <Col N="1417" /> coimeádta siar orthu le blianta anuas sa chóras leasa shóisialaigh.  Tá siad ag gearán faoin airgead sin a chaitheamh ar na mná seo atá i dteideal an t-airgead seo a fháil.  Agus fós tá siad ag cur na milseáin seo os ár gcomhair agus ag rá gur cóir na rudaí seo a dhéanamh anois díreach, láithreach bonn.</P>
    <P>Ní féidir aon chreidiúint a thabhairt dó sin.  Caithfidh mé a rá go bhfuil díomá orm gur chuir an Teachta Ní Chochláin, mar shampla, a h-ainm lena leithéid de rud.  Cheap mé go raibh mianach agus stuif i bhfad níos fearr ná sin inti, agus creidim go bhfuil.  Fiú an Teachta Flood, cheap mé go raibh tuiscint i bhfad níos fearr aige sin ar chúrsaí caiteachais.  Ní thógaim ar an Teachta Martin é.  Sin fear óg atá ag iarraidh &mdash; mar a deirtear sa Mafia &mdash; a chuid chnámha a dhéanamh agus a ainm a chur in airde.  Ach ba chóir dó a chuimhneamh agus coimeád i gcuimhne nach ionann gleo agus substaint i gcoitinne.  Ní hionann gleo agus polasaí oideachais.  Ní hionann gleo agus teacht i gcabhair ar an daoine atá sa chás is measa.  Dá mbeinnse ag breathnú ar na rudaí seo go léir agus tá sé cinnte gur fiú iad a dhéanamh diaidh ar ndiaidh d'fhiafróinn díom fein cad é an t-ord a chuirfinn ar na rudaí seo, agus freisin cad é an costas a bheadh ag gabháil leo. Bheinn ar aon intinn le cuid de Theachtaí Fhianna Fáil nuair a deir siad go mb'fhearr an rud é an t-airgead atá an Rialtas le caitheamh chun deireadh a chur leis na fiacha a chaitheamh ar chuid de na rudaí a luaigh mé.  Ach ní hé sin atá á mholadh acu.</P>
    <P>Feicim go bhfuil aon, dó, trí, ceithre, cúig, sé, seacht, ocht moltaí istigh anseo agus gan aon ord curtha leo.  Cad é an t-ord a chuirfinnse féin leo?  Do thosnóinn, déarfainn, le rud éigin a dhéanamh faoin táirseach ioncaim atá ag baint leis na deontais do na fiacha.  Ar ndóigh sin rud atá i gceist anois ag an Rialtas.  Cuirfear deireadh leis na fiacha an bhliain seo chugainn.  Beidh siad ina leath ag deireadh na bliana seo agus beidh deireadh leo ar fad an bhliain seo chugainn. Mar sin tá rud éigin ar siúl sa mhéid a bhaineann sé leis sin.  Anois, cad a <Col N="1418" /> dhéanfainn in a dhiaidh sin?  Ceapaim go mbeadh sé i bhfad níos tábhachtaí ná aon cheann eile de na rudaí atá anseo gabháil ar aghaidh chun rud éigin a dhéanamh chun teacht i gcabhair ar na daoine a bhfuil deacracht acu sa mhéid a bhaineann leis na deontais cothabhála. Ceapaim go bhfuil cuid mhaith de na Teachtaí thall ar aon intinn liom go bhfuil sé níos tábhachtaí anois airgead sa bhreis a chur isteach sna deontais sin ná aon rud eile a dhéanamh mar go bhfuil deacracht ag daoine a gcuid chlann a choimeád ar an ollscoil má tá cónaí ortha amach cuid mhaith ón mbaile ina bhfuil an ollscoil.  Do chuirfinn Uimhir a hAon air sin.  Ansin bheinn ag smaoineamh ar na rudaí eile atá ar an liosta seo.  An dara ceann a thógfainn amach as an liosta ná teacht i gcabhair ar na hinstitiúidí eile agus an réimeas céanna a chur i bhfeidhm sna hinstitiúidí tríú leibhéal eile nach bhfuil clúdaithe sna scéimeanna atá againn faoi láthair.</P>
    <P>Ach bheadh ceist agam.  Níl a fhios agam an mbeinn ag sodar i ndiaidh an Pontifical University, mar shampla, mar ceapaim gur cóir don Eaglais fónamh a dhéanamh ar a chuid gnó féin.  Ní bhéinn chomh lámh-oscailte is a bheadh an Teachta Martin mar go bhfuil daoine eile ann a bhfuil cabhair i bhfad níos mó de dhith orthu ná mar atá ar an Pontifical University, cuir i gcás, Institiúid Mháthair Dé agus tá fíor-cheist faoi sin mar go bhfuil éileamh sna scoileanna ar na céimeanna ón institiúid sin.</P>
    <P>Cad é an tríú ceann ar an liosta seo a thógfainn amach?  Bheadh fonn ormsa teacht i gcabhair ar na daltaí atá ag gabháil le cúrsaí iar-Ardteiste, mar go bhfuil siad sin i bponc i bhfad níos measa ná cuid eile de na daoine anseo.</P>
    <P>Sin ord ar na rudaí seo ach ní hé sin atá i gceist ag an bhFreasúra anseo.  Ní theastaíonn ón bhFreasúra ach gleo a dhéanamh chun a chur i gcéill go bhfuil siad ag smaoineamh ar na daoine sin agus go bhfuil siad buartha futhu.  Dá mbeidís buartha i gceart do chuirfidís ord nó eagar éigin orthu seo agus in ionad ocht gcinn de phointí a bheith istigh sa liosta seo bheadh ceann amháin nó dhá cheann go bhféadfadh siad a <Col N="1419" /> mhaoímh a bheadh indéanta i mbliana nó an bhliain seo chugainn.  Ansin bheadh tairiscint fhiúntach os ár gcomhair amach.  Caithfidh mé a rá, agus ní haon rún é seo, nach bhfuilim ró-thógtha leis an leasú atá curtha ar aghaidh ag an Aire ach tá an argóint sin thart. Feicim go bhfuil sé i gceist ag an bPáirti Daonlathach &mdash; an Daonlathas Deis mar a thabharfaí orthu &mdash; teacht agus cuntas de Buitléir a chur i bhfeidhm go tobann agus go lán anois díreach.  Níl sin réadúil ar chor ar bith.  Mar shampla, sa mhéid a bhaineann le mature students tá an dá pháirtí ansin ag iarraidh go gcaithfí leo ar an dul céanna is a chaitear leis na daltaí atá ann faoi láthair.  Tá sin amaideach.  Tá mo bhean chéile féin tar éis trí bliana go leith a chaitheamh ar an ollscoil.  Dá mbeadh a ghuí ag de Buitléir bheadh sé an-mhaith domsa mar go mbeadh £2,000 sa bhliain sábháilte againn le ceithre bliana.  Ach ní bheadh sin cóir mar tá daoine eile ann a bhfuil gá i bhfad níos mó acu leis an airgead a chaithfí ormsa sa treo sin.</P>
    <P>Mar sin ceapaim má tá sé faoin bhFreasúra teacht agus rudaí fónta a dhéanamh sa Teach seo ní mór scagadh níos mó agus níos mine a dhéanamh ar na tairiscintí a thagann os ár gcomhair agus ord éigin a chur orthu seachas an saghas bailiúchán milseán atá againn anseo.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Having listened to Deputy O'Keeffe I wonder if he wants to spend all the money in the kitty on third level education.  At the other extreme we read in the newspapers today that the loony commentator, Dr. Ed Walsh, wants to privatise the system. He should recognise that if a substantial amount of money was not provided for third level it would virtually cease to exist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's amendment and I am disappointed that Deputy Martin and his colleagues tabled this motion.  It seems it is a case of sour grapes, particularly when Deputy Martin issued a statement to the press welcoming this idea when it was first <Col N="1420" /> mooted last autumn.  He has now turned in the opposite direction and is being hypocritical.  It seems he has suddenly discovered there is such a thing as third level education and wants every single item to be dealt with immediately.  He should recognise that an historic decision has been made to abolish tuition fees which ranks alongside the equally historic decision by his own party in 1968 to abolish fees at second level which had an enormous psychological impact and led to a huge increase in the numbers attending.  This decision will have a similar effect.</P>
    <P>The previous Government made a substantial contribution in underpinning primary and second level education. The Deputy should recognise its positive achievements and stop whinging.  In recent years at primary and second level the pupil-teacher ratio has been substantially reduced; remedial and home-school-liasion teachers have been appointed and capitation grants increased.  In the past few days at the opening of a new school Archbishop Connell indicated publicly that this grant had been increased each year the Minister has been in office.  This seldom happened previously.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not true.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Caretakers and secretaries and extra career guidance teachers have been appointed while a transition year and the applied leaving certificate have been provided for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is now undertaking a major initiative at third level which should be recognised.  The abolition of fees will be revenue neutral for the Exchequer.  In addition, the de Buitléir report, which addresses the question of maintenance grants, has been published. The number of third level places available has been increased while Irish students studying abroad now qualify for maintenance grants.  Approximately 4,000 students will benefit from this <Col N="1421" /> measure in 1996-97.  Provision has been made for tax relief in respect of approved courses at private colleges.</P>
    <P>For the first time students over the age of 18 in full time education will receive child benefit.  As a consequence many students attending one year PLC courses will benefit.  Greater emphasis should be placed on these courses which are attended by between 16,000 to 18,000 students throughout the country. Approximately 60 per cent of the total of 6,000 to 8,000 attending such courses in Dublin come from outside the area and need maintenance grants.  Successive Governments have ignored this sector which has been provided on the cheap.  The Minister has provided £2 million in recognition of the need for funding.  I am certain she will move forward and provide a larger increase as provided for in the Programme for Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>As a parent, teacher and public representative, I believe that access to education is a fundamental right.  Under Deputy Bhreathnach, the first Labour Party Minister for Education, the education system has been strengthened and developed.  Since taking office in January 1993 she has made the most radical changes since the foundation of the State.  There is change at every level &mdash; primary, second and third level.</P>
      <P>One of the goals was the abolition of third level fees for all participants and she has made much progress in this regard.  In the budget the Minister for Finance signalled that the Government was committed to the introduction of free fees during the next two years.  The fees for third level education will be halved this year and abolished from January 1996.  This is the first significant step in making third level education accessible to all and will give great heart and encouragement to many young people who wish to go to college.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a Labour Deputy, I was proud to see Deputy Bhreathnach prove her critics wrong.  The cynics said that it would cost too much to abolish fees.  With <Col N="1422" /> determination and innovation the Minister proved that it was possible to introduce free fees without bankrupting the State.  Undergraduate fees have been abolished by rerouting existing student support mechanisms, including phasing out income tax covenants relief.  That is a more progressive way of spending taxes in the education system.  The figures show that during the years covenants disproportionately benefited the better off.  The Government's decision to restrict covenant relief will enable tax foregone to be converted into direct expenditure on the abolition of fees. The cost will be small in terms of the overall level of Government spending but the benefits will be immeasurable. Many hard pressed families could not afford to send their children to third level because they were above the income limits for the grants scheme although they were by no means well off.  Because of the huge obstacle that had to be overcome in meeting the fees third level was not an option for their children.</P>
    <P>This initiative will help many families, particularly in the Dublin area.  Dublin already has a much lower participation rate in third level education than most other parts of the country.  Because this measure is aimed at assisting those families on middle incomes, who are by no means well off, and those in the PAYE net, it is a particularly welcome initiative. It signals that education is not the preserve of the wealthy but is becoming increasingly accessible to all.  Of course, I would like very much to see grant support extended to those on PLCs.  I would also like to see assistance provided to those on evening courses but this is an important first step.  We cannot do everything overnight.  There was a Fianna Fáil Minister in the Department of Education for eight years and no progress was made.</P>

      <P>If the opening up of third level education had commenced in 1987 we would now be in a position where there was far greater access.  However, because no progress was made up to recently there are now large numbers of people needing financial support.  This is <Col N="1424" /> an important first step that the Minister has taken in abolishing undergraduate fees.  It removes the important psychological barrier that exists for many people.  People living at home will now be in a position to afford third level education. The obstacle of fees is gone and they will be able to meet the other expenses with help from their parents, part-time jobs, etc.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's publishing of the de Buitléir report.  I would like to see a national debate on the grants system as it currently operates.  The Minister has spoken about her wish to have a Dáil debate on this matter and I would welcome that because, as in the whole area of tax reform, we must have transparency and we in this House must agree on measures to be introduced in order to bring about greater equity in the grants schemes.</P>

      <P>This Government is committed to providing equality of access to education.  Specifically, the Government programme commits us to providing &ldquo;new support mechanisms to increase participation by third level students from low income backgrounds, including the abolition of third level fees; a comprehensive reform of the educational grants scheme; the introduction of support for students on post leaving certificate courses and an increase in the number of third level places&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Democratic Left would argue that none of these measures should be viewed in isolation from the other. Together, they form an equality package which, for the first time will allow us to fulfil the pledge so dearly held by us all, namely, to cherish all the children of the nation equally.  The greatest inequality in our education system as <Col N="1426" /> the Deputies opposite well know, is not at third level but at primary level and, to a lesser extent, at secondary level.  It is well known that in many parts of the country approximately 50 per cent of children leave school without any qualification, let alone a degree.</P>
    <P>Our so-called free system of primary education is anything but free.  It has been estimated that primary education can cost parents in the region of £3,000. Our primary school class sizes continue to be among the highest in Europe.  The ratio in our infant classes is the worst in the OECD.</P>

Yet, for every pound spent on primary education, we are spending £4.41 on third level education. This is an imbalance which, in the OECD, is exceeded only by our poor rivals in Hungary.</P>
      <P>Our primary students are expected to learn in a physical environment which ranges from decrepit to dangerous.  We all know of parents who have had to take their children out of ancient so-called temporary prefab structures for fear of accidents or fires.  Of course, the word &ldquo;temporary&rdquo; under Fianna Fáil Administrations acquired a rather disturbing permanence.

      <P>Democratic Left believes in a bottom up rather than a top down approach.  We believe that access to third level education will remain fundamentally inequitable until all children have equal access to a solid foundation at primary level.  Of course, inequality is relative.  Some primary students are more disadvantaged than others.  Travellers' children and those with other special needs have been ill served by our education system.  For example, the recommendations of the Special Education Review Body remain to be fully implemented.  The provision of remedial teachers continues to be grossly inadequate.  In some sparsely populated areas there is only one remedial teacher serving four to six schools while the recommended number is three.  Indeed, remedial teachers spend more time travelling from school to school in their catchment area than actually teaching.</P>
      <P>I urge the Minister not only to implement the recommendations of the Special Education Review Body but to go beyond the body's mandate and address the whole area of special education, including educational opportunities for gifted children.  This area has been neglected in the past and it should be looked at in a fresh and innovative way.  It is obvious that our primary education system provides an extremely unequal foundation for secondary and third level education.  Those students who manage to negotiate both the educational and the financial hazards of first and second level education often find themselves confronted by a grants system which can only be described as institutionalised inequality.</P>

      <Col N="1428" /> The children of low and middle income PAYE workers stand less chance of getting a maintenance grant than the children of the self-employed and farmers.  Up to now, farmers and the self-employed have been able to artificially depress their incomes for the year on which the grant is being calculated. We are also aware of cases where a farmer, whose child has been deemed eligible for a grant, is in a position to purchase a flat for his son or daughter in one of Dublin's quayside apartment developments.  Lest Deputies opposite say I am engaging in farmer bashing, I am not.  I have no doubt children of small and part-time farmers find it just as difficult to get a grant as do children of low income PAYE workers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>In many cases small farmers have been by-passed by the grant system just as they have been by-passed by Euro funds.  I am referring to the rich ranchers whose children have benefited disproportionately from the grant system and from almost every other service.  It is for this reason I fully endorse the proposal to assess applicants on assets as well as income for the purpose of determining grant eligibility. Even people who receive maintenance grants may in some cases be forced to drop out of college for financial reasons because the grant is inadequate and has been rendered even more so by the abolition of student's dole.  I note Fianna Fáil Deputies are strangely silent on that subject.</P>
      <P>Simply extending availability of maintenance grants without in the long term examining the amount of the grant will not fully address the problem.  Students who depend on grants and whose parents cannot afford to top them up will find themselves in an intolerable financial position.  That will inevitably lead to a drop in academic performance or will force students to take up part-time work which may leave little time for their studies.</P>

      <P>I congratulate my colleague, Deputy Martin, on the quality and coherency of the speech he made last night.  It was an excellent contribution to the debate on education.  I was very surprised by the Minister's response which was very poor; she even lacked belief in it herself.  I would remind Deputy Shortall that the Government was in a very strong budgetary position when it came to office.  Taking into account the extra £30 million from the removal of covenants, the Minister had an opportunity to make major changes.  The motion outlines that although the Minister had choices she flew in the face of equality of treatment, which is what this debate is about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is interesting that Labour Party and Democratic Left speakers failed to deal with the motion and ignored the opportunities available to the Minister in the budget.  In the Minister's speech, as in much of what she has said recently, there is the impression that if she mentions the right buzzwords and uses them in the appropriate sentences, that will convey belief in the marketplace that these aims will be achieved.  For instance, she spoke at great length <Col N="1430" /> about deprivation among socio-economic groups, and it is right to recognise that, but it is extraordinary that her first major change in education, the removal of third level fees, will not benefit those groups.  That is astonishing for a Labour Minister who was lauded some moments ago for her aspirational proposals. Let us judge her on what she has done, which has nothing to do with benefiting those without access to third level education.  It is clear from educational groups that the greatest deterrent to access to third level education is the lack of facilities at a reasonable cost. The vast majority of people have to bear the huge cost of sending their children to different parts of the country&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The location of third level colleges is an essential element in encouraging people from the type of background the Minister purports to represent, to avail of education.  People who live near an institute of education are more inclined to participate in third level education.  The Minister clearly recognised in her speech the contribution of previous Fianna Fáil Ministers. She commended the increase from 23,000 participants in third level education in 1967 to 88,000 in 1993-94.  That did not happen by chance but as a result of the attention given to this area and the contribution and commitment of Fianna Fáil Ministers in the last two decades.  The Minister had the good grace to recognise that contribution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As my time is limited I wish to refer briefly to access in terms of facilities. Many figures have been mentioned <i>vis-á-vis</i> the growth to be expected in future years.  I am deeply concerned that the <Col N="1431" /> leak from the Higher Education Authority steering committee, which appeared in a report by Paul Cullen in <i>The Irish Times</i> of last Saturday, 1 April, is an attempt by vested interest groups to subvert the case for upgrading the Waterford Regional Technical College to institute of technology status. This attempt to dilute the recommendations of the technical working group will be resisted and must be defeated in the interests of Waterford and the whole south-east region.  The report of the technical working group was well received in the south-east because it articulated an independent technical assessment, completion of which we had awaited for more than 25 years.  The report was noted for the fact that it brought together for the first time all the interests in support of the recommendation of the technical group.</P>
    <P>If the report by Paul Cullen in <i>The Irish Times</i> is true it seems the recommendations of the technical working group, which has the resources to independently study the deficiencies in the south-east, are being ignored and the rightful case of the south-east is being submerged.  This will keep certain vested interest groups in other areas of education happy.  This course of action will never be acceptable to me, to Fianna Fáil or to the people of Waterford and the south-east.</P>
    <P>It is interesting that political decisions pre-empted the report of the committee on two of its recommendations relating to Thurles and Dún Laoghaire.  I have no problem with an area making its own case, but considering the crying need for a regional college on the north side of Dublin it is extraordinary the Minister has decided to site the college in Dún Laoghaire.  The Deputy and many of his colleagues know that is an outrageous decision.  Has the steering committee found a way to change the demographic profile and the technical basis for the working group's recommendation? Does the steering committee seriously believe it can fool the people into thinking the region is being looked after by <Col N="1432" /> not upgrading Waterford Regional Technical College to institute of technology status?  There are two types of region here, those with a university and a regional technical college and those with a technical college only.  Waterford, and the south east region, are in the latter category.</P>
    <P>The technical working group recommended a formula for bridging that gap by upgrading Waterford Regional Technical College to an institute of technology. Any attempt by the steering committee to interfere with that recommendation must and will be resisted. The Government parties of Fine Gael, Labour and Democratic Left must support the implementation of that report and resist any attempt by vested interest groups to interfere with those recommendations on third level education. The technical group was independent and was able to take an overview of the national situation, and was different from the steering committee which was comprised of people with a vested interest in third level education, each fighting their own patch with no regard for the overall development of third level education.</P>
    <P>If the Minister is committed she will do a number of things, most of which have been outlined by my colleague, Deputy Martin, but she will certainly have to provide equality of access. Equality of access does not begin by removing fees.  The Minister has to find a way of helping those on low incomes to gain access to third level education. If she does not do that she will have failed in her duty.  She must provide new facilities to do so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith" hpid="Mr. B. Smith Mr. B. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this comprehensive motion tabled by the Fianna Fáil Party on the need to improve access to third level education.  The motion refers specifically to a number of areas where improvement is needed and where a greater equality of opportunity could be created.  Very substantial progress was made in the late 1960s in the provision of education at primary, secondary and <Col N="1433" /> third level.  It is clear from all projections that the third level sector will remain under pressure to meet the rising demand for student places in the coming years.  I understand that the report of the Higher Education Authority steering committee dealt with the need to improve the participation levels of working class and disadvantaged students in higher education.  Surely the follow-on to the equality of opportunity that was established with regard to access to second level education in the 1960s and 1970s should be direct targeting of resources towards the necessary improvement of access for that sector to higher level education.</P>
      <P>The extension of post-leaving certificate courses over the past few years has provided opportunities for students who otherwise would not have gained access to further education.  That opportunity might have been denied to them either through the entry requirements being too high or through lack of funding.  The establishment of post-leaving certificate courses has provided new opportunities and through these courses 17,500 students are pursuing further education courses in 1995.  The rapid and continued expansion in the number of participants on these courses is evidenced by the Minister's projection of 20,000 participants in 1996.  There is a clear and urgent need for the Minister to remove the serious anomaly which denies those students a maintenance grant.  I appeal to the Minister to give this matter urgent consideration and put in place by next September a proper maintenance grant system.  In many ways the PLC courses have eased the pressure on places in third level education institutions. The participants do not deserve to be totally disregarded, as they are when the provision of student grant support is being decided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many of the courses on offer are targeted at the growth areas of the economy and thus the skills to be learned are generally both essential for the economic sectors involved and improve also substantially the employment potential of the student.  As well as being finely <Col N="1434" /> tuned to the market needs of the economy the courses generally correspond with the predominant economic activities of the region.  The courses provided at Cavan college of further studies are very appropriate and complementary to the main employment areas in our region.  The principal, the chief executive officer of the vocational education committee and their colleagues deserve the highest commendation for their foresight and diligence in establishing such a fine college.</P>
    <P>Obviously, greater co-operation can be effected between local industry and colleges providing these courses which would be mutually beneficial and would strengthen the local economy.  I understand that 50 per cent plus of leaving certificate students do not attain the academic requirements for entry to our regional technical colleges or universities and a huge number need further education and training to prepare them for the labour market.  I know from the Cavan college of further studies that approximately 90 per cent of its students obtain employment or go on to further education.  That is an impressive achievement and I urge the Minister to give colleges such as Cavan formal recognition.</P>
    <P>The growth in the number of colleges providing post-leaving certificate courses, and the corresponding growth in the range of courses, is an added impetus to the need to regularise and regulate this section of further education. Centres such as Cavan, which have a proven record and for whose courses there is a strong demand, as is evidenced from higher annual enrolments, should be established on a formal basis.  Allied to the unanswerable case for a centre such as Cavan is the low participation by students from the Border counties in higher education. Regulation of post-leaving certificate courses with regard to proper certification, the provision of courses on a specialised basis and the nomination of centres plus the introduction of a maintenance grant system, will help to eliminate many of the obstacles that restrict <Col N="1435" /> participation in further education.  Proper structures for this whole area are urgently needed.</P>
    <P>I make a direct appeal to the Minister on the serious anomaly in the mature students grant scheme.  I brought a case to the attention of the Minister of a mature student who applied to County Cavan vocational education committee for a grant which was duly approved but when she moved her residence from Cavan to Cork she was awarded the lower or adjacent maintenance grant because she did not live more than 15 miles from the college.  I am sure the Department does not expect her to commute daily from Cavan to Cork.  I am sure that in drafting this scheme the Minister did not intend to cause undue hardship such as in the case I have outlined. The Department officials should rectify this anomaly at an early date.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to include colleges such as Mater Dei, All Hallows and others, in the proposed free fees scheme as they have contributed significantly to the provision of third level education places.</P>

      <P>What is depressing about debates in this House is when we hear negative responses from Members on the Government side.  We should welcome the fact that Deputy Martin tabled such a motion and gave us an opportunity to debate education because we do not have many opportunities to do that.  I have tabled an amendment to the motion but it does not invalidate the fact that Deputy Martin underlines the gross inequity in our education system, particularly in the scheme the Minister announced last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What the Government is doing in education is incoherent.  Unfortunately, <Col N="1436" /> education policy has become as shallow as a press release and the abolition of third level fees is a classic example of that.  It made a great press release and a great headline at the time.  A press release is not a policy.  It was not thought through.  A give away is not an appropriate approach, the third level free fees move does not enable people to go to college if they have been prevented from doing so up to now.</P>
    <P>Rolling cycles of deprivation show up in every area of Irish life and work against people at every stage of the education process. Every day young people fall from the path of achievement due to poverty.  The abolition of fees does not solve the maintenance grant problems of poorer students.  We have heard educationists at all levels in the system commenting negatively on that single issue.  I will go further than that.  The Minister should have an energetic, coherent, visionary approach to all aspects of education.  We have not seen that.  I have every sympathy with mature students, post-graduate students, evening students and those attending colleges who have not been the recipients of the Minister's largess.  I have received many letters and telephone calls from people who feel they are left out of the system.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to concentrate on building the education system from the foundations up and not from the top down.  She should stop fishing for votes and start helping the system and the younger children in it.  Her plan for free third level education shows that the Government has its priorities wrong and is out of touch with reality.  The real issues to do with education have nothing to do with free third level education. The State does not yet enjoy free primary education.  Every parent knows they are involved in fund raising or paying so-called voluntary subscriptions. Primary education should be truly free for children.</P>
    <P>The recent INTO report stated that the lack of books and supplies to schools in disadvantaged areas seriously <Col N="1437" /> undermines educational equality in Ireland.  Another survey by the ESRI confirmed what most of us know &mdash; that those with the lowest levels of education bear most of the burden of unemployment and have little chance of breaking out of the poverty trap.  Those in the poverty trap have the least chance of having a high standard of education. The Minister is not addressing this.</P>
    <P>Apart from the needs of primary education being neglected, free education is not what is most needed at third level. Universities can only accommodate 18 per cent of the school-leaving population. What will the scheme do for this problem?  What if there is a freeze next year on college intake in spite of increased demand?  We need more capital funding.  The rise in the number of places has resulted in serious overcrowding in libraries and at lectures. There is a lack of capacity to cope with any further increase in numbers.  Failure to deal with inequality in primary education will transform the universities into the preserve of the socially and economically privileged.  Will the Minister explain how free third level education will stop the decline in opportunities for disadvantaged students who wish to enter university?</P>
    <P>I was astonished to hear the Minister's colleague in the Labour Party talk about a psychological breakthrough in the third level funding.  Psychology will not buy bread or books.  We called for a debate on the de Buitléir report.</P>

      <P>I thank my colleague for sharing a little of her time with me.  I wish to address the issue of putting in place a proper maintenance grant system for post-leaving certificate students and courses.  This is not the first time I have spoken about the matter to the Minister.  I have a deep conviction that post-leaving certificate courses have made an enormous and valuable contribution to third level education.  The courses on offer are well-designed, delivered and targeted with a keen eye on the marketplace and job opportunities. This cannot be overlooked.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Cork, one year courses on subjects such as fashion, photography or catering have led directly to employment for young people.  For a number of students a post-leaving certificate course is the fastest and most cost-effective route to securing a job.  These matters cannot be <Col N="1439" /> ignored.  I appeal to the Minister to give these courses the recognition they have earned and deserve.  A proper maintenance grant system should be put in place for next September.  If that does not happen these valuable courses will dwindle and die and young people who are prepared to participate in them will be precluded from so doing because they will not be able to pursue them.</P>
    <P>I am enormously impressed by the attitude which inspired the setting up of these courses.  They are innovative and give the student a spirit of self-reliance, initiative and rolling up of sleeves and getting the job done.  That is what the country needs more than anything else at this time.  I regret to say that I know students who are pursuing courses which are rapidly becoming obsolete. At the end of three or four expensive years spent in university I know many young people who will be as ill-equipped then to earn a living as they were when they sat their leaving certificate. Surely all these elements must be taken into account.</P>
    <P>We must balance where the best advantage lies for young people in terms of education.  I fully accept that funding third level education makes a huge hole in Exchequer spending and that the Minister cannot meet all the demands at once.  I commend the Minister for her initiative in introducing a third stream at leaving certificate level and putting in place a programme which will see many young people remain in formal education until they are 17 or 18 years of age.  By doing that she demonstrated she is capable of developing innovative ideas and accepting those of others.  I commend to her the innovative ideas of those who design, put in place and deliver PLC courses and I ask that she put in place a funding scheme by next September.</P>

      <P>If some of the speeches of the other Opposition Deputies were half as constructive as the speech to which we have listened, this would be a much better debate.  I am happy to speak in support of the amendment tabled by my colleague the Minister for Education on the Government decision to abolish fees for full-time undergraduate and post leaving certificate students.  I listened with great interest to the Fianna Fáil speakers, but I am sure not many of them will recognise the following quotation:</P>
      <P>This nation is dependent largely on our human resources and our economic and social well-being demands that we exploit to the full the abilities and aptitudes of our people.  It is essential, therefore, that all pupils be encouraged to achieve an educational proficiency in accord with their varying abilities and talents.</P>
      <P>That is an extract from a speech made in this House almost 30 years ago.  It was very apt then and we all realise how much more relevant it is in the Ireland of 1995.  The statement was made by none other than the late Donogh O'Malley on the occasion of an Estimate speech for the education services for 1966-67.  The decision by the Minister to abolish fees is a milestone in the history of the development of third level education which has rightly been compared in historical significance to the announcement by the late Donogh O'Malley of the introduction of free post-primary education, the context in which he made the statement I quoted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Thirty years ago I was a student and during the summer holidays I used to work on the buses in Bournemouth in the south of England.  I met students from the South who also worked on the buses some of whom I am glad to say are still good friends and have risen to high positions in this country.  I was working for extra money then, including money to go on holidays, but students <Col N="1441" /> from the South were working of necessity for the lump sum they had to pay upfront in October.  My university fees were paid, but theirs were not.  Thirty years later students from the North and South are treated equally in this regard and it is about time.  It is a scandal that this was not done sooner.</P>
    <P>Another factor has not been considered sufficiently.  The decision by the Minister to abolish fees represents the removal of the serious burden and worry facing students who do not know what their fees will be next year.  Parents and students who carefully budget have to cope when it is suddenly announced that fees will be increased.  Students may be able to afford fees in the first year but they do not know if they will be able to afford them in the fourth year.  That panic experienced by many families has been removed.  Of course there are criticisms, but having listened to them it strikes me that nowhere has it been said that the fees should not be abolished. I listened with great interest to Deputy Keogh's contribution and I notice that she did not say that the fees should not be abolished.  What is being said, which is an easy but in many cases an irresponsible approach, is that the measure should be more widely applied.  Is the Minister not entitled to at least one word of praise for her decision?  Deputy Costello reminded us of the praise of Deputy Martin last November.  What has changed since then apart from the fact that Fianna Fáil is out of Government?</P>
    <P>The abolition of fees for post-leaving certificate courses is being effected at an estimated annual cost of £2 million per annum.  Criticism was expressed that such students do not qualify for maintenance grants.  However, PLC courses are provided in institutions outside the third level sector and, as such, do not at present qualify for the third level student grants scheme.</P>

I cannot extol it as much as I would like in the time available, but I have great pleasure in supporting the Government amendment.</P>

      <P>I have great pleasure in supporting the motion before the House and I compliment my colleagues for tabling it.  I admit that the abolition of university fees is welcome, but the manner and the context in which this was done in the budget leaves a lot to be desired.  Those fees should have been abolished in a fair and balanced way, but they were not.  It should have helped all students, but it does not.  I will not repeat the many categories of students whom it does not help but students of some institutions, such as Mater Dei, the Pontifical University College in Maynooth, Milltown Institute and others have not been included in the scheme.  I appeal to the Minister to include those colleges and their students in the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the long term needs of educators and students, the abolition of fees does not meet their priorities.  It has been said that long term educational needs were sacrificed for short term political gain in this instance.  Spokespersons for third level institutions have <Col N="1443" /> given the measure more than a cool reception, as have third level students heavily dependent on maintenance grants and their parents who are heavily dependent on convenanting arrangements to keep their children at third level institutions.  All in all the decision represents poor value for money.  It seems profligate to the extent of recklessness to absolve those who can well afford to pay fees from any payment when there is a crying need to improve educational services at all levels, while those much needed improvements await the availability of capital.  The generosity of this decision should be contrasted with the grudging manner in which the school transport system is administered at primary and secondary level.  Children of a tender age often have to trudge miles to school because they live, say, a hundred yards or so outside the qualifying distance limit for free transport and are not entitled to it unless their parents hold a medical card.  That reflects a stark contrast in treatment which can only be explained in political terms of the Labour Party chasing its new found constituency of middle income votes in every campus and up-market housing estate.</P>
    <P>The manner in which fees were abolished gives an unfair advantage to those living in or near third level institutions. To restore the balance there is a serious need to improve maintenance grants. They need to be increased by 200 per cent or 300 per cent and should be paid without reference to income as is the case with fees, otherwise a clear bias will exist against a large section of the community, those living a long distance from third level education centres.  As the student slogan says: &ldquo;abolishing the fees will help me to get into college, but it will take a reasonable maintenance grant to allow me to stay there&rdquo;.  A radical increase in the maintenance grant does not seem to be contemplated, with the exception of a vague <Col N="1444" /> proposed change to take so-called assets into consideration which would have the effect of further disadvantaging those who are severely disadvantaged by distance and urgently need redress.</P>
    <P>This official thinking prompted the abolition of third level fees and continues to prompt other changes within the educational pipeline but does not give much encouragement to people in counties like Mayo where there is as yet no third level institution, despite the county having a large third level student population estimated at upwards of 3,000 and a vigorous campaign on the part of a local action committee over a number of years.  The begrudging response so far to the request by the people of County Mayo for a third level institution is in sharp contrast with the sudden announcement some months ago of a new regional technical college for Dún Laoghaire.  That prompts one to ask yet again in what way future education issues will be decided.  Will it be in accordance with obvious need or political expediency?</P>
    <P>I compliment Deputy Hughes on the case he made for Castlebar.  While the abolition of third level fees is welcome, the manner in which it is proposed is decidedly unfair, excluding too many students and third level institutions, adding to the disadvantage of pupils living long distances from centres of third level education whose parents were dependent on entering into covenants to keep them there.  In short, it threatens to drive a further wedge between urban and rural communities which will continue until such time as maintenance grants are realistically and meaningfully increased and, I hope, until there is a full blown third level institution located in County Mayo.</P>

      <P>I thank all Members who have contributed to this debate, in particular the supportive comments of Deputy Keogh who pointed out that it is important we have such a debate in <Col N="1445" /> order to highlight these issues and illustrate the degree to which so many categories of students are excluded from the recent budgetary package.</P>
      <P>The philosophy underpinning this motion was one of equality for all students.  The quotation from the late Donogh O'Malley cited by the Minister of State, Deputy Currie, incorporated the words &ldquo;all students&rdquo;, not just one category.  That is what this motion is all about.  We must remember that resources were released to the Minister through the abolition of tax covenants. While we acknowledge there are constraints on expenditure, one must allocate the resources available equitably between all students within the different categories &mdash; evening students, mature students, PLC students and those attending the Mater Dei Institute, All Hallows and other colleges.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dukes questioned costings.  I have attempted to cost all these proposals. I tabled parliamentary questions asking how much it would cost to bring part-time students within the higher education grants scheme.  The reply I received from the Minister was that the data is not readily available in the Department.  Are Opposition spokespersons meant to research detailed costings when the Department itself could not give the relevant figures?  Likewise, I could not obtain an answer in the case of mature students.  The only answer I received was that in relation to PLC students, mentioned by the Minister last evening.  The service and degree of information available to Members of this House is appalling, particularly within the educational domain.</P>
      <P>It was amazing to hear Deputy Shortall say that we should have a debate on the de Buitléir report since it was our Private Members' motion in January last which led to its publication.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the support I received from Government backbenchers in relation to PLC students, who they claimed should receive maintenance grants, the reality is those same Members will vote against the motion. The Minister and Government took a premeditated decision in the budget to exclude from the allocation of any resources evening students, mature students and all of the other categories covered in our motion.  As an Opposition party we have a right to highlight their cause and call for action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I attended the USI conference yesterday entitled Visions of an Educated Ireland.  I know the Minister had to withdraw at the last moment but I would respectfully suggest it would have been well worth her while to attend. The reason given was that she had to finalise the White Paper on Education, <Col N="1447" /> but a journalist, in the know, said the White Paper was completed on Monday. Of course, the last people to discover anything about the White Paper on Education are the Members of this House, in particular the Opposition spokespersons.</P>
    <P>I have a vision of what things will be like in October 1995.  Let us imagine a big building surrounded by high walls and thousands of students, armed with leaving certificate points, scrambling over the parapets.  Some will make it; others will not.  Those who have made it into the fortress will be safe in the knowledge of having a free place for the next four to six years.  Some of them, unfortunately, may have to relinquish their places because their maintenance grants will not be sufficient to sustain them over their chosen period of study. What about the others who will not make it over the wall?  They will not have sufficient points to trade with the fortress commander, Minister Bhreathnach, who will shout from her battlements: &ldquo;Go buy a third-level education in your local vocational education college. Pay me more money and I will let you in at weekends, evenings and holiday time.  Go to Maynooth, All Hallows, the Milltown Institute of Theology, the College of Surgeons, the Mater Dei Institute, but do not expect me to pay your fees &mdash; only the elite, my elite, will get into my university&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>At last we see our Labour Minister for Education in her true colour, elite blue.  Has fortress commander Bhreathnach not realised that successive Ministers for Education, of every hue, colour and creed, have been endeavouring to dismantle the walls surrounding education since the foundation of the State? Has she not realised we are in the age of the information super-highway, of internet and computer technology, that the dividing lines between university, non-university, student/mature student, part-time versus full-time student are <Col N="1448" /> fast disppearing?  Why is she building walls while others are pulling them down?</P>
    <P>Let me give the Minister a glimpse of the future.  Has she heard of distance education?  Students can opt to study for degree courses in centres other than a university while linked to a university by means of new technologies.  Such students may not be able to afford to live away from home.  Their circumstances or, say, a disability may not allow them to do so.  Why not treat these students equally?  It is not a cliché to say that the new technologies are precipitating rapid social change and that education is to the fore in developing and exploiting this technology.</P>
    <P>For example, what will happen when professors and lecturers begin to use these technologies more frequently in their work, when interactive multimedia become part of normal teaching, when a number of institutions, some in different countries, collaborate to bring cross-cultural, multi-lingual courses over the super-highway?  Will we have to devise some &ldquo;clocking-in&rdquo; system to prove that they are full-time students? What is the Minister's definition of a full-time student?  For example, is a student who works in a fast food restaurant at holidays or weekends deemed to be a full-time student, a part-time worker, or both?  What about somebody who works during the day and studies over weekends?  Is that person less deserving of our support?</P>
    <P>Is it not time the Minister looked to the future beyond the next election?  We must acknowledge that education is changing, that barriers are coming down.  The Minister should be fair and give a chance to those endeavouring to provide and participate in alternative modes of education.  What we want is greater access to education overall &mdash; the more ways of gaining access to ever more diverse education the better.  The Minister should get off her elitist high <Col N="1449" /> horse &mdash; a student is a student, is a student, is a student.</P>

      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this very important matter on the Adjournment. The customs office in Castletownbere has been closed for some time and I have made representations to have it reopened.  Given the substantial quantities of drugs seized off the south coast in the past 12 months and related problems, it is very important that this office is reopened immediately.  Last year the registered traffic in Castletownbere included 250 yachts, 215 Spanish fishing vessels, a large Russian fleet and countless pleasure crafts of one type or another.  Yet there is no surveillance in this area.</P>

      <P>I am not talking about the seizure of pounds or kilos of drugs but rather of tonnes of drugs.  I find it unbelievable that there is no surveillance along the coastline between Bantry and Dingle.  The customs officer is a native of Adrigole which is adjacent to Castletownbere and it makes no sense to locate the headquarters of the customs office in Bantry, with the consequent mileage costs etc.  Even on purely economic grounds it makes sense to reopen the customs office in Castletownbere and to staff it on a permanent basis.</P>
      <P>In recent years the level of surveillance along the coastline has deteriorated. During the time of English occupation surveillance was done by people in Martello towers and lighthouses and by those in the coastguard rescue service.</P>

      <P>With the introduction of the Single European Market in January 1993, the volume of Customs work in Castletownbere declined significantly.  The Revenue Commissioners studied the impact of the Single Market on the Customs and Excise service and concluded that the most effective means of providing a Customs service in the Bantry Bay-Beara Peninsula area was to have staff centralised in, and operating from, Bantry and deployed on a flexible basis to various locations, including Castletownbere, as required to meet the needs and demands of work.

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>We are all concerned about the drugs problem, particularly with the new dangers following the completion of the Internal Market.  The Irish authorities now have a responsibility not only to keep illegal drugs out of Ireland but to prevent this country from being used as a point of entry for drugs intended for elsewhere in the European Union.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Customs National Drugs Team was set up specifically for this purpose. The CNDT, comprising more than 70 staff, consists of intelligence units, operational units, maritime units and sniffer-dog units which are strategically based at locations throughout the country. <Col N="1455" /> These specialist officials are supplemented by the general cadre of Customs and Excise staff who are also responsible for the detection and prevention of drug smuggling as part of their normal duties.</P>
    <P>CNDT staff based in Cork, comprising 16 officers, consists of operational units, intelligence units and a sniffer-dog unit.  Intelligence units, each comprising two full-time members of the CNDT, are also based in Bantry and Tralee and are supervised by two higher officers of Customs and Excise who become involved in drugs related work as deemed necessary.  All units are mobile and employ the most modern means of communication and have access to aerial and sea surveillance.</P>
    <P>Specialist CNDT officers in the Cork and Kerry regions can call on assistance, where the need arises, of other Customs and Excise staff, in particular, the 16 officials attached to mobile task units which operate in their areas.  Additionally, they can request the assistance, when necessary, of CNDT staff based in Limerick and Shannon which comprises nine members, including a sniffer-dog unit and a maritime unit.</P>
    <P>Experience has shown that intelligence gathering and surveillance, rather than a static presence, are the best means of combating drug smuggling. The CNDT has close liaison with EU counterparts via mutual assistance programmes. The EU, in an effort to strengthen the external frontier, has developed a computerised network of customs information called the Customs Information System.  There are now in excess of 300 terminals strategically located throughout the EU.  These are currently situated in all the major ports, airports and Customs operational coastal centres.  The CIS network gives users access to a number of facilities, for example, database access to shipping movements.  However, the primary focus of the CIS system is the ability of <Col N="1456" /> all EU Customs services to despatch and receive at local level timely intelligence on the movements of suspect passengers, freight and transport.  CIS provides an inbuilt translation facility which allows EU Customs officials to receive and despatch CIS messages in their own language.  Additionally, the CNDT is in the process of negotiating bilateral agreements with all European maritime states on the exchange of intelligence.</P>
    <P>The value of good intelligence is demonstrated clearly by the major drugs seizure in the past few days at Dublin Port.  A consignment of cannabis resin with a street value estimated at more than £20 million was discovered in a container which arrived from Africa via Antwerp.  The discovery was made by Customs staff as a result of an intelligence based operation which also involved international Customs services and there are ongoing inquiries by Customs and the Garda.  The Deputy will also be aware that there was another large seizure of ecstasy tablets by the Garda over the weekend.  I again congratulate all concerned.</P>
    <P>There have, of course, been earlier significant seizures by Customs and the Garda, particularly since 1993, off the south-west and west coasts.</P>

My colleague, the Minister for Justice, intimated last night that she will be bringing proposals to Government as soon as possible to ensure the fullest co-ordination and co-operation between all the agencies involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1457" /> Experience shows, as I indicated, that a flexible approach to the disposition and use of our resources is needed to tackle this problem effectively.  I am also hopeful that we may expect further assistance from the European Union in this task.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for coming into the House to reply to the matter.  We all welcome the Washington Conference and consider it a great opportunity for inward investment. In the past few weeks I met a number of business people, many of whom will attend the conference.  It is essential they have an opportunity to meet American business people with similar interests who may wish to invest in Ireland for what it has to offer or as a route to larger European markets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I approached IDA Ireland about this matter who told me it did not have any great involvement in the conference and that I should contact Forbairt.  Section 7 of the Industrial Development Act, 1993, states that the function of Forbairt is to focus on the development of the indigenous industry and section 8 states that the function of IDA Ireland is to attract overseas firms and facilitate the expansion of overseas investment here. In that context and in view of its expertise, why does IDA Ireland not have greater involvement in the preparations for the Washington Conference?  I <Col N="1458" /> understand also that compared with Forbairt it has a large overseas organisation in the United States.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to look first at the preparations being made for the conference to ensure that it realises its maximum potential.  He should ensure, in so far as he can, that there is co-ordination and integration between the Department of Foreign Affairs, IDA Ireland, Forbairt, the trade board and others he thinks appropriate.  I ask him also to look at the Border counties because President Clinton wants to see investment there following the peace process.  What competitive advantages are we putting in place in the six southern Border counties which are facing competition from the IDB and the greater Dublin area?  The Minister should ensure that money targeted at Border areas from the European Union and the International Fund for Ireland is for the development of roads, water, sewerage, telemarketing facilities which are essential for advance factories.  Forfás policy on advance factories is not helpful to the Border areas because, it seems, the better place to be is within 20 miles of Dublin.</P>
    <P>The Washington Conference presents a great opportunity for the Border areas in the wake of the peace process.  It is important that members of different parties and the State agencies work together to ensure that it is a success.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my colleague, Deputy O'Hanlon, for the opportunity to make a brief contribution on this important matter.  That an investment conference is being organised is a clear indication of the support that is forthcoming from the United States to cement the process of peace and reconciliation on the island.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The format of the conference is important.  It provides an opportunity for people in industry to meet business people in the United States and tell them of the advantages of investing in the Border counties.  If Forbairt is to <Col N="1459" /> have exclusive responsibility for organising, to the exclusion of IDA Ireland, that should be re-examined.  There is also a danger that a multiplicity of groupings could go to this conference, all putting their own points of view, without the necessary co-ordination of approach.  There is no point in a small grouping representing a few parishes, half a county or, indeed, a county putting its point of view to the detriment of the region in which it is located and of the six southern Border counties.</P>
    <P>The conference is so important that the Minister should spell out its format so that people will know in advance what is required and the best approach to adopt.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton) Richard Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies O'Hanlon and Kirk for raising this issue.  They have a genuine interest in it and I hope I will be able to deal with some of the issues they raised although Deputy O'Hanlon has raised a wide range of issues.</P>
      <P>I assure both Deputies that there is no question of the IDA adopting a secondary role to Forbairt.  The IDA focuses on foreign mobile industry which locates in the Border counties and it will be carrying that responsibility at the conference.  On the other hand, Forbairt has different responsibilities, primarily, the matching of synergies in Irish companies with ones in the States and issues such as linkage between existing companies and those that might come in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Linkage and the concept of competitive sub-supply is within Forbairt's brief. It is an area of immense opportunity. We have seen the creation of an estimated 12,000 jobs since 1985 by building linkage with foreign companies, and it is an area that has been targeted for £300 million worth of business over the next five years.  We are making significant efforts to build on that.  Recently I launched a programme for international competitiveness which was piloted in <Col N="1460" /> Mayo and Galway, but this initiative will be spread to the rest of the country, including the counties represented by the two Deputies.  The idea is to use the resource of foreign companies already located in Ireland to identify sub-supply companies in the region that have the capacity to expand their business and find new opportunities for sub-supply.  It gives those new emerging companies access both to Forbairt and the expertise of the foreign companies that act as patrons to build up their quality and their ability to contract successfully for this type of business.  That will be a key focus of Forbairt's involvement.</P>
    <P>Forbairt also has responsibility for food and natural resources, and will examine foreign inward investment in so far as it affects those sectors and the Border counties.  In the last couple of years we have seen very successful inflows from the United States.  Investments since the beginning of 1992 have amounted to more than £600 million and there is a steady stream of applications coming to IDA Ireland in this area and also to Forbairt involving food and natural resources.</P>
    <P>In regard to the conference, the focus will be on business, and will concentrate on Northern Ireland and the six Border counties covering trade, investment, tourism and business partners.  The Irish delegation will include representatives from my Department, IDA Ireland and Forbairt.  IDA Ireland will aggressively promote the Border counties for new inward investment opportunities from the United States.  Forbairt, like IDA Ireland, will market the Border areas for inward investment in the food and natural resources sectors and will work closely with the US authorities to identify opportunities for closer links between the Irish and US companies. Recently an initiative jointly funded by both Forbairt and the International Fund for Ireland selected 20 companies that have the capacity to build up links with companies in the US.  We already <Col N="1461" /> have two businesses where successful linkages have been identified and we are developing those.  The capacity of those 20 companies to employ, which now stands at 400, can be significantly expanded by that initiative.</P>
    <P>Similarly, the organisers of the conference will seek 50 companies in the North and 50 in the South for matching with relevant US companies, and the agencies have submitted lists of potential invitees through my Department to be cleared via the US Embassy and, finally, the White House.  For many Irish companies a partnership or strategic alliance with an overseas company provides a particularly attractive route to growth.  A typical match is between an Irish company with a proven production and/or marketing capability and an overseas partner with product or process technologies.</P>
    <P>The route builds on the strength of both companies to develop new business opportunities.  I am assured that Forbairt and IDA Ireland continue to maximise the efficient use of State resources in helping Irish companies to access such partnership opportunities. Forbairt staff in North America, Germany and Japan are based in IDA offices, and the flow of information from IDA Ireland executives to their Forbairt colleagues about potential opportunities they come across remains, as before the agency restructuring process, as strong as ever.</P>
    <P>Before and during the conference, Forbairt will work closely also with the US Department of Commerce Matchmaker Programme to widen the range of partnership opportunities identified. I fully accept the need for close co-operation between the main parties involved in linkage generally.  I am assured that they have a close working relationship which will continue at the conference.</P>
    <P>The US authorities expect follow-up conferences and trade missions in the Border counties by at least 100 of the attendees.  In addition, follow-up by <Col N="1462" /> education link-ups, student exchanges, twinning, technical and scientific links are expected.  Both Forbairt and IDA Ireland will be closely involved as appropriate in the follow-up process, and I intend to ensure that the maximum benefits for Ireland are secured at the conference in Washington.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for giving me the opportunity to highlight this issue and the Minister for the Marine for coming in to respond, giving this matter the attention it deserves.</P>
      <P>A series of fatalities highlight just how dangerous are the waters in Waterford harbour.  The Hook lighthouse, the oldest in Europe, is a 1,000 year old monument to those who have died. There will always be an unavoidable level of risk in seafaring but at least some of the seven deaths in this area in the past three years should have been avoided.  The deaths of two canoeists about one month ago occurred on a day when trawlers did not put out to sea because of bad weather.  The others who died did not have the necessary local knowledge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Safety must be the overriding concern in using our waters for leisure crafting. There is a need for the Department of the Marine to institute a safety system. Ideas, such as ensuring that local expert knowledge of fishermen and others is availed of or a red flag system similar to <Col N="1463" /> the one in operation on beaches, should be considered.  Leisure activities should be subject by law to stringent health and safety standards and groups and individuals who fail to comply should be barred, as people who are careless at sea are a deadly danger to themselves and others.  I cite our drink driving laws as an example of the regulations I want to see introduced.  Draconian laws should be strictly enforced.  I do not want to be a spoilsport but I am sure the Minister who has an interest in this matter understands what I am saying.  All too often I have walked along the shoreline of Dollar Bay to Hook lighthouse with willing volunteers and grieving families searching for a sign of life but have yet to find it.</P>
    <P>Measures which should be enforced include the mandatory inclusion of reflective stripes on bouyancy jackets, wet suits, helmets and lifejackets.  On a summer's day the waters off the Hook lighthouse might look like a playground; in reality they are a graveyard.  The time has come for the Department of the Marine to police more strictly the way we use our waters; lives depend on it.</P>
    <P>I compliment and pay tribute to the Naval Service, the RNLI, sub-aqua clubs, in particular the Hook sub-aqua club, the coast and cliff rescue service and lighthouse keepers who, unfortunately, are a dying breed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanKenneally" hpid="Mr. Kenneally Mr. Kenneally">

      <P>I, too, thank the Chair for giving me the opportunity to raise this matter and thank the Minister for coming in to respond.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My colleague and I initiated this debate not because of the most recent tragedy in Waterford harbour but because of the series of disasters and near tragedies that have occurred over a long period.  I have been concerned for some time about the craft putting out to sea in unsuitable weather conditions. Many of these vessels are built by well meaning individuals in their own garages during the winter, perhaps as a <Col N="1464" /> hobby.  While they look lovely at home and people cannot wait for the summer to come to launch their pride and joy into the deep, tragically, in many cases they are building their own coffins.</P>
    <P>I know from my many contacts with fishermen in my constituency that they are extremely concerned about the lack of control which allows such craft to put to sea without any proper checks being carried out as to their sea-worthiness. Many of the people concerned have no knowledge of how to handle such craft or cope if the weather turns bad.  They would not know whether the wind was coming from an easterly or a westerly direction.  The arrogance of some of these people is unbelievable.  Fishermen who offer advice are often told to mind their own business but eventually have to tow these vessels back to safety.  Dunmore East is one of our major fishery ports.  There is hardly a fisherman in that port who at one time or another has not towed one of these vessels back into the harbour.</P>
    <P>We only hear about the incidents in which there has been loss of life but during the years there have been hundreds of near tragedies which have not been reported.  Legislation or regulations should be brought into force to require certification before any vessel is allowed on to the water.  Cars have to fulfil MOT requirements while aeroplanes are rigorously checked but there are no regulations for marine craft.  It should be mandatory for anybody wishing to set sail to have some basic knowledge of the sea.  It is strange that while there are safety measures in force for air and road travel there is none for sea travel.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughCoveney" hpid="Minister for the Marine (Mr. Coveney) Minister for the Marine (Mr. Coveney)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Coveney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer the Deputies to my statement during the course of the Adjournment Debate on 22 February last when I dealt with the tragedy at Dunmore East involving the sad loss of two canoeists, some of which is relevant <Col N="1465" /> to this discussion.  My remarks tonight will not relate specifically to that accident; I do not yet have the report although I expect to receive it shortly.</P>
      <P>There has been something of a boom in recent years in the number of Irish water sports enthusiasts.  The range of such activity now embraces sailing boats, canoes, speed boats, surfers, jetskis, anglers, windsurfers, rowing boats, dinghies and perhaps others I cannot recall.  This is, no doubt, a reflection of increased affluence, greater availability of leisure time and a growing appreciation of the wonderful amenity we have in our marine and inland waters.  This is a development I very much welcome.</P>
      <P>Recent tragedies and near fatalities involving leisure craft have, however, served to highlight the downside of this increasing participation in leisure crafting.  While such incidents are tragic, that so many of them are preventable adds to our sense of sadness.  Investigations by the Department of the Marine have shown time and again that the lives of boating enthusiasts have been lost because of a failure to adhere to basic safety practices.</P>
      <P>Some people believe that the solution to this problem lies in increased legislation and regulation.  This opinion tends to be voiced particularly in the aftermath of a tragedy involving leisure craft.  This is an understandable reaction. It is, however, the considered opinion of many involved in this sector that formal State regulation of leisure craft activity would be neither appropriate nor practicable.  I concur with this view.  Even if the State were to undertake a regulatory safety role in the operation of leisure craft activities, it would be extremely difficult to monitor and enforce as people do not wish to feel the heavy hand of the State in their leisure pursuits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main role of the State has related to increasing general awareness of the need for basic safety practice as well as <Col N="1466" /> encouraging the representative associations and clubs to regulate their members.  The Department of the Marine's annual safety awareness campaign will once again this year exhort the general public to &ldquo;take time to think safety before taking to the water&rdquo;.  This message will be reinforced through a series of meetings with leisure craft representative bodies, radio and newspaper advertising and the distribution of posters and leaflets setting out basic safety precautions.  As part of this year's safety awareness campaign, I will shortly launch a code of safe practice for leisure craft, which has been drawn up by officials of my Department in consultation with the sector's representative bodies.  We are also considering means of encouraging and requiring water sportswear manufacturers to incorporate reflective stripes in their products.</P>
    <P>Everybody embarking on trips aboard leisure craft should set time aside for safety planning.  This should include, as a minimum, wearing a lifejacket at all times and, offshore, particularly in hours of darkness, a safety harness; checking and taking account of the weather forecast for the area; checking locally regarding dangerous currents and strong tides &mdash; that is often best done by speaking to fishermen and people who know the area; checking the condition of the boat and its equipment; carrying an alternative means of propulsion, where that is possible, such as an additional oar, etc.; carrying a first aid kit and flares and, for larger boats, a marine radio or some means of communicating with the shore; leaving word ashore of proposed departure and arrival times, as well as details of the trip planned and, finally, being able to swim.</P>
    <P>I am well aware that the majority of water sports enthusiasts, and their representative bodies, are responsible and educated in matters of safety but there are many more who have yet to realise that adhering to basic safety precautions <Col N="1467" /> can save their lives and the lives of others.  I will ensure that our efforts to get this message across will be intensified in the coming months but I am reluctant to get into the business of heavy-handed State regulation, although that may ultimately come.</P>
    <P>I thank Deputies Byrne and Kenneally for raising this most important subject in the House, particularly at this <Col N="1468" /> time of year which marks the beginning of the main boating season.  I know their particular concern relates to leisure activities in Waterford harbour &mdash; unfortunately for good reason &mdash; but they will appreciate this is an issue of relevance right around our coast.</P>

      <P>I understand the Deputy is referring to a report commissioned by the previous <Col N="1292" /> Government from an interdepartmental group chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach.  The group's terms of reference required it to examine the external trade statistics and their impact on national income statistics; to consider technical issues arising from the basis of compilation of the statistics and the underlying economic trends, and to consider the implications for economic performance and policy and the analysis of statistical sources and procedures.</P>
      <P>The report of the group is expected shortly.  Pending the completion of the report and its consideration by Government, I cannot comment on its contents.</P>
      <P>I assume that the Deputy, in the second part of her question, has in mind the possibility that export data might understate the dependence of Irish industrialists on the British market. Unless Irish industrialists were to sell their products to the UK at prices below their true value &mdash; an approach for which I can see no good reason &mdash; export data could not understate that dependence.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The National Treasury Management Agency was set up under the National Treasury Management Agency Act, <Col N="1293" /> 1990.  The principal functions of the agency are to perform, on behalf of the Minister for Finance, the functions of the Minister delegated to it by Order of the Government under section 5 of that Act.  The functions that may be delegated to the agency are those relating to borrowing and management of the national debt.  The national debt is the biggest portfolio of debt in the State and it requires specific attention.  The National Treasury Management Agency was set up for this purpose.  The entire portfolio managed by the agency consists of State debt.</P>
    <P>The debt of semi-State or State sponsored bodies, even when it carries a State guarantee, is not part of the national debt.  The management by NTMA of the liabilities of such bodies does not arise under the 1990 Act.  Some of the debt of these bodies carries a State guarantee.  Were any such guarantee ever to be invoked or were such debt to be assumed by the State, thereby becoming part of the national debt, it would then naturally fall to be managed by the NTMA.  I am satisfied that the agency has the skills and resources to perform its functions. Given the scale of the agency's current operations, I am satisfied that it will continue to do so under all foreseeable circumstances.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 23 and 43 together.</P>
      <P>The total expenditure by the Commissioners of Public Works on rent of buildings and lands in 1994 amounted to approximately £23 million.  This would represent the vast bulk of State rental. There could be small amounts involved in rental outside the Office of Public Works, such as by the Departments of Defence and Justice.</P>
      <P>A whole range of factors are taken into consideration when deciding whether purchase, leasing or the undertaking of building work should be adopted to meet the State's needs in regard to buildings and lands in a particular case.  These factors include the availability of the necessary financial resources, which could be considerable, the nature and likely duration of the particular service, economic considerations, the state of the property market, etc.</P>
      <P>As regards office equipment, the established practice is not to engage in leasing.  This policy is based on the consideration that purchase is generally the better economic option.  It will be appreciated that equipment purchases would generally be for smaller amounts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am committed to a policy of equality of opportunity for all Civil Service staff.  In this context, I am, naturally, anxious to see a better gender balance at senior levels in the Civil Service and every effort is and has been made to ensure that there are no barriers, hidden or <Col N="1295" /> otherwise, preventing women from progressing to the highest positions.  I believe that significant progress has beeen made in this direction.  Although there are as yet no women serving as secretary to a Government Department, the representation of women at assistant secretary and principal level has increased significantly in recent years.</P>
      <P>The Civil Service has been to the forefront among Irish employers in relation to gender equality matters.  Policy and guidelines on equal opportunities for the Civil Service have been in place since 1986.  They provide a statement of basic principles on which the ongoing development of an equality policy is based.</P>
      <P>Each member of staff is provided with a copy of the policy and guidelines booklet.  In addition, a series of equality workshops are being held in individual Departments to ensure that line managers and supervisors are fully aware of the policy and to enable them to explore ways of giving the guidelines practical application in their own areas of responsibility.  The implementation of the equal opportunities policy in the Civil Service is looked after by the equality section in my Department in close consultation with the Civil Service unions.  The review and development of our equality policy is an ongoing process and includes monthly meetings of a joint staff and management equality committee.</P>
      <P>Promotion and recruitment competitions held for appointments in the Civil Service are open equally to men and women.  Advertisements and circulars announcing external and internal competitions indicate clearly that the Civil Service is committed to a policy of equal opportunity.  Members of interview boards convened by the Civil Service Commission are briefed on the Civil Service policy in relation to equality of opportunity and in addition are provided with written guidelines stating the policy in relation to the conducting of interviews.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1296" /> Statistics relating to the candidature and outcome of recruitment and promotion competition and membership of interview boards are collected by my Department from the Civil Service Commission and from each Government Department.  The information is analysed by my Department, in consultation with the Civil Service unions and is made available to all staff in an annual report.  The general pattern emerging from the statistics gives no indication of gender bias in selection for appointments in the Civil Service, either on recruitment or promotion.  The results show that, in general, women are at least as successful as men in promotion competitions.</P>
    <P>The Civil Service Training Centre provides a training course for women in management grades.  The course, which was introduced in 1984, is specifically designed to encourage middle-management grades to develop and enhance their management potential.  Participants in the &ldquo;Women in Management Conference&rdquo; have the option of becoming part of a women in management network on completion of the course. The network holds half-day workshops about four times a year.  Training in relation to equality issues for staff at clerical levels was introduced recently.</P>

      <P>I have no plan to declare the south Galway region a disaster area.  There is no legal basis for such a designation and it would not of itself make any additional assistance available to households or to businesses which have suffered as a result of the severe flooding.</P>
      <P>The Government has initiated several positive measures to assist people who have been affected by the flooding in south Galway and elsewhere.  An allocation of £2 million was made to assist farmers who lost livestock or fodder. The guidelines for this scheme are being interpreted flexibly and the ongoing situation is being monitored to determine whether any further measures are necessary.  An additional allocation of £4 million has been made available for the improvement of county roads.</P>
      <P>The community welfare officers who operate the supplementary welfare allowance scheme on behalf of the Department of Social Welfare have been assisting some people, including some who would not normally qualify for social welfare payments, who have encountered exceptional or urgent needs.</P>
      <P>I have secured an allocation of 325,000 ECUs, £260,000 approximately, from the European Union as a gesture of solidarity with those affected by the flooding.  This will be distributed by the Irish Red Cross Society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has agreed to make additional funds available for humanitarian relief for those who have suffered <Col N="1298" /> uninsurable losses as a result of flooding. In the context of the criterion uninsurable will be interpreted in a realistic and sensible way.  I hope shortly, with my colleague the Minister for Finance, to put specific proposals to Government for a humanitarian relief package.</P>
    <P>An interdepartmental committee which I am chairing has been established to co-ordinate the Government's response to the recent bad weather.</P>
    <P>In relation specifically to the south Galway region a number of further measures have been taken.  A one-stop-shop has been opened in Gort to provide information and to co-ordinate the handling of claims.  Staffing is by the Office of Public Works, Western Health Board, Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Galway County Council and the Irish Red Cross Society.</P>
    <P>The Air Corps has been assisting farmers by dropping fodder for livestock into isolated areas and to date has made over 200 cargo sorties, transporting about 100 tonnes of provisions. The Army is providing transport to school for some children and are available for the transport of others such as pensioners, if required.</P>
    <P>A special allocation of £50,000 was made to Galway County Council to enable them to raise the level of some roads.  A major study is to be undertaken to determine the causes of the flooding in the area and to try to identify environmentally and economically acceptable solutions.</P>
    <P>I myself have visited the south Galway area on several occasions.  I have seen the problems at first hand and spoken with many of those affected.  I am determined, as is the Government, to continue to respond to the situation in a caring and realistic manner.</P>
    <P>As recently as Monday 27 March, I was in Gort where I met a number of deputations.  I was given a detailed proposal for a compensation package to meet the particular needs of the area and I am examining this with my officials and the other relevant Government Departments at present.  It is, as I <Col N="1299" /> have indicated, intended to bring proposals to Government as quickly as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 32 and 34 together.</P>
      <P>The Government remains firmly committed to the fiscal policy parameters set out in our policy programme.  Briefly, these envisage strict adherence to Maastricht's fiscal convergence criteria &mdash; i.e., that the annual general Government deficit should be no more than 3 per cent of GDP, and that the gross debt-GDP ratio will continue to decline satisfactorily towards 60 per cent.  In that context, we undertook to maintain the EBR prudently below 3 per cent of GNP, and to restrict the growth of current supply spending to a maximum of 6 per cent in nominal terms in 1995 and to an average annual rate of 2 per cent in real terms over the following two years of the programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These undertakings were fully accommodated in the budget which I introduced on 8 February last.  The 1995 EBR is set at 2.4 per cent of GNP; the general Government aggregates are well within the Maastricht limits; and the gross current supply service spending provision made in the 1995 budget represented an increase of just 5.8 per <Col N="1302" /> cent over the 1994 outturn.  It is obviously not possible at this early stage to make a firm judgment on either the prospective outturn for 1995 or the fiscal outlook for 1996 and 1997.  However, the budgetary indicators over the year to date are broadly supportive of the budget projections.</P>
    <P>At the same time, the Government have determined that progress must be made this year to implement the recent equal treatment judgment in the High Court.  This ruling held that some £260 million in arrears and compensation payments are owed to women who did not receive their full entitlement to welfare payments over a number of years dating back to 1985.  Having accepted the High Court decision, the Government is committed to meeting the liability as quickly as possible and it is expected that some £200 million of the back payments will be issued this year.</P>
    <P>I made provision of £60 million in the budget arithmetic in the expectation that some payments for equal treatment would be made in 1995, so the extra expenditure over the budget provision amounts to £140 million in the current year.  It is intended that this once-off expenditure will be funded by disposing of part of the asset represented by Exchequer advances, via the local loans fund, to local authorities.  There will therefore be no effect on the overall budget target EBR.  However, the additional spending will drive the headline rate of increase in current supply services in 1995 above the 5.8 per cent projected in the budget, to 7.1 per cent. This matter arises directly from the decision by the High Court in regard to payments determined to have been properly due in earlier years.  The exceptional £140 million should not be construed as affecting the underlying adherence to the 6 per cent limit in 1996.  Equally, the amount involved will not be counted in the base for calculation of the following year's spending limit under the Government's policy programme commitment.</P>
    <P>Finally, our analysis of the additional expenditure deriving from the equal <Col N="1303" /> treatment liability is that the amount involved is not likely to add significantly to inflationary pressures in 1995. Despite the strong recovery in domestic demand, the mid-February CPI data confirm that at just 2.5 per cent, Irish inflation has been very stable since mid-1994, and the increased expenditure is unlikely to affect this position.</P>

      <P>The proposals which I will shortly be putting to Government will be designed to contribute to the efficiency of the banking system by strengthening competition within it and permitting the optimum development of the institutions concerned in the interests of their customers and the maxismisation of sustainable employment.  The underlying objective is to help to improve the potential of the Irish economy to generate growth.</P>
      <P>It is my intention that whatever entity or entities may emerge from this process will be well adapted to the requirements of the banking market.  This is clearly also the ambition of the institutions concerned.</P>
      <P>I should point out that the banking sector already benefits from a high degree of competition.  It consists of a large number of institutions, many domestic and many foreign.  EU law prescribes a wide right of establishment within any of the member states to any institution licensed within another member state, and in that fundamental sense there is only one banking market in Europe.</P>
      <P>It is also relevant that most of the major banks, including the four associated banks, which have operations in the State already operate north of the Border.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1304" /> The new framework for agreement prepared by the Irish and British Governments envisages that, with agreement, co-operation to the mutual benefit of all living in Ireland could develop without impediment, attaining its full potential for stimulating economic growth and prosperity.  I see no way in which this most desirable perspective would threaten the viability of any restructuring of the State banks which the Government may approve.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that the matter is governed by EU VAT law, with which Irish VAT law must comply.</P>
      <P>Under the Sixth VAT Directive, legal services are taxable.  While some member states may continue to avail of a temporary derogation which permits exemption, it is not open to other member states, such as Ireland, who already tax these services, to introduce an exemption at this stage, even of the limited type referred to by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>The Directive also prohibits the introduction of new zero rates.  Furthermore, it should be noted that legal services are not on the list of items to which reduced rating may be applied.  Moreover, as these services were not at a reduced rate here on 1 January 1991, the application of reduced rating on a temporary basis is also ruled out.  Accordingly, all legal services must remain standard rated in Ireland.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>On the general question, as the Deputy will be aware, the Customs National Drugs Team (CNDT) was set up by the Revenue Commissioners with the advent of the Single Market in view of the increased responsibility on the Irish Customs service for protecting our own coastline as well as that of the European Union, in the battle against the illegal importation of drugs.  The CNDT comprising over seventy staff, consists of intelligence units, operational units, maritime units and sniffer-dog units which are strategically based at locations throughout the country.  These specialist officials are supplemented by the general cadre of Customs and Excise staff who are also responsible for the detection and prevention of drug smuggling as part of their normal duties.</P>
      <P>The CNDT maintains contacts with Customs administrations throughout the world by means of international conventions to which Ireland is a contracting party.  In addition, a highly developed computer system, the customs information system which links the customs services of EU member states has been established to facilitate quick and effective exchanges of information regarding suspect movements of people and goods.</P>
      <P>The CNDT has negotiated memoranda of understanding with trade associations and companies involved in the transport of goods and persons as part of the continuing drive against drug smuggling.  Additionally, they recently launched the coastal and airfield reporting pack under the drug watch programme.  The pack has had wide distribution and enlists the assistance of coastal communities, maritime personnel, people residing in close proximity to airfields and other members of the public and encourages the reporting of unusual occurrences in their areas to Customs by freefone or freepost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1306" /> There is close co-operation between all Government agencies &mdash; Customs, Garda, the Naval Service and the Air Corps &mdash; in the battle against drug smuggling.</P>
    <P>The Deputy may also know that the Minister for Justice is considering a report prepared in her Department, in consultation with all concerned, with a view to putting proposals to Government to ensure that this co-operation is maximised.</P>
    <P>On resources generally, I would remind Deputies that a case has been made at European Union level for the provision of assistance to enable this country to equip itself better to protect the Irish sector of the Union's external frontier.  While the allocation in the current year's Community budget is insufficient for this purpose, the funding issue will continue to be pursued in the context of discussion of next year's budget.</P>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners are fully alert to the danger of drug smuggling along our coastline particularly in the Cork and Kerry regions.  The level of seizures by Customs and the Garda indicate major drug smuggling activity along the south-west and west coasts in recent years.  The measures I have already outlined, including the deployment of intelligence units in strategic locations, the information received under the drug watch programme, the development of memoranda of understanding with Irish organisations and liaison with European Union counterparts and other international organisations, ensures that ongoing intelligence is available in the fight against drug smuggling.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances I am satisfied that Customs, in co-operation with the other enforcement agencies concerned, provide adequate protection at present against the illegal importation of drugs and the situation will of course be kept under review.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like to take this opportunity to compliment the Customs national drugs team and the Garda <Col N="1307" /> authorities on the major seizures of cannabis resin at Dublin Port on Friday last and of ecstacy tablets at Dún Laoghaire on Sunday.  The seizures are another practical demonstration of the continuing efforts by the State agencies to combat smuggling of drugs into this country.</P>

      <P>I am committed to the continued development of the International Financial Services Centre.  The recent agreement of the European Commission to the extension of the marketing deadline, to end 2000, gives us an opportunity to consolidate on the achievements of the centre to date and to continue its expansion over the next six years.  There is already a broad spread of activities in the centre but I am mindful of the need, in this continuously changing sector, to respond to developments.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, in the forthcoming Finance Bill, I will include measures which will facilitate the ongoing development of the IFSC.  My aim is to see a continued concentration on areas of activity that offer sustainable employment, are active and substantive, and are likely to be maintained beyond the year 2005.</P>
      <P>One of the chief objectives in setting up the IFSC was to create sustainable employment.  Over 400 projects with job commitments of 4,600 have so far been approved.  In excess of 2,100 new incremental jobs are now in place with substantial additional employment created in the provision of support services. Indeed, actual employment could well exceed the commitments given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards new entrants in 1995, in the first three months of this year 30 <Col N="1308" /> new projects together with extensions to a further 19 projects have been sanctioned with job commitments of 235 people.  A detailed list of approved projects is published by the Industrial Development Agency and the latest edition of this list is available in the Dáil Library.</P>

      <P>The 1995 budget was carefully framed so as to minimise inflationary risks, and in this context I would highlight the prudent overall fiscal position adopted and the comparatively modest increases in excise duties.  These budgetary decisions, in conjunction with the moderate pay increases provided for under the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i>, constitute a firm foundation for the maintenance of low inflation.</P>
      <P>The consumer price index for mid-February 1995 was released recently.  It showed that the 12-month rate of inflation was 2.5 per cent, compared with 2.4 per cent at mid-November 1994.  The latest 12-month rate is consistent with my forecast at budget time that inflation in 1995 would average 2½ per cent, representing only a marginal rise on the 1994 outturn of 2.4 per cent. This forecast, to which I still hold, implies that inflation will not rise significantly in 1995, and I do not therefore believe that the taxation gains referred to by the Deputy will be nullified by rising inflation.</P>
      <P>The Central Bank, in its Statement of Monetary Policy 1995, reaffirmed that the objective of Irish monetary policy is to sustain low inflation.  Given the small and open nature of the Irish economy, exchange rate stability is the key intermediate target for monetary policy.  The Central Bank also monitors trends in a range of other price indicators, including asset prices.  The Deputy will be aware that the Central Bank, during March, took steps which could be expected to bear down on house prices.</P>

      <P>It is assumed that the Deputy is referring to imports from a country outside the customs territory of the EU.  In Ireland's case, VAT is charged at the point of entry on all such goods whether imported by a trader directly into Ireland or under transit arrangements through another member state.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is accepted that, in the case of these <Col N="1311" /> imports, a trader could have to pay VAT in respect of damaged goods before claiming the appropriate VAT credit in the next bimonthly VAT return.  Of course, where a trader is approved by the Revenue Commissioners for deferred payment facilities in relation to VAT at point of entry, any cash-flow cost in respect of imported goods, whether damaged or otherwise, would be minimised.</P>
    <P>I have already indicated in response to recent parliamentary questions that, because of the substantial Exchequer cash-flow cost which would be involved, the abolition of VAT at the point of entry cannot be contemplated at present.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that I am fully conscious of the difficulties facing the newspaper industry in Ireland.  This was the reason, as Minister for Enterprise and Employment, I established the Joint Working Group on the Future of the Newspaper Industry.  Furthermore, the Competition Authority has, I understand, just recently reported on the question of foreign competition and the separate question of dominance in the industry within Ireland.</P>
      <P>I fully accept that Irish newspapers face stiff competition from UK publications. The latter have greater economies of scale and lower production costs which allows them to cater for the Irish market at marginal costs.  The fact is, however, that this type of competition does not arise from the rate of VAT applied to newspapers in Ireland, which applies equally to both Irish and to foreign publications, but rather from the commercial non-tax factors mentioned. I appreciate, of course, that the newspaper industry may feel aggrieved that newspapers sold in Britain enjoy a zero rate, while newspapers sold in Ireland are taxed at 12.5 per cent.  However, a reduction in the VAT rate here, even if that were possible, would not solve the core problem for Irish newspapers.  A lower VAT rate in Ireland could make no significant difference to the present very large price differential existing between Irish and Britisn newspapers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the VAT rate applied to newspapers in Ireland, I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that, for budgetary and other reasons, it would not be possible for the Government to provide a concession in this area.  While a rate as low as 5 per cent for newspapers would be permissible under EU rules, it would be very costly in terms of revenue foregone and would, quite understandably, give rise to immediate pressure from other sectors to be allowed the <Col N="1314" /> benefit of that trade, which would increase the cost even further.</P>
    <P>As to whether the newspaper publishers in Ireland could be absolved of their VAT liability, I must confirm that this would be contrary to the provisions of EU VAT law and, given all the circumstances involved, I have no reason to believe that raising the matter at EU level would serve any useful purpose.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>Legislation was introduced in 1970 to deal with payments within the construction industry where employment status does not exist.  The legislation introduced a withholding tax which became known as C45 tax because the C45 is the form which evidences payment of tax. Subcontractors are entitled to exemption from the withholding tax where they fulfil certain conditions e.g. they have a fixed place of business and a tax compliance history.  Such subcontractors are issued with a certificate known as C2.</P>
      <P>A more secure form C2 was introduced for the tax year 1993-94 <i>et seq.</i> The new C2 is a plastic card on which the subcontractor's photograph and signature has been encrypted.  The new C2 has substantially reduced incidences of abuse.  Where abuse is detected, it is followed up and appropriate action is taken, including, if appropriate, the withdrawal of the C2.  I am satisfied that the C2 system is working well and that its security has been enhanced by the new procedures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where a subcontractor does not qualify for a C2, tax is deducted on payments made by a principal contractor to a subcontractor under the C45 system. <Col N="1315" /> The subcontractor is entitled to set this tax against his income tax liability and to reclaim any excess.  The C45 system does not apply where the individual to whom payments are being made is an employeee of the payer.  In these circumstances the appropriate system of tax deduction is the PAYE system.</P>
    <P>Under the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> the Black Economy Monitoring Group was asked to carry out a thorough review of the operation of the C45 system and to make recommendations on action to curb abuse and to improve the system generally.  The group, which included representatives from the employers side, the trade unions, the Department of Social Welfare and the Revenue Commissioners presented its report in June 1994 and its recommendations were endorsed by the Central Review Committee of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> The question of publication of the report would be a matter for the Central Review Committee.</P>
    <P>The majority of the group's recommendations concerned closer monitoring of the system by the Revenue Commissioners, improved information flow between the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social Welfare and the redesign of forms to ensure that sufficient information is available to match income tax and social welfare records.  The Revenue Commissioners are in the process of implementing these recommendations.  Two of the recommendations will require statutory changes to carry them into effect and are being considered in the context of the Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the implementation of the recommendations of the Black Economy Monitoring Group will substantially improve the operation of the C45 system, although it may be too soon as yet to see the impact of these changes in the form of changing trends in the construction industry.</P>

      <P>Statistics on the business expansion scheme are compiled by the Revenue Commissioners on the basis of amounts invested in the scheme as formally notified to them in the tax year ending 5 April each year.  On that basis, the total number of companies for which investments were notified to the commissioners in the tax year 1993-94 was 211.  The corresponding number arising in the tax year 1994-95 up to 29 March last is 367.</P>
      <P>Individuals may invest in BES qualifying companies directly or invest through a designated investment fund. However, in all cases it is the company itself that decides whether to seek BES funding.  Investors will qualify for relief under the scheme only if they invest in qualifying companies either directly in individual companies or indirectly through a designated fund which generally undertakes a portfolio of investments. The criteria applied by investors in choosing either particular BES projects or designated investment funds is one of individual choice.  Likewise, the criteria to be applied by a designated investment fund in making BES investments is a matter for the managers of the fund concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that reliable statistics relating to the number of jobs created by the business expansion scheme are not available to enable the information <Col N="1317" /> requested by the Deputy to be provided. In late 1990, a general review of the scheme was conducted by my Department with the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of the Marine, the Department of Tourism and Transport and the Department of Industry and Commerce.  The review identified growth of approximately 4,240 jobs in 347 companies which had received almost £95 million investment under the scheme at a cost of some £49 million to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>Since 1992 the Revenue Commissioners have been collecting figures with a view to assessing the growth in employment in firms assisted by the BES.  While the figures available so far do not, in themselves, provide reliable indicators of the total number of jobs saved or created solely because of the BES, they will provide a basis for the more detailed review of the economic <Col N="1318" /> efficiency of the BES, promised in the Government programme.  That review will be completed in time for its conclusions and recommendations to be considered in the context of next year's budget and Finance Bill.</P>

      <P>It is too early in the year to make a firm assessment of the impact which the recent fluctuations in interest rates will have on fiscal performance in 1995.  Not all of the implications are negative.  For example foreign interest rates to which the Exchequer is exposed have shown <Col N="1319" /> mixed trends since the budget arithmetic was settled, and exchange rate movements are also relevant.  Further, the yield from Deposit Interest Retention Tax, would benefit from higher domestic rates and contribute to any additional costs that may have to be borne by the Exchequer in consequence of the increases.  Those costs cannot be quantified at this stage.</P>
      <P>The budget arithmetic was drawn on a prudent basis and I would expect from our analysis of changes so far that any negative implications of the interest rate changes referred to by the Deputy can be accommodated within the overall targets which I set out on 8 February last.</P>

      <Quest>in view of the fact that six Government Departments are charged with responsibility for young people, his views on whether there is a need to put in place statutory co-ordination to ensure that the needs of young people do not fall between Government Departments; if so, the plans, if any, which exist to meet this need; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>Many areas of Government activity &mdash; such as youth affairs &mdash; are, for sound organisational reasons, divided between several Departments.  The Government is conscious of the difficulties which can, occasionally, be created by such divisions of responsibility; and is determined to ensure that the arrangements do not result in any blurring of overall objectives, or lack of cohesiveness between the Departments involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I have no wish to under-play the necessity for the optimum level of co-ordination between such services where appropriate, it is reasonable to observe that, when we speak about &ldquo;young people&rdquo;, we are referring to a <Col N="1320" /> group who are as diverse in their backgrounds, interests, lifestyles, personal difficulties, and so on, as any other very large segment of society.  For this reason, it is necessary that services for young people be provided by different Departments.</P>
    <P>There is, of course, room for improvement; and to the extent that enhanced co-ordination in the area of services for young people is indicated, a number of measures have been, or are being, taken.</P>
    <P>A Joint Committee of the Dáil and the Seanad on the Family has been established.  Among the functions of this committee is to examine issues relating to the protection and enhancement of the interests of children and measures which can be taken to support them, especially with regard to child care, education and juvenile justice.  The committee is required to report on these issues to both Houses of the Oireachtas and to present its final report within two years.</P>
    <P>The Government appointed Deputy Austin Currie as Minister of State with responsibility for co-ordination of public policy with regard to children.  He has been assigned to three Departments: the Department of Health (with special responsibility for all aspects relating to child care and children's policy, particularly the implementation of the Child Care Act, 1991), the Department of Education (with special responsibility for special education) and the Department of Justice (with responsibility for legislative changes in the area of juvenile justice).  Minister Currie actively co-ordinates the approach of the Departments of Health, Justice and Education in regard to children through an inter-departmental committee which he chairs and which meets on a weekly basis.</P>
    <P>Phase 2 of the Strategic Management Initiative (or SMI) for the public service, which is currently under way, involves, as one of its critical elements, a more co-ordinated action between areas offering cognate services or sharing common policy objectives.  The SMI will strengthen considerably, and lend a <Col N="1321" /> sharper focus to, the regular contact which already takes place between those Departments which are charged with responsibility for various policies affecting young people.</P>
    <P>Finally, I do not feel that any useful purpose would be served by putting in place a statutory system of co-ordination between Departments.  Such an approach could prove to be counter-productive by creating its own rigidities when flexibility and adaptability are the critical requirements.</P>

      <Quest>whether the sale of Government assets on receivables to semi-State or State sponsored bodies, such as NTMA and HFA, amounts to a reduction in public indebtedness where the sale is financed by borrowings; whether such transactions reduce or effect the EBR; the effects, if any, they have on the PSBR; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>The exact details of any sale transaction between the various sectors of the public sector would have to be examined carefully to establish the appropriate classification under the various budgetary aggregates.  Subject to the foregoing, I have attempted to address the issues raised by the Deputy to the fullest extent possible.</P>
      <P>There are two basic aspects to the scenario outlined in the Deputy's question &mdash; firstly, the effect of the receipts accruing to the Exchequer from the sale of an asset or receivable to a semi-State/State-sponsored body and, secondly, the consequential impacts of the borrowing undertaken by that body to fund the purchase.  Both aspects are addressed under each of the following headings: The proceeds from the sale of a State asset or receivable would normally accrue to the Exchequer as a capital receipt and therefore have a positive impact on the Exchequer borrowing requirement in the year of sale. However, the resultant loss of any dividend or other stream of revenue which might have accrued to the Exchequer had the asset or receivable been retained will subsequently have an adverse impact on the EBR.  The borrowing undertaken by the semi-State/State-sponsored body to finance the purchase of the asset or receivable would not impact on the EBR.</P>
      <P>Given that receipts accruing to the Exchequer from the sale of an asset or receivable would be reflected in the EBR, they would impact to the same extent on the PSBR.  However, as the PSBR measure also includes the borrowing of local authorities and commercial semi-State or State-sponsored bodies, borrowing by such a body to fund the purchase of a State asset or receivable would also feature in the PSBR, offsetting the sum received from the sale.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The primary measures of &ldquo;public indebtedness&rdquo; are the national debt and <Col N="1323" /> general Government debt (the &ldquo;private sector&rdquo; debt of central Government, local authorities and the non-commercial semi-State or State-sponsored bodies), which is the measure used in the Maastricht Treaty.  I will deal with the Deputy's question in relation to both.</P>
    <P>As I have already explained above, the receipts arising under the scenario outlined by the Deputy will be reflected in the Exchequer borrowing requirement and, thus, will also affect the stock of national debt as defined for domestic budget purposes to the same extent. However, as the borrowings of semi-State or State-sponsored bodies do not form part of the national debt measurement, the consequential borrowing by such bodies to finance the purchase of a State asset would not be included under this heading.</P>
    <P>The impact on general Government debt would vary depending on the status of the purchasing body, i.e. whether it is part of the general Government sector as defined in the relevant EU regulations.</P>
    <P>Non-commercial semi-State or State-sponsored bodies are regarded as part of general Government and, thus, a transaction involving a sale of assets from central Government to a body of this nature would, in effect, be netted off and not affect the overall level of general Government debt.  The debt of central Government would be reduced by the amount of the receipt (assuming that the receipt is used to retire debt), while the debt of the purchasing body would be increased by a corresponding amount.</P>
    <P>If the purchasing body was a commercial semi-State or State-sponsored body, which is not regarded as part of general Government, the receipt could still be used to reduce the debt of central Government, but the consequential borrowings funding the purchase would not add to the stock of general Government debt.  Thus, such a transaction would usually lead to an overall reduction in general Government debt.  In the case of <Col N="1324" /> certain receivables, the status of the body paying the money can also be an important factor in the determination of the overall impact of these types of transactions.</P>

      <P>In my replies to questions on 24 January and 23 February, I set out in detail the grave concerns of the Government on the crisis in Chechnya.  I also outlined the actions which the Government had taken in response to the tragic course of events which have unfolded there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In November 1991, the Chechen leadership proclaimed Chechnya's independence from Russia.  On 11 December 1994, following a period of internal civil strife and a breakdown in negotiations with Moscow, Russian columns began moving into Chechnya, a constituent republic of the Russian Federation. The immediate target was the <Col N="1325" /> city of Grozny which Russian Federal forces began shelling on 18 December.</P>
    <P>Grozny's infrastructure has been virtually destroyed.  Fighting is continuing in towns to the south and east of Grozny, with heavy artillery and high altitude bombing being employed by Russian forces.  Perhaps a half a million people have been displaced from their homes.</P>
    <P>The Government has from the outset of the conflict, both bilaterally and with our European Union partners, unreservedly condemned the grave abuse of human rights and the high level of civilian casualties.  We have urged an end to the fighting and a negotiated solution through the involvement of the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE); and we are supporting the efforts of the international aid agencies to bring assistance to the victims of the conflict.</P>
    <P>While there have been periodic lulls in the fighting, this has increased again in recent days.  There have, however, been some encouraging developments. Russia has agreed to a permanent presence of an OSCE assistance group in Chechnya.  Its mandate, which is expected to be finalised shortly, will be to facilitate the delivery of humanitarian aid and the building of democratic institutions in Chechnya.  In addition, the assistance group will have a role in the promotion of human rights; it will work for a cessation of hostilities agreement and will facilitate the establishment of a negotiating framework to elaborate a lasting political solution.  The assistance group is expected to be deployed by mid-April.</P>
    <P>While we welcome the progress which has been made towards the greater involvement of the OSCE, the European Union has made clear to Russia that it is gravely concerned about the recent upsurge in fighting and that it deplores the continuing loss of life, human rights violations and destruction in Chechnya.  With our EU partners, we are continuing to insist that the fighting must stop, that negotiations should begin on a political solution, that aid <Col N="1326" /> should be delivered to those in need without hindrance, and that Russia should facilitate the rapid deployment of the OSCE assistance group.</P>
    <P>Ireland will continue to work, both bilaterally and with our European Union partners, for an end to the tragedy which has unfolded in Chechnya.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 59 and 73 together.</P>
      <P>As I informed the House in response to another question today, the Revenue Commissioners have committed very substantial resources to the battle against the illegal importation of drugs, most notably by the formation of the Customs National Drugs Team, comprising over 70 staff, in 1992.  The Deputy will be aware that major seizures of drugs have been made by customs in recent years, including the large seizure of cannabis resin at Dublin Port last week.  Every effort will continue to be made by customs, in co-operation with the other State agencies involved, to prevent smuggled drugs from reaching th streets in Dublin and elsewhere in the country.</P>
      <P>The customs service is responsible for detecting and preventing drug smuggling and, apart from the specialist Customs National Drugs Team staff, customs staff at ports and airports play an important part in detecting illegal imports of drugs.  Responsibility for drug law enforcement within the country, on the other hand, is the responsibility of the Garda Síochána.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the overall activities of the Revenue Commissioners, I should state that cases of individuals who have <Col N="1328" /> accumulated significant wealth suspected of having been derived from taxable activities which have not been disclosed for tax purposes, are investigated by the Special inquiry Branch and-or the Investigation Branch of the Revenue Commissioners.  In this context I can assure the Deputy that in any case where the commissioners obtain hard information indicating that an individual has evaded tax on income derived from illegal drugs, they will arrange to have the matter investigated.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the level of exposure of Irish financial institutions on the derivatives markets; and his views on whether, in a worst case scenario, exposure could be covered without undue damage to the Irish banking system.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been advised by the Central Bank that the scale of derivative trading by Irish banks is relatively small and is largely confined to the less exotic and more readily understandable first generation instruments such as interest rate and foreign currency swaps and forward interest rate agreements.  Contracts are largely customer based, of short term maturities, less than one year and are used for non-speculative hedging purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All credit institutions here are required to have in place rules and procedures for dealing with the management of all material risks.  A basic control, in this regard, is the separation of trading and back-office operations.  In the larger banks it is expected that the risk management function be centralised for reporting and control purposes. These rules and procedures are subject <Col N="1330" /> to the scrutiny of the internal and external auditors of the bank and are reviewed by the Central Bank in the course of on-site inspections.</P>
    <P>The Central Bank further requires banks to follow best international practice and to be aware of current thinking in this area.  For example, the recommendations in <i>Derivatives: Practices and Principles</i> published by the group of thirty in July 1993 and <i>Risk Management Guidelines for Derivatives</i> published by the Basle Committee on Banking Supervision in July 1994, endorsed by the Central Bank, have been implemented by the banks.</P>
    <P>The bank considers that adherence to the principles outlined above greatly reduces the possibility of a Barings-type situation occurring here.  Further it is considered given the level and nature of derivatives trading in Ireland, it poses no undue risk to the banking system. This whole area is, however, kept under ongoing review.</P>

      <P>Official balance of payments estimates are prepared by the Central Statistics <Col N="1333" /> Office on a quarterly basis.  However, as yet there are no figures from that office in respect of 1995.  Banking statistics are as yet available only up to January of 1995.  The figure for January showed an increase in the level of the official external reserves of nearly £300 million, which was primarily attributable to transfers from the EU.</P>
      <P>In general terms, some net overall capital outflows are entirely normal in a country such as Ireland which has a strong current account surplus.  These are of course balanced by inflows on the current account of the balance of payments.

      <P>I am not entirely clear what the Deputy has in mind.  Given that the Irish pound has fallen against the Deutschemark and some other ERM currencies and against the Yen, Ireland's trading position has improved from the point of view of exporting to the relevant countries and also in terms of competing with imports from them.</P>
      <P>On a general note, the key to ensuring the growth of Ireland's traded sector is to maintain and improve competitiveness. As the Deputy will be aware, this in return requires low inflation, wage moderation and sound management of the public finances.  The present economic climate is characterised by these factors, as well as by high growth, increasing investment and a strong balance of payments surplus.  My recent budget contained measures in the area of income tax and employee and employer PRSI which will help to further improve the climate for trade.</P>

The purpose of the scheme is to renew and update the tourist amenities and facilities in a certain limited number of seaside resorts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would stress that this new initiative is a pilot scheme and is thus of a trial or <Col N="1335" /> experimental nature.  It must therefore be applied on a limited basis in order to evaluate it efficacy.  For these reasons, it is therefore not intended to extend the scheme to Dun Laoghaire.</P>

      <Quest>the effect, if any, the proposed changes in the Finance Bill, 1995, will have on tax relief on mortgage interest and medical expenses; and the proposals, if any, he has to make changes in the tax reform programme in this area as announced in previous budgets.</Quest>

      <P>The Finance Act, 1994, provided for the introduction, on a phased basis, the standard rating of mortgage interest and voluntary health insurance tax relief. The standard rating of mortgage interest relief is being phased in over a four year period and is now in its second year.  The phasing in period for voluntary health insurance relief is two years beginning in the 1995-96 tax year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy is aware, the Government's Programme of Renewal contains the commitment that the standardisation of mortgage interest relief and voluntary health premium relief will continue and that any savings which accrue will be utilised to expand the standard <Col N="1336" /> rate tax band.  In line with this commitment I provided in the 1995 budget for a significant widening of the standard tax band.  The standard band is being widened by £700 in the case of a single person and by £1,400 in the case of a married couple.  This represents an 8.5 per cent increase in the band and is far in excess of the expected rate of inflation. The cost of this measure is more than three times the expected savings arising in the 1995-96 income tax year from the phased standardisation of the two reliefs.  This measure will be enacted in the Finance Bill 1995.</P>
    <P>The Government has no plans for any changes in this area of tax reform.</P>

        <i>Limerick East):</i> A decision by the Voluntry Health Insurance Boards whether to provide cover in respect of a service provider is a matter for the board.  It must operate as a commercial insurer particularly in the context of the Single Market which has opened the market here to competition and, since other companies providing medical insurance have such flexibility, it would be inequitable not to allow VHI the same freedom.  Draft regulations, pursuant to the Health Insurance Act, 1994, have been issued to all relevant interests and those regulations provide insurers with the flexibility to decide on the hospitals and services which they will cover.</P>

      <P>The service in question was terminated after Easter, 1994, when the number of eligible children being conveyed had fallen to five.  Under the school transport scheme, an average daily minimum of seven pupils would have been required to maintain this service.</P>
      <P>I understand that the number of eligible pupils eligible to travel on the route has since increased by one. However, the position remains that the minimum number required has not been met.</P>
      <P>It will not be open to my Department to reinstate this particular service until such time as seven eligible pupils present for transport.</P>

      <P>This is a complex matter and I will set out hereunder as concisely as I can, what I, as Minister for Justice, am doing to deal with the drugs problem.  As the Deputy will be aware, these measures are being taken within the overall context of the Government strategy to prevent drug abuse which proposes a multi-disciplinary approach requiring action in the areas of supply reduction, demand reduction and increased access to treatment and rehabilitation programmes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First, I am ensuring that the Garda have the necessary resources to deal with the problem.  In Dublin, drug units have been established in each of the city's five Garda divisions and their activities are co-ordinated through the Central Drugs Squad in Harcourt Square.  Full time drugs units now operate <Col N="1346" /> in Santry, Cabra, Raheny, Dun Laoghaire, Crumlin, Ballyfermot, Tallaght, Store Street, Pearse Street, Kevin Street and Donnybrook.</P>
    <P>Second, I will bring proposals to Government shortly designed to put in place the best arrangements for achieving a cohesive and co-ordinated response to the drugs problem by the existing law enforcement agencies. Thirdly, I am determined that the legislation recently put in place to provide for the seizure and confiscation of the proceeds of crime, including drug trafficking, be operated to the fullest possible extent.</P>
    <P>Fourth, I intend to ensure that the authorities here work closely with the European Drugs Unit with the objective of achieving the maximum exchange and co-ordination of drugs intelligence. Fifth, with regard to the question of drugs in prison, I would refer the Deputy to the detailed response I gave to the House on this subject on 14 March 1995.  Steps which are being taken to keep drugs out of the prisons include a high level of staff vigilance, closed circuit video surveillance of visits, screening of prisoners after visits and regular searches of the prisons.  In addition, it is planned to carry out a full review to establish how best to manage the problems of both illicit drugs in prison and the treatment-rehabilitation of drug-addicted offenders.</P>

      <P>I am introducing arrangements to give full effect to the recent decision of the High Court on equal treatment.  The entitlements of married women in the period of delay in implementing EC Directive 79/7 will be determined on the basis of the rules applied to married men during that period.  The amounts payable to the estimated 70,000 married women involved will consist, where appropriate, of increases in respect of adult and child dependants and unemployment assistance. In addition, they may also qualify for transitional payments as provided for in the court's decision.  Compensation will be payable based on the increase in the consumer price index from the date of entitlement to the various payments from December 1984 onwards, to the date on which the payments are made.  Consequently, the amounts now payable to the married women concerned will be the same in real terms as those paid to married men at that time, irrespective of whether the woman's husband was in employment or receiving a social welfare payment in his own right.</P>
      <P>During the period of delay in implementing the directive, the weekly rates of unemployment benefit varied in relation to the number of contributions paid by the claimant.  The amounts now payable will be net of any arrears already paid to the wife under the provisions of the European Communities (Social Welfare) Regulations, 1992, introduced in June 1992.  Under these regulations, for example where the husband was in employment, the wife would already have received payment of half the child dependant increases and will now be paid the other half of the increase for child dependants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1351" /> I might mention that the maximum duration of entitlement to unemployment benefit is 15 months and it would not be possible, therefore, for a claimant to have qualified for benefit on a continuous basis for the duration referred to by the Deputy.  The process of determining the amount payable in each individual instance is quite complex.  An explanatory leaflet setting down details of the arrangements will shortly be issued to all those who received payments in 1992-93 under the regulations and I am arranging to have a copy sent to the Deputy.</P>

      <P>Criteria for participation in community employment schemes are a matter for the Department of Enterprise and Employment, in conjunction with FÁS.  People in receipt of contributory based social welfare schemes such as deserted wife's benefit are not generally considered eligible for community employment under the criteria laid down by that Department. However, as lone parent's allowance is a recognised payment for receipt of community employment, my Department facilitates people wishing to avail of community employment by transferring <Col N="1352" /> them to that allowance where appropriate.</P>
      <P>People who transfer from deserted wife's benefit to lone parent's allowance in order to avail of community employment will be allowed to revert to their previous payment when their community employment scheme finishes, provided they still satisfy the conditions for receipt of deserted wife's benefit and they should check that this will be the case before switching.</P>
      <P>Participating in a community employment scheme is not a disqualification for deserted wife's benefit and a person's deserted wife's benefit would not be affected in these circumstances.  Similarly, an extension of the duration of a community employment scheme for an existing recipient of deserted wife's benefit would not affect their entitlement.</P>
      <P>I am arranging for my Department to contact the Department of Enterprise and Employment to review the eligibility criteria for community employment in the case of people in receipt of payments, such as deserted wife's benefit. The position of such women in relation to community employment will be kept in mind also in framing the proposed new lone parent's scheme announced in this year's budget.</P>

      <P>The Department does not have statistics on the number of invalided pensioners of semi-State bodies.

      <P>The Operational Programme for Tourism 1994-99 provides for, <i>inter alia,</i> the development of Ireland's coarse and game angling resources including bank development. The implementing authority for this measure is the Department of the Marine-Central Fisheries Board with the Department having overall responsibility and the Central Fisheries Board being responsible for the day-to-day administration-implementation of the measure.  Projected total investment in this area is over £18 million for the 1994-99 period.</P>
      <P>Certain ancillary developments, such as the purchase of angling boats and the development of bait rooms, tackle rooms, visitor changing and drying room facilities and access to angling waters are also eligible for EU grant assistance.

    <P>B = Number of such prosecutions withdrawn prior to going to Court.</P>
    <P>The detection of offences and the prosecution of suspected offenders is a matter solely for the fisheries board within whose region the alleged offence is committed.
