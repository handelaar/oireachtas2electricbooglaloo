      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 6, 7, 8, 14 and 15.</P>
      <P>It is also proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that:</P>
      <P>(1)  Nos. 6 and 7 shall be decided without debate.</P>
      <P>(2)  The proceedings in relation to No. 8, if not previously concluded, shall be brought to a conclusion today at 1.30 p.m. and the following arrangements shall apply: (i) The speech of a Minister or Minister of State and of the main spokespersons for the Fianna Fáil Party and the Progressive Democrats Party shall not exceed 20 minutes in each case; (ii) The speech of each other Member called upon shall not exceed 15 minutes in each case; and (iii) A Minister or Minister of State shall be called upon not less than 15 minutes before the debate is due to conclude to make a speech in reply.</P>

Are the proposals for dealing with No. 8 satisfactory and agreed? <Col N="1614" /> Agreed.  Is the proposal in respect of Private Members' Business that it conclude at 8.30 p.m. satisfactory and agreed?  Agreed.</P>

      <P>In fairness to the Tánaiste there were two questions I wanted to ask the Taoiseach.  The Taoiseach's office usually informs me if the Taoiseach is unable to be in the House for the Order of Business but obviously he is not available today for some other reason.  I had been pursuing the issue of the implementation of the recommendations of the Costello report with the Taoiseach.  Last year there was a plan to bring in a Bill dealing with charitable organisations to deal with that particular issue.  Perhaps the Tánaiste would raise that issue at Government.  I have pursued the matter with the Taoiseach on a number of occasions and he continues to say he will come back to me.</P>

      <P>In regard to the legislative programme, may I ask the Tánaiste, in view of the fact that aspersions were cast in this House yesterday on previous Fianna Fáil appointed Attorneys General who are now on the Bench, when is it proposed to introduce the Courts and Court Officers Bill to enable people to be appointed to the Bench by an independent system?  In asking that question I am not casting any aspersions on the towering intellectual giants appointed to the Bench over the last four to five months.</P>

      <P>That in accordance with the recommendation of the Dáil Committee on Procedure and Privileges, with effect from 31st May, 1995, until further notice in the 27th Dáil, the following be adopted as an additional Standing Order of Dáil Éireann:</P>
      <P>53A (1)  A member shall not make an utterance in the nature of being defamatory and where a member makes such an utterance it may be <i>prima facie</i> an abuse of privilege, subject to the provisions of this Order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2)  (a)  If the defamatory nature of the utterance is apparent at the <Col N="1619" /> time it was made during the course of proceedings, the Ceann Comhairle shall direct that the utterance be withdrawn without qualification.</P>
    <P>(b)  If the member refuses to withdraw the utterance without qualification the Ceann Comhairle shall treat the matter as one of disorder: Provided that the member may claim that the matter be referred to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges in which case no further action shall be taken thereon by the Ceann Comhairle at that point.</P>
    <P>(3)  If the defamatory nature of the utterance is not apparent at the time during the course of proceedings and at the earliest opportunity but not later than two weeks after the making of the utterance:</P>
    <P>(a)  the alleged abuse of privilege is raised by a member with a request that it be considered by the Ceann Comhairle or referral to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges directly is sought by a member of way of motion, or</P>
    <P>(b)  where a person who has been referred to by name, or in such a way as to be readily identifiable, in the Dáil, makes a submission in writing to the Ceann Comhairle&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  claiming that the person has been adversely affected by the making of an utterance in the nature of being defamatory within the meaning of this Order,</P>
    <P>(ii)  requesting that the person be able to incorporate an appropriate response in the parliamentary record,</P>
    <P>if the Ceann Comhairle is satisfied:</P>
    <P>(c)  that the member's request or the subject of the submission is not so obviously trivial or the submission so frivolous, vexatious or offensive in character as to make it inappropriate that further action be <Col N="1620" /> taken or that it be considered by the Committee; and</P>
    <P>(d)  that it is practicable for the Committee to consider the member's request or the submission under this Order</P>
    <P>the Ceann Comhairle may&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  decide that no action is required in respect of the member's request or the submission, or</P>
    <P>(ii)   require the member who made the utterance to make a personal explanation to the House in effect to withdraw without qualification the utterance made or to clarify otherwise the circumstances that gave rise to the utterance as may be deemed appropriate, or</P>
    <P>(iii)   refer the member's request or the submission to the Committee.</P>
    <P>(4)  Where the request or submission is referred to the Committee:</P>
    <P>(a)  The Committee may decide not to consider the request or submission referred to it under this Order if the Committee considers that the subject of the request or submission is not sufficiently serious or is frivolous, vexatious or offensive in character, and such a decision shall be reported to the Dáil.</P>
    <P>(b)  If the Committee decides to consider a request or submission under this Order, the Committee may invite the member who made the utterance and such other members as the Committee may deem appropriate to appear before the Committee to put his or her case.</P>
    <P>(c)  The Committee shall not publish a submission referred to it under this Order or its proceedings in relation to such a submission, but <Col N="1621" /> may present minutes of its proceedings and all or part of such submission to the Dáil.</P>
    <P>(d)  In considering a request or submission under this Order and reporting to the Dáil the Committee shall not consider or judge the truth of any statements made in the Dáil or of the submission.</P>
    <P>(5)  In its report to the Dáil on a request or submission under this Order, the Committee may make any of the following recommendations:</P>
    <P>(a)  that no further action be taken by the Dáil or by the Committee in relation to the submission; or</P>
    <P>(b)  if the Committee decides that <i>prima facie</i> an abuse of privilege has occurred&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  that a response by the person who made the submission, in terms specified in the report and agreed to by the person and the Committee, be published in the official report or be laid before the Dáil or recorded in such manner as may be deemed appropriate by the Committee, or</P>
    <P>(ii)  may require the member who made the utterance to make a personal explanation to the House in effect to withdraw without qualification the utterance made or to clarify otherwise the circumstances that gave rise to the utterance as may be deemed appropriate, or</P>
    <P>(iii)  if the member refuses to make a personal explanation, the Ceann Comhairle shall at the commencement of business on the next sitting day on which the member is present, reprimand the member in his/her place provided that any decision taken by the Committee under this paragraph shall require the support of three quarters of the members present and voting.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1622" /> (6)  A document presented to the Dáil under this Order:</P>
    <P>(a)  in the case of a response by a person who made a submission, shall be succinct and strictly relevant to the questions at issue and shall not contain anything offensive in character; and</P>
    <P>(b)  shall not contain any matter the publication of which would have the effect of:</P>
    <P>(i)  unreasonably adversely affecting or injuring a person, or unreasonably invading a person's privacy, in the manner referred to in paragraph (9) of this Order,</P>
    <P>(ii)  unreasonably adding to or aggravating any such adverse effect, injury or invasion of privacy suffered by a person.</P>
    <P>(7)  In considering a matter under this Order the Ceann Comhairle or the Committee, as the case may be, shall take into account the following:</P>
    <P>(a)  whether the member who made the utterance did so in a responsible manner, acted in good faith, and ensured, as far as is practicable, that the utterance reflecting adversely on a person was soundly based,</P>
    <P>(b)  that the said member made a personal explanation in effect to withdraw the defamatory nature of the utterance, and</P>
    <P>(c)  the extent to which&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  the substance of the utterance was already in the public domain by way of reports in the media; or</P>
    <P>(ii)  the member had reasonable excuse or otherwise for making the utterance.</P>
    <P>(8)  Notwithstanding the provisions of this Order:</P>
    <P>&mdash;a member who considers that it is in the public interest for him or her to make an utterance which could <Col N="1623" /> be construed as being in the nature of defamatory, he or she may give prior private notice to the Ceann Comhairle of his or her intention to make such an utterance and the reasons therefor; and such notice shall be taken into account in the consideration of the application of the provisions of this Order.</P>
    <P>&mdash;the Ceann Comhairle may at any time on his or her own volition refer an utterance in the nature of being defamatory to the Committee.</P>
    <P>(9)  For the purposes of this Order:</P>
    <P>An &ldquo;utterance in the nature of being defamatory&rdquo; shall mean an utterance which, in the opinion of the Ceann Comhairle or of the Committee could be construed as being defamatory if made other than in the course of Parliamentary proceedings whereby a person who has been referred to by name or in such a way as to be readily identifiable has been adversely affected in reputation or in respect of dealings or association with others, or injured in occupation, trade, office or financial credit, or that the person's privacy has been unreasonably invaded, by reason of that reference to the person;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Committee&rdquo; shall mean either the Dáil Committee on Procedure and Privileges or a sub-Committee thereof;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Proceedings&rdquo; shall mean parliamentary proceedings of the Dáil, a select or special Committee or a sub-Committee thereof.'.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to my predecessor, now Minister for Defence and the Marine, Deputy Barrett, who, in the very short period of five months from his appointment as Government Chief Whip last December, was so effective in pushing the implementation of the Government's Oireachtas reform proposals.</P>
    <P>The motion before the House arises from the commitment in <i>A Government</i><Col N="1624" /><i>of Renewal</i> to ask the Committee on Procedures and Privileges:</P>
    <P>to examine and report on the procedures and remedies required to ensure privilege afforded to Members is carefully used at all times, and that the rules of misconduct as they apply to any misleading of the House are revised.</P>
    <P>Exactly a month after his appointment and the Government coming to office, Deputy Barrett so requested the Committee.</P>
    <P>Article 15.13 of the Constitution states, <i>inter alia,</i> that&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>The members of each House of the Oireachtas... shall not, in respect of any utterance in either House, be amenable to any court or any authority other than the House itself.</P>
    <P>That is a very esteemed privilege and places a heavy responsibility on Members.</P>
    <P>There have always been allegations, rightly or wrongly, about the abuse by Members of the privilege concept in this House.  In an effort to eliminate such allegations and maintain the high standing which Members should have in our society, the three parties coming into Government last December agreed that the matter should be referred to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges for examination and report.</P>
    <P>The Committee on Procedure and Privileges decided at the end of January to establish a sub-committee representative of the five biggest parties in the House on the issue of Members' privilege. The sub-committee was directed to consider the matter under the following headings:</P>
    <P>1.  What constitutes abuse of privilege?</P>
    <P>2.  How to provide the necessary mechanism to examine if an abuse has occurred.</P>
    <P>3.  Rules of misconduct as they apply to any misleading of the House.</P>
    <P>4.  Sanctions.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1625" /> The issue of misleading the House was felt by the sub-committee to be a completely different and wider issue from that of utterances in the House which deserved consideration separately at a later stage.  The more substantial issue of penalities or sanctions was not addressed by the sub-committee because of possible constitutional implications.</P>
    <P>The sub-committee recommended that the wider aspects of privilege i.e. those relating to protection of parliament should be considered at a later stage.</P>
    <P>Perhaps these matters might be appropriate for consideration by the Constitution Review Group recently established by the Government and the proposed all-party committee on the Constitution to be established next year.</P>
    <P>The sub-committee which, therefore, addressed itself solely to the narrow aspect of Members' privilege as it applies to defamatory remarks or utterances by Members in the House, submitted its report to the Committee on Procedure and Privilege on 23 March. The committee to which we entrust such sensitive matters adopted the report on 5 April with only one dissenting voice &mdash; that of the Progressive Democrats' representative &mdash; to the approval of the draft sessional order contained in the report of the sub-committee.</P>
    <P>The draft Standing Order now before the House is well balanced and will put the absolute privilege of Members on a sounder footing.  While rather long it is innovative, and yet simple, being based on the Australian Senate procedure which has been operating successfully since 1988.  The sub-committee under the Chairpersonship of Deputy Dukes is to be congratulated on its work.</P>
    <P>An alleged defamatory remark may no longer be treated and summarily dismissed as one of disorder but can be given the benefit of further consideration by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.</P>
    <P>The strict parliamentary rule in regard to naming persons can be relaxed by the introduction of the proposal <Col N="1626" /> which puts in place a mechanism for dealing with alleged defamatory remarks for the first time.  This will enable naming of persons in the House which is more in line with everyday usage in, for example, the media.</P>
    <P>The idea of allowing an individual who felt slighted to complain to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, while maintaining.  A Cheann Comhairle, your discretion in the matter will make the public feel they now have an added measure of protection for their good name.  Any organisation or group of individuals which strictly sets high levels of performance and quality for its members and rejects vehemently any deviation from those standards will gain in stature and general regard.  This effect can only be good for the standing of the House and the perception of the integrity of its Members.  Those who oppose the draft Standing Order have a duty not just to specify their opposition but to spell out an alternative approach, which this has not been done to date.</P>
    <P>There has been some misinformed comment about the proposed Standing Order that its content in some ways impinge on the constitutional rights of Members in that it bypasses the Ceann Comhairle.  Have the critics examined the draft Standing Order?  If they did do so, surely they would have been aware of the central role placed on the Ceann Comhairle in respect of alleged defamtory utterances.  I have even read criticism stating that, by disciplining a Member of the House, it would prejudice any subsequent legal action in a court of law.  Surely any organisation, whether it be the Law Society, the Golfing Union of Ireland or whoever, is entitled to impose standards and disciplinary measures on its members.  Why should the Houses of the Oireachtas not have the same right &mdash; especially when it is requested, decided and accepted by those Members through their representatives on the Committee on Procedure and Privileges?</P>
    <P>Let us for a moment reflect on what is proposed in the Standing Order.  The first subparagraph states that a Member <Col N="1627" /> shall not make an utterance in the nature of being defamatory and where a Member makes such an utterance it may be, <i>prima facie,</i> an abuse of privilege. Subparagraph (2) deals with withdrawal of utterances, subparagraph (3) with the manner in which allegations may be investigated, subparagraph (4) with what happens when the request or submission is referred to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, subparagraph (5) with the report of the committee to the Dáil, subparagraph (6) presentation of a document to the Dáil under the Order, subparagraph (7) with what the Ceann Comhairle shall take into account, subparagraph (8) with exceptions while subparagraph (9) defines a defamatory utterance.</P>
    <P>In the Programme for Government openness, transparency and accountability are mentioned more than a few times to emphasise the importance we attach to those principles.  This draft Standing Order gives a tangible meaning to them along with the other Oireachtas reforming measures we have introduced to date e.g. the publication of a list of promised legislation to assist the Ceann Comhairle and Members; the provision that Ministers and Ministers of State may discuss, through the legislative committees, proposals for legislation; the introduction of procedures to allow legislative committees to hear evidence from persons and organisations; the provision that all appointees to high office shall attend at relevant committees subject to the legal constraints of their office; the provision that Ministers and Ministers of State may appear before committees to discuss current policies and their implementation in their Departments.</P>
    <P>The proposed Standing Order is a sessional one and can be reviewed in due course by which time Members will have practical experience of how it operates.</P>
    <P>The sub-committee of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges noted that submissions to committees of the Oireachtas are not covered by privilege <Col N="1628" /> and recommended that this matter be addressed as soon as possible.  Deputies will be aware that the drafting of a Bill on Privilege and Compellability of Witnesses appearing before Oireachtas committees is well advanced.  It is intended that the Bill will grant absolute privilege to witnesses attending before Oireachtas committees.  The draft Bill which was being prepared by the previous Administration had to be reviewed by the incoming Government in the light of our commitments in the policy document <i>A Government of Renewal</i>.  This review is now almost complete and I hope that the Bill will be published this session.</P>
    <P>For all the reasons I have outlined and for the protection of the basic right to privacy and integrity, I commend this motion to the House.  In doing so, I hope I can continue the good work of my predecessor in ensuring that further Oireachtas reforming measures are brought forward speedily.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister of State on his appointment as Government Chief Whip and wish him well in the future.  I also thank his predecessor Deputy Seán Barrett, for his assistance during the past five months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While we are critical of the lack of progress in certain areas, in this instance the Government is fulfilling its commitment in the Programme for <i>A Government of Renewal</i> to investigate the question of privilege in relation to remarks made by Members in this House.  With Deputy Dukes and others, I was a member of the sub-committee of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges set up to examine this question.  We decided that rather than consider the broader aspects it would be best to look at a more restrictive aspect of privilege in relation to utterances made in this House, sometimes without justification. This approach was adopted not because the Government decided this would be a good thing to do but because a number of complaints had been made by people who felt they had no redress outside the House for remarks made inside <Col N="1629" /> the House.  While some criticism has been expressed in the media about the current proposal, it has to be accepted that we are trying to be reasonable, fair and balanced in dealing with everyone.</P>
    <P>The Chair has a responsibility to ensure that debates are conducted in an orderly fashion.  Under a convention he is able to curtail the Member in making remarks about a person outside the House.  The Ceann Comhairle, the Leas-Cheann Comhairle or the acting chairman often reprimands a speaker who names a person outside the House.  That is a good convention.  Unfortunately &mdash; there have been many examples in recent years &mdash; it has been, and continues to be, abused despite the best efforts of the Chair.</P>
    <P>When I was first elected to this House I felt it was a privilege to represent the people to be able to say what I liked about people outside it without their having any recourse but this privilege cannot be abused.  I was brought up to believe and it was reinforced by my legal training that people are entitled to their good name and to have some recourse if it is called into question.  It is only right that the House should consider this aspect and endeavour as best it can &mdash; without doing away with the right of Deputies to say what they wish &mdash; to ensure that remarks made by the Deputy will later have to be justified by him or her.  The subcommittee therefore focused on the narrow aspect of utterances made on the floor of the House. We are really only reinforcing the concept that there is always recourse to the Ceann Comhairle and the Committee on Procedure and Privilege.  The net issue in all of this is the right of reply by people outside the House.  This proposal was approved by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges although I accept one party was not in favour; it will have to justify its own position.  What we are doing in effect is giving people outside the House the right of reply to utterances made against them in the House. We are taking on board what has been <Col N="1630" /> the position for many years in the Australian Senate to which aggrieved persons can make a submission.  Under this proposal the right to make a submission will be restricted and subject, rightly, to stringent rules.  It is most important that this be the case, otherwise there could be a deluge of submissions on frivolous matters.  This has been taken into account and the order, as proposed, tries to ensure that submissions will only be accepted where the Committee on Procedure and Privileges is satisfied that there has been, <i>prima facie,</i> an abuse of privilege.  In that event it is possible, not definite, that the contents of the submission would be included in the report of the Dáil and the affected person would at least have their say.  In other words, the Deputy would not be the only person to have a say in the matter.</P>
    <P>This issue has been the subject of a number of complaints from people.  We have heard many times about allegations made on the floor of this House in regard to major issues such as the beef tribunal, but what brought this matter to the attention of many members of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges was that people feel aggrieved at statements which have nothing to do with the beef tribunal or other much publicised issues but relate to small issues that are particularly important to them.</P>
    <P>One such instance relates to references made by Deputy Doyle in an Adjournment Debate about Beaumont Hospital.  At the time Doctor Hugh Staunton felt obliged, through solicitors, to complain to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  The complaint was considered but no formal report was issued.  The Committee on Procedure and Privileges decided there was no abuse or breach of the privilege on that occasion and so informed the complainants. While these issues were put on the public record, the complainants did not have a right of reply or recourse to the courts.  Even though the committee believed there was no privilege <Col N="1631" /> abuse, the person who felt, and probably still feels aggrieved did not have an opportunity to respond.</P>
    <P>Another complaint made by a man who felt aggrieved at allegations made in this House at a time when there was heightened political pressure on the Government related to what I believe was the most ludicrous statement ever made in this House, which was subsequently deemed to be totally unfounded, that is the allegation by Deputy Rabbitte, now Minister of State, or two-thirds Minister of State, about a letter on the file of the Brendan Smyth case which, he said, would rock the foundations of the State.  The person involved stated that he was not a member of Opus Dei or any religious organisation. He felt that the allegations made on that occasion were wrong and that something should be done about it. He wanted some recourse in that regard but that was not possible.  Neither was it possible for the other people implicated, some of them very senior figures, to do anything about the matter.</P>
    <P>I was a member of the sub-committee of the Select Committee on Legislation and Security that examined this matter and I requested that Deputy Rabbitte be brought before the committee but other members believed that was not necessary, mainly because his remarks had been found to be unwarranted.  I questioned two of the witnesses, Dr. Martin Mansergh and, I think, Deputy Reynolds &mdash; or perhaps it was the Tánaiste, Deputy Spring &mdash; I cannot remember &mdash; on the effect those remarks had on the political situation at the time.  Again I would point out that the remarks were totally unwarranted and untrue, yet Deputy Rabbitte had his reward.  Regardless of what side of the House one is on, such remarks should not be made.</P>
    <P>Another complaint was made recently by a person from the midlands about references by a Deputy in this House in November 1994.  The man complained to the chairman of the <Col N="1632" /> Committee on Procedure and Privileges, stating:</P>
    <P>While speaking he [the Deputy] referred to a person, although not named can only be regarded as myself and proceeded to defame me personally and professionally.  The defamation has been confirmed to me by my Solicitor.  As you are aware the doctrine of Parliamentary Privilege appears to preclude me from taking action through the Courts, so I am requesting you to ask the Deputy to justify his comments.</P>
    <P>The complainant also wrote to Deputy John Bruton who was then Leader of the Opposition asking him to take action in this regard.  This person wanted to sue the Deputy who made those remarks but could not do so due to the absolute privilege.  If those remarks had been made outside this House I have no doubt court action would have been taken.</P>
    <P>Those are some examples of complaints made and there have been many more down the years.  Members of this House should remember that while we have a privilege we should not abuse it. Some measure is necessary to deal with this matter and the sessional order will in no way take away the privilege of Members, as has been suggested.  It is a procedure whereby citizens will have a right of reply on issues they believe affect them.  It will provide for some censure of Deputies in the event of their peers believing that they have in some way overstepped the mark in terms of statements made.</P>
    <P>On balance this is a good order.  It was discussed by the Fianna Fáil Party Front Bench who believe that in view of what happened in recent years it is a balanced and reasonable approach to a problem which has increased down the years. The Fianna Fáil Party supports this sessional order.  I congratulate the three Government parties on their attitude to this matter.  I am delighted that particularly the Labour Party and Democratic Left fully support the order because they more than the Fine Gael Party <Col N="1633" /> have made a trade of making allegations in the House.  I would like to hear the personal views of Deputy Rabbitte, the Tánaiste, Deputy Spring, and former Members such as Barry Desmond on this sessional order.</P>
    <P>Deputy Rabbitte was recently interviewed on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; about the order and I am not sure whether he knew what he was talking about because he spoke about the Bill on privilege and compellability of witnesses which is a completely different matter.  Perhaps between that interview and now the Minister of State has had an opportunity to consider the sessional order.  I am glad that he and his party, and the Labour Party, fully support it.  Perhaps as a result we may not have a repetition of some of the outrageous statements made by them in recent years.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil fully supports the right of reply of people outside this House to remarks made inside the House. Despite what some of the psuedo liberals say, that this order will in some way prevent Deputies from saying what they like in this House &mdash; I do not agree &mdash; they must examine their consciences because people outside this House, who are wary and aware of remarks made here, must be protected.  I fully commend this sessional order to the House.</P>

      <P>It is depressing that other parties in the House are apparently supportive of these measures and do not see hazard lights implicit in the terms of this order.  That indicates a failure to understand parliamentary democracy and the checks and balances essential in it.  It indicates a failure to understand the yet unevolved role of this House as an inquiring body as distinct from a legislative body.  We are only starting to discover that this House has a duty not only to legislate, but to call the Government of the day to account and have an inquiring role through committees and procedures of this House by putting down parliamentary questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is notable that the measures in the motion before us would not have been <Col N="1634" /> debated and would have been passed without debate with many Members and the general public being unaware of what they propose to introduce if I had not insisted that it be debated.  We will not win a vote on this motion, but a dissenting voice should be heard because these proposals are far reaching and diminish an important tool of democracy, the ability of individual Members to make controversial utterances which have often been made in the House and found to be true.</P>
    <P>The motion before us proposes to introduce new procedures for dealing with alleged abuse of privilege by Dáil Deputies.  Ironically, those proposals have been made by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, one of its main functions being to protect the Members and privileges in this House in a parliamentary democracy.  That is particularly important <i>vis-á-vis</i> the Government of the day.  Mine was the only dissenting voice at the sub-committee established by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges to examine these issues.  This order will permit Deputies to be reprimanded.  It was obvious when we considered it that there would be constitutional difficulties in introducing any sanctions in this House.  There was a backsliding from that position and we found we were skirting the edges, trying to put in place an unnecessary procedure because those in place dispensed by the Ceann Comhairle over the years are adequate. This motion is a weak-minded attempt to introduce an unnecessary procedure under the guise of Dáil reform.  Has the Attorney General looked at these proposals?</P>

      <P>I will be hauled before the Committee on Procedure and Privileges for referring to him.  Has anybody with legal training considered these proposals because they will put in place a right of reply to people outside this House arising out of alleged abuse of privilege by Members.  There is a constitutional guarantee that a Member shall not be amenable, because of utterances, for any statement made in this House. This proposal introduces a measure whereby people outside the House can bring in lawyers and the Committee on Procedure and Privileges could be turned into an alternative Circuit Court. This proposal has implications for the Committee on Procedure and Privileges. We are involving ourselves in an unnecessary procedure which will diminish the right of free speech of Members.  It is sadly ironic that in this of all weeks, when we are still reeling from the fall-out from issues of accountability, the House should be asked to agree to diminish the important parliamentary right of free speech and debate in the public interest.</P>
      <P>The proposals are unnecessary and the procedures in place adequate.  The system of regulation through the Ceann Comhairle has always worked well in the past and Members very rarely abuse Dáil privilege.  In the 75 years since the foundation of the State there have been very few abuses of Dáil privilege.  One of the features of the last 75 years is how little those rights have been used and how seldom there has been a recognition of the power of individual Deputies to raise issues of public interest challenging the Executive which might be termed scandalous, hurtful and defamatory, but they are not defamatory if they are true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This proposal makes presumptions about utterances that Deputies might make by introducing a <i>prima facie</i> assumption that an utterance in the nature of being defamatory can be subject to the rigmarole of procedure.  A diagram was introduced at the sub-committee of the Committee on Procedure and <Col N="1636" /> Privileges illustrating the existing procedure which is simple and effective. We were then shown a diagram of the proposed new procedure which is a monumental disaster.  When this complicated new mechanism, an alternative system for dealing with a Member, is introduced or a member of the public can write to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges which may involve all types of investigations, a Member may be called before that committee to account for himself or herself. I challenge the competency of that committee to make a finding of fact that something is defamatory.  It could take several months to investigate matters, particularly if a Deputy does not facilitate the committee by refusing to reveal the source of information and claims a constitutional right not to reveal that source while claiming the right to make allegations.  While that rigmarole of procedure is being followed it appears that a motion of substance concerning similar allegations is not allowed to be moved during the stages of that procedure. In other words, a substantive motion could not be tabled in the House while an internal investigation by a Deputy's peers is under way.  Hazard lights should be going on all over the House concerning this proposal, but my party is the only voice challenging the right of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges in this matter.</P>
    <P>When I was appointed to the sub-committee I said that our party opposes in principle any attempt to interfere with Dáil privilege with a view to diminishing the important and constitutionally protected right of a Dáil Deputy to raise matters of public importance without fear of sanction or reprimand inside or outside the House.  Dáil privilege is a vital tool of democracy.  Putting questions is probably the only way that the Dáil, via Members representing the people, can hold the Executive to account.  We all know from bitter recent experience, not only in this Administration but in the previous Government, that there is a serious culture of evasion influencing the way in which <Col N="1637" /> questions are replied to in this House. Failure to answer questions resulted in the beef tribunal, the Brendan Smyth affair, the Masri and the Arcon affairs. Privileges of this House are being persistently abused by Ministers failing to answer questions truthfully and straightforwardly. That is one of the main recommendations which emerged from the report of the inquiry into the beef tribunal.  It was clear from the evidence heard during the beef tribunal that if questions had been answered properly and straightforwardly there would have been no need for a tribunal.</P>
    <P>The orginal brief of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges was to examine the issue of Members' privilege as set out in Deputy Barrett's letter of 16 January 1995 to the committee, which asks the Committee on Procedure and Privilege to examine and report on the procedures and remedies to ensure that the privilege offered to Members is carefully used at all times and that the rules of misconduct as they apply to any misleading of the House are revised.  We do not have the whole picture, but a focus on the individual rights of Members and their potential abuse of Dáil privilege.  The bigger issue of Ministers misleading the House is not dealt with in this measure as that was much too big to tackle.  Why is it necessary to proceed with this order, particularly following a week when the Dáil was seriously misled?</P>
    <P>I was a member of the special sub-committee established by the Committee on Procedure and Privilege to examine these matters and report back to the House.  Members will note that the order is much narrower than the original brief of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  The questions of abuse of parliamentary privilege and offences against Parliament have been omitted.  The House should deal with matters relating to offences against Parliament committed by Ministers who fail to account to the House on State management. The order refers to an &ldquo;utterances in the nature of being defamatory&rdquo;. Implicit in that is the curious <Col N="1638" /> assumption that anything derogatory is necessarily defamatory, unless the Member proves otherwise.  It is fallacious to assume that a Member is always wrong.  As we know Members have frequently been right.  The order introduces a <i>prima facie</i> presumption that such utterances may be an abuse of privilege.  That is wrong and we oppose it in principle.</P>
    <P>Members should recall that allegations made on 10 May 1989 in respect of export credit insurance were denied in terms of outrage and abuse by the then Minister, Deputy Ray Burke.  The Deputy making the allegation was accused by the Chair of abusing privilege when in fact the only abuse of privilege was by the then Minister, not by Deputy O'Malley.  At approximately the same time, Deputies Desmond and Mac Giolla made allegations about malpractices in certain Goodman factories and were roundly abused both inside and outside the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Accusations were made of national sabotage and of a reckless attempt to cause serious damage to our beef industry.  To bring the matter into more recent focus, had I alleged in the House two weeks ago that the Attorney General's office was failing deliberately to deal with correspondence from solicitors for the victims in the Fr. Brendan Smyth case and if I had gone further &mdash; had I known it &mdash; and suggested that there was a conflict of interest between the Attorney General and Mr. Matthew Russell, there is no doubt I would have been roundly abused.  Under these regulations I would have been hauled before the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and accused of abusing my privilege by naming people outside the House. While I would be careful not to name people outside the House, if, for example, I were criticising the DPP, the chairmen of State boards or making <Col N="1639" /> statements about corruption in Government Departments, it would be necessary to name them.  That privilege should exist.</P>

      <P>If we fail to get answers to questions in the House &mdash; as is usually the case &mdash; frequently the only recourse for a Member is to make allegations under privilege.  That is an important tool of the House.  The party of which the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte is a member created a trade in allegations.  Perhaps they believe they will always be in Government and do not want Members on this side of the House to enjoy benefits they are enjoying.  I would like to hear the comments of the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, in this regard.  If this order were passed without debate, many Members would not be aware of its implications.</P>
      <P>Privilege did not accidentally become a feature of parliamentary democracy.  It is enshrined in the Constitution, having been for centuries an essential tool for raising matters of public importance. The fact that a Member may in the white heat of politics and debate go a little too far in making a political point or raising an issue of public interest does not justify this House or, in particular, the Committee on Procedure and Privileges which is supposed to protect the rights of the Dáil to diminish or restrict privilege.  It is extraordinary that the committee, which is an all-party private committee of the House, chaired by the Ceann Comhairle, should put forward this incongruous proposal diminishing the power of this House to hold the Government to account.  One of the most important functions of the committee is to assert, not diminish, restrict or curtail, the rights of Members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The procedures of the House are pitched to favour the Government.  We are all aware of how the Taoiseach last week managed to transfer a difficult question to another Minister, but then <Col N="1640" /> decided to take responsibility for it.  He had the power to manipulate the procedures of the House to avoid answering an awkward question and to suit his own administrative and political convenience. When he eventually took the question he failed to answer it on the grounds of fair procedures.  Those same fair procedures were applicable at 10 p.m. that evening when he revealed the information he withheld from me and the House at 3 p.m. in the afternoon. On &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; the following day the nation listened in disbelief to the Taoiseach justify his actions by claiming that the Deputy did not ask the relevant question.</P>
    <P>Following last week's events we are all aware the House can be abused for political and administrative convenience. It can be thwarted for the sake of a personnel matter.  The Taoiseach made a calculated choice to suspend the House's right to receive a reply to a parliamentary question to give him more time to deal with a personnel matter.  I challenge his right to do that.  This House had the right to receive a factural reply to that question.  In the past week the rights of Members of the House have been set aside at the whim or convenience of the Government.  We oppose these measures.  The Ceann Comhairle's restrictions in dealing with such matters are adequate and most Members do not abuse Dáil privilege. They use it only when they have come to the end of their tether in trying to get replies to questions and must make an allegation under privilege to bring a matter into the public domain.  The only tool a Deputy can use for bringing a matter into the public domain is to raise it in this House.</P>
    <P>I challenge the capacity of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges to find as fact that something I say in the House is defamatory.  Only a court can so determine.  Many utterances may be outrageous, hurtful and, in the nature of being defamatory, they could be deemed to be so, but they may also be true.  This new mechanism represents a pyramid of unnecessary procedure <Col N="1641" /> which could take a long time to implement.  It is proposed under the badge of renewal, is regressive and introduces an unnecessary restriction. Also, apart from abusing and seeking to interfere with individual Members' rights, it introduces a right of reply to people outside the House.  The Constitution states that any utterance in this House shall not be amenable to any court or authority outside the House. While we are entitled to order the procedures of the House, we are not entitled to diminish the rights enshrined in the Constitution to ensure free debate.  Article 15.10 of the Constitution provides:</P>
    <P>Each House shall make its own rules and standing orders, with power to attach penalties for their infringement, and shall have power to ensure freedom of debate, to protect its official documents and the private papers of its members, and to protect itself and its members against any person or persons interfering with, molesting or attempting to corrupt its members in the exercise of their duties.</P>
    <P>Article 15.12 states:</P>
    <P>All official reports and publications of the Oireachtas or of either House thereof and utterances made in either House wherever published shall be privileged.</P>
    <P>Article 15.13 states:</P>
    <P>The members of each House of the Oireachtas shall... not, in respect of any utterance in either House, be amenable to any court or any authority other than the House itself.</P>
    <P>That is the basic constitutional framework to which we should adhere.</P>
    <P>For a nation of writers, poets, dramatists and great orators which has expressed itself very ably over the centuries, we place very little value on free speech.  This motion is another example <Col N="1642" /> of whittling away free speech in this most important Chamber where it must be protected.  The motion must be resisted not only because it is vital in a democracy that elected representatives participate freely in parliamentary debate but also because the Constitution provides that Deputies are only amenable to the House.  They are not and never have been amenable to any person outside this House, and that is how it should be.</P>

      <P>Deputy Byrne would do well to consult with his allegator colleagues in his party who have made his name in the House by using privilege properly by raising issues of public importance without fear.  The Deputy, as a member of that sub-committee, is colluding with the other parties in this House in diminishing the rights of Members.</P>
      <P>Any sanction or reprimand introduced on foot of this order will be worn by this party as a badge of honour.  We will not adhere to these procedures.</P>

      <P>I am somewhat taken aback by Deputy O'Donnell's concluding remarks that her party will not be amenable to this order.  That is not the way we should conduct our business. The Deputy is entitled to her opinion on this measure, as is her party, but I found that some of her arguments would give one cause to have second thoughts. However, I support this motion.</P>
      <P>In his opening remarks, the Minister of State, Deputy Higgins referred to the fact that Deputy Barrett brought forward this measure.  If the Minister of State can lay his hands on a copy of the aborted Fianna Fáil-Labour pact, which was substantially subsumed into the Programme for <i>A Government of Renewal</i> in the area of Oireachtas reform, he will find that it already contained this proposal.</P>
      <P>I accept Deputy O'Donnell's point that most Members respect the privilege they have in this House and have respected it in the past.  I would not like to see that privilege diminished but, unfortunately, over the past seven years since I came into this House, a number of Deputies have abused it and gone beyond the bounds of the normal decent behaviour we would expect of people operating under privilege.  Those Members should be made amenable to the House and to a committee of the House, not to anybody outside it, as has been suggested.</P>

      <P>The three most recent cases involved the Minister of State Deputy Rabbitte, the Minister of State Deputy Doyle and Deputy Paul McGrath.  They made scurrilous allegations in this House without having a shred of evidence to support them.  I have no difficulty with some of the allegations made here about the beef tribunal. Serious concern was expressed by Deputies who raised questions here in the House, a subsequent investigation took place and we know its outcome.  I <Col N="1644" /> have a difficulty, however, with a Deputy standing up in this House and making the most outrageous statements without a shred of evidence to support them.  He or she may act on hearsay or because of an article read in a newspaper. That has been happening more frequently in the recent past.</P>
      <P>I have no difficulty with the general cut and thrust of political debate in this House.  The office of the Attorney General, which is very much in the news at the moment, can become involved in the cut and thrust of the political scene because the Attorney General is a political appointee and the Taoiseach is responsible for him in this House.  I have no difficulty with people making allegations in regard to how he or anyone else carries out their business.  That is not what we are talking about; we are talking about personal allegations levelled against people outside of this House who have no means of defending themselves.  The cases to which I referred are cases in point and it is for those reasons I am supporting this sessional order.  I am happy this is sessional order rather than a Standing Order.  We should monitor how this measure works so as to ensure we do not fall into some of the traps Deputy O'Donnell forecasts.</P>
      <P>The privilege we have in this House carries a responsibility.  Deputies must not be allowed to come into this House, make outrageous statements, ruin reputations and get away scot free.  However, at the moment they get away scot free having made such allegations, merely being reprimanded by this House. Unfortunately, the persons about whom allegations have been made have no right or opportunity to come into this House with their lawyers and make a statement that they were defamed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would not support any curtailment of Dáil privilege but we should act responsibly and some Deputies have not acted responsibly in the past.  For the first time ever, this House is taking a lead in dealing with the minority of Deputies who make outrageous allegations. We are trying to put in place <Col N="1645" /> a procedure that will at least encourage Deputies to be more careful about how they level allegations in this House.  It is important we do that now because, despite the fact that we had only three cases in the past number of years, careers could have been ruined as a result of the allegations made in those three cases.  If such allegations were to continue or increase in the years ahead, a strong campaign would be mounted, both inside and outside this House, to remove privilege from Deputies, and that is a measure we should not entertain. Self-regulation in such a sensitive area is very important and that is why I support this sessional order.</P>
    <P>The infamous allegations made by Deputy Rabbitte in this House to the effect that there was a document in the Attorney General's Office that would rock the foundations of the State was made in a politically charged atmosphere but it had to be investigated. Deputies may recall that people had to be asked to return from various parts of the world so that we might ascertain whether there was such a document.</P>
    <P>I was instructed at that time by the then Taoiseach, Deputy Reynolds, to contact Deputy Rabbitte to ascertain what information he had and ask him to make it available to me, to some other member of the Government or to a civil servant so that we could find this document as quickly as possible.  Deputy Rabbitte was asked to point us in some direction if he had information that others did not have.  He told me his statement was based on a telephone call in which he was told there was a document which was so important that it would shake the foundations of the State and that was all the information he had.  Based on information from a person &mdash; I do not know how responsible that person was but obviously he was not very responsible &mdash; Deputy Rabbitte came into this House and said, without a shred of evidence, there was a document of such importance that it would rock the foundation of the State. Is that a responsible way for a Member to act?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1646" /> As Deputy Rabbitte had no further information, I asked him to ask the person from whom he got the information to contact me, or an intermediary and pass all the information he had on to that person who would then contact me. The Taoiseach and I felt it important that whatever information was available should be made known but at the same time allow the person to protect his name.  I told Deputy Rabbitte that we would respect whatever arrangement his source wanted to protect his or her name.  Deputy Rabbitte agreed to that and returned to his alleged source and, in fairness to him, phoned me a half an hour later and told me that his source was not willing to divulge any further information.</P>
    <P>Where a Member makes very serious allegations they should be backed up by more than a telephone call from God knows where.  I appreciate, as Deputy O'Donnell said, that one cannot and will not get documentary evidence and that people will not want to be named. However, there is a duty on every Member to try to verify the information they receive and failing that, as has been done by Deputies, to table questions. Having failed to get proper answers to questions and exhausted other means of checking information they should make the allegation in this House and I defend anyone's right to do that. Deputies should not be allowed to make allegations off the top of their heads that may do untold damage to people outside this House.  I hope this order will cause Deputies to pause before making allegations.  Members should be very careful not to abuse their privilege.</P>
    <P>I am not a constitutional lawyer and have no legal training but I have a sense of fair play.  Deputy O'Donnell outlined the constitutional privileges of Members but under our Constitution every person in the State is entitled to his or her good name.  I understand &mdash; I am open to correction by the constitutional lawyer present&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I have been elected to this House on two separate occasions and lost my seat in the interval. During those periods I have heard a number of allegations made here by Members which seemed to me to be without foundation.  If one were to look to those allegations and ask whether they should be allowed to go unchecked and uncorrected one might be tempted to the view that there should be some system to allow an effective right of reply for persons who consider themselves injured by such allegations.  It is an attractive proposition but it is fundamentally flawed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When this order comes into effect it will not be the practice, in my view, that the ordinary Joe Soap will get justice. What will happen will be equivalent to what happened at the time of the Goodman inquiry when the newspapers and RTE went down on their knees to apologise to the Goodman organisation but we found out later, of course, that the bulk of the accusations made in respect of that organisation were substantially proven.  The tax fraud uncovered by the Tribunal of Inquiry into the Beef Processing Industry, and not by the Revenue Commissioners, was massive.  I have no doubt that if I had said a massive tax fraud was being perpetrated on the Irish people by top management in the Goodman group &mdash; as Mr. Justice Hamilton eventually found &mdash; there would have been a complaint to the Ceann Comhairle within <Col N="1648" /> minutes and I would have been brought before the committee and asked to substantiate my arguments about Goodman's tax evasion.  How could I substantiate them?  Would I be given access to that company's records and would I be able to prove that millions and millions of pounds had been handed out in cash to employees of that organisation?</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that a bevy of highly paid lawyers would bring in witnesses who would categorically deny what I would say before the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  If I bothered to attend the meeting at which this was being discussed I would have said I had good information to suggest it was the case and then I would be asked to bring forward my witnesses and evidence to show that I had good information.  In the last analysis the confidential tipster who told me what was going on would not dare put his or her head above the parapet and expose themselves to the immense strength of the Goodman organisation.  This measure will not protect small people but will aid the big and powerful and those who abuse privacy and confidentiality and fear any legislative or other forum in which they can be brought to account.</P>
    <P>I readily agree with Deputy Dempsey in that when Deputy Avril Doyle levelled her accusation against doctors in Beaumont Hospital I cringed because it is so easy to take one side of a story and make a meal of it in the House without regard to the interests of the other side. Nonetheless, I have pointed out inadequacies in the way in which one of my constituents was treated.  She died in the National Maternity Hospital.  I was careful about what I said as a matter of mental discipline but I do not want to be placed in a position in which I must go before a committee of the House to defend what I say.  In the nature of things, the medical defence union would bring in lawyers and doctors and I would only have a layman's accusation made by the relatives of the girl to avail me, if they bothered to come before the committee.</P>
    <P>There is a possibility that, on <Col N="1649" /> occasion, the privilege we enjoy as Members of the Oireachtas will be abused.  In case Deputy Dempsey is carried away by notions of virtue, the source of Deputy Rabbitte's earth shattering document rumour was not to be found in Democratic Left but much closer to the Deputy.  It was not at Cabinet level but at Minister of State level.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but I know where it started.  I do not wish to rake over old coals but I got good information about the Masri affair.  All I received was a statement by a credible person that it was true and I was asked to pursue the issue in the House.  I tabled a question to the Taoiseach at the time asking whether any member of the Government received a substantial investment in the previous five years in return for a grant of citizenship to the investor.  It was a simple, straightforward question.  My experience at the time took the scales from my eyes.  The Chair rejected the question on the grounds that to ask it was to make a personal imputation.  I accept the rulings of the Chair, as I must.  It was following precedent.  I queried that and said if it were true it could not be an imputation <Col N="1650" /> and if it were false the answer would be &ldquo;no&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I argued as strongly as I could that the question should be allowed to stand and the Taoiseach required to answer it.  I came up against a stone wall.  The Chair is always co-operative and I asked what I could do in the circumstances.  I was told to make a substantive charge which means putting down a motion in Private Members' time to allege it is true.  I was in the difficulty that all I had was a statement that it was true.  My speech would have lasted for one minute if my party colleagues had allowed me to put down the motion.  I would have had to say: &ldquo;I am informed by a reliable source that a member of the Government received £1.1 million into their family firm and in exchange the investor was given citizenship&rdquo;.  That would have been impractical as I did not have any records to prove it.</P>
      <P>In the end, I went through the farce of bringing in a Private Members' Bill, arranging with the great allegator, Deputy Rabbitte, to oppose it and force a five minute debate the following Tuesday afternoon.  Then it tumbled out that it was true.  I was left in the position in which to ask the question would have amounted to personal imputation but the statement was correct.  I was not supported by the rules of the House.  If I had said it in a debate and was hauled before the Committee on Procedure and Privileges all I could have said was: &ldquo;I am reliably informed it is true&rdquo;.  I would have been asked: &ldquo;What substance is there to back this up&rdquo;?  I would not have had anything to say except that I was reliably informed it is true.  My rights to pursue matters of importance are not vindicated by existing rules and I will be more inhibited in making inquiries of this kind as a result of this procedure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the explanatory leaflet showing how the proposed mechanism will work it is stated that &ldquo;motions of substance concerning the same allegations will not be allowed to be moved during any stages of the above&rdquo;.  Someone who wants to pre-empt further discussion of <Col N="1651" /> a matter and hem me in, as the rules of the House did on that occasion, has only to make a complaint to the Ceann Comhairle and the matter cannot be raised in any shape or form when the star Chamber process begins.  I would have had nothing to say as I sat before a significant number of Deputies, some of whom would have been most anxious to embarrass me and point out that I had no basis for making the allegations. The Ceann Comhairle would ask me to withdraw the imputation and I would either be forced to withdraw it in the House or be reprimanded.  I would not withdraw it and would have been reprimanded under a procedure in the House which would have belittled me because I could not stand over something which I knew to be true.</P>
    <P>Is it the case that motions of substance concerning the same allegations will not be allowed during any stages of this investigatory procedure?  If that is so, it would inhibit Members from making points which they know and believe to be true and dealing with issues of public importance in good faith.</P>
    <P>As Deputy O'Donnell said, the Progressive Democrat Party is opposed to this measure, it will not be bound by it and will wear any reprimand handed down to it by this process as a badge of honour.  We were elected to carry out certain functions and it is not open to a majority of the Members of this House to effectively muzzle us in the way envisaged under this procedure.  Our higher duty as found by the courts, is to respect the confidentiality of information given to Deputies in this House on matters of public importance.  Our higher duty is to the voters who elected us to this House and the public at large. We do not have a duty to voluntarily engage in an act of self-mutilation, which is what this proposal is, to prevent ourselves from using our critical faculties.</P>
    <P>This is a case of using a sledge hammer to crack a nut.  If a huge number of people said day in and day out, this <Col N="1652" /> House allowed its Members to abuse their privilege than I would say we should consider some corrective action. In the vast majority of cases Members are careful, honest, and responsible in what they say and it is wrong for this House to put in place a system of discipline on them which in the last analysis will be used by the big, powerful wrongdoers to muzzle their individual critics.  While the three quarters weighted majority requirement may suit the larger parties which can always have a blocking vote to stop a motion for reprimand going through, Independent Members such as Deputy Gregory and Members of smaller parties will never have enough votes at the Committee on Procedure and Privileges to stop a motion for reprimand.  We will have to depend on the grace and fair attitude of our colleagues in this House.  I know from experience that when push comes to shove Members vote along party lines in accordance with the party wishes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. E. Byrne Mr. E. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to refer to some of the points raised by Members of the Progressive Democrats and to which I hope the Minister will respond in his reply.  Deputies O'Donnell and McDowell have argued against this motion on the basis that Deputies who issue statements which are deemed to be defamatory will be hauled before the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and will have with them solicitors who will tear us to shreds, thus turning it into a courtroom. I wish to correct that wrong picture painted by them.  Deputy O'Donnell was a member of the sub-committee and she will have received the documentation which states that it was clarified that a Member could claim privilege before the committee and refuse to disclose information.  That is a straightforward statement.  Even more importantly, it also addressed the issue of a possible input by a third person involved in an alleged breach of privilege in a subsequent investigation.  It was agreed that any such input should be in the form of a submission in writing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1653" /> This is a very difficult issue to address.  It is similar to the narrow tightrope the Taoiseach had to walk in another matter in balancing the rights of the House and its Members with the rights of the citizen.  In that context, I am glad we are dealing with a sessional order.  This issue should be dealt with on the basis of the facts presented to us. The Progressive Democrats Party is wrong in suggesting that we will be torn to shreds by the barristers, solicitors or the legal teams representing the Goodman group or the Medical Defence Union.  That is not my interpretation of what is proposed.  I understand people who claim they have been defamed will be allowed to submit a succinct and limited statement.</P>
    <P>As a member of a party with six Deputies I am conscious of the rights of minority Members of the House and argued in favour of the three quarters weighted majority concept.  One could argue that the majority should be greater but that was the figure agreed. I hope the Minister will respond to the scenarios referred to by Deputies O'Donnell and McDowell.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the outrage expressed about the penalty.  While I have some reservations about whether Members should be brought before the Committee on Procedure and Privilages we want to be fair to everyone.  The documentation states that the draft order will maintain the <i>status quo</i> by treating a defamatory remark in certain circumstances as a matter of disorder. Under the procedures of the House a Deputy who is named can be suspended from the House for thee days by the Ceann Comhairle.  The documentation states: &ldquo;Obviously this could lead to the suspension of a Member from the services of the Dáil and creates an anomaly in respect of how a Member should be sanctioned by recommendation of the committee&rdquo;.  The committee cannot suspend a Deputy from the House.  If it finds a Deputy guilty, so to speak it can make a recommendation to the Ceann Comhairle who can dismiss it and merely reprimand the Deputy in the <Col N="1654" /> House.  The proposed penalty is not as severe as a three day suspension from the services of the Dáil.  Obviously there is a concern that Deputies who have to make a statement will be forced by peer groups to divulge information, which is not obligatory.  Under the Constitution no one can be forced to divulge information. Will the Minister address those issues when replying?</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely" hpid="Mr. Callely Mr. Callely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>My clear understanding is that privilege of Members of the Oireachtas remains intact as provided under paragraphs 12 and 13 of Article 15 of the Constitution which has been upheld by the Supreme Court judgment of August 1992.  Given that those privileges remain, like my colleague, Deputy Byrne, I sat in on one or two of the sub-committee meetings and was somewhat sympathetic to Deputy O'Donnell's arguments.  My clear understanding is that privilege remains absolute, in accordance with the Constitution and the Standing Orders of the House, but that a mechanism will be put in place which will give a right of reply to outsiders against whom an allegation is made.  That will be a simple mechanism and the person will have the right, if they so desire, to respond to such an allegation.</P>
      <P>I welcome the sessional order because for far too long some Members have abused this privilege.  Most of the speakers have indicated examples of abuse: Deputies making reference to professional medical personnel and allegations and innuendoes regarding the beef industry.  We all know the cost arising out of investigations into the latter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been said here on many occasions that if there was a proper committee system operating here, there would have been no need for the beef tribunal.  In his contribution Deputy McDowell indicated that Members could be severely curtailed and, for want of a better description, &ldquo;put on ice&rdquo; for a number of days while the Committee on Procedure and Privileges carried out an investigation.  There was a need for a right of reply.  Where an <Col N="1655" /> allegation is made against a person or an industry those involved should have the right to use the mechanism if they so desire.  In putting that mechanism in place we should look at other issues about which Members have a genuine concern.</P>
    <P>An issue touched on today was the allegation that would rock the State to its foundations made in November 1994. I posed the following question to the Taoiseach recently: &ldquo;To ask the Taoiseach the inquiries, if any, that have been carried out by him into uncovering the letter that allegedly exists in the Office of the Attorney General or elsewhere, that this letter would rock the very foundations of the State, the extent and the result of the inquiry and if he will make a statement on the matter&rdquo;. I received the following reply from the Ceann Comhairle's office: &ldquo;I regret I have disallowed the following question tabled by you.  The question contains argument&rdquo;.  That was not a satisfactory response.  The House will recall that when that allegation was made in November 1994 it was shattering and warranted an investigation.</P>
    <P>It is important to record the name of the person who made that allegation and the importance attached to it.  When Deputy Rabbitte was asked to appear before the sub-committee of inquiry he was then a Minister of State.  The original request to attend the meeting was cancelled because it clashed with the appearance of other witnesses before the sub-committee.  It is important to quote the conclusion of his letter for the record.  He said he would attend the committee but would prefer, rather than receive a phone call at 10.30 p.m., if he could be given a little more notice than he received of the cancellation and &ldquo;in any event not later than 10.40 p.m. if I am being contacted at home since the baby takes her last bottle around that time&rdquo;.  That was farcical.  This was a highly sensitive political issue and Deputy Rabbitte had alleged that he had evidence that would rock the State to its foundations but when he became a <Col N="1656" /> Minister of State with responsibility for commerce and technology he was more interested in giving the baby her last bottle at home.</P>
    <P>I also tabled the following question to the Taoiseach: &ldquo;To ask the Taoiseach the Members of Dáil Éireann who were aware of the information and other relevant facts regarding the Fr. Brendan Smyth affair and official A that had been concealed from the Dáil Committee on Legislation and Security&rdquo;.  I wanted to know the Members who were aware that this charade was being played out in the months of December, January and February.  In reply the Ceann Comhairle said: &ldquo;I regret to disallow the following question tabled by you.  The Taoiseach has no official responsibility to the Dáil in relation to this matter&rdquo;.  That was most unsatisfactory.</P>
    <P>I have tabled a number of other questions on Government policy of accountability, openness and transparency.  This morning I asked the Tánaiste a question about accountability.  The health boards were given £100 million last year on the understanding that a Bill would be introduced.  That has not happened and the response of the Tánaiste this morning was that the heads of the Bill had not been prepared.  We will not see the Bill this session and probably will not see it until late next session, if at all.</P>
    <P>I asked a relevant question on openness and transparency and the reply from the Ceann Comhairle's office indicated that the question either contained argument or impinged on the collective responsibility of the Government.  That is the nub of the problem.  If a Member comes into this House and tables a relevant question it should be answered and not transferred or stonewalled.  In the recent past certain allegations made in the House were stonewalled by the then Government.  This led to the agreement of this House to set up a tribunal which may have contributed to the formation of a Government but at the end of the day the taxpayer had to <Col N="1657" /> bear the cost.  Here we are holding privilege while the Government and successive Governments have stonewalled questions that could have been simply answered and we could have avoided the expenditure of large amounts of taxpayers' money.</P>
    <P>In relation to Father Smyth and official A, I asked a question recently as to why the general public were left in the dark regarding the compromised position of the Attorney General and why the order was only made following a telephone call to the Taoiseach's office by a leading national newspaper. I asked a question regarding official A and collective responsibility within the Attorney General's office and within the Taoiseach's office.</P>
    <P>Yesterday a great rent-a-crowd was brought into the House and there was great applause for the Taoiseach when he told the House that official A had indicated he had done wrong and was now to take early retirement as and from this Thursday.  The Taoiseach was happy to announce that he had given to Official A taxpayers' funds to the value of in or around £1 million.  Here we have a man who recognises that he was irresponsible, that he made errors of judgment regarding a very sensitive, highly political case and the Taoiseach comes into the House to indicate that he will give the man £140,000 to leave office immediately, that he is giving him £33,000, which I presume is indexlinked, as a pension and which could accumulate to the value of £1 million.  If you, I or any ordinary individual were guilty of such a wrong-doing, it would mean resigning or being dismissed and getting the matter properly addressed. We have yet to see the public reaction to this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I have just recently arrived from five time zones to the West and, accordingly, do not feel fully fit to make a speech in the House today but the nature of what is proposed in this motion propels me to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I listened to Deputy O'Donnell's speech and the reasons she gave that this motion should not be adopted and I listened to Deputy McDowell.  I agree with them.  I have not heard Deputy O'Donnell's arguments against this refuted by anybody.  The speeches being made in support of this motion are almost anecdotal and do not face up to the very serious difficulty we have in the motion before us.  Deputy O'Donnell said this morning that Parliament is on trial.  It is and who is putting it on trial? Itself.  Does it deserve any respect if it allows itself to be neutered?  Will a motion like this, with all its implications, <Col N="1659" /> have any effect as against Article 15 of the Constitution?  Has that been thought through?  What is the point of Deputies saying we cannot have people coming into this House and saying things they are not prepared to back up and for which they are not prepared to divulge their source?  What is the point of saying that when the Supreme Court in a case, brought originally by a number of Members of this House and now called The Attorney General <i>v</i>.  Hamilton No. 2, 1992 Irish Reports, specifically held, as a matter of constitutional law in interpreting the Constitution, that a Deputy is not required to substantiate his allegations.  So the Constitution says and this House cannot say otherwise. We had better think about this now before we commit ourselves to it. Article 15, paragraph 10, has been interpreted in this case in 1992 and the Supreme Court has held that it is not necessary for a Deputy to substantiate his allegations.  So what is the point of this motion and what effect will it have? I heard people criticise Deputy O'Donnell because she said at the end of her speech that we would not observe this motion if it were passed today.  One cannot observe something that it not valid in terms of the Constitution because it does not exist.  This House cannot pass a law that contravenes the Constitution. Likewise, it cannot pass a motion that contravenes the Constitution and cannot take away the rights which a Deputy is given by the Constitution.  This House cannot divest itself of the powers bestowed on it by the Constitution.  We should pause and think as this is a serious matter.</P>
    <P>The practice has grown up, particularly during the past ten to 15 years, of the Government being the dominant force in political matters.  This House is rapidly becoming an instrument of the Government of the day and this is further proof of that thesis, if one requires it.  Under the Standing Order as proposed, decisions will be made for the time being by the Ceann Comhairle. <Col N="1660" /> Nowadays the office of Ceann Comhairle is not seen as being in the gift of the House but in the gift of the Government. If a matter is referred by him the decision will be made by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges on which the Government always has a majority. Our experience in committees is that the majority tends to support the Government, irrespective of the merits of the case.  This is not good enough.</P>
    <P>No member of the Government has come into the House to defend or advocate the motion.  In addition, Fianna Fáil has taken a view which is extraordinary for the main Opposition party.  I wonder why; I have my suspicions but even if they are correct it does not matter.  It should not be encouraging us to let something like this go through as this is a serious matter.  I urge Members to consider carefully the points made by Deputies O'Donnell and McDowell before the Standing Order is adopted.</P>
    <P>Let me try to give Members some idea of the difficulties which will arise. The proposed Standing Order 53A (1) states that a Member shall not make an utterance in the nature of being defamatory. What this will mean in practice is that almost anything controversial which somebody either inside or outside the House does not like and regards as a slight will be &ldquo;in the nature of being defamatory&rdquo;.  In other words, one will not be able to make a seriously critical remark.  Subsection (1) goes on to state that where a Member makes such an utterance it may be <i>prima facie</i> an abuse of privilege.  In other words, if something which reflects seriously on somebody else either inside or outside the House is uttered then, <i>prima facie</i>, it will be a breach of privilege and the onus will be on the Member concerned to prove that it is not, although the Supreme Court in The Attorney General <i>v</i>.  Hamilton (No. 2) stated that it is not.  There is a conflict, the House should resolve it before it adopts the Standing Order but has not done so.</P>
    <P>Subsection 2 (a) states that if the defamatory nature of the utterance is apparent at the time it was made during <Col N="1661" /> proceedings, the Ceann Comhairle shall direct that the utterance be withdrawn without qualification.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>That is scandalous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact that it is true and not defamatory is irrelevant, if it is in the nature of being defamatory the Ceann Comhairle may order its withdrawal. If a Member refuses to withdraw it various sanctions can be imposed.  This is not right and conflicts totally with the interpretation by the Supreme Court of Article 15.10.  The two cannot stand together.  At the moment the Supreme Court's interpretation is the one that will prevail and Members can resort to it, if an attempt is made to sanction them.  It is a mark of weakness on the part of this House that some of its Members will have to flee to the courts to try to protect themselves. It is a parliamentary and political function of Members elected to this House to speak as they see fit within the rules of order and decency.  One should not have to go to the courts to seek protection.</P>
      <P>Many examples of alleged abuses of privilege are given.  Let me give one further example.  I urge the Tánaiste, Deputy Spring, and the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte &mdash; the original plaintiffs in the case to which I referred with former Deputies Mac Giolla and Desmond &mdash; to contemplate that in voting for the proposed Standing Order, they are voting against the principle which they had upheld with some difficulty. I wonder where they are.  Is the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, so deep in his burrow this morning that he cannot hear us and will not come in?  I would like to hear what he and the Tánaiste have to say about this Standing Order.  These matters cannot be judged on the basis of which side of the House one is sitting on at a particular time; one has to be more discerning than that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 10 May 1989 I made a highly controversial speech during the Adjournment debate, it was in the nature of being defamatory within the meaning of <Col N="1662" /> the proposed Standing Order 53A (1) because I was highly critical of certain people.  The reaction of Ministers was extraordinarily heated.  As Deputy O'Donnell said, they became apoplectic about it and stated I was totally unjustified but if one was to read it again now it is clear that every word was true. However, within the meaning of the proposed Standing Order it was in the nature or being defamatory.  Did I not have the right to say what I said?  There was no abuse of privilege.  It stopped certain things happening and called a halt, at least for a while, to the gallop of certain people which was to the benefit of the country.  Will Deputies be prevented from doing so again if the need arises?</P>
    <P>Nine months ago I was told by the Chair that one could not criticise the Attorney General when I repeatedly criticised Mr. Harry Whelehan and said that he was not fit to be Attorney General, let alone anything higher.  The quote used was that he was a great constitutional officer.  I was told that one could not criticise him or his senior legal assistant.  Is this not meaningless and silly?  We should call a halt to this. Deputy Byrne said that if the Committee on Procedure and Privileges heard a case under this proposed order, those who attended the committee to complain could not bring lawyers with them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. E. Byrne Mr. E. Byrne">

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I invite Deputy Byrne to go to the Library and read in the 1971 Irish reports the case <i>In Re</i> Haughey which refers to an individual against whom allegations of a serious nature were made, who was brought before a committee of this House but declined to answer questions on the grounds that his rights were being interfered with.  He then received from the court an extensive declaration to that effect.  The court decided that one of the rights a person cannot be deprived of in appearing before a committee of this House is the <Col N="1663" /> right to legal representation.  That is a Godsend to those who can afford expensive lawyers.  The only people it will put down are Members of this House who try to do their duty.</P>
      <P>I have been a Member of this House for 27 years and I have often had to say rough things but I can go before my God and say that I never abused the privilege of the House.  The same applies to the vast majority of Members. If that privilege is taken away from us we might as well pull down the blinds.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Members of this House need more powers, not fewer.  This House has become increasingly irrelevant and I, as an elected representative, resent that.  Any curtailment of Members' rights should be strenuously resisted by all Members of the House. There is no need for this measure because Members generally do not abuse privilege.  There was abuse of privilege during the beef tribunal debate and some of the principals have been referred to here, but a number of subsidiary contributors who named specific individuals were never taken to task. They were given a mild rap on the knuckles by the President of the beef tribunal inquiry who said that their statements were unfounded and untrue. Those people should have been taken to task and admonished much more severely in public.  For the vast majority of Dáil Deputies, a diminution of their powers is unacceptable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If a person comes in here, acts in an irresponsible way and mentions people's names in a derogatory manner, he or she will feel the backlash so severely from the media and the public, particularly their electorate, that their life will be a misery, and that is as it <Col N="1664" /> should be.  They will suffer their own sanctions without the need to instigate a reduction in the rights of Members of the House.  That is the way this matter should be dealt with.</P>
    <P>We are supposed to be the people with power &mdash; I made this type of speech here before and one always feels on these occasions as if one is a leper &mdash; but as the Chairman will know we do not have power.  Having served as a backbencher for a number of years, I can say that a traffic warden has more power in many instances than has a backbench TD.  A garda certainly, and sometimes even a dog catcher, has more power.  There is a cliché that we are voting fodder, that is true in many instances.  On issues such as this we are compelled to vote for measures with which we do not agree, which makes us hypocrites, and people such as myself go along with that at times.  However, you must face your constituents at election time and unfortunately if you are not loyal to your party, if you attempt to be objective, you are dead politically.  I have seen that happen to some very fine people in this House.  Let us give credit and support to people with backbone. This type of measure gives no such support.</P>
    <P>The people who have real power are in State and semi-State bodies, local authorities and health boards.  They can decide whether a person will receive a grant, a medical card or whatever.  They have the power to dish out privilege while we do not have such power.  What we are attempting to do here is take away privilege.  The people in the Press Gallery have real power.  There might not be one word about today's Dáil report in a number of national papers but the Press Gallery can still write about events in the Dáil in an objective way without alluding to the factual content of what was said.  That is real power.</P>
    <P>If we were consistent about having a watchdog in this House and if the ultimate sanction of the constitutional reform mentioned in the Minister's <Col N="1665" /> speech is implemented whereby a Member of this House could be brought before the courts if he or she utters something that is considered to be defamatory, the corollary of that is that there should be a press council.  Everybody should be subject to the same sanction.  We are elected whereas members of the Press Gallery are not, but the power lies there rather than here.  That is unfortunate and is dangerous in a democracy because in those circumstances we can very easily go off the rails.</P>
    <P>Who is running the country?  The vast majority of Dáil Deputies play a very minor role and some Ministers play a negligible part in that process.  We should get our priorities right.  We should give Members more power and let them say what they think.  Like Deputy O'Malley, I have been a Member of this House for a number of years and have never abused privilege or been pulled up on it.  I was greatly tempted at times to mention officials in certain State boards and local authorities whom I suspected of being corrupt, and health board officials whom I considered in some cases to be totally inept and bordering on corrupt but I did not do so although maybe it would have been good to do so.</P>
    <P>There has been talk about using the Australian Senate as a model, that we should all be as good as them, but we would probably be better off if we used as a model the Japanese or Italian parliaments where we regularly see punchups in their parliamentary chambers. Probably their members fare much better. It would be a big help to the Irish rugby team to see that at first hand.</P>

      <P>Parliamentary democracy is defeated by our inability to get questions answered in this House.  Other Deputies have complained about this, but I have encountered this problem for many years.  Questions are disallowed, transferred not only from one Minister to another, but from a second to a third Minister.  Having been transferred once or twice they are eventually disallowed. I tabled a recent simple statistical question requesting information on the number of people employed in Leinster House on sitting and non-sitting days.  I tabled that question to the Taoiseach, it was transferred to the Minister for Finance and last week it was disallowed.</P>

      <P>I was told it was not the responsibility of the Minister, but a matter for the Houses of the Oireachtas. What does that mean?  Is a brick or fixture to blame?  It appears no human being is to blame as it is a matter for the Houses of the Oireachtas?  Have Members ever heard of anything so ridiculous? Members cannot ascertain how many people are employed on sitting and non-sitting days.  I included Kildare House and Government Buildings in that question.  It was not difficult to get that information because the Superintendent of the House &mdash; I mentioned a name and I am not supposed to &mdash; had assimilated the numbers working in the various buildings and figures had been provided.  I suppose it would have been <Col N="1667" /> an embarrassment for people to realise that there are probably 1,000 people employed in those buildings in which there are very few facilities.  That was the point I wished to make, but I did not get a chance to make it in my Machiavellian way.  That is one illustration of a lack of power in this House.</P>
      <P>I had another sobering experience during the past two to three years prior to this Government coming into power and which ceased on the formation of the Government.  Before a parliamentary question I tabled to a Minister in a previous Government about matters in my constituency was answered, a member that Minister's party who is a Member of the House got the information a week previously and had it publicised so that the purpose of my question was totally defeated.</P>

There is no control. I wrote to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, but got no satisfaction.  I was told that the Minister was entitled to do that.  I pointed out that when I was appointed Cabinet Minister one of the first things the Secretary of the Department concerned told me was that when a question is tabled by a Member a Minister is not allowed to divulge anything relating to the subject matter of that question to any other individual, particularly to another Deputy.  All that has gone out the window.  We do not need further restrictions, Members should have more rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposal is designed to make this House less relevant.  It is superfluous and anaemic.  The most relevant point is that if you set yourself up on the high moral ground there is only one way to go, back down at the rate of knots. The Minister referred to the Golfing Union of Ireland.  I wonder why he <Col N="1668" /> referred to that body and the Law Society.  He did not refer to the trade unions, teacher organisations or the IFA.  Perhaps he is concerned about the handicaps of certain Members, past and present, in this House&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Members of that House are in the clouds, like the Deputy in the Chair used to be when he fielded the ball for County Louth many years ago.  We are becoming, if we are not already, as irrelevant as town commissioners, a county council or urban council.  This type of proposal should not be accepted or entertained.  Common sense should prevail and many more people should be present today speaking their minds.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>This motion has come from the engine of political correctness. I am sick and tired of having political correctness rammed down my throat at national and local level and through the media.  It is as if to say that people who enter or participate in public life automatically have a question mark hanging over their integrity, credibility or there <Col N="1669" /> is a suspicion as to why they are in public life, leading to claims that they are making money out of it, are open to corruption, bribery, all sorts of suggestions and innuendo that is their <i>raison d'être</i> for being in public life.  I reject that vehemently because it is totally and utterly untrue and without foundation.  I have not been in public life as long as some of the previous speakers, but I have been used to it since I was a child and directly involved in it for almost ten years.  From my experience in this House the vast majority of Members have not abused their Dáil privilege. Responsibility comes with that privilege. The previous speaker, my good friend and colleague from my constituency, elucidated on areas where privilege has not been abused and Members have been constrained in ensuring that they were not defamatory towards other individuals inside or outside this House.</P>
      <P>Regarding the new regulations, I am mindful of the behaviour of one or two Members of the House in the distant and recent past. At least Deputy Eric Byrne is in the House for the debate. The statement by the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, when in Opposition, about the existence of a letter which would rock the State to its foundations had a major impact on circumstances at that time.  We now know his allegation had no foundation but, because it was made, it is still believed in some circles that it had a basis.  That type of behaviour led to the introduction of the order before us today, but Deputy Rabbitte is conspicuous by his absence.  It is extraordinary that he has not come into the House to say why he supports this proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having listened to the contributions of previous speakers and noted paragraphs 12 and 13 of Article 15 of the Constitution and the findings of the Supreme Court, I question the effectiveness of this order.  What is the Ceann Comhairle's view on the matter?  I accept he cannot give his view in the House, but the Minister should indicate <Col N="1670" /> how the Ceann Comhairle's office interprets the conflict between the Supreme Court judgment and the issue we are debating today.  How will defamatory statements be defined?  It will be up to the Ceann Comhairle to make a subjective judgment in that regard and that will be based on whether the statement is made by a Government or Opposition Member, its content and whether it impacts on matters raging outside the House at the time.</P>
    <P>Like Deputy Deasy, I am also concerned at the way in which the powers of those in public life are being eroded. During the past decade the powers of members of local government have been greatly diminished.  Many quangos and quasi-committees have been established, creating a soap box effect of great importance for their positions, but the powers of those of us who must go before the people in a democratic process and seek a mandate are being diminished.  Is this the thin end of the wedge?  Is it a first step in diminishing our powers?  What market are we trying to please by introducing such measures? Are we trying to satisfy people in the media who, instead of carrying out research, use politicians as a hobby-horse or a soft target to get a good headline? By diminishing its powers, is the Government trying to convince the public of how great it is?  It is a shame this is happening, mainly unnoticed by Members.</P>
    <P>There is some merit in an order such as this.  If people believe they have been defamed they can complain to the Committee on Procedures and Privileges, but does that mean the Supreme Court judgment is not accurate in suggesting that the absolute privilege of Members of the Oireachtas is copperfastened? The Supreme Court is the final arbiter and defining body in all matters affecting the Constitution.  In passing motions or introducing laws this House is at all times subject to the Constitution and cannot pass laws or motions that would contravene any article of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>The Minister emphasised that this is a <Col N="1671" /> sessional order which I presume means there is a &ldquo;get out&rdquo; clause.  If this order amounts to a hill of beans and must be rescinded in six months, Members will be again open to attack from the public. We are trying to put a politically correct face on an issue &mdash; about which there are grave doubts &mdash; and in six months time the order may have to be rescinded because it contravenes the Constitution.</P>
    <P>Democracy is a potent weapon.  While there have been many great people in history, none of them has managed to control the democratic forum to their own ends.  They may succeed in the short term and win the odd battle, but a parliamentary forum and democracy will always win out against abuses.  The most sacred protection for our people is that we live in a democracy and that if Members of this House try to abuse the privilege granted to them on the day they are elected they will not succeed in the long term.  From my experience no Member of this House has ever deliberately set out to defame another person if the matter in question was not in the public interest.  Many difficult issues have been raised in the House and were brought to light only because Members used their privilege.  That privilege should not be diminished.  If this measure diminishes the proper ordering of parliamentary democracy, that will be regrettable.</P>
    <P>I am not a legal person but I have not even seen a measure introduced here that so contravenes a Supreme Court judgment which laid down in clearcut terms the rights and privileges of Members of this House.  It is regrettable that we in this House, on the altar to the God of political correctness, are bringing in an order such as this.  It will not enhance our standing and, in time, the Minister will have to rescind the order because if somebody attempts to use the various subsections in it, for whatever reason, they may find they are contravening the Supreme Court judgment. That is the defining issue in this debate.</P>

      <P>I was elected to this House <Col N="1672" /> almost one year ago and the frustration I have felt in the past 12 months is unbelievable. I thought I could express the views of the people I represent but I have met many obstacles.  I have learned one lesson in my short time in this House; backbenchers do not have any power.  The real power lies with officials be it at county council, health board or other level.</P>
      <P>If I had an opportunity I would vote against this measure.  I am a Fine Gael Member of this House and I signed the party pledge&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I have to vote for it but that is sad.  I would like a free vote on issues such as this about which Members feel strongly.  We should not be pushed up to the lobbies to vote for something in which we do not believe.  The power should be left with the Members who are answerable to the people they represent. The county managers or the State executives are not answerable to anybody.  They are appointed by the Minister of the day.</P>
      <P>I have found this a difficult year.  I congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy Higgins, on his appointment.  I realise this is not the Minister's measure but one which has been decided by the House which he must introduce.  This order is anti-Member and should be withdrawn.  I realise it will not be withdrawn at this late stage and I will be required to vote shortly for something in which I do not believe.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Malley went <Col N="1673" /> even further than that but I will not go into that now.</P>
      <P>I would like to have more time to talk about the members of the press because they are the people with real influence. They can put a slant on any issue that arises.  A press council should be established because when members of the press make observations about Members of this House, we should have an opportunity to correct them.  Sometimes they will not even pick up a telephone to ask Deputies why they have tabled numerous questions in the House.  If they did that we would explain that we cannot get answers from Ministers and many questions in the House are ruled out of order.  For which I believed were reasonable and which were in the interests of my constituents were ruled out of order.  For whatever reason, these questions are not answered and this is very frustrating.</P>
      <P>I hope the Government will consider giving back some power to the ordinary Members of this House.  When my party was in Opposition it constantly told the Government of the day how things should be done, but when it came to power, it did not do anything about these matters either.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank all the Members who participated in what one thought might be a bland debate but which turned out to be quite lively.  I want to briefly address the points made by all Members.  This is not a Fine Gael, Labour, Democratic Left or Fianna Fáil motion.  It is a motion that was deliberated upon at great length by a sub-committee of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, on which all parties were <Col N="1674" /> represented.  Dialogue should have taken place between the various members of the parties and if that was not the case, no blame can be devolved to me or the previous Minister of State, Deputy Seán Barrett.  There was a general recognition of what was intended.</P>
      <P>I thank Deputy Dermot Ahern for his generous comments on my appointment and for his constructive contributions not just here today but also as a member of the committee.  His expertise as a former Chief Whip, both in Government and in Opposition, was most welcome. Deputy Ahern hit the nail on the head when he said it was a privilege to be a Member of this House.  However, it is an abuse of privilege to go beyond the powers and scope of the absolute privilege of immunity from the legal recourse which the Constitution, and the rules of the House, give us.  The vast majority of Members do not abuse the privilege of the House but we must always be cognisant of the irreparable damage that can be done, and which has been done in the past, by the abuse of this privilege.</P>
      <P>The fundamental point at issue here is that if the truth is being told in the House, Members have nothing to fear. This measure simply puts Members on notice that they must be vigilant in relation to the veracity of their contributions. It will not impose undue restraint on them and certainly will not take away the privilege of Members.</P>
      <P>On the point made by Deputy O'Donnell, that it was intended that this measure be passed without debate, that is not correct.  When the request was made for a debate on this measure, it was acceded to.  The only question that arose was in regard to the length of the debate and it was generally agreed that ending it at 1.30 p.m. would allow Members sufficient time to debate this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Donnell also stated that this was a weak-minded excuse for Dáil reform.  Nobody is trying to pretend that <Col N="1675" /> this is the absolute in terms of Dáil reform.  It is but one element of it&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Why is it coming first?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash; which has been much debated but it does not purport to be the entire package of Dáil reform. Other issues will come on stream in due course.  Under this measure, the Committee on Procedure and Privileges will not become a star chamber or a type of circuit court into which people will bring a plethora of legal advisers.  That is not provided for in that order.</P>
      <P>In regard to infringement of Members' rights, section 7 (a) states: &ldquo;In considering a matter under this Order the Cheann Comhairle or the Committee, as the case may be, shall take into account the following: (a) whether the member who made the utterance did so in a responsible manner, acted in good faith, and ensured, as far as practicable, that the utterance reflecting adversely on a person was soundly based&rdquo;.  If a Member was excessive in his or her comments but made those comments in good faith, that will be taken into account.  That, in its own way, should answer the allegation on the <i>prima facie</i> requirement in this motion.</P>
      <P>The Progressive Democrats Party makes the point that Dáil privilege is a vital tool of democracy.  I accept that. All this motion is doing is making sure that Dáil privilege is not abused and that Deputies in pursuit of their agenda do not go over the top.  In addition, if a matter is brought before the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, it will require a 75 per cent majority, which is a built-in safeguard.  The bottom line is that it must be possible to substantiate allegations made in the House.  That is an understandable requirement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Donnell made the point that we will not honour the terms of the motion.  It is very serious to say that we will not obey the rules of the House and the majority decision of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  Deputy <Col N="1676" /> O'Donnell was selective in her comments on Standing Orders and the Constitution. There is no constitutional infringement.  In view of the fact that this is a sessional order we hope it will stand the test of time and I do not doubt that it will.  Deputy Dempsey made the point that no Member would willingly and knowingly come before the House and set out to diminish our rights and put in place a system of self-destruction that would amputate one of the fundamental instruments that we cherish&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what the Minister of State is doing. .</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Nobody would dismantle a fundamental instrument which is protected and preserved and will continue to be enshrined in the Constitution. We are asking Members to be responsible and check out the veracity of what they are saying.  I thought, in fact, that Deputy Michael McDowell would dissociate himself from Deputy O'Donnell's comments, but he reaffirmed that as far as the Progressive Democrats Party is concerned it simply will not accept what will be democratically decided by the House.  His point is that the effect of this motion is attractive but fundamentally flawed.  He went on to talk about the ordinary Joe Soap who will not have the same access to the committee as the elite, such as Larry Goodman or those who can afford to hire the best and the brightest. It would seem that some Members did not read the motion because clearly, in relation to providing access for redress for people outside the House whose rights have been infringed or whose integrity has been impugned paragraph (3) (b) applies.  It states:</P>
      <P>where a person who has been referred to by name, or in such a way as to be readily identifiable, in the Dáil, makes a submission in writing to the Ceann Comhairle&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>On the point made by Deputy Callely &mdash; all Members may have fallen victim to the provision that a question cannot provoke argument but in most cases it is possible to use one's imagination to devise questions and redraft them in order to build in the content one is trying to get across while at the same time not falling foul of Standing Orders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley made the point that Members' powers will have been seriously eroded by this motion.  He went on to discuss the instance where on the one hand he was ruled out recently because he questioned the Attorney General but then went on to stand his argument on its head by saying that a number of years ago he made <Col N="1678" /> what he called an &ldquo;earth shattering&rdquo; speech which was defamatory almost line by line and those were the same procedures, rules and regulations as we have&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and they will only be changed today.  Under existing regulations the Deputy was ruled out of order in one instance and in another was permitted to make what he regarded as an &ldquo;earth shattering&rdquo; speech.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>On the points made by Deputy Deasy, the powers, rights and facilities are there and it is a question of exploiting the rules and regulations. As far as I am concerned &mdash; and I was on the back benches until a short time ago &mdash; there is no curtailment.  In response to Deputy Cullen, this is not coming from the school of political correctness but from an all-party committee who spent considerable time deliberating what was being brought in and at the same time came to the conclusion that what we are talking about is the responsible use of a valuable instrument&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The point made by Deputy O'Malley on the Supreme Court judgment is contained precisely in Article 15.13 of the Constitution which states:</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am taking Questions Nos. 1 to 25, inclusive, and 66 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I refer Deputies to my statement on these matters yesterday when I said I would be happy to meet the family who were victims of Fr. Smyth.  I can now tell the House that I am putting arrangements in place to do this.  It is important that I apologise on behalf of the Irish State to that family for the discourtesy <Col N="1684" /> done and the pain caused to them by the failure to reply to their solicitor's letter.</P>
    <P>I wish to make it clear that the steps which I have been obliged to take in this matter in respect of Mr. Russell, and which I recounted in detail to the House yesterday, give neither me nor I am sure any Member of the House any satisfaction. My feelings are summed up in an extract from Miss Justice Carroll's judgment in the unfortunate Ted O'Reilly case: &ldquo;It's a sad state of affairs when a civil servant who has given honest and faithful service all his life finished his career in this manner&rdquo;.  I wish to repeat the comment I made yesterday: &ldquo;My considered view is that Mr. Russell does indeed understand that he acted in error and does regret that.  I believe that Mr. Russell did provide good service to the State during his career in a large number of cases&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Returning to what I said yesterday and I trust said very clearly, I dealt in a measured way with Mr. Russell's case and the outcome of that measured approach stands in marked contrast to the unmeasured way in which the Fianna Fáil Government attempted to address the same issue when it tried to summarily dismiss Mr. Russell in the dying days of its administration and the similarly unmeasured way in which Mr. Ted O'Reilly was dealt with when Deputy O'Malley was Minister for Industry and Commerce.  There should be no crocodile tears or politically motivated twisting of or ignoring the facts.  Let us be clear that that is what Deputy Ahern and Deputy Harney &mdash; whose conduct has been a disappointment to me &mdash; are indulging in.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>This behaviour cannot cloud the stark contrast between a measured approach with fair procedure in this case and the unmeasured hasty <Col N="1685" /> approach without fairness or due procedure in the Fianna Fáil and Progressive Democrats cases in similar situations.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised and disappointed at the way in which Deputy Harney approached and continues to approach this matter.  She has direct access within her party to people who have the legal expertise to appreciate precisely the correctness of the approach the Attorney General and I adopted in three key areas: first, a fair procedure for and a settlement with Mr. Russell; second, the issues surrounding the appointment of the present Attorney General and, third, the issue of the sub-Committee of the Select Committee on Legislation and Security and the Attorney General's position before that committee.</P>
      <P>I recognise that Opposition parties do not find it easy to accept that they were wrong, and they were in this case, in blowing up a political storm.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The committee can look, if it wishes, at the serious issues &mdash; which are not confined to the present case &mdash; of how to reconcile the conflicting requirements of adherence to legal codes of conduct, be they in relation to the handling of the possible disciplinary action or in relation to the confidential nature of lawyer-client relationships, with the requirements of due accountability of Ministers to the Oireachtas.  I, <Col N="1686" /> in relation to the constitutional requirement of fair procedures, and the Attorney General, in respect of the need to respect client confidences, have taken a particular view weighted on the side of adherence to correct legal conduct, and I am certain we were and are correct.  If I had taken a different view the outcome could have been very different.</P>
      <P>I wish now to respond to a number of other matters raised yesterday.  On the questions of why the Attorney General did not take a pro-active approach to the 14 November letter when he saw it and if there was a political responsibility to check that everything that should have been done was being done in regard to that letter, as I explained, the letter of 14 November was seen and noted by the then Attorney General, Eoghan Fitzsimons a month before the present Government was formed and the present Attorney General appointed.  The Attorney General only saw this letter when he was reviewing the file for presentation to the Select Committee on Legislation and Security.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>His task then was to examine the file solely for the purpose of excluding matters which would reveal the identity of the victims, breach confidential communications between the two Attorneys General or prejudice a fair trail for Fr. Smyth who was facing further charges.  There was nothing on file to indicate that the letter, which had been noted as seen by the previous Attorney General, was not being dealt with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reminder letter from the solicitors dated 10 January had not been received at the time of the review of the file for the committee by the Attorney General.  When it was received it was not brought to the attention of the Attorney General for noting, as was at least done in the case of the 14 November letter which was brought to Mr. Fitzsimons.  If that had been done ten or <Col N="1687" /> 12 days after the review of the file then the Attorney General could have taken action &mdash; he would have known that the earlier letter had not been replied to. However, that reminder letter was left on Mr. Russell's desk and was not brought to the attention of the Attorney General.</P>

      <P>On the question of why I made the revocation order in regard to personnel functions on Tuesday night.  I had decided I would have to revoke the powers under the 1956 Act soon after being informed of the failure to answer the November and January letters and so informed officials of my Department.  I had not come to any conclusions as to the exact day on which I would do this.  I announced the decision on Tuesday night as otherwise the newspaper information, which I was told of that night, would have been partial and misleading.</P>
      <P>On the question of what reform has taken place in the Attorney General's office, yesterday I circulated a short report for the information of Deputies on the rapid progress made in relation to the main recommendations of the review group on the Office of the Attorney General.  Despite what some Deputies seem to think, wide ranging reforms have been initiated in the Attorney General's office in the past five months.  A permanent head of administration will be appointed within six months.  In the meantime, the Assistant Secretary on loan from the Department of Justice is carrying out the functions of a head of administration and doing so extremely well.</P>

      <P>With all the noise from the Fianna Fáil backbenches I will have no difficulty.  The Deputy seemed to have no control over them yesterday. They were shouting one another down.</P>
      <P>The professional staff of the office possess unrivalled knowledge, skill and experience in the field of Government law, and are highly professional and dedicated.  Because of the nature of this work, this fact is rarely seen and acknowledged in public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problems of the office have not arisen in relation to the quality of legal advice or of draftsmanship.  However, the ever increasing and varied demands of the office's work in recent years have <Col N="1689" /> given rise to the need for a major managerial reinforcement of the office, involving, in particular, the introduction of an enhanced and comprehensive system of information technology.  These changes are now taking place.  When they are complete the office will be fully equipped, by means of a major resource, which will still be embodied in its professional staff, to meet the demands being placed on it.</P>
    <P>On the question of what arrangements I made for obtaining formal and independent legal advice, it was not appropriate in the case of Mr. Russell for me to use the services of the Chief State Solicitor.  This is because Mr. Russell, a senior legal assistant, in the Office of the Attorney General was the Accounting Officer for the Office of the Chief State Solicitor.  That is why an independent solicitor as well as an independent barrister had to be used.</P>
    <P>Under the Ministers and Secretaries Act, 1924, the Office of the Chief State Solicitor is a particular service assigned to the Attorney General.  Counsel engaged by the Chief State Solicitor have access to State files &mdash; this is clearly necessary if they are to be briefed on a particular case.  Of course professional confidence applies and this has never been breached.  In relation to the particular matter at issue here today the question of access to State files by the independent legal advisers engaged by me did not arise.  These advisers did not have any need to have access to any of these files.</P>
    <P>The commitment in the Government's programme in relation to the feasibility of splitting the two roles of the Attorney General was made in the context of a review of the Ministers and Secretaries Act and this review is, as I stated yesterday, in progress.  It can also be anticipated that the constitutional review group will wish to examine Article 30 of the Constitution relating to the Attorney General.  My predecessor in reply to a parliamentary question on 18 October last from my colleague, Deputy De Rossa, as in reply to previous questions of that kind to him, <Col N="1690" /> stated that he had no proposal to alter the existing arrangements in regard to the functions of the Attorney General's office.  In contrast, the parties forming this Government have agreed that the roles of the Attorney General required examination and this is being done.  We will act, if necessary, on foot of that examination.</P>
    <P>Neither I nor my Department had any communication or discussion with the Attorney General as to whether he should attend before the sub-committee of the Select Committee on Legislation and Security.  As I stated yesterday, that decision was entirely his own.</P>
    <P>In relation to the question of why was Mr. Gleeson dealing with the committee's request for documents, the committee made a request for documents to the Attorney General to which he was perfectly free to reply because he was not conflicted in any way.  They did not seek legal advice from him.  The committee's own independent legal advisers saw every document.  The reasons for which documents required to be excluded were set out in correspondence to the committee and had no connection at all with the matter upon which Mr. Gleeson had advised Mr. Russell.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the question, why did the letter go to Mr. Russell, all correspondence is registered and then referred to the legal assistant for allocation between the professional staff.  The error was that at this point the letter was not referred to the Attorney General, under the guidelines which exist for sensitive correspondence, or allocated to another member of staff to <Col N="1691" /> deal with it in the normal way.  That was Mr. Russell's error.</P>
      <P>In relation to the question, why did correspondence continue to go to Mr. Russell, the senior legal assistant, Mr. Russell, was in that position when we came into Government.  He is and was a senior legal assistant responsible for the allocation of all work on the professional side of the office.  That is why all correspondence goes to him.  To that end, all items of correspondence come across his desk.  There was nothing unusual in this.  What was unusual was that Mr. Russell decided to hold on to this particular correspondence, i.e. the posted copy of the letter of 14 November and the letter of 10 January, even through the file was no longer in his possession and even though he had been instructed that he was no longer to deal with the Smyth file.  In other words, contrary to what is being alleged, he was no longer dealing with the Smyth file, but still, for some reason, retained those two items of correspondence which were relevant to it on his desk without informing the Attorney General, other than in the case of the letter of 14 November to which I have already referred.</P>
      <P>I understand that the file was locked away on the direction of Attorney General Fitzsimons during November and when the file came back, after the work had been done on it for the sub-committee for extracting documents, it was again locked in the safe of the deputy legal assistant, not Mr. Russell's.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the question of why, if the procedure that all sensitive and important cases and, in particular, extradition and child abuse cases were to be brought to the attention of the Attorney General, did that not happen in this case?  The procedure did in fact work in this case to the extent that the faxed copy of the letter of 14 November was brought to the attention of the then Attorney General, Mr. Fitzsimons, who, as I have pointed out, noted it, assuming it would be replied to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>His, Mr. Fitzsimons', recollection is that he agreed with Mr. Russell that the claim was not a sustainable one and that he understood that it would be sent to the Chief State Solicitor for reply. That did not happen and no reply was issued.  Mr. Russell's reasons for not dealing with that letter in the usual way, and with the letter of 10 January, were given in my statement yesterday.  In so far as the letter of 10 January is concerned, it should have been brought to the attention of the present Attorney General and failure to do so, while it <Col N="1693" /> might be explained by Mr. Russell in terms of how he understood the original letter was to be dealt with, was a breach of the procedures and in error.</P>
    <P>Finally, I must place on record that the Attorney General and his office carry out, to the highest standards, a very large and constantly growing volume of demanding legal work, requiring the exercise of individual skill and judgment and a capacity to undertake responsibility which is rare and probably unique in the public service.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In so doing they provide an essential service for the Government in the form of legal advice on all aspects of law relevant to the activities of the Government in the domestic and international spheres, in the drafting of a large volume of complex legislation, and in the conduct, through the Chief State Solicitor, of litigation on behalf of the State.</P>
      <P>On the question of why the Government agreed to arrangements for what has been described in the media as a golden handshake which Mr. Russell will receive on his retirement, it needs to be made absolutely clear that much of the greater part of Mr. Russell's retirement benefits, of which so much has been made, are an entitlement of his by virtue of his long years of hard work in the public service and are entirely unconnected with the circumstances of his agreed retirement next Monday night.  I have already put on record why I believe it was right to agree to these terms without which it would not have been possible to resolve the case by agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this context I am conscious that I have also been criticised here by some Deputies for treating Mr. Russell in a manner which they consider to be unduly harsh.  The background to the decision which the Government reached on my recommendation was as follows: Mr. Russell had served in this office for <Col N="1694" /> over 20 years, with great skill and commitment; the view of the previous Attorney General, Harry Whelehan, that it would be a harsh judgment, made with the benefit of hindsight, to attach blame to the manner in which the extradition case was dealt with, had to be taken into account too.</P>
    <P>Mr. Russell had apologised publicly for the neglect of the Fr. Smyth extradition case when he appeared before the Dáil sub committee.  He also apologised personally and in writing to Attorneys General Mr. Whelehan and Mr. Fitzsimons in November last.  Further, the lack of a proper management system in the Attorney General's office under previous Attorneys General, taken in conjunction with the increased work load in the office over the past 10 years or so was also a relevant factor in assessing Mr. Russell's position and his eligibility to be allowed to retire with somewhat greater benefits than he would if he had been compulsorily retired.  The situation which arose could not be attributed solely to Mr. Russell because successive previous Attorneys General must also share responsibility for the overall management of the office and for the less than effective management style practised up to the end of last year.</P>
    <P>I am aware of a number of departmental secretaries who had direct experience of working with Mr. Russell over the years, who if called upon to give evidence in any contested disciplinary case could only attest that, with the exception of the handling of the Fr. Smyth case, Mr. Russell has always given excellent service, often at short notice.</P>

      <P>This contrasts with the way in which the previous Government attempted to deal with Mr. Russell and the ineffective way in which another Opposition party, when in Government, attempted to deal with the position of another official.  In this case, despite constant and politically motivated barracking from the Opposition benches, this Government in a united way has dealt with two difficult crises this week. We have done it fairly, and effectively. We stand united in the decisions we have taken and have shown a significant contrast, in our activity in this matter, with the ineffective panic that was displayed by the Fianna Fáil Party when <Col N="1696" /> trust having broken down between it and its colleagues, it attempted to deal ineffectively with a situation with which I dealt effectively this week.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach said yesterday and again today that the Attorney General had seen the file that included the letter of 15 November and presumed that it had been replied to in the normal way and that there was, in the Taoiseach's words, nothing in anything he saw to suggest this normal courtesy of replying to the letter had not been complied with.  Is not the fact that he saw nothing, precisely the point? Would the Taoiseach not accept that it is standard administrative practice in all Departments to attach the reply to the letter and that the absence of the reply on the file should have alerted him to the possibility of negligence?  Apart from that, did the Attorney General not make any inquiries about the substantive response that would be sent then or later to the family of the victims?  I have to remind the Taoiseach again that in the programme, <i>A Government of Renewal</i> the Government took office on the solemn understanding that it would carry through the reorganisation already planned by its predecessors in the wake of the Brendan Smyth case. The programme stated that it would be a priority of the Government to re-establish confidence in the Office of the Attorney General to ensure that there was no breakdown in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach in his concluding remarks said he believes that when people make mistakes they have to be sought out and dealt with.  In three months he has been successful in that, I concede. He has fired three people.  He fired one Minister of State because his office sent out budget material too <Col N="1697" /> quickly, he fired another because he made a 'phone call that he should not have made.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer is that in this case threats of litigation addressed to the Attorney General's office are not replied to by the Attorney General's office and therefore the replies would not appear on the file in the Attorney General's office.

The letter was retained by him on the desk.  The present Attorney General was not made aware of it and there was nothing on the file to suggest to him that the reply had not been issued.

As I outlined yesterday, there were three reasons I wrote to Mr. Russell seeking explanations as to why I should not exercise the power of compulsory retirement: first, the delay in dealing with the extradition file; second, the case for reorganisation in his office and his position with it and; third, his failure to reply to particular correspondence in a controversial matter and to draw that correspondence and the lack of a reply to the attention of the Attorney General.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dermot Ahern said that I did not answer his Question No. 1.  Therefore I will read the extract from my reply which deals with that question.</P>
      <P>The commitment in the Government's programme in relation to the feasibility of splitting the two roles of the Attorney General was in the context of a review of the Ministers and Secretaries Act and this review is, as I stated yesterday, in progress.  It can also be anticipated that the Constitution Review Group will wish to examine Article 30 of the Constitution relating to the Attorney General. My predecessor in reply to a parliamentary question of 18 October last from my colleague, Deputy De Rossa, as in reply to previous questions stated that he had no proposal to alter the existing arrangements.  In contrast [I have already stated this on two occasions] the parties forming this Government have agreed that the roles of the Attorney General [the respective roles and division thereof] required examination and this is being done.  We will act, if necessary, on foot of that examination.</P>

He also told me, I think after he made his decision, that there was no basis or need for him to appear before the committee.  I did not ask him to or give him any advice on whether he should do so; that was his decision, but he did inform me of it after the event.</P>

Apart from reviewing the file from a specific point of view, should he not have satisfied himself, in discussion with Mr. Russell, that this explosive case was being properly dealt with in those five months?  Has the Taoiseach information on whether the Attorney General lived up to his duty in running the office by specifically inquiring from Mr. Russell whether the case was proceeding satisfactorily? The committee was not told about the matter.  Why was it not possible for the lawyers to tell the lawyers advising the committee about the conflict of interest on a lawyer basis? Would that not have been a possibility if the Taoiseach was genuinely interested in informing the committee about the position from a legal point of view?

      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  I am sure he is aware of the popularity of Cahermacnaughton Fort, the law school of the O'Daverns and the Corcomroe area is of great historical interest.  The Connole family have informed me that the Office of Public Works has failed to maintain the Cahermacnaughton Fort site and have suggested that a car park is necessary to facilitate the number of tourists visiting the fort.  I understand tourists visit the area all year round, but that in peak season up to 200 people per day visit the fort.  The Connole family run a bed and breakfast business beside the fort and access to their home is frequently blocked by the vehicles of those visiting the fort.  As the fort is of great archaeological and historical value, will the Minister take immediate steps to resolve this problem?  I understand the Connole family have no option but to close access to the fort.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, a statutory provision in the Finance Act, 1994, required that guidelines be drawn up by the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht and An Chomhairle Ealaíon, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, for determining, for the purpose of section 2 of the Finance Act, 1969, whether works falling to be considered under that section are original and creative works and whether they have, or are generally recognised as having, cultural or artistic merit.</P>
      <P>The Deputy is further aware that section 2 of the Finance Act, 1969 provides that a work for the purposes of the section is an original and creative work in one of the following categories: &mdash; a book or other writing, a play, a musical composition, a painting or like picture, and a sculpture.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that what has been agreed between myself, An Chomhairle Ealaíon and the Minister for Finance are guidelines that restore the original intent of this statute as envisaged in 1969 in a way that takes reasonable cognisance of the present state of cultural activity in the country and bearing in mind what is practically achievable by statute.</P>
      <P>Assessment of individual cases is a matter for the Office of the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister will agree that since 1969 tax exemptions for artists have been of tremendous practical and financial assistance to many of them.  I note the Minister stated that the criteria for such exemptions must ensure that the work is original, creative and has cultural or artistic merit.  Does he agree that the regulations are very restrictive and exclude works which, up to now, were included.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The volume of applications put the scheme under pressure. Since 1969 section 2 of the Finance Act was operated by the Revenue Commissioners along the lines stated in my <Col N="1718" /> reply, but the absence of definitions caused some difficulty.  Following the introduction of the appeals mechanism in 1989, people began to lodge appeals regarding their works.  The appeals commissioners heard cases which contended that works contained elements of originality and creativity and in some cases applicants were successful in seeking exemptions.  Lengthy disputes arose about the inclusion of items such as school text books, books used primarily as aid to professional practice, works which arguably mainly presented existing facts or ideas and were compendiums of no knowledge rather than original or imaginative works.  The established criteria are an attempt to deal with the issue of absence of definition so that the basis on which an appeal is made will be a response to known conditions.  The scheme has benefited many artists, and I pay tribute to those who introduced it, but to retain its effectiveness it was necessary to prevent its diffusion through vague definition.  The intention of the new guidelines is to direct the benefits of the section to those originally envisaged under the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I would agree with the Minister if we were talking about huge numbers but the information I have been given, and I am open to correction, is that in the past 26 years, only 4,800 works were submitted and of those approximately 50 per cent were accepted under the old criteria for tax exemptions.  The regulations brought in are rather parsimonious since we should encourage creativity.  The arts plan recognises the importance of allowing artists the right to live by their art and we should create the climate whereby those involved in the arts are seen as being part of an industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Genuine applicants and the people who are referred to in the arts plan will not be discommoded by the guidelines.  The people who may be are those who previously, on appeal, would have argued for an equivalence <Col N="1719" /> between a work of original insight, imagination and creativity and, say, a practical handbook for professional usage.  The difference is that the former is associated with the work of the artist, as the Deputy describes it, but the latter deals with what one might regard as a tool of one's profession.  There is a difference between the two.  It is worth giving the guidelines a chance to see if they manage to accrue the benefits of the Finance Act, which I welcomed, to those who most deserve them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Over a period of 25 years, only 2,400 applicants benefited from those tax exemptions.  I asked the Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, a parliamentary question on Tuesday, 25 April on whether he was considering expanding the tax regime for artists to include actors, musicians and those persons who create jobs in the music business. Unfortunately, I received a one line reply stating: &ldquo;I have no plans to expand the scope of existing relief for artists provided in section 2 of the Finance Act, 1969&rdquo;.  Will the Minister agree that not only do we not have any plans to expand the scope of existing relief for artists but there has been a limitation of that relief which will result in many artists being excluded?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The way to assist artists such as those to whom Deputy de Valera refers is by way of proposals specifically dealing with their situation rather than by confusing the distinction between, say, a work of art and artistic interpretation.  There is a huge difference between the two.  Actors and others &mdash; and I would be very sympathetic for many reasons towards their position &mdash; are really involved in artistic interpretation.  That deserves special and separate provision rather than dilution of an existing provision which exists for the production of a work of artistic, imaginative and creative effort.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the European Union Structural Funds Operational Programme for Tourism 1994-99, it is envisaged there will be expenditure of over £67 million on national and regional cultural activities.  This will include expenditure on developments at the major national cultural institutions, as well as on regional initiatives and the establishment of a cultural development incentives scheme in co-operation with local authority-private contributions.</P>
      <P>While the detailed allocation of all the funds available under the operational programme has not been finalised, funds have been committed at national level to the development of the National Museum at Collins Barracks and investment in a new home in Dublin Castle for the Chester Beatty Library.  At regional level, funds have been allocated to Galway and Longford Theatres, Crawford Municipal Gallery, Cork and the Hunt Museum, Limerick.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will also be aware that I have invited proposals for consideration for funding under the cultural development incentives scheme.  This scheme has been over-subscribed which is a good indication in itself, and the process of evaluation of projects has been made extremely complex by both the quantity and quality of the applications received. No decisions have been made yet with regard to the individual projects to receive allocations under the cultural development incentives scheme.</P>

      <P>This is our biggest single allocation of capital moneys ever made to the arts involving a total of £67 million. Will the Minister accept it is grossly unsatisfactory that there has not been a public debate on how this money is to be spent?  Will he further accept that no agreed criteria have been laid down in regard to how allocations ought to be made?  As of now, there is no evidence that these moneys will be spent in accordance with the area based principles laid down in the three year arts plan designed by the Arts Council.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>If I were to ignore the plan, which is a work of partnership between the Arts Council and my Department, I would hardly appoint representatives of the Arts Council to the advisory committee which will advise me.  It is not true that there has not been much debate on the allocation of funds.  The purpose of the three year plan was to integrate the capital funding with the envisaged expenditure over a period of time, with the current funding. That is why we had prioritised counties and areas of excellence.  Instead of it being done in an arbitrary way, it is being done quite consciously through an attempt to integrate the development plan, which has to be approved by Government, and the Structural Funds. The invitation, which was part of an advertisement to local authorities and others, to submit projects led to considerable debate on the quality of projects. Approximately 170 projects were submitted and I have said publicly that they are of excellent quality.  This forced a debate at local authority level, which I very much appreciate, on the merits of different projects.  Funding will not be allocated in an arbitrary way.  The <Col N="1722" /> Deputy knows there will be representatives of the Arts Council, my Department and the regions on the advisory committee.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister accept that he has already ignored the plan and the Arts Council in respect of the allocations made to the institutions which he described as being the major national institutions?  Will he accept that it is absurd for the Arts Council to make allocations when the Minister is also making allocations from his Department without any consultation with the council or with local authorities?  Will the Minister comment on that?</P>

      <P>Did the Minister confer with the Arts Council?  Why is it that moneys paid out to the Abbey Theatre were not paid through the Arts Council? Whose decision was it to pay those moneys through a different channel? This afternoon the Taoiseach referred to the fact that he could not allocate public moneys as if they were his own. Does that apply to all Departments?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I rely on the Deputy's sense of fairness to broadcast the truth.  I consulted the Arts Council on the allocation of £300,000 to the Abbey Theatre.  There had been an argument between the Arts Council and the Abbey Theatre about the cost of reconstructing the foyer of the building, which was approximately £500,000.  The Abbey Theatre received approximately £250,000 from the Arts Council towards the cost of that work.  The view of the Arts Council was that it had discharged its responsibilities and it was now up to the Abbey Theatre to find the balance of the funding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Arts Council did not advise against giving £300,000 to the Abbey Theatre to wipe out the debt which was a source of contention between the two bodies and on which it was paying <Col N="1723" /> interest.  Savings made in my Department came to between £400,000 and £500,000 at the end of the year and I allocated some money, about £125,000, to unemployment centres for a pilot scheme which was described in the Estimates as community arts intervention schemes.  I then allocated £300,000 to the Abbey Theatre to enable the block to be taken away so that the Arts Council and the Abbey Theatre could go on in an orderly way and plan its future.</P>
    <P>I did not allocate this money against the advice of the Arts Council, it was consulted and matters were handled properly.  In fact I took that decision during the period of office of the last Government &mdash; I think in September &mdash; but when I left Government the money was allocated for another purpose &mdash; I can go into that if Deputies so wish.  An issue arose about the National Ballroom but it did not have an application in my Department at that time.  They were planning the future of the National Ballroom and I had suggested to them in September that Dublin Corporation should purchase the building and thereafter could apply in the normal way for development funds.  That is exactly what happened.</P>

This is a difficult matter because I am anxious that counties and regions be represented but at the same time there are many counties where the representatives are simply not available because they have applied for funding. As I have said, I have to make the best decision to make it as representative as possible not only in the sense of geography but to get people whose judgment <Col N="1724" /> is good and who will be able to bring a broad vision to bear on it.  I will establish the committee in the next few weeks.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>The current situation in relation to the dispute at Pack ard Electric is that following the breakdown of talks under the auspices of the Labour Relations Commission, the Labour Court intervened in the dispute in accordance with the terms of section 26 (5) of the Industrial Relations Act, 1990. The court had discussions with both parties yesterday and issued a recommendation this morning.  I appreciate that the terms of the recommendation require compromise on both sides.  It is in my view a balanced attempt by the Labour Court to reconcile the conflicting aspirations of both parties and should be seen as such by all concerned.  I would hope that the recommendation provides the basis for an agreement between both parties.  It is up to the parties to decide on the issue and both sides are no doubt aware of the consequences if agreement is not reached.  In view of the fact that the recommendation is being considered by the parties it would not be helpful for me or any other third party to make further comments at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply but on every occasion I raise this issue I am told that it would not be helpful to speak further on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister will be aware, the full details of what has emerged was broadcast on the airwaves and the job sharing option, should it be available, has been <Col N="1726" /> floated.  This was discussed openly and freely on the radio by various commentators. For the Minister to say that he would find it distinctly unhelpful to respond further is, I think, dodging the issue.  I understand his point that both parties are discussing it but it is in the public arena and has been commented upon on the national airwaves.  That being so, I think the Minister should give details of the arrangements that have been put to the two separate groups so that we can then discuss them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy recognises it would not be appropriate for me to comment on the acceptability of the arrangements to either party.  The Labour Court recommendation deals with the issue of a 31 hour working week, the redundancy package for the 42 people and the lay-offs taking effect next month as well as the issue of job sharing. The package covers the issue of concern to the different parties.  The parties have the opportunity to consider that package and, as I said in my reply, I think the Labour Court has put together a balanced package seeking to deal with the concerns of both sides in a manner that gives them a way forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>It may well be balanced in that it addresses each difficulty in a separate fashion but it is a very hard pill to swallow for everybody concerned, particularly the workers.  We all recognise that they will have to make hard decisions, decisions about possible lay-offs, and job sharing that will affect every worker in the firm.  The ramifications of the decisions may bring heartache and will require a spirit of generosity from everyone in the firm.  What time frame is available to them within which they must make up their minds on the 31 hour week, the 42 redundancies, the 400 people affected and job sharing?  I hope that whatever arrangements are reached will be clear and that no one will be under any illusion about the length of the working week, the number of people affected and the likelihood of job sharing being a realistic <Col N="1727" /> objective for a stated length of time. Workers were under the impression last January, for whatever reason, that if they worked a 31 hour week, which they did, there would be minimal redundancies in June.  That proved to be incorrect. I showed the Minister the communication I had on the last occasion.  My understanding is that political assurances were given at that time that there would be minimal layoffs despite political knowledge that this would not be so. Will the Minister ensure that the facts are made clear?  The workers have suffered much pain and there is more ahead.</P>

      <P>I understand the intention is to hold it today.  I do not have confirmation of the detailed arrangements envisaged for doing so. One element of the recommendation I omitted to mention is that in the event of people not being taken back in 1996 there will be discussions on the issue of redundancy not just for 42 people but a greater number of workers.  That is part of the package.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was much toing and froing between management and others and in the maelstrom of the discussions many scenarios were painted.  We did not mislead anyone or shroud anything in mist.  Mr. Schramm may have indicated in January that he envisaged the possibility of 400 layoffs.  When I received his letter I indicated categorically by direct <Col N="1728" /> reply that this was not in accord with our discussions.  I indicated that to suggest it was would be misleading and that if it was his understanding of our discussions it would be conveyed to the work force.  I indicated that my interpretation of the suggestion of layoffs on that scale was in the context of the company not securing agreement in January. Agreement was secured and the company gave a commitment to make every effort to secure new business.  The issue of political shrouding, if that is what the Deputy suggests&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">

      <P>I stated categorically that such a suggestion was made on one occasion and I clearly signalled to the management that it did not reflect our discussions.  It did not arise in the discussions then or subsequently.  I indicated to management that was not our understanding but was new material.  I had a telephone conversation with Mr. Schramm at the time and understood that such scale of redundancy was in the context of agreement not being reached in January.  No one on the political side misled the workers.  It is not my intention to mislead them.</P>

Since then we have been engaged in discussions with management at the highest level and with the trade union. We endeavour to assist the Labour Relations Commission and the Labour Court if we can do so usefully.

He said he did not know what I was talking about.  He stated: &ldquo;no figure for prospective layoffs was included in any arrangement with us&rdquo;.  When I asked the Minister if he had received correspondence which referred to a figure of 400 redundancies he said he had not.  Did he receive correspondence in January from Mr. David Schramm which referred to 400 or more lay-offs?  I understand this correspondence was addressed to the Minister but it may have gone to his Department.  Did he have any knowledge of the letter and, if not, why did he not say so when I raised the matter in the House?

The subsequent agreement was reached on the basis that the management would strive to find new business and that the new working arrangements were agreed.  That is the context in which an agreement was presented to workers.  The letter had fallen completely out of the reckoning, it was a single letter which bore no relationship to any of our negotiations. I clearly indicated to Mr. Schramm that it bore no such relationship and he did not come back on that issue.  Mr. Schramm and the management of the company have indicated on numerous occasions since then that they could not have predicted the level of lay-offs until they had seen how the agreement reached in January worked and how their efforts to secure new business proceeded. This is why they were not in a position until the end of April to indicate the position to the workforce.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 97:</P>
      <P>In page 54, to delete lines 4 to 10 and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;94.  &mdash;(1)  A person shall not engage in the business of collecting repayments whether personally or by his employee or agent&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(a)  subject to subsection (2) between the hours of 9 o'clock in the evening on any week day and <Col N="1777" /> 10 o'clock in the morning on the following day or</P>
    <P>(b)  at any time on a Sunday or public holiday (within the meaning of the Holidays (Employees) Act, 1973).</P>
    <P>(2)  Where the consumer has given a consent in writing in the form set out in the Seventh Schedule nothing in subsection (1) (a) shall prevent a person from also collecting repayments between the hours of 8 o'clock in the morning and 10 o'clock in the morning on any week day.</P>
    <P>(3)  Any consent under subsection (2)  shall be separate from any other document.</P>
    <P>(4)  A copy of such consent shall be furnished to the consumer within 10 working days of receipt of it by the person to whom it is addressed.</P>
    <P>(5)  A consent given in the form set out in the Seventh Schedule shall subsist unless and until a revocation of it in writing is received from the consumer.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The proposal here is to amend the relevant section relating to hours of collection by fixing the hours between 9 o'clock in the evening and 10 o'clock in the morning while allowing a consumer to consent in writing to different hours of collection between 8 a.m. and 10 a.m. on any given morning.  It involves setting out in a Seventh Schedule a formula of words whereby consumers would be given the right to set out in a formal document signed by them, an extension of the authorised collecting hours.  This is a sensible arrangement.  I note that for some technical reasons the original Seventh Schedule tendered in association with this amendment is not now with this copy of the amendments. If he is agreeable to the principle of this amendment I can undertake to move an associated amendment either to the satisfaction of the Minister or alternatively, the Minister's expert draftsman could draft a Seventh Schedule form.</P>
    <P>Flexibility should be permissible. <Col N="1778" /> where it suits some people to have collections made outside of fixed hours they should be able to opt for the 8 a.m. to 10 a.m. period if they sign a consent to that arrangement being made.  It also occurs to me that the whole notion of this proposed amendment is that any such consent can be revoked.  Anybody who finds it a nuisance can indicate in writing to the collector that he or she wishes to revert to the normal statutory position and that should be the end of the matter.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister accept the amendment as reasonable in principle?  If he considers that his officials are more competent to draft the Seventh Schedule they are welcome to do such drafting. Alternatively, I will undertake to move an associated amendment to constitute the Seventh Schedule to set out a form which would meet the case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept there is justification for allowing the collection of repayments outside the hours of 9 o'clock in the evening of any weekday and 10 o'clock of the following day, provided this is the express wish of the consumer and such collections do not cause any disruption to family life or give rise to unseemly squabbles in front of children or other family members.</P>
      <P>It is not alone important but imperative that the consumer must give prior consent in writing and in a document separate from the moneylending agreement. It must also be mandatory that the consumer is given a copy of the consent within ten working days of receipt of it by the moneylender.</P>
      <P>I regard my acceptance of the principle of collection out of hours as a concession to the legal moneylending industry. Moreover, I would trust that my good faith will not prove unfounded and result in my subsequently being inundated with voluminous complaints about abuses of what is a significant concession.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Deputy McDowell.  The point, due consideration, is reasonable and the protection is there in terms of the consent of the consumer.  I need <Col N="1779" /> technical advice here.  I am disposed towards accepting Deputy McDowell's amendment.  I cannot account for the reason the attendant Seventh Schedule is missing.  If it is in order for us to accept the amendment and for my colleagues in conjunction with Deputy McDowell to draft the necessary Seventh Schedule &mdash; which I understand is not complicated and is brief &mdash; I am in agreement.  If not, I suggest when the Bill goes to the Seanad&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with this proposal as Deputy McDowell well knows.  I do not know whether the Minister was in the Seanad when it was debated.  It was a warm day and I was there all day.  I think the Minister came in and that he agreed with my point of view.  The reason this provision was inserted in the Bill originally was to ensure people would not be bothered in their homes at unsuitable hours, particularly when children are coming and going.  The Minister referred to that and said it should not lead to squabbles in front of children.  That is one of the areas about which I feel strongly.  I <Col N="1780" /> recognise that if a vote is called Fianna Fáil cannot win it.</P>
      <P>The Minister said he would agree to the amendment in the interests of the legal money-lenders but that it must be accompanied by a separate written agreement by the consumer that he or she will allow these collection call times. Has it occurred to the Minister that there may well be consumers who are not able to cope?  There may well be pressure, though not explicitly expressed, or implications of a different kind in connection with getting the required money, which for people in those circumstances is desperately and urgently required, but it will depend on signing another form.  The consumer finds that getting that money depends on signing not only the first form but also the form allowing collection times outside of the hours which had been explicitly stated in the Bill which I prepared. I am disappointed.  I recognise clearly that forcing a vote is an empty exercise, but this proposal is a negation of an effort to try, within this Bill, to put the interests of the consumer on a par, if not above, the interests of the provider.</P>
      <P>The provider has lots of power, knowledge and experience, but the consumer borrowing from legal money-lenders does not have knowledge, experience or commercial cop-on.  If they had they obviously would be going to other sources of credit.  I recognise that legal money-lenders are necessary for people who need money in particular circumstances and to have it readily available to them but knowing the status of the consumer who will be signing up I do not agree with this amendment.  This is a very unwelcome extension to this Bill. I am not calling for a vote because it would be an empty exercise but I am expressing my views very strongly and I will do so outside the House also.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>If I thought for one minute this was an anti-consumer measure I would have great sympathy for the arguments put forward by Deputy O'Rourke but I take the view, and I think it is a reasonable one, that <Col N="1781" /> this introduces flexibility into the arrangement between the consumer and the lender.  It also has the great merit that it facilitates many consumers who would be inconvenienced by a rigid approach such as that originally in the Bill.  I do not want to rehash the arguments that have been put forward but I can say for certain that there are many people and many households for whom excluding collection between 8 a.m. and 10 a.m. would be an inconvenience, that they might like to have a repayment scheduled for that time because they have to bring the children to school at 9 o'clock, and go on to a job or do the shopping.  There are many people, men and women, for whom that would be a convenience.  There is an element of prissiness to all this stuff which is not realistic.  In communities where there are door to door collections in respect of insurance, funeral money, milk money, bread deliveries and so on, there is no terrible shame about another man in a suit coming to the door between 8 a.m. and 10 a.m.  Children in those communities are not as naive as the Deputy considers.</P>

      <P>Legal money-lenders do not pressurise, abuse or degrade the people with whom they are dealing.  It does not make sense for them to do so and I believe the collective credit industry would be the first to desist from this if the Director of Consumer Affairs thought it was the subject of widespread abuse or causing unfairness and that they would be advised by him if he thought there was any social impropriety or unfairness arising out of the operation of this.  If he advised the collective credit industry to adopt a particularly sensitive approach to the use of such a consent mechanism they would be happy to abide by his guidance.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment replaces section 97 which is concerned with the continuity of licences granted under the Money-lenders Act, 1933, on the entry into force of this legislation.  By virtue of section 22 the entering into force of the legislation will result in the repeal of section 5 of the Moneylenders Act, 1933, and could thus create a hiatus in which the existing licences would no longer be valid.  The purpose of section 97 is to avoid what would be a major disruption to the business of legal moneylending.  At present moneylending licences are granted by the Revenue Commissioners on application by an existing or would-be moneylender to the court.  Licences are issued annually and have a termination date of 31 July. As it is my intention that Part VIII of the Bill which deals with moneylending shall have legal effect by means of ministerial order before 31 July, 1995 there will still be a period in which existing moneylending licences would have to run before their normal expiry date. Arising from the present amendment all licences issued under the Moneylenders <Col N="1784" /> Act in force at the time of commencement of section 97 of the Bill shall continue in force under Part VIII until 31 July following commencement of Part VIII of the Bill.  Secondly, and to avoid confusion about the intention of this section, I want to make it clear that it does not provide for extension beyond 31 July to moneylenders' licences due to expire on that date.</P>

      <P>This amendment proposes the deletion of section 98 (2) which empowered the Minister to make regulations from time to time amending the form and content of moneylending agreements.  The power to make such regulations has been inserted, as Deputies will recall, by virtue of amendment No. 48b agreed on 10 May earlier in the Bill.

      <P>I move amendment No. 99f:</P>
      <P>In page 55, to delete lines 28 to 30, and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3)  An application for an authorisation shall be in writing and in such form as the Director may determine and shall contain&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  the true name of the applicant,</P>
      <P>(b)  the name under which the applicant trades,</P>
      <P>(c)  the name of any undertaking for which the applicant acts or intends to act as a mortgage intermediary,</P>
      <P>(d)  the address of any business premises of the applicant to which the application relates, and</P>
      <P>(e)  such other information that the Director may require.</P>
      <P>(4)  An application for an authorisation shall be accompanied by a fee of&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  £500 for companies and partnerships, and</P>
      <P>(b)  £250 for sole traders.</P>
      <P>(5)  Any of the fees referred to in subsection (4) may by regulations be varied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(6)  A person shall not wilfully give <Col N="1786" /> any information which is false or misleading in respect of an application for an authorisation.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment deletes section 100 (3) and substitutes therefor detailed provisions relating to an application for a mortgage intermediaries authorisation. An application must be in writing and must contain the true name of the applicant; the name of any undertaking for which the applicant acts or intends to act as a mortgage intermediary; the business name and address of the intermediary and any other information that the director may require.</P>
    <P>The amendment is consistent with amendment No. 87d which introduced similar provisions in respect of applications for a moneylender's licence and also harmonises the information requirements to be contained in both the application for and the authorisation issued to mortgage intermediaries.</P>
    <P>The fee structure is also set out specifically in subsection (4) and not just merely by way of reference to section 10 (3)  which stipulates the fees payable by credit intermediaries.  An applicant who is a company or partnership must pay an application fee of £500.  Where the applicant is a sole trader the application fee is £250.  These fees may be varied by ministerial regulations under subsection (5).</P>
    <P>The final subsection provides that a person shall not wilfully give false or misleading information when applying for an authorisation.  Amendment No. 87g inserted a similar duty of truth in respect of an application for a moneylender's licence.</P>

      <P>The fees payable are substantial.  A sole trader will have to pay an application fee of £250.  Small businesses in particular are already paying substantial amounts in PAYE, PRSI and rates and now find that further cost is being imposed on them.  I ask the Minister of State to be more lenient given that a substantial amount of money, running into a few million pounds, will be raised for the Office of <Col N="1787" /> the Director of Consumer Affairs.  The emphasis should not be on profit-making. The charges are over the top.</P>

Having considered the matter, in all fairness, having regard to the benefits which derive from being an authorised intermediary, the charges &mdash; £500 in the case of a company or partnership and £250 in the case of a sole trade &mdash; are not excessive.  This is not an unreasonable imposition in 1995.</P>

      <P>Both amendments are connected and concerned with section 100 which deals with mortgage intermediaries.  Amendment No. 99g deletes the word &ldquo;and&rdquo; because a new subsection, subsection (d), is being added by amendment No. 99h.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 99h inserts a new provision relating to the information which shall be contained in a mortgage intermediaries authorisation.  The new subsection requires the name of any undertaking, for example, a bank, building society, trustee savings bank or finance house, for which the holder of the <Col N="1788" /> authorisation acts as a mortgage intermediary to be included as part of the information to be specified in the authorisation. This was an omission and is now being remedied on the advice of the Attorney General's office.  The authorisation to be issued to credit intermediaries under section 10 has always required that this type of information be included in the credit intermediaries authorisation.</P>

In addition to the holders of bookmakers', intoxicating liquor and gaming licences, the list is now being extended to include the holders of pawnbrokers' or money-lenders' licences.

      <P>I move amendment No. 99j:</P>
      <P>In page 56, to delete lines 23 to 40 and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(9)  The Director may suspend or revoke an authorisation if he is satisfied that since becoming the holder of an authorisation, a mortgage intermediary or any business with which he is connected has been convicted of a criminal offence or a mortgage intermediary has become the holder of a licence referred to in subsection (7) (c)  or has failed to comply with any regulations made under subsection (8).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1790" /> (10)  Whenever the Director proposes to refuse to grant, suspend or revoke an authorisation he shall notify the applicant or the holder of the authorisation, as the case may be, of his proposal and shall, if any representations are made to him in writing by such applicant or holder within 14 days of the notification, consider the representations.</P>
    <P>(11)  Whenever the Director, having considered any representations that may have been made under subsection (10) decides to refuse to grant, suspend or revoke an authorisation, he shall notify the applicant for, or as the case may be, the holder of, the authorisation of the decision and the grounds for such decision and such applicant or holder may, within 7 days of receipt of such notification, appeal against such decision to the judge of the Circuit Court within whose Circuit the business to which the authorisation relates is to be carried on.</P>
    <P>(12)  A notification referred to in subsection (10) or (11) shall be delivered personally or sent by pre-paid registered post to the business address of the applicant for an authorisation or the holder of the authorisation concerned, as the case may be.</P>
    <P>(13)  Where a notification under subsection (10) or (11) relates to a refusal to grant a second or subsequent authorisation or a suspension or revocation of an authorisation, the refusal, suspension or revocation shall take effect upon the expiration of the 7 days allowed for the appeal.</P>
    <P>(14)  Where an appeal is made under subsection (11) by an applicant for a second or subsequent authorisation in respect of a refusal to grant such authorisation or by a holder of an authorisation in respect of a suspension or revocation of an authorisation, the refusal, suspension or revocation shall stand suspended until the appeal is determined or withdrawn and, notwithstanding subsection (5), <Col N="1791" /> any authorisation held by the applicant at the time of the appeal shall continue in force until the determination or withdrawal of the appeal.</P>
    <P>(15)  On the hearing of an appeal under subsection (11) in relation to a decision of the Director to refuse to grant, suspend or revoke an authorisation, the Circuit Court may either confirm the decision or allow the appeal and, where an appeal is allowed, the Director shall grant the authorisation or shall not suspend or revoke the authorisation, as the case may be.</P>
    <P>(16)  A decision of the Circuit Court of an appeal under subsection (11)  shall be final save that, by leave of that Court, an appeal from the decision shall lie to the High Court on a specified question of law.</P>
    <P>(17)  In an appeal under subsection (11)  the Director shall not be awarded or ordered to pay costs.</P>
    <P>(18)  In this section &lsquo;authorisation&rsquo; means a mortgage intermediaries authorisation.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment is concerned with section 100 &mdash; mortgage intermediaries &mdash; and deletes the present text of subsections (9), (10), (11), (12) and (13) which deal with the appeal procedures where the director refused to grant an authorisation.  The amendment also provides for the first time that the director shall have the power to suspend or revoke a mortgage intermediaries authorisation.</P>
    <P>I will now deal with the new provisions <i>ad seriatim</i> which are similar to those introduced by way of amendment 91 in respect of moneylenders licences. In new subsection (9), conviction for a criminal offence during the time of holding an authorisation, becoming the holder of bookmakers, liquor, gaming, pawnbrokers or moneylenders licences, or contravention of regulations made under subsection (8)  shall now be <Col N="1792" /> grounds on which the director may suspend or revoke an authorisation.</P>
    <P>Subsection (10) corresponds in a large measure to the present subsection (9). It extends the provisions of the existing subsection to the director's suspension or revocation of an authorisation. Consequently, where the director proposes to refuse to grant an authorisation, or proposes to suspend, revoke or vary the terms or conditions of a current authorisation, he must notify the applicant or the holder of the authorisation, as appropriate, of his proposal.  Such applicant or holder is entitled to make, within 14 days of receipt of the notification, representations to the director in respect of his proposal.</P>
    <P>Subsection (11) provides that, if having considered any representations made under subsection (10), the director decides not to grant the authorisation or decides to suspend or revoke an existing authorisation, he shall notify the holder or the applicant of the decision and the grounds on which he has based his decision.  The holder or applicant may, within seven days of receiving the notification, appeal the decision to the Circuit Court within whose circuit the business to which the authorisation relates is to be carried on.</P>
    <P>The provisions of subsection (12) replace subsection (13).  Any notification made under this section from the director must be delivered personally or sent by pre-paid registered post to the business address of the mortgage intermediary or applicant.</P>
    <P>Subsection (13)  provides that where the notification refers to a refusal to grant a second or subsequent authorisation, a suspension or revocation of an authorisation, such refusal, suspension or variation shall take effect upon the expiration of the seven days allowed for the appeal.</P>
    <P>Subsection (14) provides that pending the determination or withdrawal of an appeal against the director's refusal to grant a second or subsequent authorisation or his decision to suspend or revoke an existing authorisation, the refusal, suspension or revocation shall <Col N="1793" /> not take effect, and any authorisation held shall continue in force until the appeal is finalised.</P>
    <P>Subsection (15) replaces the provisions of subsection (10).  The Circuit Court may either confirm the director's decision to refuse to grant, suspend or revoke an authorisation or to allow the appeal.  Where the appeal is allowed the director shall grant the authorisation or shall suspend or revoke the authorisation, as the case may be.</P>
    <P>Subsections (16) and (17) which reinstate the provisions of subsections (11) and (12) are standard legislative provisions.  In the case of an appeal the director shall not be awarded or ordered to pay the cost of that appeal.  The decision of the Circuit Court shall be final except where, with the permission of that court, the decision may reside with the High Court on a specified question of law.</P>
    <P>Subsection (18) serves to define the &ldquo;authorisation&rdquo; as being a mortgage intermediaries authorisation.</P>
    <P>Finally, the reference in new subsection (9) to subsection 7 (c) may seem confusing.  The letters (a), (b), (c) etc. are now being inserted for Roman numerals (i), (ii) etc.</P>

    <P>(2)  A person shall not falsify or attempt to falsify a mortgage intermediaries authorisation.</P>
    <P>103.  &mdash;Where the holder of a mortgage intermediaries authorisation ceases to act on behalf of any undertaking specified in the authorisation or commences to act as a mortgage intermediary on behalf of any undertaking not specified in the authorisation, the holder shall upon such cessation or commencement inform in writing the Director of the change and forward the authorisation to the Director, and the Director shall accordingly, as he sees fit, amend the authorisation or issue another authorisation incorporating the change.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment inserts a new section 101 into the Bill and imposes an obligation on a mortgage intermediary to display a copy of the authorisation, granted by the Director of Consumer Affairs, in a prominent place in any premises where he engages in his business. He will also be obliged to display a notice in these premises stating clearly the name of any undertaking for whom the holder acts as a mortgage intermediary &mdash; for example, banks, building societies etc.</P>

My purpose in bringing forward this amendment is to exclude tied branch agents of the building society members of the Irish Mortgage and Savings Association together with those of the Irish Permanent PLC, from the procedures whereby they would have to be authorised as mortgage intermediaries by the Director of Consomer Affairs.  These tied branch agents, of which there are about 500, represent the institutions generally in provincial towns but sometimes in city suburbs.</P>

    <P>I have had correspondence from and discussions with the Minister for Equality and Law Reform concerning the Equal Status Bill he is drafting which will prohibit discrimination on specified grounds of gender, marital status, family status, sexual orientation, religion, age, disability, race, colour, nationality, national or ethic origin and membership of the travelling community. The Minister for Equality and Law Reform has drawn it to my attention that this amendment could compromise the proposed anti-discrimination legislation for which he has responsibility. I share his view that rather than having two unaligned Bills dealing with <Col N="1797" /> discrimination in the consumer credit area, with the attendant risk of compromising the Equal Status Bill and Employment Equality Bill, the amendment to the Consumer Credit Bill should be withdrawn.</P>
    <P>I am mindful that my colleague has informed the Dáil of his intention that the Equal Status Bill will be published this year.

      <P>There is some merit in the Deputy's point.  A promise was given that an evaluation report would be given to an applicant applying to a financial institution for a loan for accommodation.  This involves the gender issue on which we are agreed.  Does it still stand that an applicant must be informed by the manager of the lending institution concerned of the reasons an application is rejected?  It is traumatic <Col N="1800" /> for small borrowers, especially those in small businesses, whose loan applications are rejected whether on the grounds of sex or traveller status.  Is there any provision in that section which will make it obligatory for the lending institution to state its reasons for rejecting an application, whether on the grounds of lack of ability to pay, sex, a bad record with another institution or a default in payment on a previous loan? We are all very much aware that there is a good deal of information available to financial institutions through the credit bureau as records can now be checked.  I understand agreement has been reached between those bodies, especially for hire purchase purposes. As lending institutions may not inform loan applicants of the reason their applications are rejected that poses problems for those applicants who are not aware of the reason they are refused, particularly those making a once off purchase whether buying a property, developing a business of requiring working capital. Will the Minister elaborate on that and consider incorporating a provision to provide for that in the section?</P>

He will recognise that the fear he articulated is adequately provided for in that section.  The equal status Bill will cover banking and insurance as well as other services. There is an obvious overlap between this provision and provisions in the equal status Bill.  This amendment omits many of the grounds of discrimination, including disability, included in the equal status Bill and introduces new grounds of discrimination not covered by the equal status Bill.

      <P>I move amendment No. 100(a):</P>
      <P>In page 65, lines 1 and 2, to delete &ldquo;credit agreement or consumer hire&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment to section 118 which restricts the use of inertia selling provisions relates to amendment No. 4 and the removal of hire purchase from the definition of a credit agreement.  This amendment ensures that the restrictions on the use of inertia selling provisions will apply equally to credit agreements, hire purchase agreements, consumer, hire, money lending and housing loan agreements.  For all such agreements provisions which require the consumer to indicate positively that he or she does not wish to purchase any goods or avail of any service in relation to the agreement are prohibitive.  Normally the positive indication is by means of placing a tick in a box.  The banning of intertia selling has been a feature of all recent national and EU consumer protection legislation, for example, doorstep selling regulations, the EU time share directive and so on.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 118 (1) bans the insertion by any person of a requirement in a credit agreement, a consumer hire agreement or the proposal on a loan application form in connection with such agreements that the consumer must indicate positively that he does not wish to purchase any goods or services in relation to the agreement.  Normally that means that a consumer must tick a box.  If the tick is not placed, the consumer is obliged to make the purchase of the goods or service.  The effect of the amendment is that liability for the use of inertia selling will now reside with the person who inserted the provision and not the creditor.  That is the net point <Col N="1802" /> and in line with the Committee Stage amendment No. 288 which extended the prohibition contained in subsection (1) on the use of inertia selling from the creditor to the more general term &ldquo;person&rdquo;.</P>

    <P>This amendment replaces section 120 which contains similar provisions.

Paragraph (a)  is a redraft of paragraph (a) and (b) of the original Bill and paragraph (b) contains, a new provision to the effect that a creditor or owner, as the case may be, cannot enforce an agreement which excludes or restricts liability or imposes further liability as set out in paragraphs (a) (i) and (ii).</P>

    <P>Deputy O'Keeffe queried this matter earlier.  The amendment redrafts section 122 concerning a duty to disclose information on the financial standing of the consumer.  Under section 122 if a creditor or an owner refuses to enter into an agreement for credit, hire purchase or consumer hire with a consumer, that person must disclose, within 14 days of receipt of a written request from the consumer in question, the name and address of any person from whom the creditor or owner has sought information on the financial standing of the consumer, where such information influenced the refusal to enter into an agreement.

      <P>I am not sure I understand the Deputy's query.  In circumstances where a reference has a negative effect and is an influential factor in a consumer being refused credit, the provisions of this amendment provide that within 14 days of a written application the consumer must be made aware of the identify of the third party.  Some of the wider information sought by Deputy O'Keeffe would be covered under the data protection legislation.  Those matters would be more appropriate for discussion under the freedom of information legislation.  We were concerned that a person could blacklist a consumer <Col N="1806" /> and be the cause of the consumer being refused credit.  Under this provision, having submitted a written application, the consumer is entitled to be made aware of such information within 14 days.</P>

      <P>This amendment relates to section 124 of the Bill which deals with the nature of &ldquo;finance arranged&rdquo; to be explained to the consumer.  The seller of goods, acting as a credit intermediary, must disclose in writing certain facts to the consumer such as the nature of the financial accommodation on offer, the amount, number and frequency of payments, the total amount payable, the APR, the name of the undertaking for which he &mdash; the seller &mdash; is acting as a credit intermediary and details or any commission, payment or consideration of any kind received from the undertaking for arranging such financial accommodation, before any agreement to purchase the goods in question shall be entered into.</P>
      <P>The present wording could give the impression that this information should be provided immediately on demand.</P>
      <P>In recognition of the fact that the sales person-credit intermediary may not always have all of the requisite details readily available, I am, at the suggestion of the draftsman, including a &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; clause whereby the seller gives the required information as soon as may be reasonable.

      <P>I note a disturbing trend in such new insertions in the Bill. This provision states &ldquo;as soon as may be reasonable&rdquo;, which sounds reasonable but opens a chasm between the consumer and the giver of credit.  Under this provision information need be given only as soon as may be reasonable. Surely it should be given immediately. Who will decide this?  Will it be the provider of the credit?  That might not be in the best interests of the consumer. When in Opposition, the Minister of State frequently made the point to me that consumers are constantly in the position of supplicator when applying for credit and believe that everything will be great once they receive the credit.  The same applies to people seeking mortgages, bank overdrafts and so on.</P>
      <P>Most people are apprehensive when seeking credit and feel a sense of relief once it is sanctioned.  Who will decide the timespan in which it is reasonable for information to be given?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two answers to that.  It is a well established precept in common law that what is reasonable depends on the particular merits and <Col N="1808" /> circumstances of the argument.  Far from shifting the balance as between consumer and credit institution, the definition of &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; does not matter in the sense of whether it is two or three weeks, ten days or whatever, because any agreement shall not be entered into unless and until all the required information is given to the consumer. The agreement is not consummated until the consumer has the information. It does not matter, therefore, whether it is ten days or two weeks because it does not shift in any way the balance as between consumer and lender.  There is little point in us having an emotional argument to that effect. The fact of the matter is that it can be quite a complex business.

Indeed, yesterday I received a further submission, which I have not had an opportunity to examine, from the Irish Bankers Federation on a range of issues.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Rourke has so remarked on a few occasions. However, I hope that Members on both sides of the House can be pleased that, ultimately, the Bill will be the better for having gone through this re-evaluation.</P>
      <P>I want to assure the credit institutions that the director shall not subject to scrutiny any charges, terms or conditions for which the approval of the Central Bank has already been given. Equally, when assessing proposals to increase existing charges or to introduce new charges for existing services, the Director shall have regard to the commercial justification, as well as the consumer interest, including the cost increases which the applicants shall put forward in support of their proposals.</P>
      <P>In this regard I would emphasise &mdash; and this is relevant to the amendment put forward by Deputy O'Rourke &mdash; that the legislation does not require the director to allow banks or financial institutions pass on any costs, including the £25,000 fee, in the form of increased charges.  In fact the opposite is the intention and this is the purpose of subsection 6 (b) of section 125.  Banks and financial institutions will now have cause to reflect before deciding to seek to increase charges because of the £25,000 fee.  The need to raise charges will arise from other costs and the cost of the fee will only arise if they seek to pass on these costs in whole or in part.  One of the primary reasons for having a fee of this level is to discourage too frequent and frivolous applications.  From the reactions I have heard to date, I am confident this objective will be achieved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following on these discussions I am looking at the range of charges which would be covered by the legislation.  The main focus and source of both consumer and business concerns are in relation to what is commonly referred to as transaction charges.  Transaction charges <Col N="1811" /> comprehend the following customer services, grant and management of overdraft facilities; making and receiving payment; providing foreign exchange or <i>bureau de change</i> facilities and issuing of statements related to these services.  I am mindful of the fact that some financial institutions provide services for wills, trustee services and conveyancing. It was clearly never the intention that the task of assessing charges by the Director of Consumer Affairs would be concentrated on the type of services I have just mentioned.</P>
    <P>Arising from the recent meetings, I am also examining the question of terms and conditions.  Regulations signed by the Minister for Enterprise and Employment on 1 February 1995 giving effect to the EU Unfair Terms Directive adopted in 1993, outlaw all unfair terms in consumer contracts concluded after 31 December 1994.  These regulations give extensive powers to the Director of Consumer Affairs and, in particular, allow him to go to the High Court seeking an order prohibiting the use or, as appropriate, the continued use of unfair terms.  The regulations also impose a duty on sellers or suppliers, including financial institutions, to ensure that terms in consumer contracts are written in plain, intelligible language.  In any case, where there is doubt, the interpretation most favourable to the consumer must prevail.</P>
    <P>It could be argued, therefore, that the consumer interest in regard to terms and conditions not individually negotiated with financial institutions is already well protected and adequately safeguarded.  But the same does not hold true to regards business customers, especially small and medium size enterprises.  This vital source of new jobs and product innovation must not find its path to development impeded or their ability to compete against the best internationally stifled by an unfair regime of bank terms and conditions.</P>
    <P>The Central Bank is not obliged to respond within a particular period to notifications to increase existing charges <Col N="1812" /> or to introduce new charges.  With the proposed requirement to pay an application fee, it is justified that the Director of Consumer Affairs should respond within a reasonable period to such notifications. This is the practice in the case of, for example, planning applications.  It has also been represented strongly to me that a &ldquo;fast track&rdquo; response period should be provided for new products. For this purpose new products would need to be carefully defined.  Two criteria are particularly relevant (a) the product was not previously offered to its customers in Ireland; (b) is being offered in a materially different way and is being offered as a choice.  Other issues raised with me and to which I am also giving attention relate to: whether institutions, such as building societies, would be allowed to pass on increases in charges where they would have to pay for the use of money transmission system operated by the clearing banks, without the necessity of having to pay an application fee to the director; the passing on to customers without reference to the director of third party charges, third party charges would mean any charges, cost or expense which is levied by a party other than the credit institution, in connection with the provision of a service to the credit institution or the customer and which is to be discharged by the customer.  An example would be the customer paying for a valuation report in connection with a house purchase transaction; allowing certain institutions to make group applications to the director, on the strict understanding that this procedure was not in breach of the competition legislation; the duty of confidentiality on the director and his staff particularly regarding commercially sensitive information.</P>
    <P>At this stage my consideration of these various and complex issues has not been completed.  Yesterday I received a further written detailed submission on a range of matters in the Bill from the Irish Bankers Federation.  I intend to introduce amendments in the Seanad <Col N="1813" /> and to report to the Dáil on these and other amendments which may be adopted in the Upper House.  I regret that I cannot accept the Deputy's amendment and I have been advised that it is not capable of being enshrined in law.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister made a long speech and covered many matters that had nothing whatsoever to do with the amendment I tabled, but that is his prerogative.  I will proceed to do the same and will give the history of transaction charges.</P>
      <P>The increasing complexity, range and number of bank transaction charges which the ordinary consumer and the small businesses were charged was the genesis of this Bill.  My concern about this led me to seek to redress the imbalance. The Minister will know I am telling the truth.  I pestered the Government with my ideas and at the end the then Minister for Finance and the then Taoiseach Deputy Reynolds and the Government gave me permission to go ahead and the amendment was tabled. This led to a very acrimonious debate in Setanta House after the Second Stage debate.  I sought to remove responsibility for monitoring and giving permission for bank transaction charges from the Central Bank, which had the legislative power to do so but was not fulfilling it and transfer it to the Director of Consumer Affairs who was keen and eager for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Central Bank while having the legislative right to monitor bank transaction charges seemed to be doing so on the nod, so to speak, as applications came in.  We were told that due process had been followed but announcements of new and bewildering transaction charges were made with remarkable rapidity.  This was the beginning of the debate and a frustrating debate it has been.  It is not that people are being charged that is the main issue, but that consumers do not know for what they are being charged.  I know that some banks are making an effort to address this but I do not know how far they have <Col N="1814" /> got as I have not checked on it lately.  A bank statement will show an impenetrable sum for bank charges, although in some cases a key is given for the various small signs indicating what the charges are for.  However, to be fair to the credit institutions they have tried to rectify this situation during the past two years.  At the early stages, possibly three years ago, one of the major banks agreed to supply a page with details of all the customer's charges in front of the statement but it had to alter the computer programme to do so.  People are charged for each cheque issued, for each cheque lodged, for time with the bank manager &mdash; although I find that particularly difficult to take.</P>
    <P>Today I received correspondence from somebody who had been invited by the manager of a credit institution to discuss business with him and he was very irritated when he was charged for the time he had spent with the manager. I find that inexplicable.  One is not charged for the time it takes to make any other purchase.  Be that as it may, some banks have made a real effort to redress this and I accept that.  Equally, some banks have made a real effort to cater for small businesses, in particular, the Bank of Ireland has made a very real effort and has produced a business plan for small businesses and gives guaranteed loans at guaranteed rates for a guaranteed length of time and one's home is no longer needed as collateral. This is a huge relief.</P>
    <P>I have been most pressing in my demands on the banks and I recognise what they have tried to do.  The Minister is continuing my effort and is seeking to transfer some responsibilities from the Central Bank to the Director of Consumer Affairs.  I hope the Minister will give expression to the fact that it is the complexity that bewilders consumers who want things explained.  Consumers want clearly explained the service charges they are paying.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State referred to submissions and I recall there was not a day when there was not a new submission one had to consider and one wondered <Col N="1815" /> whether it would offset something that had been agreed earlier.  The Minister of State proposes to levy a charge of £25,000 on banks and credit institutions when they make changes in bank charges but does that apply to every transaction of every credit institution as distinct from banks and is it on a sliding scale?</P>

      <P>Representations were made to me about smaller institutions. If you have profits of the order of £300 million, £25,000 is not significant but if you are a small one-stop shop it could be significant.  I received a further submission yesterday which I am examining.</P>

      <P>In page 70, between lines 40 and 41, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>128.&mdash;The Pawnbrokers Act, 1964, is hereby amended by the substitution for sections 7 to 10 of the following sections:</P>
      <P>7.&mdash;(1)  A person shall not carry on the business of a pawnbroker at any premises unless he is the holder of a licence which is in force in respect of those premises.</P>

    <P>(5)  The Director may suspend or revoke a licence where he is satisfied that a pawnbroker has become the holder of a licence referred to in subsection (3) (e) or has failed to comply with any of the terms or conditions of the licence or a pawnbroker or any business with which he is connected has been convicted of a criminal offence.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1818" /> (6)  Whenever the Director proposes to refuse to grant, suspend or revoke a licence he shall notify the applicant or the holder of the licence, as the case may be, of his proposal and shall, if any representations are made to him in writing by such applicant or holder within 14 days of the notification, consider the representations.</P>
    <P>(7)  Whenever the Director, having considered any representations that may have been made under subsection (6), decides to refuse to grant, suspend or revoke a licence, he shall notify the applicant for, or as the case may be, the holder of, the licence of the decision and the grounds for such decision and such applicant or holder may, within 7 days or receipt of such notification, appeal against such decision to the judge of the Circuit Court within whose circuit the business to which the licence relates is to be carried on.</P>

    <P>(b) under section 9 for the transfer of a licence,</P>
    <P>wilfully gives any information which is false or misleading shall be guilty of an offence.'.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 102a, 102b and 104 to 112 are put forward for the purpose of bringing some of the provisions of the <Col N="1820" /> Pawnbrokers Act, 1964 up to date.  Discussions have taken place with the Irish Pawnbrokers Association and the Department of Justice about the provisions of the Consumer Credit Bill as they affect pawnbrokers.  The proposals are being introduced on foot of these discussions.  As part of the package of amendments, the proposed limit on pawnbroking transactions will increase to £5,000.  Amendments Nos. 102a and 102b provide that the Director of Consumer Affairs will assume the functions of both the District Court and the Revenue Commissioners in relation to the licensing of pawnbrokers.</P>
    <P>Under the Pawnbrokers Act, 1964 a pawnbroker is required to obtain a District Court certificate and thereafter to take out an excise licence from the Revenue Commissioners.  They are, in essence, in the business of advancing secured monetary loans and, as the Consumer Credit Bill is the vehicle whereby a complete overhaul of virtually all aspects of moneylending is being achieved, it is appropriate to transfer the pawnbroking business to the regulatory control of the Director of Consumer Affairs.</P>
    <P>It is proposed that a pawnbroker will have the right of appeal to the Circuit Court regarding the Director's decisions on pawnbrokers' licensing matters as provided for in section 10 (5) of the 1964 Act.  The Director of Consumer Affairs, as the licensing authority under section 8 of the Bill, is being given, under that section, the necessary powers to suspend or revoke a pawnbroker's licence.  On Committee Stage, section 15 of the Pawnbrokers Act, 1964, which provides that a pawnbroker may make a special contract with a person in respect of a loan of more than £10, was restored.  The purpose of the amendment to the section is to take account of consequential amendments to pawn tickets when a pawnbroker makes a special contract under section 15.</P>
    <P>Section 12 restates the law as regards forgery or falsification of a licence or <Col N="1821" /> any attempt to do so.  The monetary limits of District Court fines specified for the contravention of provisions of various sections of the Pawnbrokers Act, 1964 are being updated as part of the process.  The monetary limit for the payment of compensation for the making of frivolous complaints is also revised.</P>

      <P>It is good to include these sections in the Bill.  It makes sense to transfer the powers to the Director of Consumer Affairs in light of the activities carried on by pawnbrokers.  Like moneylenders they are part of life and fulfil a great need.  They played a vibrant part in the life of Dublin as portrayed in one of Sean O'Casey's plays.  When I was a student there were many pawnbrokers in the city.  Perhaps people are more affluent now and do not need to use their services.

      <P>No. The limits that applied were so out of date that it is not surprising the number has contracted to four.  Two operate a single shop so, in fact, there are only three shops left in the city.  I acknowledge the Deputy's graciousness but I would not like her to think that moving the Department of Justice to action was easy or could be repeated.  I am very grateful for the detailed and well researched advice I received on the matter but unfortunately it was a twelfth hour development and I might have missed lining out today.  I am delighted that this did not happen.  The Department took seriously the arguments in the House that it was <Col N="1823" /> anachronistic or anomalous for pawnbrokers not to be covered in the legislation. As a result it tackled the matter from the beginning and much care has been taken in drafting the amendments from No. 102 onwards.  I am advised &mdash; I am sure this is correct &mdash; that the pawnbrokers' association is satisfied with the balance that has been achieved. I am glad this area has been included in the Bill as it is the appropriate place for it.</P>

    <P>The deletions in section 11 are a consequence of the provision in the newly inserted section 8 which introduces amendments to the mechanism for the suspension or revocation of a pawnbroker's licence.  The provisions in section 11 which are being deleted allowed a member of the Garda Síochána not below the rank of inspector to bring an application for revocation of licence to the District Court.  Under this amendment the Director of Consumer Affairs, the licensing authority under section 8, is being given the necessary powers to suspend or revoke a pawnbroker's licence.  Section 12 restates the law as regards the forgery or falsification of a licence and any attempt to do so.  It is considered that there is no need to retain those references in the previous section 12 which covered the forging of a District Court certificate since such a certificate is no longer part of the licensing procedure.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The effect of amendments Nos. 110, 111 and 112 is to increase the monetary limits of District Court fines specified <Col N="1829" /> for contraventions of the provisions of various sections of the Pawnbrokers Act, 1964.  As regards section 45, the section affected by amendment No. 110, the District Court is empowered under section 45 of the 1964 Act, if it is satisfied that a frivilous complaint of an offence under the Act has been made to order the person making such complaint to pay up to £10 compensation to the defendant.  Amendment No. 110 will increase the figure for such compensation to a maximum of £250.  The maximum District Court fine as specified in recent legislation is £1,500, hence the figure is being inserted as the appropriate maximum District Court fine for offences under the Pawnbrokers Act.  In similar fashion, offences which continue following conviction will now attract a fine at a level of £150 per day.  The objective of increasing fine levels is achieved by redrafting section 47 in its entirety.</P>

It is another place where the £1,500 should have been inserted.  The purpose of this amendment is exactly similar to amendment No. 112 which the Dáil has just accepted.  Instead of a maximum District Court fine limit of £1,000 as proposed, this amendment will fix such fine at £1,500.  This is the maximum District Court fine.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;the submissions go on as Deputy O'Rourke has acknowledged. I refer to a detailed submission I received yesterday from the Irish Bankers' Federation.  I am aware there are other submissions that require study.  I am not holding out any prospect of great change but the organisations who have taken time to make submissions deserve to have them studied in detail and they will be.  It may mean that some matters will have to be considered <i>de novo</i> in the Seanad and as a result they will come back to this House in due course.  Therefore, whether we are premature in winding up is the question that arises.  Notwithstanding that I thank all the Deputies who have stayed with this agreements Bill over an unconscionably long time.  In particular I thank Deputy O'Rourke who had a central role in its genesis and in piloting it <Col N="1832" /> to Committee Stage.  I would like to thank her for her openness in accepting her amendment has been taken on board by me and that as a result the Bill is a better one.  I am confident it is.</P>
      <P>There are some matters such as Deputy McDowell's amendment today which cannot be finalised because of the Standing Orders of the House but I am satisfied these can be dealt with speedily in the Seanad.  I am sure that House will take its responsibilities in the matter very seriously.</P>
      <P>It is important and valuable legislation which greatly enhances the rights of consumers.  The balance between consumer and lender up to now has been unfairly weighed against the consumer. While we have organisations representing every conceivable sectional interest, consumers have been an unrecognised quantity for too long.  This Bill will confer rights on them that they could not have contemplated before and will give additional muscle to the consumer organisations.  We have to acknowledge the role of the European Union in inspiring a good deal of this legislation.  It is one of the progressive social roles it has played in our legislation. I should refer in passing to the fact that it tackles, and this is long overdue, the scourge of illegal moneylending. Disadvantaged areas and unemployment black spots have for too long in this and other cities been prey to the machinations of illegal moneylenders but that will change when this Bill is enacted.  There is a requirement for transparency, intelligibility, clarity and plain speaking in all credit agreements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am particularly happy to have been able, as Deputy O'Rourke acknowledged, to bring the pawnbrokers' industry under the ferrule of this Bill and, even more so, the housing loans.  To bring the local authorities under the remit of this Bill is an achievement I am pleased about.  As a member of a local authority for a number of years I believe it is necessary and it will help the local authority but, most important, it will make the task of the consumer <Col N="1833" /> easier and confer explicit rights on him or her which was not the case up to now.</P>
    <P>I thank everybody for their patience. I thank my officials and the officials of the Departments of the Environment and Justice, all the Opposition Deputies, my colleague in Government, the Minister for Employment and Enterprise, Deputy Richard Bruton, Deputy Michael McDowell, Deputy Ned O'Keeffe and especially Deputy O'Rourke who was a guiding influence in the early days of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Rabbitte for his generous words.  We will be revisiting this Bill because clearly it will provide meaty substance for the Senators who have not had a meaty Bill for some time.  I am aware from comments they have made to me that they are waiting to get their teeth into it.  I do not think the Bill will have a quick passage through the Seanad.  Unless Senators are prepared to work the dog days of July and August the Minister will be back to us in the autumn with the changes the Senators will have made.  The arithmetic will have to be done each day of a contentious Vote in the Seanad and that should be interesting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is important legislation.  When I was demoted by the then Taoiseach, Deputy Albert Reynolds, and went to work with Deputy O'Malley at the Department of Industry and Commerce, to his credit he saw that I was in a very distressed state that morning and said: &ldquo;You need something to which you can address your mind.  Here is the Consumer Credit Bill and get at it&rdquo;.  Anybody in this House could find themselves in that position and no reason given.  Talk about unfair dismissal.  At that time I wanted to get my teeth into something; this Bill provided me with intellectual stimulus and I attacked it with great gusto.  For me it is a happy memory even though it was an unhappy phase of my life.  Perhaps Deputy O'Malley was glad to be rid of it but for me it was a source of solace and it has remained an abiding interest.  It has <Col N="1834" /> taken a long time in gestation.  In 1995 alone there were three separate books of amendments to be got out.  I dealt with it one day at a time.  As I got the rafts of amendments I got down to study each night to be ready for the probing of Deputy Rabbitte and Deputy Bruton.</P>
    <P>For the consumer this Bill will make a difference, but only if the regulations pertaining to it, the powers given to the Director of Consumer Affairs, are underpinned by proper financial arrangements.  There is no doubt about the probity and acumen of the current Director of Consumer Affairs but all the regulations need financial provision to enable them to be enforced.</P>

      <P>I listened with interest as Deputy O'Rourke made the point about being unfairly dismissed or <Col N="1835" /> made redundant a few years ago.  If it was yesterday's decision she would have got a generous severance &mdash; £100,000 plus.  Many Ministers will have big demands to make on leaders now.</P>
      <P>I compliment Deputy O'Rourke who was the instigator of the Bill and put much thought into it.  It is far-reaching and very good for our people.  However, there are a few parts of it of which I am critical.  One is the provision in regard to the banks and the £25,000 transactions. If there are ten applications from ten institutions to the Director of Consumer Affairs that will amount to a substantial amount of money plus the annual fee.  I hope this Bill will not become another tax gathering Bill bringing money into the Exchequer. The Bill should be in favour of the consumer and not there to make money. Having the annual fee so high and the £25,000 is daft.</P>
      <P>I fail to understand why there is nothing to protect consumers and borrowers from the banking institutions being surcharged.  If a liability is not paid off on time the banks have the right to charge a very substantial rate of interest.  The consumer is never told the true rate.  A section should be inserted in this Bill in the Seanad to oblige banking institutions to let customers know of increased costs.  Surcharging is very unfair.</P>
      <P>On money lending and pawnbrokers I fully agree with the Minister's tightening up in that area and also in regard to home loans from the local authorities. I want to remind him of his unwritten commitment that we will see the regional office for the Munster area in Mallow.  Mallow is an ideal centre.  I know the Minister will not be in a position to let me know now but I might hear the day after because he has a friend there who shall be nameless.  It would be a good plug for future polling days if he could do that.</P>
      <P>I would ask the Minister to look at the situation where people are surcharged on their overdraft at a penal rate after 30 days.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 5, line 36, after &ldquo;knowledge&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;'and includes, in relation to a fact, belief in its existence the grounds for which are such that a reasonable person who is aware of them could not doubt or disbelieve that the fact exists&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The original formulation of the definition of &ldquo;actual knowledge&rdquo; was based on legal advice.  On Committee Stage there was a great deal of discussion about whether this definition was unduly restrictive.  I undertook to re-examine it.  After taking further legal advice I am now in a position to broaden the definition.  I commend it to the House.</P>

      <P>This amendment relates to section 2 and inserts after the word &ldquo;knowledge&rdquo; the words &ldquo;and includes, in relation to a fact, belief in its existence...&rdquo;.  While I have no objection to the inclusion of a reference to a spouse I could not agree to the inclusion of a reference to a child.  I hold strong views on this issue and will deal with the matter more comprehensively later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A Member of the House, including an office holder, may not always be aware what interests their child, over the age <Col N="1837" /> of 18, may have although there is a perception that they are so aware.  Their child may not inform them that they have purchased land which may become the subject of a designation order under the renewal scheme or be rezoned for the simple reason that they would be opposed to this purchase.  If the land is rezoned the Member concerned would not be able to clear their name as the perception is that they have to be aware of the interests their child may have.</P>
    <P>I have been a Member of the Oireachtas for a long time and I regret to say that we do not have the same standing now as we had when I was first elected.  As Members of the House would never be able to clear their names because of the public's perception that there is no smoke without fire I am opposed to the inclusion of any reference to a child as Members would be placed in an awkward position. However, I have no objection to the inclusion of a reference to a spouse.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EithneFitzgerald" hpid="Ms E. Fitzgerald Ms E. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms E. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied that this is a reasonable definition.  If a Member of the House is not aware of an interest a spouse or child may have they will not be obliged to make a declaration. However, if they have seen title deeds or share certificates they will not be able to evade their responsibility.  It is therefore a common sense definition. Having taken fresh legal advice I am pleased to be in a position to broaden the definition in this way.  It will greatly strengthen and improve the Bill.</P>

      <P>On Committee Stage the words &ldquo;election expenses&rdquo; were deleted from section 15 and the word &ldquo;donation&rdquo; inserted in substitution.  These are consequential amendments.  We do not need a definition of &ldquo;election expenses&rdquo; or &ldquo;registered political party&rdquo; because we are using the word &ldquo;donation&rdquo;.

      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 8, between lines 3 and 4, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(b) a member who holds the office of Attorney General,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The definition of &ldquo;designated position&rdquo; in section 2 and the process whereby the Minister for Finance could prescribe under section 3 those persons in the public sector who would be required to make statements of interests was originally considered broad enough to cover the generality of public service positions, including the position of Attorney General, Comptroller and Auditor General, the Ombudsman, the Data Protection Commissioner and the Director of Consumer Affairs.  We have since been advised legally that the definition is not strong enough to cover the latter group and that we need to make separate provision for these people.  Hence amendment No. 30 which covers the Attorney General and No. 31 which covers the other positions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1840" /> It has been decided that where an Oireachtas Member is at the same time the holder of the position of Attorney General, he or she should be regarded as an office holder for the purposes of the Act and should be obliged to meet all the requirements imposed by the Act on Ministers and Ministers of State. This is the purpose of amendment No. 4.  Where an Attorney General is not a Member of the House he or she will have applied to him or her arrangements similar to those applying to other public servants.  For convenience these arrangements are set out in a new section to be inserted by amendment No. 30.  As regards the Comptroller and Auditor General, the Ombudsman, the Data Protection Commissioner and the Director of Consumer Affairs, the section 17 designated position is being extended in amendment No. 31 to ensure that the holders of these posts are covered in the same way as other public servants.</P>
    <P>On legal advice section 3 as it stands, which is designed to facilitate punitive action against a person found to be in contravention of the Act, will not be applied to these people.  Instead any contravention of the Act, particularly a serious contravention, could leave them open to a charge of stated misbehaviour under the legislation establishing these posts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the names of the persons mentioned will also appear on the register.  In amendment No. 31 the Minister excludes judges.  Why is that the case?  Are they special people? My relationship with judges is reasonably good, but should a law which applies to the Minister and me not also apply to judges?  Why must they not declare their interests?  A spouse or child of a judge could have a personal interest in a civil case, perhaps concerning land or a moratorium, which is being heard by that judge.  I do not understand why these people are excluded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The litigation process is very far-reaching. To bring a major case to the High Court takes up to three years &mdash; I <Col N="1841" /> am open to correction on that &mdash; from the time proceedings are lodged in the court until the case is heard.  I find it extraordinary that while so many people are included, such as the Ombudsman, staff in Departments and Members of the House &mdash; the Minister is even trying to include the children of these people &mdash; there is no obligation on judges to declare their interests.  Is there one law for them and another for us?  I cannot understand the logic behind that.</P>
    <P>Members of local authorities and corporations, whether elected or co-opted to that body, must sign a register of declaration of their interests, and anybody who wishes may see that register.  It seems there is one law for us and another law, or no law, for judges.  They need not disclose, even in a case that is dealt with by a colleague, that they may have an interest in the case.  This matter should be reconsidered.  I would like detailed reasons for excluding judges.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EithneFitzgerald" hpid="Ms E. Fitzgerald Ms E. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms E. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>If a judge were to act where there is a conflict of interest, the judgment would be null and void. That is a well established legal principle. The inclusion of judges would raise extremely complex constitutional issues involving the separation of the Executive and the Judiciary and any action in this area, if it were considered appropriate, would be a matter for the Minister for Justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>How will it be ascertained if judges have such interests?  It might never be brought to the attention of the Minister for Justice of the day that judges have interests.  Their interests may come to light in ten years' time when they may have retired. Would those with such interests have to bear the expense of going to court to have a decision appealed?  Judges may not know of their children's interests but they could come to light shortly after a judgment is made.  I do not understand how it is complex for judges to make a similar declaration of interests to the one that I, a member of the local authority or the official in a <Col N="1842" /> Department, will have to make.  Judges should declare their interests in respect of the houses and land they own, if they are company directors or an interest their spouse may have.</P>
      <P>It was indicated in views expressed last weekend that not all the Minister's Government partners agree with all the provisions in the Bill.  Businessmen who become politicians must declare all their interests.  It would not be in the country's interests if business people did not put themselves forward for election.  As they will be required to declare all their interests, many of them who are doing extremely well will be reluctant to become politicians, especially when judges are not required to declare their interests.</P>
      <P>I do not know the complex legal matters involved in requiring judges to declare their interests.  I am not casting any reflection on the Judiciary.  Its members carry out their duties in an excellent manner, but I do not agree with their not being required to declare their interests.  Is there one law for them and another for us?  Are they above the law as they are not required to declare their interests?  If that is the case, it is not realistic.  Members of the public have every right to ask why they, their spouses, their children and the Minister are required to declare their interests, but some members of the legal profession are not required to declare theirs.  Is that because they are privileged? I do not understand the legal complexity involved in requiring judges to register their interests.  Such a register of their interests could be kept in the Attorney General's office or in the Department of Justice.  The public will not understand why that is the case.  I do not mean to be derogatory, but it is a lame excuse to say that judges cannot be included under the provision for complex reasons which I or, I am sure, members of the public do not understand.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms F. Fitzgerald Ms F. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms F. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sympathetic to Deputy Connolly's point regarding the inclusion of judges, but I must abide by <Col N="1843" /> the legal advice I have been given that bringing judges under a regime of this type requires separate complex legislation because of the separation of powers in our Constitution.  The public can rest assured that the fact that judges are not included under this legislation does not pose dangers for them.  We can be satisfied about the integrity of our judges and we know there is a long established rule of law which states that if a judge acts in his or her case a judgment will be invalid.  All judges are scrupulous in standing aside from such cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>From my experience past and present Members of the House across the political divide have great integrity and judgment.  I believe they have performed their duties in a highly efficient and satisfactory manner.  Some of the legal people advise members of the legal profession and hope to become judges in the future.  Their advice may be based on the knowledge that if they became judges they could be required to declare their interests and that may be why they advise that judges should be excluded from that provision.  The proverb that legal people decide to make wrong right and right wrong is often quoted in court.  How many times have we seen that?  Legal people will frequently say that they are giving the best advice they can.  I am not casting any reflection on the integrity of the Judiciary.  Why are county councillors, members of corporations and town commissioners required to declare their interests when judges are not?  All that is involved for those who are required to declare their interests is the completion of a simple form stating their interests as requested on the declaration. It would be a simple matter to include judges under this provision and request them to make a simple declaration similar to that which local authority officials will be required to make.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The public perception on this matter will be rather clouded.  While members <Col N="1844" /> must disclose where they live, the property they own and anything else they or their spouses own, judges are in the privileged position of not having to declare any of their interests.  I fail to understand the complexity to which the legal people refer.  Perhaps some of them hope some day to be among the privileged ranks of the Judiciary and have a vested interest in ensuring they are not included under the Bill.  I do not have a difficulty with the amendment, but judges should not be excluded from the provisions of the Bill.</P>

    <P>That Dáil Éireann is concerned that State and EU funding of tourism should be applied in the most cost-effective manner and so as to maximise tourist growth, having particular regard to the permanent cessation of violence in Northern Ireland, to the Government's proposals to reorganise State investment in the industry and to the need to increase investment in this growth sector.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1965" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully support this motion with particular reference to the fact that this House and the public are concerned that State and EU funding <Col N="1849" /> for tourism should be applied in the most cost-effective manner so as to maximise tourism growth.  Until the year 2000 and beyond, tourism will be the biggest growth industry not only in this country but worldwide.  Tourism is our most decentralised industry as it affects every city, town, village and parish.  It is also an industry with great job creation potential and if the Minister and the Government are interested in creating more jobs for our well educated young people, who are now being properly trained in the area of tourism, including catering and management, everything possible must be done to ensure that State and EU funding is spent wisely in order to maximise growth in the immediate years ahead.</P>
      <P>I refer in particular to the marketing programme by Bord Fáilte and the Department of Tourism and Trade under the operational programme.  During the period from 1 October to 17 March as many people as possible from Bord Fáilte and the Department should be engaged in promotional work outside the country in order to attract more tourists here.  Marketing is the key to tourism promotion.  From information given to me by those with vast experience in the tourism trade and in the hotel and catering businesses, Ireland is merely scratching at the surface of the huge market that exists in the United States, continental Europe, Asia and throughout the world.  I cannot over-emphasise the importance of marketing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Low interest loans should be made available to entrepreneurs who wish to become involved in tourism projects such as the extension of existing facilities and the provision of new facilities, including buildings.  Low interest loans are far better and indeed the tourism trade prefers them to grants.  We must spend a percentage of State and EU funding for tourism on the provision of all-weather leisure facilities, including cinemas and conference centres.  This may be Ireland's last opportunity to spend money of the magnitude that will <Col N="1850" /> be made available between now and the year 1999 by the European Commission.</P>
    <P>I am convinced, as are those involved in the tourism trade, that a greater sense of urgency is needed on the part of planning authorities in deciding on applications for planning permission for tourism-orientated projects which have great employment potential, be they all-weather leisure facilities, conference centres, extensions to hotels and guest-houses or the construction of new projects.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to consult with his colleague, the Minister for the Environment, with a view to issuing a directive to planning authorities to give priority to applications for planning permission in respect of proposals which will ultimately create many jobs.  I ask the Minister also to consult with his colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, with a view to restoring the grants for the control of pollution on farmyards.  We must protect and maintain our strong healthy environment for our own benefit, for the benefit of tourists and in the interests of job creation, regardless of the cost.</P>
    <P>I am anxious that towns such as Killarney, Kenmare, Killorglin and other coastal towns in south and west Kerry are given an equal and fair opportunity to obtain grants under the Operational Programme on Tourism.  It is important that these towns, and indeed the entire constituency of South Kerry, get their fair share of State and EU funding having regard to the huge sums which entrepreneurs and others involved in the hotel and tourism businesses spent over the years out of their own resources.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom buíochas a ghabháil le mo chomhleacaithe i bhFianna Fáil as an rún a chur os ár gcomhair agus an t-am a chur ar fáil chomh maith.  I dtús báire, is trua liom a rá go bhfuil baol ann nach dtuigfear an rún seo i gceart.  Tá mé buartha go gcuireann sé béim ar mhéadú ar uimhreacha turasóirí.  Tá sé ag caint ar fás, <Col N="1851" /> agus an tuiscint a bhíonn ag daoine air sin ná méadú ar uimhreacha.  Tá an cheist i bhfad níos leithne ná sin agus ba mhaith liom tagairt a dhéanamh do na rudaí eile nach bhfuil luaite sa rún.</P>
      <P>In suggesting a growth in tourism, the motion runs the risk of being regarded in the same way as a motion that might have come before the Spanish Parliament before the development of places such as the Costa del Sol.  If we simply rely on growth in tourist numbers, there is a danger that we may end up with deserted communities during the winter months but which are inundated with tourists during the summer.  In Kilkee, County Clare, there is a large hotel in the town which looked distinctly neglected when I was there some years ago. That is what I fear might happen if sustainable tourism is not at the forefront of Government policy.</P>
      <P>The term &ldquo;soft tourism&rdquo; is often used these days.  It is important to spell out what is meant by that because I believe it is our only hope if we are to have a sustainable tourist market, rather than one which will disappear in the short term.  Soft tourism relies on low impact type tourist activities which are not concentrated in one area but which make use of the wide resources available over a broader area.  It is community-based, unlike the Mullaghmore project where the towns around that area would not have benefited, except indirectly, from the development of such an interpretative centre.  It is also activity-related because, due to our climate, we must promote all-weather activities for tourists. It is also heritage-based because that is one of our major strengths.  Those areas must be developed and the problems teased out in this motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Minister for Tourism and Trade to look at other areas of policy and perhaps bring some influence to bear on his colleagues, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry and the Minister for Enterprise and Employment. Headage payments, for example, have the effect of encouraging farmers to have concentrations of sheep on <Col N="1852" /> mountain tops when there is no money available for pollution control.  If money is going to be made available to keep people in a community it should assist the tourism industry through protection of the environment rather than the other way around.</P>
    <P>In regard to forestry, places such as Connemara are severely risking their tourist potential by relying on an area which will not enhance that particular landscape.  On industrial policy, I will simply refer to the current situation in Askeaton and the problems that exist around Cork Harbour.  We must be integrated in regard to our tourism policy and not deal with it in isolation from other areas of policy.</P>
    <P>I realise the time available to me is limited so I will be brief in my comments. This motion has been tabled at an historic time.  I was amazed to discover that this is the first year our tourist numbers will actually exceed the number of residents in the country.  To that extent, we are at a turning point and we must be careful that the attraction for Ireland does not begin to wane. An activity which initially attracted tourists here may become diluted if too many people take it up.</P>
    <P>My area, Fingal, means &ldquo;the race of the stranger&rdquo; and is apt for a place that is trying to develop its tourism potential. It seems to be relying on golf and motorways to attract tourists, which to my mind is not the best way.  As a flat area it has immense potential for cycling. However, the Bord Fáilte map of tourist areas does not mention it.  I think Bord Fáilte needs to correspond with people in local communities to find out the potential strength of areas but to date they have not done that in all areas. Similarly road signs at places such as Dublin Airport direct people solely into the city ignoring the medieval hinterland of north County Dublin and people are not even told about it.  They are directed to Newgrange and by-pass everything on the way.  That is a crying shame.  People come to this country to find the villages which were developed at a time when the horse and cart was <Col N="1853" /> the mode of transport, and cycling is a perfect mode of transport for people who want to go a distance of three to four miles between villages.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister take note of the danger of eroding rights of way?  This is happening in a rush to grab whatever bit of land is available.  In Portmarnock rights of way have been extinguished in the rush to develop golf courses.  Golf is not of general interest to people who come to this country although it is a tourist interest.  Will the Minister take on board those things that are immediate and cannot be left on the long finger?</P>

      <P>The Government's commitment to tourism was recognised in the policy agreement, <i>A Government of Renewal</i>, which was negotiated last December by the three parties in Government.  An imaginative and constructive seven-point programme was incorporated into the document emphasising the importance of the tourism industry with detailed plans for its development.  In the meantime the peace process has gained momentum and its potential has been recognised by the Minister and the Government.</P>
      <P>The tourism industry in the Border regions, and Donegal in particular, laboured under severe difficulty during these past 25 years due to the troubles in Northern Ireland.  The north western region, which comprises five of the six southern Border counties, earned the lowest overseas and domestic tourism revenue of all seven regions in 1993. The Government recognises the particular problems in Border regions and a number of significant and constructive measures have already been initiated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Bord Fáilte and the Northern Ireland Tourist Board have jointly established <Col N="1854" /> the overseas tourism marketing initiative with a fund of £6.3 million to promote Northern Ireland and the Republic as a holiday destination.  The EU INTERREG programme is allocating £10 million for the promotion of tourism in border areas in the next five years.  We have also the generous assistance of the International Fund for Ireland who have funded and are continuing to fund tourist-related development in border areas.  Perhaps the most significant happening for a long time was the recognition given to the potential of the tourism industry as a generator of employment and economic activity at the Washington conference last weekend.  I compliment the Minister, Deputy Enda Kenny, on the signing of the joint communique with Baroness Denton, who is responsible for the promotion of tourism in Northern Ireland and the US Secretary of State for Commerce, Ron Brown.  I was privileged to be there as was my colleague, Deputy Nealon, and we were sitting within a handshake of the Minister and the Baroness when this was being done. It was a great day's work and I am sure this will be reflected in increased numbers from the United States and other parts of the world, as it received widespread publicity.</P>
    <P>Despite the difficulties due to the Northern troubles, tourism is a major contributor to the north west region.  In 1991 a study commissioned by the Irish Tourist Confederation estimated that income from tourism accounted for approximately 10 per cent of total personal incomes in the region and it was estimated to have been responsible also for 10.8 per cent of total employment there.  In the period 1988-93 more grantaided investment went into the Border counties to help develop tourism projects than any other sub region.  The sum of £510 million in EU INTERREG and International Fund moneys was three times as high as the average of £17 million for all other regions.  Thus the necesary tourism infrastructure to replace and update the facilities which have suffered as a result of business losses have <Col N="1855" /> been put in place and the climate for significant further investment in the tourism industry is very good.  I have never experienced since I came to this House more inquiries than are being made at present.  There are far more projects being submitted for consideration than ever before, a mark of the confidence of entrepreneurs and others in the present policies.</P>
    <P>Donegal is a well known tourist county and has a lot to offer from Bundoran in the south to Malin Head in the north.  I was particularly glad that Bundoran was selected as a traditional seaside resort to be developed.</P>
    <P>In Donegal we are separated from the rest of the country except by a bridge between Ballyshannon and Bundoran. Access is very important in order to reach one's full potential.  There are no railways in Donegal.  The airport is situated in the west of the county in a Gaeltacht area.  It is verging on a disgrace that as yet no scheduled flights have been established between Carrickfin and Dublin.  We have flights between Carrickfin and various points in the UK such as Edinburgh, Manchester and even London.  We never succeeded &mdash; even though an application is in &mdash; to have flights between Carrickfin and Dublin.  I appeal to the Minister to do his best to see that something is done in that area.</P>
    <P>I applaud the initiatives already under way such as the all-Ireland marketing being undertaken jointly by private sectors in the North and South.  I believe the Government is using every worthwhile opportunity to raise the international profile of Ireland abroad and to promote the attractions of the whole island as a tourism destination.  I look forward to seeing the fruits of this endeavour in many more visitors to Donegal and the border counties this summer and in the years ahead.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to deal with one specific area in the limited time at my disposal.  Among the great attractions we have as a tourist country are our <Col N="1856" /> beautiful lakes and splendid beaches and this is the case particularly in the west.  They will be of little tourism value unless we continue to enjoy unfettered access to them.  Traditionally we have had free access but I fear that in many areas this freedom is being rapidly eroded.  Lands adjoining the beaches and adjoining the lakeshores are being brought up, and sad to say the new owners come equipped with their iron gates and private notices.  One of the latest such areas to come under threat is Lough Arrow in County Sligo, a lake of enormous scenic beauty, as many Deputies will know from passing along the Curlew Mountains.  At the same time it is one of the leading trout fishing lakes in the entire country.  Now the fishermen and other visitors are finding the main access to the lake waters &mdash; what people thought was a public pier at Brickeen in Castlebaldwin &mdash; closed to them.  Another access point at the bridge on the Ballyrush side is also under threat.  Where are the advantages of this tourism treasure if access over a large area is cut off and the lake can only be admired from afar?</P>
      <P>The problem in Lough Arrow in County Sligo is being addressed by the local people but the Minister must take action at national level, by way of legislation if necessary, which I am sure would have all party support.</P>
      <P>We are rightly concerned about the pollution of lakes and beaches.  This is another form of pollution.  I thank the Minister for including Enniscrone in the traditional seaside resorts which will benefit under the important and imaginative renewal programme.  There is an excellent community in Enniscrone which will avail of this.  I know the Minister is considering including other resorts in County Sligo next year and I thank him for that.  This is an important time in tourism and I know of no person better suited to be at the helm than the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this non-contentious motion and pay tribute to <Col N="1857" /> Deputies Andrews and Killeen for moving it.  It is constructive and in welcome contrast to the many discordant, tiresome motions which come before the House which do little more than highlight problems without offering solutions to remedy the situations they denounce.  If remedies are offered little is said about how they would be financed or implemented.  As far as some motions are concerned, one wonders if argument and disagreement are not major factors in preventing progress and if those who engage in constant argument realise the futility of their actions or if they believe that is the only way of attracting some modicum of attention or credibility.</P>
      <P>There is enormous potential for the development of tourism especially since peace was established.  The recent Tansey Weber report indicated that tourism is a major growth area in the economy. In 1993 it accounted for 66 per cent of earnings.  Growth in tourism earnings from 1982 to 1990 averaged 10 per cent per annum, the highest in Europe.  That was the position before peace was declared so it follows that there is huge potential for an acceleration in the growth levels we have seen since 1980. Earnings from tourism are of the order of £2 billion per year and 90,000 people are employed in the industry.  There is potential for further employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Dublin has fared badly.  While 29 per cent of the population live in Dublin, only 24 per cent of tourism earnings are spent in the city.  Dublin is the major location for tourists but most only visit it for a short time.  Dublin Tourism, and those charged with responsibility for promoting tourism in the city, should endeavour to extend the stay of tourists in this city and try to develop the services and tourist attractions which are available.  Dublin's tourism potential is grossly underdeveloped and that is particularly true in areas outside the old city.  Historic buildings, centres of culture and so on are promoted although there is scope for further development but outside of the area bounded by the <Col N="1858" /> two canals there is untapped potential which receives little attention.</P>
    <P>There are many parks in the county and city but little is done to promote them.  That is in sharp contrast to cities like Paris where tremendous effort is put into promoting its beautiful parks. Our parks are a tribute to those in Dublin Corporation and the old Dublin County Council who developed and enhanced them over the years.  There is potential for outdoor activities such as orienteering, equestrian sports and water leisure pursuits.  Within a few miles of the city centre there are beautiful mountains yet nothing is done to promote and develop the attraction of the Dublin mountains.  Very little is done to promote continental-type camping sites in the city or exploit the attractions of the Liffey Valley and Dargle Valley.</P>
    <P>When one considers the potential of the Grand Canal and the Royal Canal the level of neglect is truly appalling.  I am delighted that the Grand Canal study is completed and I look forward to rapid development of the canal.  If these waterways were in the Minister's constituency he and others would be loud in proclaiming their attractions and would have much to say about securing money to develop them.  The people of Dublin take them for granted and that is a pity although it is understandable as it is a capital city.  I hope the Department will place greater emphasis on developing the tourism potential of the city.  Tourists should be encouraged to extend their stay in the city.  There is great potential for job creation which is badly needed in a city where 90,000 people are unemployed.</P>
    <P>I compliment Deputy Doherty on his speech.  He highlighted the issue of signposting which is dreadful.  It is assumed that signposts are ornaments and that people know exactly where they are going.  That is not so.</P>
    <P>As far as possible every tourist should leave Ireland happy.  There have been instances of sharp practice which derive from a belief that one can make a short term gain on the grounds that tourists <Col N="1859" /> will not revisit the country and will not remember what happened.  They do remember and will leave the country with a bad impression.</P>
    <P>In a recent press release, Deputy Killeen mentioned the potential for developing tourist based attractions in public houses.  He did not spell out exactly what he had in mind but I have no doubt he will let us know before the debate concludes.  There is need to look at the licensing laws.  I know there are many considerations to be taken into account but it is important to have a degree of flexibility in that area.  Apart from the canals, there is virtually no reference in the promotion material for Dublin city to its tourism attractions. This is a pity and something should be done about it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. E. Byrne Mr. E. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my constituency colleague, Deputy Upton, for sharing his time with me.  I support all the points he made except the implied criticism of Dublin Tourism, of which I am a member.  I agree that Dublin is ripe for a major tourism drive.  It is very difficult even during non-peak periods to get accommodation in Dublin city.  The promotion of Dublin as a destination for weekend breaks has proven so successful that my colleague from Cork could not get a room in a hotel and I had to put her up in my home.  This demand for accommodation is reflected in the number of hotels under construction.  A magnificent new hotel is being built in Tallaght which in the past received very bad press and was regarded as a dumping area in terms of housing developments. This is a magnificent location for a hotel as it is halfway between the Wicklow mountains and Dublin city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Dublin tourism has a large number of projects in hands.  It has revitalised the north side of the inner city around Parnell Square through the establishment of the Dublin Writers Museum.  This magnificent museum attracts not only tourists but also large numbers of Dubliners and Irish people in general. <Col N="1860" /> This project is a credit to Dublin Tourism. It has also issued a contract for the development of its headquarters which is beside Grafton Street &mdash; a tourist friendly location so to speak.  This building was formerly a Protestant church and when the refurbishment is completed it will provide the best of services for tourists.</P>
    <P>Dublin Tourism also looks after the James Joyce Tower and the magnificent terraced house in Synge Street where George Bernard Shaw lived.  It is only right to put on record the progress made by Dublin Tourism in encouraging Icelandic tourists to take weekend breaks in Ireland.  They are huge spenders and this campaign has been very successful. The previous Government must also be given credit for the exciting developments in tourism in Dublin, for example, the Temple Bar area which is a major attraction for tourists.  Dublin Tourism has also acquired an old Catholic church on the quays beside the civic offices where it has set up a tourism centre based on medieval Dublin.  Dublin is worthy of greater promotion from a tourism point of view.</P>
    <P>The development of tourism has massive job creation potential.  In this respect I express my appreciation to the new Jury's Inn opposite Christ Church Cathedral for in conjunction with the South Inner City Community Development Association employing young local long term unemployed people in the construction of that building.</P>
    <P>On the necessity for North-South co-operation in the area of tourism the peace process has challenged us to turn swords into plough shares.  For 25 years people on both sides of the divide in Northern Ireland had their lives destroyed by violence.  The peace process gives us an opportunity to develop sections of the economy which were neglected during those years of violence. The entire island has a green image but it was under exploited in Northern Ireland for obvious reasons. Approximately 20 per cent of overseas visitors to Northern Ireland are tourists <Col N="1861" /> whereas 50 per cent of visitors to the Republic are tourists.</P>
    <P>In this regard I welcome the measures taken by the Government to promote cross-Border co-operation in the tourism industry.  Tourism is a labour intensive industry with a high job creation potential.  Since 1988 approximately 25,000 new full-time jobs and many part-time and seasonal jobs have been created in the industry in the Republic. The job creation potential in the industry in Northern Ireland is enormous and I hope it will help underpin the peace process.  Cross-Border co-operation in the tourism sector will be encouraged by the substantial funding available under the EU INTERREG programme, the International Fund for Ireland and the exciting new EU special support programme for peace and reconciliation which is expected to receive Commission approval for the summer.</P>
    <P>Tourism on both parts of the island is sharply divided between what might be termed urban and rural tourism.  Until we develop our towns and cities as tourist destinations holidaymakers will continue to view them as little more than stopovers to other areas.  Unfortunately the 25,000 jobs created in the industry over the past six years have not been distributed equally throughout the country.  Some progress has been made in this regard and the conservation projects in Dublin and Cork will add to the tourism potential of these cities.  The greatest potential for the development of urban tourism is contained in the operational programme for tourism which is expected to lead to a £640 million investment in tourism.  The Minister said that 1,000 proposals for the development of the tourism industry had been received under the operational programme.  Decisions on projects will have to be made within the parameters of the programme.  I hope a substantial proportion of the projects funded under the programme will be in urban areas and that integrated tourism projects are developed so that towns and cities are no longer regarded as stopovers on the way to airports.</P>

      <P>I am delighted we have had the opportunity to speak to the motion this evening and I commend my colleagues for introducing it to the floor of the House.  This is the most opportune time given that we both had the privilege of attending the Washington conference at which we witnessed the enthusiasm and energy generated with regard to investment. None of us in the House will be ashamed of being parochial in this debate.  Donegal has been most successful in the tourism trade during the past number of years but we have had our disadvantages and we have had to deal with the problems of Northern Ireland. I hope the Government will become aware of the need to reorient their policies and to benefit from the peace dividend.</P>
      <P>Tourism is one of the areas where we will have real potential in job creation and in the promotion of this country as a holiday destination.  We cannot put a ceiling over the entire country so we cannot have sunshine but we certainly can give a lot more.  The marketing of this country, and in particular the Border counties, in conjunction with the Northern Ireland tourist board is the way forward.  The fresh air of Donegal is preferable to hot steamy New York in June, July and August and the pollution of our large cities.  I do not think Bord Fáilte has taken and transferred that image into something from which we in Ireland could benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We need to invest money in marketing initiatives.  In particular we should look at the growth markets of Northern England and Scotland, especially when we have the opportunity to re-establish <Col N="1863" /> many of our old markets.  We have seen Scottish people, in particular, and English people coming to the north west region and to the Border counties.  We will have to take difficult decisions, one of which is the promotion of Belfast as an international base.  I realise we have the problem of the Shannon stop-over and with Dublin but we will be able to overcome those problems if we work with the Northern Ireland people.  We in Donegal would like Larne promoted as the port of entry.  We want to see the airports of Belfast, Derry, Carrickfinn and Sligo promoted to encourage tourism, particularly in the north west.</P>
    <P>The Minister should look at the possibility of Canadian airlines coming into Belfast and working with some of the Canadian tour operators.  It is important to exploit fully the Northern Ireland tradition where many people emigrated to Canada.</P>
    <P>Donegal has a good product mix but if we do not market it we will not benefit from the peace dividend.  Tourism should not be isolated from the operational programmes and the need to work with the Department of the Environment with regard to infrastructure. We do not want motorways around the coast of Donegal but we certainly want good access.  I thank the international fund which has helped many of the Border counties to develop leisure facilities in particular.  We have 13 hotels in the county with leisure facilities, 13 18-hole golf courses and 27 new visitor centres. Certainly there has been growth and development but that has only been because of the international fund working with Bord Fáilte.  Much more needs to be done.</P>
    <P>There is a grave need for self-catering accommodation in County Donegal. There has always been a reluctance in Bord Fáilte to grant-aid hotel beds, which is wrong and should be changed. We should seek to upgrade our existing facilities; <i>en suite</i> leisure facilities, etc., and increase the number of hotel beds. We should examine the type of hotel bed psychology introduced by Jury's Inn <Col N="1864" /> which may be the way forward for package holidays.</P>
    <P>We must sustain the moneys that will be made available to tourism.  We have the potential to extend the tourist season and we need to do it.  We must have quality, customer care and high standards.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to have the opportunity to make a short contribution to this worthwhile debate.  I wish to avail of the opportunity to congratulate my good friend and long time colleague the Minister for Tourism and Trade, Deputy Kenny, on his appointment. I am sure he will be very successful in his Department and I wish him well.  Many of the people of Mayo are delighted with his recent appointment and I am sure he will do his best to live up to their high expectations in that office.</P>
      <P>Some of the points I wish to make have already been made.  We have been told that tourism is the fastest growing industry in the world.  It is certainly a fast growing industry here and threatens to replace agriculture, our most important industry.  Even in Ireland tourism is more important to some parts than to others.  It is an uneven patchwork: in some areas tourism is well established while in other areas it is in its infancy.</P>
      <P>The first criticism I make of those in charge of the development of tourism is that there appears to be a great imbalance in the way the money is doled out <i>vis-á-vis</i> the established areas and those which are underdeveloped.  In the past the bulk of the money available from the EU &mdash; I do not think it will be any different in the present tranche &mdash; went towards developing even more sophisticated facilities in areas which had long since been established in the industry while areas which were in their infancy could not get grants to provide basic facilities.</P>

    <P>I will be parochial and refer to County Mayo.  We know that every report we read holds up tourism as being the great saver of the economy of <Col N="1865" /> our county.  If we are to develop tourism in the county to the extent projected we need to double the number of bed night accommodation, yet people could not get grants for the provision of that extra accommodation.  That is wrong thinking on somebody's part.  While unlimited funding can be provided for the provision of sophisticated facilities in an established area there is no incentive to provide basic facilities in the areas which are trying to break into the industry. I hope something will be done to correct that.</P>
    <P>Many of the smaller hotels in the west are family owned.  They organised a great campaign during the past number of years to extend and modernise their facilities.  Out of all the money available to the industry from the latest EU funds only £5 million was set aside for this purpose.  That is a pittance and will result in many of these people being unable to obtain grants for the facilities they wish to provide.</P>
    <P>Our beautiful beaches &mdash; we have ten blue flags in the county again this year &mdash; and our scenic beauty spots are in areas where tourists do not have ready or safe access to them.  This is a matter that should be addressed.  I realise it is not in the Minister's immediate bailiwick but perhaps he would have a word with his colleague, the Minister for the Environment.  Roads leading to beaches and places of scenic interest should be improved.  I am sure the peace process will impact greatly on the tourist industry. We have had thousands of visitors from the North already to our part of the country.  They should be provided with easy access.  I would like the Government to ensure that next year the Claremorris by-pass goes ahead.  It is the main thoroughfare from the North through Mayo to Galway and further South.  In the context of tourism this by-pass would be invaluable.</P>
    <P>I would like to congratulate the Minister on the initiative he took on the traditional seaside resorts, which had fallen into decline.  It is a pity that scheme is confined to seaside places.  I am thinking of the village of Knock <Col N="1866" /> where we attract about one million visitors a year.  The infrastructure there is urgently in need of overhaul.  We need new water and sewerage schemes and I hope the application before the Government for such facilities will be approved shortly.  People going there should be facilitated in the same way as people who have to be encouraged to go to other areas.</P>
    <P>More use could be made of Knock Airport in the context of tourism.  I hope the Minister will see that some attention is given to that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>The tourism industry is one with real potential for development. Nowhere is this potential more obvious than in the north eastern counties.  For reasons that do not need to labour, the development of tourism in Louth, Monaghan, Cavan, Meath and the other counties along the Border has been somewhat stagnant for over 20 years.  It is our earnest hope, now that dramatic changes are taking place in the six northern counties, that we are moving into a new phase that will see tourism develop on a level playing pitch.  For obvious reasons the west and south west is where the real dynamic has been in tourism.  We have much ground to make up and I hope we will do so rapidly.  It would be naive to expect that tourism will immediately become as important an element in the local economy as it is in the west and south.  We will have to identify what the deficiencies are.  There is a need for great investment in the infrastructure in the area.  It is appropriate that we have the Minister with direct responsibility for the industry present tonight.  This is the first opportunity I have had to congratulate him and wish him well.  I hope he will place emphasis on the north east.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In places like south Armagh and south Down phenomenal progress has been made in terms of infrastructural development.  There has been ongoing investment despite the fact that places like Crossmaglen were pivotal to the Northern troubles.  It would be well worth the while of the Minister, and his <Col N="1867" /> officials, to visit such places and see what has been achieved in the midst of economic chaos.  The strong work ethic that exists in the northern counties and the great spirit of self help is as vibrant as ever.  Its influence will become more obvious with the passage of time.  It is only in recent days they have appointed a promotional officer for the area.  Promoting the area will be relatively easy because there is a beauty there that we do not have in many parts of the country. We wish them well and we are looking forward to developing our own area in tandem with them.</P>
    <P>It is no harm to ask what is the real dynamic in the development of a tourism industry.  Do visitors come spontaneously to an area?  Is it promotion by word of mouth?  Is it the role of the promotional agency like Bord Fáilte and the effort and the amount of money they put into it?  Is it a combination of that and the efforts of the local industry? Is it the importance of the tour operators, the people who decide whether a tourist trail extends into the north east or takes another route to the east or the south east, to the south west or to the west?  We will have to look at all these elements.  Sometimes getting all elements co-ordinated is not easy.  I spend some time working with local voluntary groups and I know how difficult it is to get the cohesion that is required to get development going in sectors like this.  There always has to be a catalyst to make things happen.  I do not want to labour this because it helps to create a dependency culture but Bord Fáilte, and the Minister's Department, need to look at the underdeveloped areas and ask what needs to be done to be dynamic and make things happen. There are different segments in the tourism market.</P>
    <P>If the needs of the sector in a particular area are satisfied, there will be a gravitational pull towards it.  Will people at the commercial end of the sector be able to justify the expenditure of large sums of money in providing <Col N="1868" /> accommodation with minimum support in terms of grant aid if tourists cannot be regularly attracted?  If the tourist season only lasts for a month to six weeks will they be able to justify investment decisions where they will have to meet repayments on the modest sum of £70,000-£80,000?  These factors have to be taken into consideration.</P>
    <P>The Minister comes from a county where the tourism sector is of importance to the local economy and I congratulate him for introducing the pilot scheme for traditional seaside resorts.  I am particularly glad that Clogherhead in County Louth was chosen for inclusion as its natural amenities are in need of development and investment.  I hope this grant scheme will act as a catalyst and make things happen.</P>
    <P>When the Minister has an opportunity to visit County Louth in the not too distant future I hope he will visit places such as Omeath, an old Gaeltacht area which lies between the Cooley Mountains and the sea, and Carlingford which lies between Omeath and Newry on the northern side of the Border. Each Sunday in the late 1940s and 1950s Omeath was a mecca for day trippers with spending power from the North, including Belfast, who travelled by ferry from Warrenpoint.  Eventually, because of price differentials &mdash; commodities in the North were much cheaper &mdash; this business evaported.  This, however, does not take from its natural beauty.</P>
    <P>There is an urgent need for investment. The extension of the pilot scheme for traditional seaside resorts to include Omeath would be greatly welcomed and would have a dramatic impact on the village.  Tourists were visiting Omeath long before the concept of tourism as we now understand it had evolved.  We should examine the infrastructural deficiencies and consider the impact a pilot scheme would have.  Such a scheme would transform the village.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will take the opportunity to visit the north east, including Newgrange which lies on the Meath-Louth border and attracts in the region of 90,000-100,000 visitors a year. <Col N="1869" /> The new interpretative centre on which work is well under way will make a significant difference to the Boyne Valley area.  There is, however, an urgent need for development in areas north of this valley.  The Minister should consider the possibility of devising a local co-ordinated plan and asking the east midlands tourism body to focus on the need for development in the north east and to ensure that over a period of two to three years the tourism sector becomes just as important to the local economy as it is in places such as Belmullet, Bangor Erris or Killala.</P>
    <P>There is a strong farm enterprise culture in Counties Louth and Monaghan, the home of the mushroom, poultry and pig industries, where people are nothing if not adaptable.  If they see an opportunity, they are prepared to pursue it. It is important therefore that the State agency with responsibility for development in these areas should lead by example and set a headline.</P>
    <P>Last week at the Washington investment conference hopes were raised that benefits, in terms of major developments, would flow from it but this will not happen overnight.  People with huge bags of money will not arrive and ask in which project they should invest.  The viability of all projects, be it in the industrial or tourism sectors, will have to be examined rigorously.  No one any longer makes investment decisions based on sentiment but rather on the return for their money.  The quicker they can obtain a return the more attractive a project becomes.</P>
    <P>The Washington investment conference was attended by the most representative political grouping ever to leave this country.  It is ironic that they had to leave these shores to meet at the same conference.  However, a meeting anywhere in the world is welcome if it furthers peace and economic well being. I hope the tourism sector will not lose out in terms of the investment opportunities which may flow from the conference either in the short or long term.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Trade (Mr. E. Kenny)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies Andrews and Killeen for tabling this motion which I am prepared to accept.  It is noncontentious and highlights their concerns in respect of the tourism industry. It deals with maximising tourism growth having regard to the cessation of violence in Northern Ireland and Government proposals to reorganise State investment in the industry.</P>
      <P>These are the most exciting times in the tourism industry in the past 25 years and it is now the third largest industry in the country supporting 91,000 people in full-time employment.  Government targets in this area are clear.  We have laid down objectives to bring an annual expenditure of £2.25 billion and to create a further 35,000 jobs by the end of 1999.  We want to ensure progress in the international marketing of Ireland, the changing of the focus of concentration of Bord Fáilte and in encouraging people in the industry to provide quality products so that the visitor to our shores will be able to avail of a range of facilities that are of top class international standards.  This year we expect approximately four million visitors, more than two million from Great Britain, more than 500,000 from North America and the remainder from continental Europe and other countries. Expenditure by every 40 visitors from North America creates an extra permanent job.</P>
      <P>We all recognise the need to support the peace process, and I am happy to indicate how I and my Department have redefined tourism strategy and activity with this in mind.  I have supported the expansion in 1995 of the private sectorled overseas tourism marketing initiative which is costing £6.3 million.  For the first time, we have brought the public and private sectors in Ireland and Northern Ireland together in a unique partnership which is selling tourism on the island of Ireland in the major markets of the US, Britain, France and Germany.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Baroness Denton, my Northern <Col N="1871" /> Ireland counterpart, announced in Limerick about two months ago the introduction of a number of cross-Border regional marketing initiatives, which are being implemented in the 12 northern counties by both tourist boards.  Earlier this month, with support from the two tourist boards, we jointly sold Ireland's attractions as a tourism destination on Eurovision '95 to an estimated audience of 300 million people.  Deputies will recall the emphasis laid on peace during the broadcast.</P>
    <P>The International Fund for Ireland, the new INTERREG Progarmme and the forthcoming Special Support Programme for Peace and Reconciliation are creating new opportunities for North-South contact at governmental, tourist board, community and business levels.  The House will, I hope, appreciate that the range and depth of co-operation between the tourism sectors, North and South, has grown significantly since the ceasefires and, as I indicated much has already been achieved. It is my belief that as these contacts develop, further progress will be reported in policy co-ordination between North and South.</P>
    <P>It is appropriate to return to the Washington Conference and to provide the House with my perspective on what was achieved.  It was, first and foremost, a major opportunity to raise the profile of Ireland and Irish tourism, particularly in the US market.  US tourists are vitally important to the Irish tourism industry. In 1993 tourism from the US accounted for: 17 per cent of all holiday visitors to Ireland; 32 per cent of all nights spent in Irish hotels by overseas holidaymakers; 18 per cent of all nights in other accommodation; 34 per cent of all car rentals to overseas visitors and the highest spend per holiday visitor at £430 approx.</P>
    <P>From a tourism perspective, the conference was very successful on three levels. First, the statement by the US President on international television that this country is open for business from <Col N="1872" /> America is the kind of publicity we cannot buy, as will be borne out by Members opposite who were at the conference.</P>
    <P>Second, I was delighted to sign a joint communique with the US Secretary of Commerce, Ron Brown, and my counterpart in Belfast, Baroness Denton, which reinforced our joint determination to promote tourism throughout Ireland, develop initiatives to increase private sector investment and improve training for the sector.  This communique was proof positive of the support which the Clinton administration is giving to Irish tourism, and it is another example of effective cross-Border co-operation.</P>
    <P>Third, at a very well attended working session of tourism, Baroness Denton and the chief executives of the two tourist boards, gave the audience in indication of where they saw opportunities for US investors in Ireland.  I indicated that I saw the Conference acting as a catalyst to helping us achieve a new and higher level of investment in Irish tourism, especially in the Border counties and in Northern Ireland.  We identified three areas where the contacts made at the conference could bear fruit.</P>
    <P>The visit of His Royal Highness, Prince Charles, to our country today adds immeasurably to Ireland's profile abroad.</P>
    <P>I thank Deputies for their contributions. I do not have time to respond to detail to Deputies Coughlan, Kirk and Morley, but I will take up the invitation to visit the north-east.  A number of important matters were raised which I hope we will have time to deal with again.  This is a very exciting time in tourism.  I thank Deputies Andrews and Killeen for putting down this motion and I accept it as it is in accordance with Government proposals in this area.</P>

      <P>I support the motion. The Government's amendment refers to the enhancement of North-South co-operation in the tourism area.  That is very laudable but, since the peace initiative, no great effort has been made to bring that about.  The Minister stated that a North-South consumer advertising campaign is under way on British television and that campaigns are being conducted in the US, France and Germany, costing £6.3 million.</P>
      <P>The region from which I come is not in the business of selling a product but producing a product for marketing.  The Border area is not traditionally a tourist area but with increased funding there is now an opportunity to change that.  I hope the best possible use will be made of that funding.  The Minister referred to the Delors initiative under which 15 per cent of funding will go to projects with a cross-Border dimension.  Of the remaining funds, 80 per cent will go to the North and 20 per cent to the South. The regional tourism boards should examine how we can take up as much as possible of that funding to obtain the maximum benefits.  Between now and the allocation of the funding the Minister and the tourism boards should say what structures they will put in place.  I ask them to concentrate on areas that are not traditionally tourist areas.</P>

      <P>Gabhaim buíochas leis na Teachtaí go léir a ghlac páirt sa díospóireacht agus is trua nach bhfuair daoine eile go raibh suim acu san ábhar deis cainte.  Faoi mar a dúirt an Teachta Andrews, níl na gearáin atá againn dírithe ar an Aire go pearsanta agus ceapaim go dtuigeann sé é sin.  Táimíd ag iarraidh a chuid polasaithe a fheabhsú agus a athrú áit atá gá leis sin agus na nithe atá ag cur as do dhaoine ag obair i dturasóireacht a léiriú dó.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a complacent view that tourism is a good news area and that the Minister's role is to attend functions, be available for photo-calls and show up at travel fairs in exotic locations, but as the Minister said, that is manifestly untrue. Tourism is hugely important in terms of <Col N="1874" /> job creation, with 88,000 people employed in that area.  It is vital in its contribution to GNP, put at 6.9 per cent by Tansey Weber and Associates in a recent report.  In 1993 the industry accounted for 56 per cent of all export earnings from services.  It has contributed between £400 million and £500 million of a surplus to the State's balance of payments in each year since 1990.  The State cannot afford to take tourism for granted.  It cannot ignore the preliminary figures for 1994.  The Government cannot hide behind the claim that its predecessors were responsible for the level of funding and the shortcomings of current strategy.  The Minister and his colleagues must act quickly and decisively in conjunction with the industry to ensure that all areas benefit so that the successes of recent years continue.</P>
    <P>This debate is being held against the background of our country having had the highest tourism growth in Europe last year.  First time visitor numbers in 1994 exceeded that of our population and one in every eight people employed in services works in tourism.  There is a foreign exchange target of £2,250 million leading to the creation of 35,000 extra jobs from tourism by 1999.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, cuts are being made at a time when two critical elements which have been missing in Irish tourism have come together, that Ireland is an attractive destination for visitors due to the success of the peace process and that there is extra capital available through EU operation programmes to pump prime the industry to take advantage of this new marketplace.  The cutbacks are being made at a time when the Northern Ireland economy is about to boom due to EU Structural Fund allocations, INTERREG, the peace initiative and US and other subventions to the North. That has been made clear by a number of speakers from the Border regions.  It is possible, and somewhat worrying, that we may have two speed tourism development pattern in Ireland.  Northern Ireland could find the fast track and outpace us.  Surely it is vital to seek an <Col N="1875" /> even pace and pattern to development to consolidate the peace process and to ensure that benefits are evenly spread throughout the country.</P>
    <P>As a Minister from the west where the developing the west together initiative by the western Bishops and the unfortunately lacerated Leader-funded schemes put a great deal of hope for the future in tourism investment, development and jobs, Deputy Enda Kenny will be familiar with the statement that, &ldquo;we will give responsibility to people to decide their own approaches by an effective regional development policy which will unlock the growth potential of tourism&rdquo;.  We may wonder to whom the responsibility has been given or conceded when the earnest and worthy policy document sop to regional development is contrasted with the imposed Government decision which overrode the planning process and the majority wishes of the people of the area when abandoning the Burren National Park visitor centre project.</P>
    <P>The tourism industry of Clare, which is being bypassed by national growth, will be keenly interested to know how this Government honoured the Fine Gael policy pledge to let the people decide their approaches.  In the light of his policy commitment to devolved regional decision-making in tourism, the Minister sadly did not have a convincing explanation for the 37 per cent slashing of the Shannon Development budget for tourism promotion and development.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the same region where the Mullaghmore centre has been shelved.  The Minister did not give a convincing explanation.  The savage cutback in funding for Shannon Development which is stalling investment and development initiatives&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in a region where they are critically needed to counteract the loss of the Shannon stopover contrasts with increased budgets for other agencies involved in tourism promotion.</P>
      <P>The drastic cutbacks in Shannon Development funds, for example, compares with the 63 per cent increase in the Office of Public Works' budgets for tourism related projects.  It would be interesting to know if it is part of the rainbow shareout agreement that the pot of gold in tourism funding is not under the control of the Department of Tourism and Trade this year.  While Bord Fáilte has £18 million to spend on tourism development works the Office of Public Works has £27 million, almost as much as it combined budgets for the past two years and more than six times what it had in 1990.  The Office of Public Works is certainly building up a very formidable tourism empire and the Minister and his party do not appear to have as much influence on it as they and we would like.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
      <P>That has the effect of reinforcing centralisation rather than fostering decentralisation and is a cause of considerable concern in the Shannon region.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is aware of the worries voiced by the President of the Irish Hotels Federation that the 1994 preliminary figures from Bord Fáilte bear out that the western seaboard was effectively shut off from last year's tourism <Col N="1877" /> growth.  While east cost tourism flourished with up to 35 per cent growth in the south-east and 25 per cent in the midlands and the east, there were reverses in revenue figures for the south-west and the midwest.  I do not blame the Minister for the outturn in 1994, but he and the Government must respond to the preliminary figures with appropriate action to redress the balance.</P>
    <P>The excellent, but largely ignored, Shannon Task Force report highlighted the need for balancing co-ordination of inputs from various Departments in place of follow-the-leader policies which have tended to be dictated by transport issues to the detriment of tourism.  It was not only the Irish Hotels Federation which voiced its concern about last year's tourism performance outturn which became more of a turndown for the western seaboard.  Like the western regions, one of the neglected aspects of this month's study published by the Irish Tourism Industry Confederation on the economic impact of tourism is the shift from the west to the east in overseas tourism.  In noting the shift, the economic consultants state that if the preliminary figures are confirmed this would constitute a worrying trend.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Irish Hotels Federation and the tourism industry will be keen to hear the Minister put forward measures to ensure that worrying trend does not take root.  Unfortunately, as the Shannon lobby was warning for four years of its campaign, the shift away from the west once started will not be easily reversed.  Just as the clock cannot be turned back, neither can tourists without a carefully planned stratey.</P>
    <P>That shift, described as worrying by independent economic analysts, is being accelerated and reinforced by the tactics geared to locate everything in Dublin. The casino concept resisted by Government Departments for 30 years as an extra dimension to Shannon's free zone is now being considered for Dublin.  The Minister is adamant that the national conference centre must be sited in Dublin and is turning his back on a <Col N="1878" /> thoroughly researched corporate conference centre for Shannon which had planning permission and firm commitments from the most senior members of the last Government regarding Euro funding.</P>
    <P>Lest I be misunderstood I welcome increases in tourist numbers and revenue in Dublin and the east and I am impressed by the case made by a number of Deputies in the peripheral areas of the city concerning potential development in their areas.  I am concerned about the trend of the spread of tourism income outlined in the 1994 preliminary figures.  Dublin and the east coast have enormous advantages in terms of access by air and sea and they also have excellent attractions.  Unfortunately other areas in the west and south-west which have a strong tourism tradition are not showing growth at present.  That is what Deputy Andrews and I want the Government to address.</P>
    <P>It is encouraging, as confirmed by the Minister, that funding is being sought for up to 1,000 projects, but a number of problems have developed, particularly with the management boards. Hotel and leisure facilities in the midwest region appear to be getting 10 per cent funding while in the Bord Fáilte area appear to be getting 25 per cent. Deputy Upton reminded me of my interest in the role of pubs.  I believe they have a constructive role to play in the development of tourism, one that is not but needs to be further encouraged.</P>
    <P>In 1952 consultants suggested that State involvement should be focused on marketing.  The A.D. Little report suggested similar action.  Arising from that report new legislation was put in place in 1952.  The Minister indicated that it is his intention to put legislation on the Statute Book shortly.  Critically, he has an opportunity to establish the structure State involvement will take in the future.  For example, at present the regional tourism organisations are not accountable to the Dáil.  They have many offshoot companies which are, in effect, semi-State, but are not accountable to the Dáil.  Those bodies must be <Col N="1879" /> strengthened.  The existence of so many offshoot organisations to Bord Fáilte is creating a lack of focus and a duplication in State tourism efforts.  This needs to be rectified with fully comprehensive, responsive and streamlining tourist traffic legislation.  My colleagues and I look forward to examining the Minister's legislative proposals and to having a constructive input.  Concern has been expressed about the lack of funding for the tourism expansion scheme, the plans for which the Minister outlined today.  As many applications from the tourism industry have been received for structural funding, this matter must be treated with some urgency.</P>

      <P>Tá mé anseo anocht ag déanamh cáis do scoil náisiúnta Oileán an Chnoic, atá suite i gceantar na n-oileán i gConamara. Le cúpla bliana anuas chaill roinnt scoileanna éagsúla i gConamara an cúntóir i scoileanna beirt oide.  Ar na scoileanna sin bhí Scoil an Ghoirt Mhóir, Ros Muc, Scoil Fearann na Coirce in Inis Mór, Scoil an Líonáin, agus anois tá Scoil Oileán an Chnoic i Leitir Mealláin. Is cosúil nach bhfuil aon pholasaí ag an Aire leis an meath seo a stopadh.  Ceantar Gaeltachta é ceantar na n-oileán. Ceantar é a bhfuil an Ghaeilge an-láidir ann i gcónaí.  Bíonn an Stát ag maíomh go bhfuil sé mar pholasaí aige an Ghaeilge a chur chun cinn ach cad is féidir le muintir na Gaeltachta a cheapadh nuair a fheiceann siad go bhfuil na múinteoirí á dtógáil as na scoileanna agus líon na scoileanna aon oide ag méadú in aghaidh na bliana.</P>
      <P>Iarraim ar an Aire an cinneadh atá tógtha i gcás na scoile seo, a bhfuil beirt is fiche fós fágtha ar an rolla, a athrú, agus a chinntiú go mbeidh beirt oide sa scoil seo, sé sin príomh oide agus cúntóir, an bhliain seo chugainn.</P>
      <P>Mura ndéanfar é seo is fánach don Aire a bheith ag caint ar oideachas trí Ghaeilge agus ar shlánú na Gaeltachta, agus beidh sí ag fágáil pobal eile ar an ngannchuid de bharr easpa pholasaí na Roinne i leith na scoileanna beaga.  Ní gá domsa a rá cé chomh dona is atá sé do phobal ar bith má scriostar an scoil trín í a laghdú go dtí aon oide.  Níl sé féaráilte ach oiread do na hoidí atá ag iarraidh a bheith ag múineadh ó na naoineáin bheaga suas go dtí rang a sé sa bhunscoil má tá orthu iomlán an ualaigh a iompar.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tá súil agam mar sin go mbeidh deascéala ag an Aire Stáit atá i láthair anocht dom maidir leis an gceist seo agus go mbeidh sé le fógairt go bhfuil polasaí na Roinne le n-athrú maidir le scoileanna beaga na tuaithe agus go bhfágfar na múinteoirí atá sna scoileanna sin iontu.  Tá súil agam nach leanfar le <Col N="1881" /> tógáil múinteoirí as na scoileanna beaga seo agus iad a chur isteach go dtí na cathracha móra.</P>

      <P>Ar an gceád dul síos, ní mór dom a chur in iúl go bhfuil ceangal orm cloí leis an socrú a deineadh idir an Rialtas agus Cumann Múinteoirí Éireann maidir le ceapachán oidí i scoileanna náisiúnta.</P>
      <P>De réir an tsocraithe san, bíonn an líon múinteoirí a cheadaítear ar fhoireann teagaisc scoile do bhliain áirithe bunaithe ar an líon daltaí a bhíonn cláraithe ar rolla na scoile ar an 30 Meán Fómhair roimhe sin.</P>
      <P>Maidir le Scoil Oileán an Chnoic, bhí beirt dhalta is fiche ar rollaí na scoile ar an 30 Meán Fómhair 1994.  Is é an fhoireann teagaisc atá dlite don scoil de réir na n-uimhreacha seo don scoilbhliain 1995-96 ná an príomhoide amháin.</P>
      <P>Cuirfear post an chéad chúntora ar ceal ag deireadh na scoilbhliana seo. Cuirfear ainm an oide san ar an bPainéal Deoise.  Beidh ar an oide aistriú go scoil eile, rud nach dtarlóidh roimh 1 Meán Fómhair 1995, ar a thúisce.</P>
      <P>Tuigim go maith an díomá a chuirfidh sé ar mhuintir na háite post an chúntóra a chur ar ceal.  Ní mór dom a rá, áfach, i gcomhthéacs líon na ndaltaí sna scoileanna a bheith ag meath ar bhonn náisiúnta, go bhfuil go leor scoileanna ag cailliúint postanna.  Tá cuid mhaith scoileanna ann agus iad ar an imeall.</P>
      <P>Tá siad an-ghar don líon cuí daltaí chun go mbeadh oide eile acu.  Má táimid chun caitheamh go cothrom le gach scoil ní mór dom cloí go dlúth leis an socrú a luaigh mé thuas.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Small Business Sector.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="NedOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. E. O'Keeffe Mr. E. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair <Col N="1882" /> for allowing me to raise this matter on the Adjournment.  We are all aware of the major role small businesses play in our economic welfare.  We encourage small businesses and give them our support, but what they want is practical manifestation of that support.  The best way to give that practical help is by financial means, which works more quickly than any other form of assistance.</P>
      <P>It is because of the pressing need to give financial recognition to small businesses that I raise the matter on the Adjournment tonight.  I am encouraged by the presence of the Minister of State, Deputy Durkan.  However, I would prefer if the Minister for Enterprise and Employment was in the House to reply.</P>
      <P>The small business sector has a long list of grievances.  There is too much paperwork, the audit requirement should be removed and there is need for prompt payment procedures.  While PAYE allowances for owner-workers and tax on dividends are of concern, top of the list is the payment of corporation tax at 38 per cent as well as the high rate of employers' PRSI.  A corporation tax of 38 per cent is far too high and a review of similar taxes in other EU countries supports that.  I would prefer, however, to examine our position on its merits, we do not need to copy the system of another country.  We are well able to conceive and implement practical measures to assist the Exchequer and small businesses at the same time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is approximately one small business for every two persons seeking work.  Assistance for the unemployed costs approximately £3,800 per person per annum.  Small businesses cannot reinvest much more than 60 per cent of their profits in the business.  The more successful a business, the more it requires cash to finance new stock, pay additional debtors and create new jobs. Small businesses must be allowed to expand and reinvest their profits in the business for working capital, new plant and equipment, premises, etc.  A reduction of corporation tax to 10 per cent would mean a great deal to small business.  It would enable them expand <Col N="1883" /> and develop with the inevitable creation of more jobs.  This would not cost anything. In fact, the Exchequer and the wider economy would benefit greatly.  I do not understand why the Government will not amend the Finance Acts.  Is the solution too obvious?</P>
    <P>I wish to elaborate on the net benefits to the Exchequer of such a measure. Initially, the Exchequer would lose corporation tax revenue but the last 2 per cent reduction in the rate of corporation tax cost the Exchequer £43 million.  The banking sector, which formerly paid levies, gained most from that £43 million and it is now actively reducing payroll overheads by shedding jobs.</P>
    <P>At present, small business contributes to and collects without charge VAT, PRSI, PAYE and VRT.  Business owners pay more PAYE than other workers.  They pay residential property tax and often risk their homes to finance and support their business.  With greater availability of working capital, through the retention of after tax profits in the business, the Exchequer will gain tax revenue and will benefit from the creation of jobs.  Every new job created means less will be spent on unemployment assistance and more will be received in PAYE, PRSI and VAT contributions which will result from increased spending power.</P>
    <P>If the 120,000 to 150,000 small businesses in the State created only 10,000 new jobs, it would save the Exchequer £38 million per annum in unemployment costs and would benefit the Exchequer by at least a further £36 million. These amounts, totalling more than £74 million, would come if only one business in 12 created a new job.  I have been unable to obtain from the Revenue Commissioners the cost of reducing corporation tax but I estimate it at substantially less than £70 million.  Corporation tax for all non-manufacturing companies last year amounted to approximately £500 million.</P>
    <P>One might ask why small business owners do not borrow for fixed and working capital requirements.  While the <Col N="1884" /> answer is glaringly obvious to anyone with the merest acquaintance with small business, it would be helpful to outline the principal reasons.  They include the following: the high cost of interest &mdash; on average 3 per cent more than for larger businesses; difficulty in making repayments while expanding &mdash; normal short term financing is a problem; the need for security &mdash; fixed assets are not often available other than the family home which will not be requested as security but would not be rejected if offered and, finally, difficulty in obtaining any loan.</P>
    <P>Small business owners lease cars and equipment and rent factory premises. This is more expensive than outright purchase, which rarely is an option. However leasing, etc., cannot finance the purchase of stocks and factoring debtors is an expensive and not always suitable option.</P>
    <P>The difficulty of defining small business is sometimes mentioned as a reason for not doing anything.  The following are short workable definitions: not 75 per cent or more owned by a larger entity, as this would not meet the criteria; not more than 50 people employed in the previous two years &mdash; two part-time workers would equal one full-time worker for this purpose; a turnover of £1 million, excluding VAT, in the previous year.</P>
    <P>It is important to emphasise that a reduction in corporation tax would only benefit the business if the money was reinvested.  Money taken out of small companies is taxed.</P>
    <P>I call on the Government to amend the Tax Acts to provide for a 10 per cent rate of corporation tax for qualifying small business in order to reduce unemployment. We have approximately 80,000 small manufacturing companies here out of a total of 106,000 small businesses. I understand that Sweden and Norway have a scale of tax to accommodate small business.  In those countries, this is an area where jobs are being created and I urge the Government to come to the rescue of small business to enable it create much needed jobs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy O'Keeffe for raising this matter on the Adjournment.  I recognise his entrepreneurial spirit which was very successful in the past.  I compliment the Deputy on the number of positive proposals he made here tonight and I am sure the Minister will give them serious consideration. It is good to see a Deputy coming into this House with a number of constructive proposals and I would say that Deputy O'Keeffe is always constructive in this House.</P>
      <P>This Government has, from the outset, placed a high priority on the practical development of small business with a view to the expansion of employment. I can do no better than refer the Deputy to paragraphs 27 and 28 of, <i>A Government of Renewal</i>, the policy agreement between the Government parties, wherein we have stated: &ldquo;There will be a concerted programme to help small business in the creation of enterprise and employment&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>It is a measure of our commitment to small business, and to its employment development potential, that we have, since taking office, taken steps to reduce the costs of employers PRSI.  We are well advanced towards establishing seed venture capital funds by the industrial development agencies in partnership with the financial institutions and with the assistance of the European Union.</P>
      <P>The Minister, Deputy Bruton, is considering further strengthening the Competition (Amendment) Bill which provides for self-initiated enforcement action by the Competition Authority. The Government is also examining, in consultation with the Attorney General, empowering the courts to impose stiff fines on those found to be engaging in unfair competition.</P>
      <P>The Minister has consulted the social partners on the exemption of most mergers and takeovers from scrutiny and he will take these views fully into account in the review of the Competition (Amendment) Bill which is currently under way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Considerable work has been done on refocusing emphasis and support <Col N="1886" /> towards the high growth services sector, and here I would refer the Deputy to Report No. 7 of the National Economic and Social Forum entitled <i>The Jobs Potential of the Services Sector</i>.  The Government, in welcoming the forum's report, recognised that the services area offers enormous potential for employment creation and that it is committed to embark on a concerted programme to help the services sector and small business generally foster enterprise and employment.  The forum's recommendations are under consideration and some will be delivered in the context of the specific policy commitments contained in <i>A Government of Renewal</i>. The Minister has been tasked by Government to examine the remaining recommendations of the report and will, in consultation with other Ministers, report back to Government by the end of this year with detailed costings and perspectives on the implementation of the various proposals which, in terms of the services sector, are, in reality, targeted at small business as 80 per cent of the services sector is made up of small businesses.</P>
    <P>Another significant step taken by this Government was the establishment, with the agreement of this House, of a joint committee chaired by my colleague, Deputy Michael Creed.  The joint Oireachtas committee is to examine and report to the Oireachtas on how to improve the operating environment for small business and services.  The joint committee's terms of reference enable it to review and examine all policies, interventions and their consequences on the development of small business.  The joint committee will present its final report by March 1997 and in the interim enables the Oireachtas to be kept fully up to date on developments in the small business sector.  Since its establishment the joint committee has been very active and has taken upon itself a heavy schedule through hearing the views of all involved parties.</P>
    <P>As to specific measures envisaged in <i>A Government of Renewal</i> to assist <Col N="1887" /> small business development and employment, I would point to the commitment made to the introduction of legislation to enforce prompt payment by public bodies; the provision of information and advice to small business in relation to public contracts is but one of a range of practical supports which will be delivered through the small business operational programme, which is awaiting final clearance from Brussels.  I also refer the Deputy to the public tendering process which the Minister, Deputy Bruton initiated earlier this month to ensure the provision of long term, low cost financing thereby enabling small business and services to undertake new strategic investments having a strong potential to create jobs. This tender process is ongoing with a number of financial institutions.</P>
    <P>Overall, the consensus is that the reports of the task forces on small business and services constitute a blueprint for the development of the small business sector and its associated employment potential.  The issue now is to press ahead with the implementation of the recommendations, many of which impinge on the taxation area and of necessity, entail a multi-annual perspective.</P>
    <P>I assure the Deputy that the Department of Enterprise and Employment and the industrial development agencies associated with it, including the county enterprise boards, every day, on a practical basis, deliver supports and assistance enabling the development and expansion of employment in the small business sector.</P>

      <P>It is with a heavy heart that I raise for the fourth time within four months the threat which now seems fatal to the Sunbeam plant. During the previous debates on the Sunbeam factory, the Opposition public representatives for Cork city tried to be constructive in our comments and placed our trust in the Minister to ensure that the plant received all possible State support to guarantee its survival.</P>
      <P>We were repeatedly told the matter was receiving every attention from the Government and that all necessary resources within the Department of Enterprise and Employment and Forbairt were being mobilised to that end. With the closure of the plant announced today, what can I say to my constituents on the north side of Cork city?  In particular what can I say to the many families directly or indirectly affected by this industrial disaster in our community?</P>
      <P>Can I say that the Government left no stone unturned to assist the Sunbeam plant in its struggle for survival?  Can I even with any degree of confidence state that the Government Ministers have shown their concern by visiting the plant and getting an insight into its problems at first hand?  We now see clearly the Government's commitment to this plant.  The Leas-Cheann Comhairle had a slight difficulty with me earlier today when I questioned why my Private Notice Question was not allowed when the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Richard Bruton and the Minister of State at that Department, Deputy Rabbitte, were present and could get involved in the discussion.  Neither is here tonight and that clearly shows the interest of this Government and the Minister in this problem.  There is no Government representative from Cork city in the Chamber and that is a clear indication of the message I am trying to get across.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unfortunately, I have little option but to come to the conclusion that the net contribution of the Government to date <Col N="1889" /> has been to offer lip service to the critical need to copperfasten the precious 320 or so jobs provided at Sunbeam by ensuring its survival.  In their hour of need the workers have been abandoned by what can only be described as a callous Government.  It is one thing to lose a much-needed plant after every possible avenue of rescue has been travelled, and every opportunity for recovery examined.  In such a situation one at least has the consolation that every effort has been made to avoid closure.  I have no choice but to strongly condemn the failure of this Government to respond with compassion and effectiveness to the critical employment needs of my constituents.  Even at this disastrous stage in the matter, I plead with the Government to wake up to their grave responsibility to the employees of Sunbeam. Located in an area with some of the worst unemployment levels in the country, the factory has an excellent skilled and totally committed workforce.</P>
    <P>I would like to impress on the Minister that the time for talking and promising is well and truly over.  Now he must clearly show whether he is equal to the simple direct challenge posed by Sunbeam. If the Minister will not or cannot move effectively to save the jobs of a skilled workforce located in an area of appalling unemployment, then what hope has he of dealing effectively with the unemployment problem in general?</P>
    <P>I request the Minister to fully inform the House of all steps which he has taken to ensure the viability of the Sunbeam plant and at a minimum to provide full details of his plans for ensuring that an alternative enterprise is immediately secured for the Sunbeam factory.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>For the past number of weeks I have been in constant contact with Forbairt regarding the Sunbeam plant.  I was given the clear impression that negotiations on an investment package were at an advanced stage, the expectation was that this package would be successful, that the industry would be secured and the majority of the jobs <Col N="1890" /> saved.  What has gone wrong?  I was given the clear impression that a successful outcome would be announced today.  Could it be that this Government refused to put up the money at the eleventh hour?  If that is the case can the Minister's representative say how much money was involved and how much per job it would represent?  How can the Minister on behalf of the Government justify this Government spending £50 million on Irish Steel and refusing to spend a tiny fraction of that amount to save the jobs in the Sunbeam plant?  Are the jobs in the Sunbeam plant not as important to the workers and to the economy as a job in Irish Steel?  Has the Minister, or any member of the Government, any concept of the anguish caused to the workers and their families and the loss to Blackpool and Cork if a workforce second to none is forced by this Government on to the scrap heap?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I join my colleagues in stating that the non-attendance of the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Richard Bruton, and the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, represents a scandalous disregard for the workers of Sunbeam and their families. In fact, it represents a calculated insult to their plight.  The very least we could have expected this evening was that the Ministers responsible would come before this House and answer to the Opposition Deputies from the constituency where the plant is located.  It is scandalous that they are not present and illustrates the different treatment being meted out to factories and employment outside the capital.  If this factory was located in Deputy Rabbitte's constituency or in Dublin he would be in here arguing for it.  We were fed up watching him on television morning, noon and night out at the Packard plant or meeting with its management across the water.  We saw no such commitment to the Sunbeam plant in Cork.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We need answers and to know what was lacking in the Government's commitment to the plant.  Where did it go wrong?  We deserve that answer because <Col N="1891" /> in previous attempts when Deputies Wallace and Quill raised this issue in the House the impression was certainly given that serious efforts were under way to ensure a viable package for the rescue of this plant.  We were given no warning that it was in a perilous state.  It is reprehensible that we now find ourselves in this situation.  Let me repeat that at the very least the Minister, and all Government Deputies from the constituency, Deputies Lynch, Allen and Burke, should be present for this debate.  When we were in Government they would have been in the House in a similar situation and it is scandalous that they are not here to represent their constituents and make their views known on this appalling situation and tragic loss of jobs in Cork city.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The situation at Sunbeam Industries Limited in Cork has been debated on several occasions recently in the House and the company's financial difficulties <Col N="1892" /> have been well known for some months. On the Adjournment debate on 18 May 1995 the Minister of State, Deputy Eithne Fitzgerald, referred to the ongoing efforts being made by Forbairt to try to secure the future of the existing operations.</P>
    <P>Given that the workers were issued with protective notice two weeks ago, today's decision by the company to go into voluntary liquidation was not unexpected. I reiterate that I share the concerns of all Deputies in the area, about the possible job losses.</P>
    <P>On behalf of the Minister, Deputy Bruton, and the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, I assure all concerned that Forbairt is engaged in active discussions with a potential investor.  Significant progress has been made in relation to a possible proposal and the normal clarifications and negotiations associated with this exercise are well advanced.</P>
    <P>The Deputies will appreciate, however, that I am not in a position to elaborate further at this stage regarding the precise details of the proposal but I ask for their co-operation in ensuring that the current discussions are given every possible opportunity to be brought to a conclusion.  Some of the emotive rhetoric tonight may not be helpful.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that the Sunbeam Industries board has been forced to put the company into liquidation.  Nevertheless, I want to assure the House, the workers at the Cork plant and indeed their families that this development should not adversely affect the outcome of the current negotiations to which I have already referred.  Forbairt will consider any proposal emerging from these discussions on its merits.  It is important to stress, however, that the final outcome will depend on the overall viability of the project.  The Minister for Enterprise and Employment is hopeful that this process can be completed within a matter of weeks.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 1 June 1995.</P>

      <P>The code of conduct for Ministers and Ministers of State to which the Deputy refers and which has been applied by successive administrations, both before and since 1986, continues to apply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only variation to this code is that, upon assuming office, I took the unprecedented step of requesting all Ministers and Ministers of State to furnish me with a declaration of their financial interests.  This request was complied with in every case.  I have already explained in detail to the House the circumstances surrounding the resignation of Deputy Hugh Coveney as a Minister and his subsequent appointment as a <Col N="1735" /> Minister of State.  The action take was not because Minister of State, Deputy Coveney, was unfit for office, but because, in my opinion, he made a single mistake for which he must be held accountable.  By taking the course of action which I did, I showed that I expected &mdash; and will continue to expect &mdash; the highest standards from Ministers and Ministers of State.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware, there is no rule prohibiting Ministers or Ministers of State from holding press conferences or photocalls at the offices of companies in which they have a shareholding.</P>

      <P>Tá cúnamh substaintiúil á chur ar fáil ag mo Roinnse le fada do chomharchumainn Ghaeltachta áirithe ar mhaithe le forbairt pobail a chur chun cinn ina gceantair fheidhme chomh maith le seirbhísí riachtanacha a sholáthar don phobal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tar éis do mo Roinnse athbhreithniú a dhéanamh ar ról na gcomharchumann bhí mé sásta go raibh gá le méadú substaintiúil a dhéanamh ar na deontais reachtála a íoctar le comharchumainn áirithe le go mbeidh siad in ann feidhmiú níos éifeachtaí.  Mar thoradh shocraigh mé le déanaí na huasdheontais reachtála bliantúla gur féidir a íoc á <Col N="1736" /> méadú i gcás na gcomharchumann ar an mórthír ó £20,000 go £28,000 agus ó £22,000 go £40,000 i gcás na gcomharchumann ar oileáin Ghaeltachta amach ón gcósta.</P>
    <P>Ba i ngeall ar na costais mhaireachtála a bheith níos airde ar na hoileáin a rinneadh méadú chomh mór sin i gcás na gcomharchumainn ansin.  Ó shin i leith, áfach, rinneadh achainíocha láidre liom nach raibh cothromaíocht idir na huasdheontais ar an mhórthír agus iad siúd ar na hoileáin.  Tá an cás sin athscrúdaithe agam agus is áthas liom a rá go bhfuil an t-uasdheontas do chomharchumainn ar an mhórthír á mhéadú anois agam go £33,000.</P>
    <P>Os rud go dtiteann costais riaracháin ar na comharchumainn ar bhonn leanúnach táim sásta, i gcoitinne, gur mar dheontais reachtála méadaithe, seachas mar airgead aon uaire, is fearr cabhrú leo.</P>

    <P>My Department advertised late last <Col N="1739" /> year for applications from project promoters for grants under the cultural development incentives scheme which is administered by it as part of the EU operational programme for tourism 1994-99.  The closing date for such applications was 3 February 1995.  The Transport Museum Society of Ireland did not, however, apply for funding under this scheme and it would not be possible, in equity, to consider any such application at this stage.  The number of applications under this scheme was 170 and the scheme has been heavily over-subscribed having regard to the amount of funds likely to be available this year.  It is my intention to re-advertise the scheme during the period of the programme which runs up to 1999 at which time the Transport Museum Society of Ireland, if it wishes, may apply for consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht (Mr. M. Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>The most important objective is to preserve the archaeological remains in situ, particularly in the medieval city of Dublin. Archaeological excavation is, in itself, a process of destruction and generally only justified where unavoidable to facilitate development.  The National Monuments and Historic Properties Service has established close liaison with Dublin Corporation on planning matters which have archaeological implications in order to avoid or minimise archaeological disturbance.  Where excavation does take place, a formal licence is required under the National Monuments Acts and proper standards are insisted upon.</P>
      <P>To date, large areas of medieval Dublin have been excavated, especially by the National Museum at High Street, Christchurch Place and the Wood Quay civic offices' site and by the Office of Public Works at Dublin Castle.  The corporation itself funded excavation prior to phase 2 of the civic offices development and prior to a sewerage scheme on Patrick Street and Winetavern Street. Private developers have funded many other rescue excavations around the city in accordance with planning conditions, as have Temple Bar Properties Limited. These investigations have greatly increased our knowledge of the Viking origins of the city and the later medieval expansion.  The priority now is to have the findings of the excavations published.</P>

      <P>I am not aware that any agency under my aegis directs the public to cross land which is in private ownership so as to gain access to national monuments.</P>
      <P>National monuments are part of our heritage and have always been visited by members of the public.  With the growing public interest in our heritage, it is understandable that the viewing of national monuments on private property and access through private property should cause some unease among landowners concerning responsibility for any injuries which the public might sustain.</P>
      <P>It is in all our interests that access to national monuments should not be constrained by unnecessary fears about potential liabilities and the Occupiers' Liability Bill introduced by my colleague, Deputy Mervyn Taylor, Minister for Equality and Law Reform, is intended to deal with, <i>inter alia</i>, this issue.</P>
      <P>Contrary to what is implied in the Deputy's question, the Bill, when enacted, will increase the protection for occupiers of land against claims by trespassers and recreational users while ensuring that recreational use of land is facilitated to the widest extent possible.</P>

      <Quest>if he will introduce a system whereby medical equipment and appliances, duly certified and recommended by a medical practitioner, can be supplied free of VAT to individual purchasers; if the scheme would be in accordance with EU VAT rules; and if not, the way in which it is applied in the UK.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume that the Deputy is referring to equipment and appliances bought for the personal use of individuals.  The general position is that, under EU VAT law, medical equipment and appliances are liable to VAT.  However, member States which applied zero rates to such items on 1 January 1991 may continue to do so for a transitional period, that is, until end 1996, at least.  This appears to be the operational basis of the UK system of relief to which the Deputy refers: it involves the zero-rating of goods to individual purchasers where they can satisfy the retailer that they are disabled persons entitled to the relief. As the creation of new zero rates is prohibited by EU law, it is not open to Ireland to introduce a similar scheme at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I should explain that a number of special arrangements have applied here for several years which have the net effect of removing VAT on many medical appliances and items of equipment for personal use.  Firstly, the zero rate of VAT currently applies to wheelchairs and other invalid vehicles (excluding mechanically propelled road vehicles), orthopaedic appliances, surgical belts, trusses and the like, deaf aids, artificial limbs, walking frames and crutches.  Secondly, under the terms of VAT Refund Order No. 15, an amount equivalent to the VAT borne on <Col N="1749" /> appliances and aids which assist disabled persons to overcome their disability in the performance of daily functions or the exercise of a vocation, may be refunded on application to the Revenue Commissioners.  For the purpose of this scheme, the term disability is defined in broad terms to include loss of physical or mental faculty due to injury, disease, congential deformity or physical or mental illness or defect.  A very broad range of items is eligible for refund under this scheme, including radar devices for the blind, renal haemodialysis units, dialysis machines and artificial respirators.  The scheme is administered by the Revenue Commissioners and it is a matter for them to determine whether or not a particular item is eligible for refund.  Finally, of course, medical card holders are generally entitled to receive medical appliances and aids free of charge.</P>
    <P>The existing arrangements outlined above in relation to medical aids and appliances are, therefore, wide ranging and I believe that they are of significant assistance to persons requiring such equipment.  I do not intend to make any amendments to them at this stage.</P>

      <P>Policy on architecture must take account of both our architectural heritage and modern architecture and I have taken initiatives in a number of areas in the development of policy for these two aspects of architecture.</P>
      <P>In relation to architectural heritage, the Deputy will be pleased to know that I and my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Howlin, have established an inter-departmental working group made up of officials of my Department, the Department of the Environment and the Office of Public Works to examine, and report back with recommendations on improving the protection for listed buildings, including placing the system of listed buildings on a statutory basis and introducing incentives for the proper upkeep and maintenance of such buildings, and undertaking a full national architectural audit.  I can assure the Deputy that, in consultation with the Minister for the Environment, I will give careful consideration to this report, which I expect to have by the end of this year, and to the introduction of any necessary new policy initiatives in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Heritage Act, 1995, which was recently enacted, provides for the establishment of a statutory corporation, to be known as An Chomhairle Oidhreachta, or the Heritage Council, which will replace the existing non-statutory National Heritage Council established in 1988.  The council will be required to establish a standing committee on the architectural heritage which may <Col N="1758" /> include persons who are not members of the council.  This committee will be a source of advice on architectural heritage policy.</P>
    <P>The broad functions of the Heritage Council will be to propose policies and priorities in relation to the identification, protection, preservation and enhancement of the physical heritage, which will include the architectural heritage. The specific functions of the council will include co-operation with, and the provision of assistance (including financial assistance) and advice to persons and bodies.  A new and important function of the council will be a special responsibility in relation to heritage buildings in public ownership.  Under section 10 of the Act, a public authority (viz. the State, a State agency or a local authority) must notify the council in writing of any proposal to demolish, alter significantly or dispose of a building owned by it, which has been designated as a heritage building by the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht under this section on the advice of the council, or any land or other building adjoining such a building, and may not proceed with the proposal contrary to the advice of the council unless the Minister agrees to the proposal or to a modified form of the proposal, or the Government agrees to the proposal.</P>
    <P>The Council of Europe Convention for the Protection of the Architectural Heritage of Europe was signed by Ireland in Granada, Spain, on 3 October 1985.  My department is actively pursuing ratification of the convention by this country in consultation with the other Departments involved.</P>
    <P>Architecture is included in the Arts Plan, 1995-97, which was published earlier this year by An Chomhairle Ealaíon and discussed in this House, and which I have now submitted to Government for consideration.  Architecture is included under the broad category of the Visual Arts and, while there may only be a few specific references to the discipline, its needs must be considered under the wider issues of creating awareness and <Col N="1759" /> appreciation of the visual arts in general, for which there are definite proposals. One of the greatest problems facing architecture at the moment is the lack of understanding of its importance as an integral part of our culture.  Both my Department and An Chomhairle Ealaíon have formally supported the establishment of a working group, coordinated by the Royal Institute of Architects of Ireland, to prepare a proposal for a National Policy on Architecture, a draft of which will be submitted in the autumn.  The results of this exercise may be incorporated into relevant sections of the Arts Plan where appropriate and will also be of assistance to my Department in the on-going formulation of general architectural policy.</P>

      <P>Transport is a significant emitter of nitrogen dioxide and lead pollution, and contributes to a lesser extent to concentrations of smoke and sulphur dioxide in air.  Data on these pollutants was published in the 1993 ERU report <i>Air Quality in Ireland: A review 1981-1991</i>, a copy of which is in the Oireachtas Library.  The report showed no deterioration nationally in nitrogen dioxide concentrations and significant improvements in lead and sulphur dioxide levels since monitoring commenced in accordance with the Air Pollution Act, 1987, (Air Quality Standards) Regulations, 1987.  Improvement in smoke concentrations was also apparent from the report.</P>
      <P>I understand that the Environmental Protection Agency plans to publish an update of the 1993 report shortly.  This will show that no deterioration has taken place in nitrogen dioxide concentrations and that lead, sulphur dioxide and smoke concentrations continue to decrease.</P>
      <P>These improvements reflect the ban on bituminous coal; emission control measures on petrol and diesel engined vehicles; and environmental standards for various fuels, including diesel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I intend shortly to make regulations to implement Directive 94/12/EC which lays down revised emission standards for passenger cars from 1 January 1997. Ireland has strongly supported EU efforts to improve vehicle standards <Col N="1762" /> with a view to reducing air pollution and we will continue to do this.</P>

      <P>Under new staffing arrangements for primary schools, teaching posts which would have been lost due to declining enrolments are being retained in the system.  This will allow the pupil teacher ratio to be reduced from 23.4:1 in September 1994 to 22.9:1 in September 1995.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding these improvements, there will, of course, be a number of schools where teaching posts will no longer be warranted because of declining enrolments, as a result of which the teachers concerned will be redeployed under the panel arrangements.</P>
      <P>The staffing of national schools for a particular year is determined by the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous year.  The total enrolment in each of the schools on 30 September 1994 has, when compared with the previous year's enrolment, declined to the extent that a teaching post must be suppressed.  All of the teachers in question have been given the option of having their names placed on the diocesan panel for redeployment, which will not take place before 1 September 1995.</P>

      <P>The person concerned commenced employment with this company in November 1991 and the employment terminated on 16 July 1994.  During the period September 1992 to September 1993 he was participating in a special off-the-job apprenticeship course at a FÁS training centre.</P>
      <P>He claimed disability benefit from 18 July 1994 but did not qualify as there was no record of pay-related social insurance contributions having been paid on his behalf.  The matter was referred to a social welfare inspector for investigation.  The inquiries made by the inspector indicate that the person concerned was not paid wages in respect of the period September 1992 to September 1993 when he was participating in a FÁS apprenticeship course.  The employer has indicated that he was not in a position to pay wages and it seems that there was some understanding between him and the employee in this regard.  Since no pay-related social insurance contributions are due the question of prosecuting the employer for non-payment in respect of this period does not arise.  The person concerned has been credited with social insurance contributions in respect of the periods November 1991 to September 1992 and September 1993 to July 1994. Unfortunately, this does not give him sufficient contributions to qualify for disability benefit.</P>

      <P>There are an estimated 30,000 carers providing full time care and attention to elderly or incapacitated people.  Of these, some 5,800 are in receipt of a carer's allowance.  The cost of paying those not in receipt of a carer's allowance a minimum of £25 a week, irrespective of means, would be £32 million in a full year.

      <P>According to the records of my Department, the person concerned is working in a self-employed capacity and has paid PRSI contributions since 1984 at the Class K1 rate &mdash; 2.25 per cent.  This contribution rate comprises the health contribution, 1.25 per cent and the employment and training levy, 1 per cent only.  Class K1 contributions do not provide cover for any social welfare benefits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The social insurance system was extended in April 1988 to self-employed people under pension age 66 years to give them coverage for contributory old age and survivor's pensions.  As the person concerned was aged over 66 at that <Col N="1770" /> time, he was not liable for social insurance contributions as a self-employed contributor at the PRSI Class S1 rate, but continued to be liable to pay PRSI at the Class K1 rate.</P>
    <P>Survivor's pension is payable on the insurance record of a widower or his late spouse provided PRSI contributions at an appropriate class have been paid and the qualifying contribution conditions are satisfied on either record.</P>
    <P>As the person concerned was not insurable for survivor's pension and there is no record of social insurance for his late spouse, he is not qualified for survivor's pension.  It is open to him, at any stage, to apply for an old age noncontributory pension which is payable subject to a means test.</P>

      <P>The free television licence scheme is one of the free schemes administered by my Department which also include the free electricity allowance, the free natural gas allowance and the free telephone rental allowance. The purpose of these schemes is to encourage elderly or disabled people living alone on limited means to continue to live in their own homes instead of going into residential care.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to qualify, an applicant must be in receipt of a social welfare type payment and satisfy the living alone conditions of the schemes.  Those who are registered as deaf would qualify under the free television licence scheme if they are in receipt of an invalidity pension from my Department or a disabled person's maintenance allowance <Col N="1771" /> from the health board and meet the living alone conditions.</P>
    <P>The present free television licence scheme was extended in this year's budget to provide a free colour television licence for all recipients.  An extension of the scheme on the lines suggested by the Deputy would involve additional expenditure which could only be considered in a budgetary context.  I should mention that the free schemes referred to above currently cost about £59 million a year and are availed of by over 200,000 people.</P>

      <P>The person in question applied to the Department in November 1993 for licences to engage in oyster growing in Dungarvan Bay.  Applications for licensing for any particular area are dealt with on a chronological basis and a large number of licensing applications from other persons had preceded this application. A total of some 37 individual oyster growing development projects for an area comprising some 300 hectares have been licensed to date at locations in southern Dungarvan Bay, in consultation and agreement with Waterford County Council and the National Parks and Wildlife Service.  A small area of foreshore remains to be allocated and <Col N="1774" /> this is presently the subject of an application from an existing licensed operator.</P>
      <P>Applications for licences to engage in shellfish farming are subject to evaluation by the Aquaculture Licence Vetting Committee, a multidisciplinary advisory body, which brings together relevant expertise from within the Department of the Marine and from the Central Fisheries Board.  Applications are assessed from all technical, scientific and other relevant perspectives to determine the suitability of proposals. This evaluation process is further informed by a public consultation process.</P>
      <P>In the circumstances, it is unlikely that the licensing application from the person concerned can be facilitated. The Department will notify all outstanding applicants as to the position as soon as the licensing process has been brought to finality, in relation to the remaining small area of foreshore available for allocation.</P>

      <P>We have been notified by the Secretariat to the Oslo Convention for the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping from Ships and Aircraft that the UK authorities propose to permit the dumping at sea in the north west Atlantic of a redundant offshore oil installation.  Under that convention, such installations may be dumped at sea in accordance with its provisions. Basically these provisions allow for such dumping provided they do not have a negative impact on the marine environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1775" /> We have concerns in relation to the proposed dumping.  These relate to possible presence within the installation of PCBs, toxic substance, oily sludge and radioactive sludge.  We are in communication with the UK authorities seeking clarification on these matters. We would obviously be very concerned if such substances were dumped at sea.</P>
    <P>We are also anxious that the general rules governing the dumping of offshore installations be reviewed and intend raising this matter in consultation with other contracting parties at the next Oslo Commission meeting in June. Accordingly we have suggested to the UK authorities that they consider postponing the proposed dumping operation pending the outcome of the commission meeting.</P>
