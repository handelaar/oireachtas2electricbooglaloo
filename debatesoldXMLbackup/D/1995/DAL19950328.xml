    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1, 2 and 3 together.</P>
      <P>The commencement of comprehensive dialogue on a settlement must be the primary objective of all.  The decommissioning of weapons is an extremely important issue to be dealt with in the context of such a settlement.  The Government has been anxious to ensure that the arms question does not become an obstacle to political progress and we are, therefore, working with all the parties to achieve progress on the issue. This is one of the matters for discussion at the meeting which the Tánaiste and I will be having with Sinn Féin representatives this afternoon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Sinn Féin leader, in his statement of 9 March, more recently in the United States and subsequently, has given clear indications that the decommissioning of weapons would be on the agenda for talks with British Ministers.  I welcome that development.  I hope that Sinn Féin will signal a commitment to use its influence with the IRA to put all its weaponry out of commission.  Naturally, a similar approach is also required from the loyalist representatives in respect of <Col N="179" /> their dialogue with the British Government and I welcome that talks at ministerial level have commenced.  Issues such as prisoners and policing will also need to be addressed in an imaginative way.  I believe that with realism and flexibility on all sides, progress on the arms, prisoners and policing issues would greatly enhance the climate of confidence for comprehensive dialogue, and would certainly contribute in a very significant way to the sense of security felt by all participants.</P>
    <P>Now that ministerial talks with the loyalist representatives have got under way, the Government hopes that such talks with Sinn Féin will begin soon and thus expedite the commencement of a comprehensive process of dialogue.  We are monitoring all developments in regard to those talks, including matters relating to the decommissioning of arms.  However, I do not propose to comment on the substance of any exchanges with the British Government on that issue.  Our primary concern is the achievement of a durable political settlement in an environment of peace, where all in Northern Ireland will feel a real sense of security and belonging.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach told me in this House on 24 January that it was the Government's position, and that of Minister Ancram, that the decommissioning of weapons is not a pre-condition for Sinn Féin's participation in all party talks.  Is that still the Taoiseach's position?  Will he confirm that he has not changed his stand on this position?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course that is the position.  Nobody is suggesting that all arms should be dumped before talks take place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach accept that the British ministerial talks with the loyalists began without any arms being handed up or concessions made on decommissioning?  Does he agree that the disagreements now with Sinn Féin and the British Government <Col N="180" /> appear to be on the order of an agenda rather than something more substantial?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's question contained two parts.  First, he asked if I agreed that talks had taken place with loyalists without the decommissioning of arms.  That is true.  Second, he asked if I agreed that those talks had taken place without progress being made on the issue of decommissioning of weapons.  That is not true because the loyalists were willing to discuss that issue with the British Government and not to link it to any other issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are working towards a formula which would enable discussions on the decommissioning of illegally held weapons to take place between Sinn Féin and the British Government, but that will be part of an agenda containing many other items.  I made it clear in successive interventions here and elsewhere that I do not believe this should be a one item agenda.  Neither do I believe one must necessarily have completely agreed the first item before moving on to discuss the following items.  It is an inclusive agenda.  We must recognise that the arms question is an important one, not merely from the point of view of the size of the arsenals now in existence, which is far greater than any in our history, but also from the point of view that we are the political representatives of the relatives of the victims of those arms.  We will not have a complete settlement until there are all round talks involving, for example, Unionists and Sinn Féin.  Anybody who thinks about the matter for more than ten seconds will realise that without the decommissioning of arms such talks will not be viable because one side will see itself as sitting down without arms to negotiate with another group which has arms available to it and the dialogue would not be an ordinary political dialogue. This is an issue that must be dealt with in a serious and consistent way.  In this context I welcome the genuine efforts being made by both the British Government and Sinn Féin to reach a <Col N="181" /> formula for discussions to take place on the basis of a clear commitment to, among other things, deal seriously with the question of getting rid of these arms.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree that it is important to distinguish between legally and illegally held arms? Is it his view that there are people in the provisional movement who believe that the talks can be brought to a satisfactory conclusion while they still hold arms?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is essential to make a clear distinction between legally and illegally held arms.  I have made that distinction in all interventions I have made. I have made it clear that it is one of the marks of any civil power that its army and its police have the right to bear arms to defend the existence of the State or the political entity in question. This is entirely separate from any question of illegally held arms.  There is an intermediate position of arms issued to individuals for self-protection because these individuals were considered to be under threat.  If that threat is lifted, the need to hold arms is substantially lessened. Legally held arms are not in the same category as the arms held by a police force or an army.  Essentially we are dealing with three categories &mdash; illegally held arms, arms legally held by individuals for self-protection and arms held by the civil authority.  Each must be dealt with separately.  It is relevant, in a certain context, to discuss all of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach forgot to answer the second part of my question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not care to speculate on the opinions of individuals within any political movement.  I have no doubt there are minorities in every movement, whether it be a political party or other association, who disagree with the view of the majority.  The loyalist organisations, Sinn Féin and the IRA are committed to the cessation of violence and a preponderant number of people in all those organisations is working assiduously towards that end.  It <Col N="182" /> is important, however, that in so doing they recognise that they are dealing not just with the concerns of their own people but also with the hurt, fears and worries of another community which may in the past have been their antagonists or their victims.  One cannot deal with these issues in isolation, in the context of what will or will not go down well in one's community.  One must consider how certain gestures or activities will go down in the other community close to home.  It is one thing to be understood on the international stage but the important thing for both elements in Northern Ireland is to seek an understanding of each other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach saying that the decommisioning of arms is part of the wider demilitarisation agenda and that he believes that is the right approach rather than chasing one item on the agenda?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I prefer to use my own words rather than have even somebody as well meaning as the Leader of Fianna Fáil summarising what I say.  I have made a clear statement about this matter already.  In a society where all the relevant people, including those who control the weapons, are committed to peaceful political methods, these weapons &mdash; the Semtex, the rocket launchers, the conventional weapons, the machine-guns and the AK47s &mdash; are a redundant legacy of the past, but they are not simply some antique reminder of the past; they represent an ever present threat to communities and they must be disposed of.  That is a practical political reality which we must all understand.  How and when are matters that can be discussed, but it is essential that there be a firm commitment to deal with this issue as quickly as is humanly possible.  We cannot afford to have the fear still in Northern Ireland remain at its present level; it has to be constantly reduced by confidence-building measures on all sides.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Taoiseach but it is not much use our debating it at Question Time when decommissioning has not commenced. If decommissioning is taken separately from demilitarisation, it will not work. Does the Taoiseach accept that decommissioning is part of the broader demilitarisation agenda or is there some way that he, as Head of the Government, can help Sinn Féin and the British Government to move from their position? It is ridiculous that two similar agencies are holding up all the aspirations the Taoiseach set down and with which I agree, and that talks cannot start because of the order of the agenda. If the agenda does not say that decommissioning is part of the overall demilitarisation issue, I cannot see how we can move forward.  Does the Taoiseach have a proposal that will help or is this an issue in which the United States should get involved?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I identified three categories of arms &mdash; illegally held arms, arms legally held by individuals and arms held by the army and the police force.  I prefer to describe it in those practical and precise terms rather than using language like the phrase used by the Deputy where arms appear to be the property of one side or the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy seems to be under a misapprehension.  Very real progress is being made.  The positions are coming quite close.  As I said on several occasions when I was in the United States, I was and remain optimistic that the difficulties will finally be completely overcome.  I am confident about that.  As to my involvement as Head of the Government here, I have been in touch at the highest level with all the relevant parties with a view to encouraging them in a very practical way to come to a point where the remaining small difficulties are eliminated.  The situation is much closer to resolution than the <Col N="184" /> Deputy seems to think from the phraseology he used in his question.  I hope he will be pleased to hear that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree that the security response will come when the decommissioning process begins?  Does he further agree with the comments made at the Forum last Friday by Dr. John Alderdice that, for many people in Northern Ireland, equating IRA arms with British Army arms is like equating loyalists arms with those in the possession of the Garda and the Irish Army and that they find this offensive?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no disagreement with Dr. Alderdice.  Even without the decommissioning of arms, each week or month that passes in which there is no violence, in a practical sense, makes it sensible to reduce the security presence and activity.  I would not be as categoric as the Deputy in creating a link but I agree with her when she implies that the decommissioning of arms is a very important issue.</P>
      <P>Whatever about talks with the British Government getting under way, as I believe and hope they will quite soon if there is reason on both sides, it is important to recognise that the long term goal is a situation in which the Unionists and loyalists, the sons and daughters, brothers and sisters of victims, will sit down with representatives of Sinn Féin and on the other side loyalists will be able to sit down with nationalists.  That is the objective and real prize we are seeking.</P>
      <P>We must recognise it is not conceivable that those talks will be fruitful as long as there are huge stores of explosives and arsenals of arms illegally held. In practical terms, the full consensus we are looking for is not possible as long as those arsenals exist on either side because people will be too fearful to be generous and people must be generous to the other side if we are to make progress. The existence of arms engenders fear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="185" /> The removal of arms is part of a process of reducing the level of fear so that the level of generosity will be sufficient to ensure the reconciliation we need on the island of Ireland.  I hope people will see this matter in that political context and not harp back, as some do, to what happened in 1867 or 1798 and other events.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact is that in those times we did not solve the problem. Even after all those events there still remained division between the peoples living on this island.  Citing those historical precedents as justification for what we are doing now is citing a formula which did not work.</P>

      <P>What we now need is a new dispensation and a new approach which genuinely takes not just the gun but the culture of the gun out of Irish politics forever.  That is what we are seeking and we are very close to achieving it.  In the way it has treated this matter, including today, this House is contributing greatly, by the sanity of its discourse, to bringing this much desired eventuality closer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>In his wide-ranging replies the Taoiseach mentioned three categories of arms &mdash; those held illegally, legally and in the hands of the security forces.  Will he take into account the fact that the Provisional IRA is not the only group which holds arms?  Given the Official IRA's involvement in the troubles, its continued existence and the fact that it continues to hold arms has the Taoiseach asked the Minister for Social Welfare, the former leader of the political wing of the Official IRA, to use his influence with his former associates to decommission its weapons?  Will he also take the initiative in relation to those &ldquo;legally&rdquo; held arms by members of the Unionist community, in the hands of those who <Col N="186" /> felt threatened, which run to many hundreds of thousands?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In response to Deputy Harney I identified the issue of arms legally held by people for their own protection as one which is capable of being discussed in the course of further talks because the threat which justified the issue of those arms has lessened considerably.  I recognise the validity of that matter.  In response to the first part of the question I am surprised the Deputy should make such a point in this House, it is of no relevance&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware of the statistics which the Forum has already considered on the number of full and part-time reservists of the RUC?  In each case the figures in 1969 was zero but now in the order of 4,500 are in possession of arms.  This must be taken into consideration in discussing the decommissioning of weapons and demilitarisation.  Deputy Harney rightly emphasised the need to decommission weapons held by ex-paramilitaries.  As the British Government is not the appropriate authority to arbitrate on this matter, as a confidence building measure, will the Taoiseach consider, with the British Government, the engagement of some outside Government or agency which would command the confidence of both Governments and communities to make an impartial assessment on the issue of demilitarisation, including the decommissioning of weapons held by paramilitary groups? That is the best confidence building measure that could be taken at this time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The more people one tries to involve in solving a problem the more difficult it becomes to solve.  If yet another party is introduced into the discussion half way through everybody retreats to their original position while this new intervenor gets up to speed on the facts. The Deputy's suggestion does not have much to recommend it.  We are very near to getting discussions under way in a fruitful atmosphere between the people directly involved.  This is far more effective than bringing in third parties who may have to spend six to eight months getting to understand the facts and the views on either side.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="188" /> On the question of the arms held by reservists of the RUC I am sure the Deputy has not forgotten that many RUC reservists were murdered.  One of the reasons many RUC reservists hold licensed arms is self-protection.  I am sure the Deputy is also aware that many politicians on both sides of the divide in Northern Ireland who were considered to be at risk of assassination were issued with licensed weapons for the same reason, self-protection.  In response to Deputy Harney I said that the issue of legally held weapons for self-protection in a situation where the necessity for protection is less because there is no violence is a legitimate one for discussion but I do not think we can create any moral or political equivalents between illegally and legally held arms; They are not the same and I do not think we can put them on the same plain.  That is not to say that the legally held arms issue should not be dealt with also because there should no longer be a need for many of these arms if the threat is removed.  It is one of the issues that can and will be legitimately raised in discussion and I hope it will be dealt with.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Deenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>By the initial closing date of 10 March, the number of applications received by my Department for compensation under the flood damage relief scheme was almost 1,400.  The closing date was extended to 24 March by which date about 1,600 applications had been received.  If all of these prove eligible then the total compensation payable would be of the order of £1.8 million, including compensation for loss of grazing of land flooded above normal winter levels.</P>
      <P>The first payments under the scheme will commence this week.  If the terms of the scheme need further modification to cover agricultural losses not already included, I am prepared to consider any such modification.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for his reply.  The Minister will be aware that when this issue was raised during Private Members' Time and finalised on budget day, a commitment was given by the then Minister with responsibility for the Office of Public <Col N="190" /> Works, Deputy Hogan, that payments would be made within a matter of weeks rather than months.  What further modifications is the Minister prepared to consider since people have only applied for loss of livestock and fodder as per the original terms of reference of the scheme?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a need for compensation because many areas that have been affected by flooding will not be ready for hay or silage this year.  Many parts of the country that have not been as greatly affected by the flooding as some of the worst areas will experience major difficulty in having proper meadows this year.  What financing arrangements does the Minister intend to make to provide for such consequential losses?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy could not accuse the Government of being inactive in this whole area.  For example, the Minister has visited the Gort area on two occasions and the Minister with responsibility for the Office of Public Works has visited that area also.  A number of initiatives have been put in place, for example, an interdepartmental committee, chaired by the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Higgins, has been established to co-ordinate the Government's response to the effect of bad weather.  A total of £4 million has been allocated for county roads in that area and £2 million has been provided for an agricultural compensation fund to cover loss of stock and fodder.  An amendment is proposed to the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945 which would enable the Commissioners for Public Works to carry out drainage works on individual areas within a river catchment area. Also, an examination of areas experiencing flooding is being carried out on <Col N="191" /> a countrywide basis prioritising areas to be dealt with on a phased basis. Included in that examination is a special consultant's investigation of the flooding problems in South Galway.  A delegation led by my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Higgins, was successful in obtaining emergency funding of £240,000 from the European Commission for humanitarian relief.  A one-stop-shop was established in the Gort area, where the flooding has been most severe, to assist residents.  It is important to point out that an emergency disaster plan is being prepared to improve the national response to any future emergency.  The Deputy will agree that in 1990 a similar disaster occurred in the Gort area and other areas but we did not follow up on that experience.  We should learn from this experience and hopefully a disaster plan will be in place in future which will come to terms with such eventualities.</P>

      <P>There have been a number of ministerial visitations but the areas are still flooded.  It is not Lourdes. If the number of ministerial visitations were to solve the problem they would have been solved a long time ago.  I note that payments are to begin this week but I would remind the Minister that, when he is monitoring the payment of these necessary moneys to people who have suffered and who continue to suffer severe hardship, there are areas in the country which FDS staff have not yet had an opportunity to inspect with regard to applications for compensation and relief.  I do not know, therefore, what percentage of people can expect payment this week but I ask the Minister to use his good offices and ensure that payment is made as expeditiously as possible and that the farm development staff are available to carry out the inspections quickly now that we have gone beyond the expiry date for applications of 24 March.</P>

We are paying £20 per ton of silage equivalent in respect of lost fodder; in 1990 the payment was £12.50.

    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10, 22, 25 and 33, together.</P>
      <P>My main concern in relation to the tillage sector is the significant decrease which has taken place in cereal production over the past two years.</P>
      <P>This decrease was partly due to the set-aside requirement under CAP reform which resulted in the withdrawal from production of 26,000 hectares of land in 1993 an 36,000 hectares in 1994.  In addition, adverse weather conditions over the same period also played a significant part in reducing production with below average yields having been recorded in most areas of the country.  The effects of set-aside and low yields has resulted in reduced production from an average of two million tonnes in the years prior to CAP reform to 1.6 million tonnes in 1993 and 1.5 million tonnes in 1994.</P>
      <P>The area under cereals had been declining significantly in the years prior to CAP reform.  For example the national cereal area decreased by 32.5 per cent between 1980 and 1992.  Notwithstanding this decrease in area, cereal production actually increased by 42 per cent over the same period.  This was due to the changing structure of production and an increase in productivity. Given a return to normal weather conditions, I am convinced that the level of efficiency which now exists will help to offset to some extent the reduced area under cereals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="194" /> I am nevertheless concerned that the area under cereals in 1994 was below that which was necessary simply to take account of our setaside obligations.</P>
    <P>To ensure that cereal production can recover to a level which will bring us close to self-sufficiency it will be necessary for producers to use our full base area.  Given that it is not possible to offer incentives to growers to expand their areas, nor to waive the set-aside requirements, I have been looking at how the existing arrangements might be adjusted to remove elements which tend to discourage optimum use of our base area.  The eligible land rule is a major factor in that problem.  This restricts production of cereals to specific areas which historically were used for tillage. This is an unnecessary restriction in addition to the national base area limit which also applies under the area payments system.</P>
    <P>I have already raised some ideas with Commissioner Fischler aimed at having the eligible land rule modified.  Following consultations with all interested parties, I am now following this up with a formal submission to the Commission. In addition to putting forward proposals to modify the eligible land rule, this submission also seeks the waiving of unpaid penalty set-aside which would apply if the national base area were to be exceeded.  I will be pursuing these requests with Commissioner Fischler as a matter of priority.</P>
    <P>A recent change by the EU Commission in the eligible land rules, which allows the substitution of eligible land with ineligible land in certain circumstances is at present under examination in my Department with a view to the drawing up of criteria which can be used in order to avail of this facility.  It is the intention that the necessary arrangements will be announced in advance of the autumn sowing season.  This increased flexibility in the eligible land rule is a step in the right direction and will undoubtedly ease the situation on some farms.  It is not, however, a total solution to the problems posed by the eligible land requirements and, as I have <Col N="195" /> said, further solutions are being actively pursued with the Commission.</P>
    <P>In summary, in response to the question by Deputy Cowen, while I am concerned at the drop in cereal production over the past year, I am satisfied that this situation can be attributed to a large extent to exceptional weather conditions. Given a return to normal cropping conditions I am convinced that the trend of the past two years can be substantially reversed.</P>
    <P>In so far as the area under cereals is concerned there is no doubt that the eligible land requirement poses a threat to the greater utilisation of our base area.  The measures which have already been taken or which are being pursued to resolve this problem are the facility to exchange eligible land with ineligible land which will be available from next year and the modification of the eligible land requirement which is being pursued as a matter of priority with the EU Commission.  These changes to the existing CAP reform rules would undoubtedly help to achieve an increase in the utilisation of our national base area and in production of cereals.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his comprehensive reply, but it does not reflect the sense of crisis in the tillage sector.  Serious concern has been expressed by specialised tillage farmers about the need for an immediate change in the eligible land criteria.  At present specific areas are designated for tillage purposes and unless changes are made in this area many people who rely on the conacre system cannot obtain land to sow tillage crops.  That is the reason for the huge decrease in tillage crops. Does the Minister agree there is a crisis in this area?  Does he agree the malting barley sector cannot survive if it has to import corn?  Unless a change is made in the eligible land criteria, we will witness extinction of the tillage sectors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree there is reason for concern about this matter.  The Government has been in office for only <Col N="196" /> ten weeks and already we have taken major steps in Brussels to deal with the matter.  This crisis has been signalled for some time.  As a person who comes from a county that produces cereals, the Minister will play a significant role in ensuring that cereal farmers are not abandoned.  If it is possible to make improvements in the eligible land criteria, that will be done.  I agree the criteria are very restrictive and unfair considering that only land that was under tillage from 1 January 1987 to 31 December 1991 is eligible for cereal purposes.  That is a matter that must be addressed.  We are aware of the problem and are trying to deal with it.  It did not arise today or yesterday; it has been signalled for some time but unfortunately not much action was taken and we hope to rectify that position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately every time one asks a question after a change of Government one is told it has not been long in office.  The Minister has responsibility in this matter.  If a person ploughs ineligible land they will not get arable aid.  The malting barley sector is crying out for immediate action, otherwise that industry will be severely hit, as will poultry and pig producers.  These people will be put in a more uncompetitive position as a result of having to use imported foodstuffs.  The whole animal foodstuff industry will be put at risk unless this matter is dealt with.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry</askee>
      <Quest>if he has satisfied himself that cattle prices to farmers will not be affected by the recent change in control of the Goodman Group and associated companies; if his attention has been drawn to the dominant position held by this group in the Irish meat export industry in the past before it went into examinership; and the steps, if any, he proposes to take to prevent the operation of a cartel in cattle-buying in this couuntry if the present live export trade were to decline or disappear.</Quest>
      <QRef>[6512/95]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no reason to believe that the recent change in control of the Goodman Group and associated companies will have any effect on cattle prices.  The position is that the change of ownership has not increased the company's share of the beef market.  Indeed, the company's share of the beef market has declined from just over 30 per cent of cattle slaughterings at meat export premises in the early 1990s to 25 per cent in 1994.  I should point out that two prohibition orders relating to the Goodman Group in 1990 effectively permitted the group to increase its market share to 38 per cent and, while this was never achieved in practice, such a level was not seen then as a matter of concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the possible operation of a cartel in cattle buying in the event of a decline in the live export trade, I would refer the Deputy to the reply of my colleague, Deputy Richard Bruton, Minister for Enterprise and Employment, to the Adjournment Debate on 15 March 1995.  The cattle and beef trade is extremely buoyant at present because <Col N="198" /> of a substantial decline in beef production in the European Union and the elimination of intervention stocks.  This favourable situation is likely to persist for the foreseeable future.  The live export trade to third countries is not at risk and should continue to provide strong competition for the meat plants.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister of State aware that when there was not a significant live export trade in the past there was a cartel for the purchase of cattle here and farmers suffered very severely from it; that there is always the prospect of this happening again particularly if the present live export trade were to decline or disappear, as is possible since it is based on factors outside our control? Is the Minister further aware that the prohibition orders of 1990 were made for the purpose of getting the company concerned to dispose of certain factories under its control and not for the purpose of allowing it to build up additional market share?  Has he satisfied himself that those prohibition orders have been complied with?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Concern had been expressed for many years about the dominant position of the Goodman Group in the beef industry, particularly in the context of anti-competitive practices, but the reality is that there has never been any evidence that the group used that position to control cattle prices.  This may have been due to the fact that while the group was the dominant player in the beef sector it was never in a position to dictate cattle prices.  The Goodman Group never slaughtered more than 31 per cent of all cattle slaughtered in meat export premises. When all cattle disposals, including slaughterings in local abattoirs and live exports are taken into account, Good-man's share of the cattle trade never exceeded 24 per cent.  Its current share is 17 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The two prohibition orders relating to the Goodman Group in 1990 &mdash; when Deputy O'Malley was in Government &mdash; were designed to prevent the group <Col N="199" /> from increasing market share of cattle slaughterings at meat export premises from 31 per cent to 42 per cent. However, these orders effectively permitted the group to increase its market share to 38 per cent although in any event its market share never exceeded 31 per cent.</P>
    <P>There is far less justification now than in the past for concern about the dominant position of the Goodman Group in the cattle-beef industry.  In the first place the change of ownership has not affected the market share of the group. Its share of cattle slaughtering has declined from just over 30 per cent in the years 1990-92 to 25 per cent in 1994. Similarly the group's share of total cattle disposals has declined in the same period from 24 per cent to 17 per cent.</P>
    <P>The beef sector is extremely buoyant because of the substantial fall in beef production in the European Union in recent years and the elimination of intervention stocks.  This has led to very strong competition in the industry and for most of the past 18 months cattle prices have been higher than in the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>The live export trade to third countries provides considerable competition for the meat plants.  This favourable market situation is likely to be maintained for the foreseeable future, and there is no reason to believe that Goodman will be in a position to dictate cattle prices.  Apart from the live export trade there are after all some 17 other beef companies operating in the beef sector and these are strategically dispersed throughout the country.</P>
    <P>The question of what action the Department might take to prevent the operation of a cartel in the event of the live export trade being discontinued is hypothetical.  There is no immediate risk to the live export trade to third countries. This trade has not been subjected to the same degree of criticism from welfare activists as has trade to the Continent. In any event any cartel arrangements or lack of competition between beef plants is a matter to be dealt with <Col N="200" /> under competition legislation and that is a matter for the Minister for Enterprise and Employment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Never, Sir, did a modest supplementary evoke such a lengthy prepared reply.  I am almost out of breath having listened to all of what has been read out.</P>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the Goodman Group as defined by him and by the Minister for Enterprise and Employment does not include the Master Meats Group as it is known, even though that group was found to be under the control of the Goodman Group, and that, therefore, the figures he is now quoting are not appropriate or accurate?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department is happy with this arrangement which, from the evidence we have, will benefit the industry.  As regards arrangements with other companies, that is not in the question to which I am replying, and I am answering the question the Deputy tabled.  If he feels that there are other aspects to the issue he should put down a question and I will reply to it.  There was a recent announcement that a consortium led by Larry Goodman has bought the banks' interest &mdash; incidentally this arrangement dilutes Good-man's influence.  I am confident that this new arrangement will benefit the farmers and will be good for the industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether the Minister of State misunderstands me.  He invited me to put down a separate question but I have tabled a question about the group and its associated companies.  These are the associated companies.  I put it to him that the figures he is quoting are incorrect because he is not taking account of the companies that are effectively controlled by this group but which ostensibly do not legally constitute part of the group.  Therefore the figures he has given in the reply are inappropriate, to put it at its mildest. I put it to the Minister of State that it <Col N="201" /> does not take account of the experience on the ground when there was a cartel operating at marts for the purchase of cattle and farmers suffered severely. That situation can arise again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not here to defend the Goodman Group but it must be said that it paid exceptional prices for cattle and paid on the day.  If the Deputy describes that as a cartel, it was certainly a cartel for the benefit of farmers. On the question of other arrangements I do not have the information today.  I am satisfied that the recent announcement that the Goodman Group will be taking over the banks' interest will be good for the industry, I am convinced time will prove me right.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may not be satisfied with the reply but the general thrust of it is that the Department, the Minister and I are quite happy that this arrangement will be beneficial.  If there are lessons to be learned we certainly learned them from a very expensive beef tribunal report.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12, 20 and 122 together.</P>
      <P>In my replies to questions on 24 January and 16 February last, I indicated the position generally in relation to Leader II at that time.  The position is that negotiations with the European Commission on the implementation of Leader II in Ireland have been completed and the Commission's approval of our programme is imminent.</P>
      <P>In the meantime I am completing my assessment of the business plans of the 48 applicant groups, taking account of the report of the independent consultants engaged to assist me in this task.  I expect to be able to make an announcement about the groups being selected for the new programme in the next few weeks.  For that reason, it would be inappropriate for me to comment on any particular group at this stage.  In the case of Leader I groups, we have already agreed that their necessary administrative cost from 1 January will be eligible for Leader funding in the event of their selection for the new programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As indicated in reply to previous <Col N="203" /> questions, the European Commission originally allocated £37 million to Ireland for Leader II.  This was supplemented by a further £17 million from a reserve of £64 million provided for the implementation of all the Community initiatives in Ireland.  This EU funding of £54 million will be topped up with a significant Exchequer contribution which will be announced shortly.  At the mid-term review, I will press for additional resources from the reserve still retained by the Commission.  It should also be borne in mind, of course, that on top of the EU and national public funding for Leader II, private matching investment on a similar scale will be available.  In addition, considerable resources will also be available in rural areas under the local development programme.</P>
    <P>I am well aware of the keen interest in our rural communities in Leader II and I have made it my business since coming into office to meet representatives of the various applicant groups.  I look forward to working with the successful groups over the next few years when I am confident that the successes of the first programme will be built on.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the momentum built up as a result of the successful Leader I programme is waning due to the time lapse between Leader I and II?  When will the announcement be made?  When he talks about significant Exchequer funding does he mean funding in the region of £100 million will be provided which is what is expected by the Leader groups? When did the independent consultants report to him?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am doing my best to get a solution to Leader II and announce the succesful groups.  A decision from the EU is imminent.  I went to the EU some weeks ago to resolve difficulties which we were unaware of earlier.  I am glad to say these have been resolved and we expect an announcement to be made, hopefully <Col N="204" /> this week.  A submission will be made to Government in the next few weeks recommending the successful groups and I hope the Government will respond quickly.  The definitive level of Exchequer funding will be announced when the selection of the groups is announced.  The momentum built up by Leader I has not been lost.  The fact that Leader II groups came together has created its own momentum.  They are engaged in other activities and are not waiting for Leader II funding.  I agree with the Deputy that Leader II is an important initiative and there is a lot of interest in it in rural communities.  I am very impressed by the groups I met and optimistic about the success of Leader II.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>What percentage of the 48 groups which applied under Leader II does the Minister expect to be in a position to assist?  While the quality of the business plans is a major criterion and a necessary one for assessment will he ensure there is a geographical spread so that there is a proper rural development programme under Leader II?  Will Leader I groups be discriminated against because they began rural development programmes and many require funding under Leader II to make a success of what they set out to achieve?  Will the Minister of State give the date on which the independent consultants reported to him?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>We hope to select 35 groups out of the 47 applicants.  In some cases there was duplication and overlap. There is no question of Leader I groups being discriminated against under the Leader II programme.  Each application is assessed on its merits.  Reference to Leader I will not be taken into account in determining whether a group is capable of carrying out the Leader II programme. I hope all the Leader I groups will be included.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report by McIver consultants was issued about four weeks ago.  Departmental officials carried out an analysis of the various applications and are in <Col N="205" /> the process of producing a final report. Generally they agree with the consultants' report which will be submitted to the Government.  I am relying on the expertise of the departmental officials and on the consultants involved to decide on the best groups.  Political involvement in the programme must be kept to a minimum particularly as regards deciding which groups should be chosen, who should be on the board or the amount of funding they should receive.  Decisions must be left to the groups.  It is a community driven scheme and its control evaluation must be left in the hands of communities.</P>
    <P>At departmental level we must ensure that the scheme is properly implemented and that the money is spent wisely.  I am confident that the groups will make a success of Leader II because they are well constituted and representative of their communities.  I look forward to the programme being put in place as soon as possible.  It will be an important instrument in the development of future rural policy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister saying that the recommendations of the independent consultancy group will dictate which 35 groups will be chosen and that the Minister will not have any discretion in the matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the manner in which I hope it will proceed.  There will also be a cross analysis by Department officials who have been dealing with the various Leader I groups during the past three years.  Those officials have close ties with those groups and are aware of what is happening.  I hope that is the best way to proceed to ensure and preserve the integrity of the Leader programme.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13 and 139 together.</P>
      <P>Since being launched on 1 September 1994 a total of 11,754 applications have been received under the control of farm pollution scheme and 2,883 under the dairy hygiene scheme.  A total of 2,779 and 535 approvals respectively have issued.  This represents 23 per cent of the total applications received to date.</P>
      <P>Applications under the various schemes are dealt with in order of receipt subject to good operational practices.  The average processing period for the rural environment protection scheme is five to eight weeks.  Because of the volume of applications received under the pollution and dairy hygiene schemes processing is of the order of 16 to 18 weeks.</P>
      <P>To date claims in respect of works completed under CFP totalling £1.6 million have been paid.  A further £400,000 will be paid in the next two weeks.</P>
      <P>Every effort is being made within the resources available to process applications as quickly as possible and I am at present reviewing the situation in regard to the investment aid schemes to see how the processing of applications can be expedited.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. H. Byrne Mr. H. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister of State indicate why no applications have been accepted since 12 December last?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="207" /> What practical use are the promises of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Yates, of an improved departmental service if at the beginning of this month 80 per cent of all applications were pending?  The position has not improved much since.  Will the Minister of State comment on the position in some areas where farmers are being told they will have to wait until next year for approval of a CFP grant?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no embargo, of which I am aware, on the receipt of applications for grants in any office.  If an embargo is in place in some offices, I would appreciate the Deputy informing me which offices are involved.  I accept there is a large number of applicants. The Department is under pressure owing to a shortage of clerical staff and the processing of applications in some offices has been delayed.  The personnel section of the Department is endeavouring to resolve the problem.  Because of a shortage of field staff the rate of approval of applications in some counties is slower than normal.  The staffing problem is being addressed by the personnel section and should be resolved shortly.  This scheme has been successful and has aroused a good deal of interest but departmental staff cannot cope with the large number of applications being received.  There is no question of refusing applications at this stage or of any embargo.  Applications are being accepted in the normal way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to differ with the Minister of State on that.  However, I stand to be corrected and perhaps he will check the facts.  Will he admit that <Col N="208" /> the real reason the Minister and his Department are on a go-slow in respect of payments under these environmentally vital schemes is that he is effectively using the funding for the schemes as an interest free loan at the expense of farmers in order to make ends meet in the Department?  What the Minister, Deputy Yates, delicately referred to as &ldquo;strategic management of grant scheme funding&rdquo; is effectively the use of money that should be in farmers' pockets to fund his publicity-driven political agenda.  Will the Minister of State indicate if the farmers will be paid what is rightfully theirs?  I agree that a great number of people have shown an interest in those schemes, but a corresponding number of grants have not been paid out under them.</P>

      <P>I have listened to the Deputy on several occasions trying to shout down other Ministers.  Overall this scheme has been successful and that is <Col N="209" /> probably why we are suffering as we received such a large amount of applications. We will do our best to ensure that applicants' applications are processed as soon as possible and if there is a shortfall in money, which may occur, as these schemes are likely to be oversubscribed, we will have to secure more funding for them from the reserve in 1997 when it will come up for review.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. H. Byrne Mr. H. Byrne">

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State will be aware from agricultural journal articles in recent weeks that serious concern has been raised about the administration of these two schemes.  He is aware that eligibility for REPS is not available until those schemes have been processed.  We have talked about the importance of environmentally sensitive farming and the availability and importance of REPS but, on the admission of the Minister of State, two schemes contingent for eligibility purposes for REPS are not being processed in a manner satisfactory to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We heard in the first flush of enthusiasm about the need for a farmers' charter and so on, all laudable aspirations, but we are now getting to the crux of the issue.  The Minister of State said the schemes are successful, farmers are interested in them and have applied under them, but the Department is not providing the resources or personnel to adequately complete inspections, approve applications and arrange for payment.  Is that not the position on the admission of the Minister of State?  His admission was honest.  It is welcome to hear Ministers admit there are problems in the administration of sections of their Departments.  These two schemes, in which there is great interest, are not being adequately administered for a number of reasons.  However, the bottom line is that approvals are not being made because inspections cannot be <Col N="210" /> carried out as adequate resources are not being made available by the Department to allow staff deal with the huge workload which we, having talked to personnel in local offices dealing with this matter, are all aware exists.  While we do not expect the overall position could be improved overnight we would expect the Minister, having acknowledged that a serious problem exists, to inform us what precise plans he has to improve it?  Has the Minister of State or the Minister, Deputy Yates, any plans to relocate staff temporarily to carry out these inspections?  These are all critical questions.  While we all agree that the scheme is successful, that people are interested, we want the Minister to state what administrative arrangements he will make to cater for this huge interest because the Department cannot accommodate the present interest in these schemes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, the personnel section of the Department is endeavouring to resolve the problem and hope to augment the number of field officers available.  Deputies Cowen and Hugh Byrne referred somewhat cynically to the charter of farmers' rights, in respect of which additional field officers will be required to investigate applications to ensure farmers will not have to wait too long for investigation.  Everything possible will be done to have applications under this scheme investigated as soon as possible so that applicants will not be subjected to undue delays.  This is not the first time there has been a delay in grant application approvals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. H. Byrne Mr. H. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no intention of trying to shout down the Minister of State.  Neither Deputy Cowen nor I <Col N="211" /> were cynical.  We are questioning promises given by the Minister of State and his senior colleague, Deputy Yates.  We want to know precisely what is happening. What the Minister of State said will give farmers little solace.  He was asked precisely what his Department is doing and, as far as I can ascertain, he does not propose to do anything other than request existing personnel to carry on with the task already assigned them. If the Minister will not do anything about approving applications for this vital environmental scheme, what will he do to redress the balance in my county, where two out of 57 dairy hygiene grants and 55 out of 231 control of farmyard pollution scheme grants were approved recently?  We all agree there is tremendous interest in the scheme but because of scarcity of departmental personnel and probably because the public generally do not believe in ministerial promises, private companies are now being established to prepare such plans.  Will the Minister say whether these companies are being harassed by his Department, to put them out of existence, or are they being encouraged?  I should like a straight answer to that question.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 14 and 123 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware that the work levels in the farm development offices have increased with the introduction of the farm retirement scheme and REPS.  My Department is currently reviewing the allocation of personnel in this area.  This review will be completed in a matter of weeks and appropriate measures taken to maintain an efficient service.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister of State aware that a short time ago his senior Minister, Deputy Yates, promised an increase in the number of personnel whereas the Minister of State is now telling us he has requested his Department to review those numbers?  What is the position?  Is what the Minister Deputy Yates promised another broken promise?  Will his Department accept farming plans drawn up by private companies established nationwide?</P>

      <P>Had the Deputy been listening he would have heard that I said, as did the Minister in the course of his last Question Time, our Department is currently reviewing the allocation of staff in this area.  Surely Deputy Hugh Byrne knows there is a large number of private consultants preparing REPS plans which are quite acceptable to my Department; indeed, those companies are playing an important role overall in the administration of that scheme; they were established to undertake this task and are acceptable.  The administration of the REPS programme has created a large number of jobs for young graduates, a number of whom I have met, who would not otherwise have obtained any.  The scheme is being very successful in that aspect also.  Such private consultants are very much part of the overall scheme and accepted as such by my Department.</P>

      <P>A corporate plan is being developed by Teagasc to set the direction of the research, training and advisory services for the period up to 1999 including its staffing requirements for that period.  In this context agreement has been reached in principle on a substantial new blood recruitment programme.

Teagasc sought authority to create 83 posts during 1995.  Some 44 posts were provisionally agreed on 8 March last, 13 on the advisory side, 28 for research and three for education and training.

      <P>I am grateful to the Minister for outlining the performance of the former Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Joe Walsh, last year in arranging for 57 new appointments to Teagasc, even though the total complement sought was 83.  I note that 44 were appointed on 8 March 1994.  On assuming office the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry made a specific arrangement, quite apart from any general view taking place, that 19 new staff would be appointed to Teagasc as part of a new blood programme.  It was one of the new initiatives but he did not mention that 57 new staff were appointed by the former Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Joe Walsh, last year.  Apart from the appointments made last year what is the status of the statement made by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Yates, that 90 new appointments would be made?  Has he sanctioned 90 new appointments for Teagasc as stated in his first week in <Col N="216" /> office?  Are we to take it that the 90 aspirational staff will be part of the general review?

      <P>I propose taking Questions Nos. 16 and 114 together.</P>
      <P>It is important to clarify that the level of bovine tuberculosis in Ireland is at a low level &mdash; over 99 per cent of the seven million animals in the national herd are clear of this disease.  The remaining incidence is essentially residual infection.  At low levels, progress in achieving further reduction in infection is generally slow.  I am continuing to place emphasis on improving the efficiency of the programme including the refocusing of resources towards research designed to overcome technical barriers and so progress towards full eradication.</P>
      <P>The net operational costs of the bovine tuberculosis and brucellosis eradication programmes at the end of 1994 was £349.5 million, details of which are included in the following table which I will circulate in the Official Report.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="219" /> Because of accounting mechanisms it is not possible to readily separate the exact expenditure on bovine TB.  The bulk of brucellosis testing is carried out in conjunction with TB testing and is estimated to cost annually about one sixth of the combined expenditure.  It is necessary to highlight that, as recognised in an independent analysis, the bovine tuberculosis eradication scheme has been beneficial in protecting market access for our agricultural exports and that the costs involved in operating the scheme have been outweighed by the benefits.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. E. Byrne Mr. E. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  Will he agree that the attempt to eradicate TB from the national herd is an ongoing scandal in the history of agriculture and probably runs second to the Larry Goodman episode?  Will he tell the House, and perhaps allay the fears of hard pressed PAYE taxpayers, that if we are spending £60 million in an attempt to eradicate TB from the national herd why it has not been 100 per cent successful given comparative figures for other EU national herds where there has been complete eradication of TB?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the traditionally held view that the Exchequer and taxpayer is footing the bill for the TB eradication scheme, this has been only partially accurate in recent years. The position is that farmers pay two thirds of the £42 million annual operating costs of the TB and brucellosis eradication schemes by way of direct levy amounting to some £30 million annually.  It is also important to recognise that the annual rounds of testing are essential to protect our trading position in beef and dairy products.  We would all wish to see total eradication but we must recognise that we have a very high health status in our national herd.  Nevertheless we will have to strive for total eradication.  I hope we can put the mechanisms in place, with the IVU, to ensure that happens.  I have asked the IVU to co-operate with me to ensure a <Col N="220" /> reduction in the levels of TB and brucellosis which are low but, as the Deputy said, compared with other EU countries such as Denmark and the Netherlands &mdash; where TB has been almost eliminated &mdash; they could be considered high.  While we have a high health status there is room for improvement. Certainly I will do my utmost, in co-operation with the IVU, to ensure further progress is made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. H. Byrne Mr. H. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that 99 per cent of the herd is TB free but, according to the Minister's figures, it will be costly to eradicate TB in the remaining 1 per cent.  Given that we have been working to eradicate TB for the past 30 years, will the Minister say who he considers to be at fault for the failure to totally eradicate the disease?  Does he agree that the fault lies with a number of sectors, for example, farmers who are refusing to implement some of the regulations, cowboy cattle dealers and farmers who have engaged in the notorious practice of switching herds over border lines &mdash; in the past some of these people were successfully prosecuted by the Department &mdash; and vets who can earn huge sums of money from the continuation of the programme?  The taxpayer has not been given a fair return by the agricultural sector for the money spent on this programme during the past 30 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>It may not be possible to completely eradicate TB from the cattle herd.  In 1965 the Minister for Agriculture, Mr. Haughey, declared Ireland a TB free zone.  The incidence of TB increased during the intervening period and in 1991 approximately 4 per cent of every 1,000 animals was infected. A number of reasons have been given for the failure to totally eradicate TB, for example, the methods of testing, the growing resistance to tuberculin and the ability of wildlife to transmit the disease to bovines.  All these factors must be seriously addressed as they can contribute to the spread of TB.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have read a number of articles on <Col N="221" /> our failure to make progress in this area and I hope a deliberate effort can be made with the co-operation of the IVU and other interests to eradicate TB.  The EU has offered funding of £4.5 million to assist us in our TB eradication programme contingent on agreement with the IVU on a rotation system.  I hope the IVU will accept the EU Commission proposal that there should be one-third rotation in this round of testing.  I hope this method will enable us to take out more reactors, thereby making the scheme more effective.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Deputy put down this question as there is widespread concern about this among the farming population who are paying a large percentage of the operating costs of the programme. I hope we can make progress in this area during the next two years with the co-operation and agreement of the IVU.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that the charges made by Deputy Byrne that some farmers are not abiding by the regulations are totally unfounded on the basis that the biggest contributors to the scheme are farmers and that in recent years they have strongly lobbied for effective mechanisms which will completely eradicate TB from the cattle herd?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the Deputy's point.  It is very unfair to blame farmers who are very responsible and conscious of the health status of their herds for the failure to achieve 100 per cent eradication. Some farmers have lost their livelihoods as a result of TB and brucellosis and it is not in their interests to refuse to abide by the regulations.  The number of cowboy farmers or cattle dealers is exceptionally low.  Most farmers have a responsible attitude to their herds and the Deputy was probably exaggering when he made his point about them.</P>

      <P>Given the widely accepted belief that the badger plays a major role in transmitting TB to cattle, <Col N="222" /> will the Minister say what action has been taken in this area and whether any vaccine for badgers has been developed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Consideration is being given to the use of a vaccine and I understand some progress has been made in this area.  One must get a licence from the Office of Public Works to kill badgers and any eradication programme must operate in conjuction with a programme to control wildlife if it is to be totally effective.  If we are to have an effective programme, consideration must be given to the control of wildlife.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Byrne</NameTxt>

      <P>Given that we have one of the worst records in Europe in TB eradication, will the Minister look at the programmes in other countries which have a TB free status?  Our bad record in this area is causing damage to our trade.  Obviously there are weaknesses within the Department and no-one should blame the farming community who are genuinely concerned about this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards the comparison with other countries, it has been said that we have a higher incidence of TB and are taking out more reactors because we are so diligent in tackling the disease while other countries may not be so diligent.  That being said, our objective must be to achieve the levels in Denmark, the Netherlands and most <Col N="223" /> of Great Britain.  As long as I have responsibility for the TB eradication programme I will strive relentlessly to bring our standards up to the European average.</P>

      <P>I wish to advise the House of the following matters in respect of which notice has been given under Standing Order 20 and the name of the Member in each case: (1) Deputy Noel Ahern &mdash; the privatisation of the local loans fund; and the short and long term effect it will have on the financial operation and future funding of capital projects by local authorities; (2) Deputy Connor &mdash; the need for additional funds to be allocated for the road network in County Roscommon in view of damage caused by exceptionally heavy rainfall in recent months; (3) Deputy P.

    <Title>Package Holidays and Travel Trade Bill, 1995: Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Stagg) Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Stagg)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Stagg)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The main purpose of this Bill is to transpose EU Council Directive No. 90/314/EEC on package travel, package holidays and package tours into Irish law.  The Bill will also amend certain provisions of the Transport (Tour Operators and Travel Agents) Act, 1982.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The directive is one of a number of measures adopted by the EU aimed at protecting the consumer in the travel and tourism sectors.  In addition to the <Col N="315" /> directive on package travel, other legislation adopted covers airline computerisation systems and the overbooking of airline seats, and the provision of unbiased information to air travel sales desks.</P>
    <P>The legislation has been introduced in view of the fact that national laws and international regulatory developments are the major influences on travel and tourism services and because significant differences in consumer protection can exist from one member state to another.</P>
    <P>The EU directive on package travel was designed to harmonise aspects of national provisions relating to travel in the Union and thereby improve protection for the consumer.  Package holidays form a fundamental part of tourism, but the laws governing these packages vary considerably between member states. These disparities in national practices give rise to obstacles to the freedom to provide services in the field of packages and package travel.</P>
    <P>The directive aims to stimulate greater growth in the package travel industry by removing these disparities, thus enabling consumers in the European Union to benefit from comparable conditions when buying a package in any member state.</P>
    <P>The directive makes a significant contribution to the protection of consumers and completion of the internal market by laying down common rules and a common framework for holiday packages in all member states.</P>
    <P>The Bill sets out the ground rules for regulating the travel contract, the security to be provided by the package provider in the event of insolvency and amends certain provisions of the Transport (Tour Operators and Travel Agents) Act, 1982.  The main provisions of the Bill relate to: the accuracy, clarity and content of brochures and other promotional material about packages; the information to be provided by the organiser and-or the retailer to the consumer about the package, both before the conclusion of the contract and the start of the package; the liberty of the <Col N="316" /> consumer to transfer bookings to a willing third person; the rules concerning the alteration or cancellation of a package, for example, the price of the package cannot be changed except where the contract specifically provides for this; the essential features of the contract and the responsibilities of organisers and retailers for the performance of the contract; the security to be provided by the package provider in the event of insolvency, to enable the stranded holiday maker to be returned to the point of departure, or, in the event of the holiday not having commenced, to be refunded moneys paid over; and the elimination of certain anomalies in the Transport (Tour Operators and Travel Agents) Act, 1982 which have come to notice in the light of experience.  As is standard practice, the Bill provides that breaches of specific provisions will be offences, either summary or indictable, depending on the gravity of the offence.</P>
    <P>On the provisions relating to the regulation of the travel contract, a consumer buying a package holiday is in the vulnerable position of paying in full in advance for a product almost entirely on the basis of descriptions of the product contained in a holiday brochure. Intending purchasers of pre-arranged packages will now be able to place greater reliance on the descriptions in the brochure.</P>
    <P>Package organisers will not be able to make exaggerated claims about holidays as they will have to be able to stand over any advance descriptions given in brochures. In addition, the brochure must also contain general information about passport and visa requirements which apply to the purchase of the package and health formalities required for the journey and stay.</P>
    <P>The information to be provided by the organiser before the start of the package must include the name, address and telephone number of the representative or agent of the organiser at the holiday location, or, if there is no such representative or agency, a telephone number which will enable the consumer to contact the organiser or retailer.  This <Col N="317" /> provision is reasonable.  If a consumer gets into difficulties it is only right and proper that he or she should be able to contact some representative of the organiser to provide assistance.</P>
    <P>There has been much discussion as to what precisely will constitute a package holiday under the new Bill.  It defines a package as a combination of at least two of the following components; transport; accommodation; other tourist services accounting for a significant proportion of the package.  The many people providing bed and breakfast accommodation in guesthouses throughout the country are not covered unless the accommodation is being offered by the guesthouse owner as part of a larger pre-arranged package which includes some other significant element.  The combination required to constitute a &ldquo;package&rdquo; must be pre-arranged by the organiser when sold or offered for sale at an inclusive price and must cover a period of more than 24 hours or include overnight accommodation.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Ad hoc</i> arrangements made by travel agents specifically for individual customer's requirements do not come within the scope of the proposed legislation. For example, if somebody, say a business person, walks into a travel agency and asks the agent for a flight to London and to book a particular hotel, this does not constitute a package.  If, however, the travel agent advertises a weekend in London, which includes flight and accommodation, this would be pre-arranged and would constitute a package.</P>
    <P>The Directive is not as exact as it might have been in clarifying what precisely constitutes a package.  However, the number of possible booking scenarios is legion.  It would be completely impossible for any legislation, no matter how detailed, to cover all the possible combinations.  I understand the Director of Consumer Affairs, who will police the legislation when enacted, has suggested that his office will draw up guidelines in conjunction with the travel industry on what constitutes a package. This would be helpful in the interests of <Col N="318" /> greater clarity and I would welcome such an initiative.</P>
    <P>One of the main features is that the Bill will make the organiser of a package holiday primarily responsible for the proper performance of the obligations arising out of the contract.  I am aware that there is much concern in the travel trade industry regarding the extent to which organisers could be held liable to the consumer following the implementation of this legislation.  In this regard, I would like to clarify that the retailer's liability to their customers will not be dramatically increased following the Bill's enactment.  Under the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act, 1980, the seller, or retailer in the case of the travel trade, is already responsible in almost all cases for the performance of their side of the contract. The effect of the Bill will be to place responsibility on the organiser similar to that which is already on the retailer under the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act.</P>
    <P>As the legislation is a consumer protection measure, the Director of Consumer Affairs will have the primary role in enforcing it.  The Bill will operate in addition to the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act, 1980 and the director is, given his other responsibilities in the field of consumer legislation, the appropriate competent authority to police this area.</P>
    <P>There has also been some speculation that the new legislation will make the organiser liable for any or all the damage suffered by the consumer.  This is not the case.  Section 20 makes it clear that the organiser will not be responsible if the failure to perform the contract or its improper performance is not due to the fault of the organiser or the retailer or another supplier of services. If, for example, the consumer suffers damage entirely due to his or her own negligence, then the organiser would clearly not be liable.  In the event of a claim about failure to perform the contract, or improper performance, the specific conditions of the contract pertaining to the package would have to be <Col N="319" /> taken into account in each case in determining the organiser's liability, if any.</P>
    <P>It is important to note that this Bill encompasses, in addition to travel agents and tour operators, everybody who organises or sells packages, such as carriers and hotels.  The exception to this are organisers who organise and sell packages on an occasional basis who are excluded from the provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Following the enactment of the legislation, I will introduce regulations specifying precisely the classes of persons who are deemed to be acting occasionally as package organisers.  Examples of such classes would be community, social, sporting or voluntary organisations which organise domestic packages as part of the general objectives of that organisation; schools or educational institutions which organise packages; religious or denominational groups which organise packages involving a pilgrimage; and packages organised by charities or benevolent institutions in pursuit of the objectives of that body</P>
    <P>This exemption will apply to home packages only.  The organisation and sale of packages abroad will continue to come within the provisions of the Transport (Tour Operators and Travel Agents) Act, 1982, whether occasional or regular.</P>
    <P>I emphasise again that this is consumer protection legislation.  One of its main purposes is to ensure that the consumer can, without difficulty, seek redress from the supplier.  I am satisfied organiser in the event of improper performance of the contract.  Should this improper performance be the fault of a supplier of services, the retailer and&mdash; or organiser will be able to seek legal redress from that supplier.  I am satisfied that the availability of legal redress to the consumer in respect of improper performance of a contract and the penalties for non-provision of information about a package or the provision of misleading information will eliminate any cowboys seeking to operate in the travel trade. <Col N="320" /> I am aware that concern has been expressed regarding the safety of Irish holidaymakers overseas.  There have been causes of tragic accidents abroad in recent years resulting in injuries and the death of Irish holidaymakers.  While these have, fortunately, been small in number relative to the numbers holidaying abroad, I fully understand the concerns raised.</P>
    <P>This Bill provides, in line with the EU directive, that where a package in a member state includes accommodation, the contract with the consumer must state the compliance of the accommodation with the laws of that member state.  This puts an onus on the package organiser to ensure that all accommodation which they provide for Irish holidaymakers is of an acceptably safe standard.</P>
    <P>The Bill also places primary responsibility for the proper fulfilment of the conditions in the contract on the organiser. Should the improper performance be the fault of the supplier of services, the retailer and &mdash; or organiser can seek legal redress from that supplier.  The provisions which I have outlined above will make it easier for consumers who have a problem with accommodation abroad to seek redress in an Irish court.</P>
    <P>I note also that, in reply to a recent question in the European Parliament, the Commission indicated that it had undertaken to study the legislation in member states dealing with services linked to the installation and maintenance of appliances burning gaseous fuels.  These appliances have been highlighted as a cause of concern in a number of tragic incidents over the past few years.</P>
    <P>This brings me to the second main area covered.  The Bill lays down the arrangements for the security of moneys paid over by consumers and the repatriation of consumers, if necessary, in the event of insolvency of the retailer or body providing the package.</P>
    <P>There are two main options.  A package provider who is a member of a body, such as a trade association, approved by the Minister to administer <Col N="321" /> bonds may provide security by means of a bond taken out with an institution, such as a bank, authorised to issue such bonds.</P>
    <P>Alternatively, security may be provided by means of an insurance policy taken out by the package provider or retailer in favour of the consumer.  As I mentioned, transport carriers, hotels and anybody organising holiday packages will come within the definition of package organiser and will have to have security against insolvency in respect of their package travel activities.</P>
    <P>The effect of this provision is to give to people holidaying in Ireland who are customers of Irish-based package organisers comparable protection to that which people going on holidays overseas enjoy under the Transport (Tour Operators and Travel Agents) Act, 1982.  It is only proper that Irish people spending their holidays at home should have this protection in the event of insolvency of the package provider or retailer.  People taking holidays in Ireland who are customers of package organisers in other EU countries will, of course, be covered by the legislation implementing the directive in those countries.</P>
    <P>Some worries have been expressed that the implementation of this Bill will affect the prices of holidays being sold.  I would like to stress that any increase in the price of package holidays will be minimal as a result of these measures.  While some extra insurance by organisers may be necessary to cover the actions of foreign suppliers of services, there should not be any need for large increases in liability insurance because there will be little change in the levels of liability already carried under the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act.</P>
    <P>There may be a small increase in holiday prices in the first year but, as the travel trade industry is a highly competitive business, I anticipate that the usual market forces will bring prices down again very quickly.  Indeed, the added benefits and security which the consumer will enjoy will more than <Col N="322" /> compensate for any small increase in prices in the short term.</P>
    <P>The new legislation will enhance even further the already high quality of the Irish travel trade industry.  It will provide a framework which will give a better quality of service and improved protection for the consumer while at the same time keeping to a minimum the potential costs for the package organiser.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned in my introductory comments, there is a third element to the Bill.  I am taking this opportunity to amend certain provisions of the Transport (Tour Operators and Travel Agents) Act, 1982 which has been the principal Act governing the sale of overseas travel.  Before turning to these amendments I would like to outline the reasons for enactment of and the philosophy underlying this Act.</P>
    <P>Deputies may be aware that prior to the introduction of the 1982 Act, the Irish travel industry operated on an unregulated basis.  In December 1980, Bray Travel Limited, then one of the largest tour operators, went out of business resulting in the loss of holiday money and the deposits of over 1,500 people and the stranding of a number of holidaymakers abroad.  There were also a number of other collapses in 1981.</P>
    <P>While voluntary bonding arrangements had been introduced by the Irish Travel Agents Association and a number of individual operators in response to these developments, it was evident that a need existed for a statutory framework to protect holidaymakers.</P>
    <P>The basic elements incorporated in the 1982 Act were: a bonding arrangement for tour operators and travel agents for the protection of their customers; a back-up travellers protection fund to be raised by contributions from tour operators and to be used where individual bonds proved inadequate; and a system of licensing to control entry to the trade.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="323" /> The Act sought to prevent failures in the trade as well as to provide remedies where failures occurred.  Consumer protection was the major motive, but the licensing and bonding elements had, as a major objective also, the imposition of certain rigours and disciplines designed to put the trade on a proper footing and in this way to seek to prevent failures. These disciplines related to the financial affairs, business and organisational resources and general fitness of applicants to hold travel agents and tour operators licences.</P>
    <P>Following the passing into law of the 1982 Act, regulations were enacted which set out in detail for the travel trade how the new procedures would operate in practice.  Contributions to the travellers protection fund were suspended in April 1987 as it was felt that there was sufficient money in the fund to deal with possible contingencies.</P>
    <P>There are, at present, 320 licensed travel agents and 55 licensed tour operators bonded under the 1982 Act.</P>
    <P>Overall, I am satisfied that the system of existing licensing and bonding has worked well over the years.  Where there have been collapses of tour operators and travel agents, customers affected have been repatriated where necessary and moneys passed to the operator or agent have been refunded. These refunds enable the customer, if they so wish, to make alternative holiday arrangements.  Apart from some minor amendments, I do not propose to change the 1982 Act.  The Bill now before the House will operate in addition to this Act and will provide added protection to the consumer.</P>
    <P>I propose to amend a number of the definitions in the Act of 1982 to make them consistent with the current Bill.</P>
    <P>The Bill will also make it clear that the provisions of the 1982 Act now apply to all travel commencing in the State to destinations outside the State or Northern Ireland.  Problems were experienced with the operation of the 1982 Act in identifying what was encompassed by overseas travel.  In particular, <Col N="324" /> the 1982 Act referred only to travel to a place outside Ireland and did not specify that the travel had to commence in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The 1982 Act excluded carriers from its licensing and bonding requirements, that is, persons whose principal business is the provision of transport.  The Bill before the House provides that carriers selling package holidays outside the State or Northern Ireland will in future require a licence from my Department. Carriers have been informed of their impending obligations under this Act.</P>
    <P>In summary, the principal benefits to the consumer of the Bill before the House are: consumers will have easier access to redress; more comprehensive and concrete information will be available; consumers will be guaranteed a minimum degree of protection; the quality of service will be improved; and there will now be provision for security against insolvency for domestic as well as outbound packages.</P>
    <P>I understand that the home holiday business generated approximately £400 million last year.  It is important to the national economy and makes a significant contribution to year round tourism. In recent years the trend has been one of steady increases in short holidays outside the peak months.  It also generates substantial employment.  Domestic tourism accounted for an estimated 20,000 jobs in the Irish economy in 1994.  I hope the protection accorded to domestic holidaymakers by this legislation will encourage more people to stay in Ireland for their holidays, generating additional business and assisting job creation.</P>
    <P>Outbound tourism is also a major business.  It is estimated that in the region of 350,000 people will take holidays abroad in 1995.  For most customers, a package holiday is a once a year experience, for which they have gone to considerable personal expense. They are entitled to a safe and enjoyable holiday which runs as smoothly as possible.</P>
    <P>Before concluding, I would like to take the opportunity to express my <Col N="325" /> appreciation of the large amount of preparatory work done on this Bill by the former Minister for Transport, Energy and Communication, Deputy Brian Cowen.  He was responsible for seeking and obtaining Government approval for the drafting of the text of the Bill and many of the initial consultations with the travel industry were held when he was Minister.  It is only proper that his contribution be acknowledged.</P>
    <P>I am happy to recommend this Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for his comprehensive speech and his detailed introduction of the Bill. It is very useful in our discussion of the Bill to have such a detailed introduction and a tracing of the history of the Bill. Also, on behalf of my colleague, Deputy Cowen, I thank the Minister of State for his kind comments in that regard.</P>
      <P>The Bill gives effect to a European Union directive on package holidays, package travel and package tours. Indeed, I may have been involved directly in that negotiation at Brussels level during my time as Minister for Tourism.  The purpose of the directive is to harmonise aspects of national provisions relating to package travel in the EU.  I accept the Bill is designed to improve protection for the consumer.  It sets out the information that has to be included in any brochure, lays out the liabilities of tour operators and travel agents and adds to the body of legislation already in existence in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A package is defined in section 2 as a combination of at least two of the following components, pre-arranged by the organiser when sold or offered for sale at an inclusive price and when the service covers a period of more than 24 hours or includes overnight accommodation; transport, accommodation, other tourist services not ancillary to transport or accommodation accounting for a significant proportion of the package. The Bill sets out the information to be provided to an intending consumer. <Col N="326" /> It lays down the ground rules for regulating the travel contract and deals with the security to be provided by the package provider in the event of insolvency. Some regulation has existed in these areas and the Minister proposes to add to them.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil will not oppose the Bill on Second Stage because of the reasons I outlined.  On Committee Stage, however, the party will propose a number of amendments designed to strengthen and perhaps clarify aspects of the Bill.  The number of amendments will depend largely on how Second Stage develops and the Minister's response to points made by Deputies on this side of the House.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil believes the Minister should allow three months after enactment of the Bill before it comes into force.  This short period will allow the travel trade to achieve compliance with the provisions.  It should be remembered that most travel agents at this stage of the year are committed to the 1995 season, and to give them a period of three months from the date of enactment of the Bill would not be unreasonable given the resources, particularly, of small travel agents.  The Minister said there are 320 bonded travel agents operating in the State.  My assessment is that two-thirds of those have a staff of no more than two or three people.  We are talking by and large about small town travel agents and I ask the Minister to consider the three month period before bringing the Bill into effect.</P>
    <P>I also ask the Minister to consider amending the definition of &ldquo;package&rdquo;, to which he referred at length, so that there is no doubt that business travel is excluded from the provisions.  That is not stated unequivocally in the Bill.  The Minister suggested that by regulation the definitions might be tightened up, but it would be more sensible if the Bill made it clear that ordinary day-to-day business travel is excluded.  I appreciate the Minister's advice that may be it is not easy to do that in drafting form, but perhaps he will consider this matter with a <Col N="327" /> view to inserting a clause to make clearer the areas that are excluded from the package.  I do not wish to refer to specific sections at this stage but I will do so on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The directive on which this Bill is based was not intended to apply in circumstances where two entities of equal bargaining power &mdash; for example, a firm and a travel agent &mdash; come together to conclude what is essentially a purely commercial contract.  There is no need for the State to interfere in such a contract between two companies with equal bargaining strength.  They are well able to look after themselves in that regard and for that reason the business to business type of travel should not be included in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The legislation should not apply to brochures already in circulation.  A substantial number of brochures have been printed and are at present in circulation, and it is not clear whether they will be included.  I do not believe the Minister wishes to include them but clarity in this regard is important.  There should be no retrospection and it is not clear from the Bill that retrospection is not intended. The meaning could be taken that the Bill will apply to brochures printed perhaps three, four or six months ago.  That would be retrospective legislation and, as a principle, such legislation has never been accepted by the House.  I do not believe that is envisaged by the Minister, but it is not clear from the legislation whether that is so.</P>
    <P>If that is the intention tour operators would have to reprint existing summer brochures and those in the process of being printed for the winter of 1995.  I know it is not the Minister's intention to disrupt the travel trade at this sensitive time of the year but to put in place additional consumer protection, which I support.  I ask him to consider aspects of the Bill from the point of view of it suddenly coming into force and applying to existing brochures.  The consequences of that to the trade would be incalculable.  Travel agents would have to throw away thousands of brochures, <Col N="328" /> thereby increasing the cost of package holidays to the consumer.</P>
    <P>Travel agents should not be liable to compensate consumers for damage caused by misleading brochures.  No doubt the Minister has received representations from travel agents on this point.  He should ensure he has top class legal advice on the issue.  I do not know whether his office consulted the Attorney General's office on this point, perhaps he will refer to that matter when concluding Second Stage.  Is the Minister asking small travel agents who employ two or three people in towns such as Maynooth to be in a position financially to compensate a consumer in circumstances where a 200 page brochure from a multinational tour operator states on page 96 that the apartment shall be 20 feet by 18 feet but instead it is 15 feet by 16 feet?</P>
    <P>It is not acceptable that the consumer should claim against a small travel agent in rural areas on foot of a misleading brochure.  I ask the Minister to consider between now and Committee Stage whether it is intended that a high street rural travel agent should be totally responsible for every sentence in a holiday brochure produced by a multinational firm.  Arguably the Minister could close down a large number of the 320 travel agents.  As I stated, of that number, about two-thirds employ only two or three people.  How can they be responsible for every line of every brochure, without the resources to check the details?  I accept that where a travel agent has the ability to recognise misleading information in a brochure, he should be liable if he does not deal with it.  Will the Minister examine again the right to compensation?  There is already a right to compensation from the organiser and I would like the Minister to consider again whether there is a need for the additional protection of compensation from the retailer and small travel agent.</P>
    <P>The legislation makes it an offence for a travel agent to supply a brochure knowing or having reasonable cause to believe it is not accurate.  It is also an <Col N="329" /> offence if a travel agent does not provide the consumer or intending consumer with proper information.  It seems, therefore, that there is no real need to make the small travel agent liable for damage caused by misleading information.  The consumer already has the right to sue the tour operator in such instances and he may not get additional comfort from being able to sue the two or three persons travel agency.  If travel agents are to be liable, it will seriously impinge on the small operators who will be liable for brochures over which they have no control.  This is the key and an area where we need legal advice.</P>
    <P>Travel agents have no control over what is in the brochure although they promote the holidays in them.  How does a person with a small travel agency check out the accuracy of a brochure? For example, if an agent in Maynooth gives out a brochure about an apartment in Athens, I do not see how he can check out and be held responsible, to the extent of having to compensate the individual, for some inadequacy in the apartment in Athens.  Will he have to get on a plane and check it out?  A two person travel agency could not do that. Is he or she to accept the assurances of the brochure producer?  If the producer of the brochure gives assurances on which the travel agent could normally depend, perhaps that would be a better route for the Minister to take.  We must consider whether we can blindly make small travel agents responsible for brochures over which they have no control and which they have no way of checking. It will be impossible for them to check every item in every brochure. Small travel agents are now being made responsible for something that passes through their hands.  Perhaps large travel agencies are a different matter but I doubt if smaller ones can handle this.</P>
    <P>We have to make sure the legislation is realistic and workable.  In theory, one should be able to sue the small travel agent if line 64 of the brochure is inaccurate; in practice, it would be very difficult, if not totally unrealistic.  A tour operator or travel agent should not have <Col N="330" /> to provide the form of the contract in writing before the contract is made in cases where an intending consumer makes a proposal 14 days before the date of departure.  In my view, the period of seven days referred to in the Bill does not allow the organiser sufficient time to comply with section 15 (1) (a). Will the Minister extend that period from seven days to 14 days because there is considerable work involved in drawing up the contract and we must remember that the small travel agent will find it extremely difficult to do that in seven days?  This applies in particular when travel contracts are concluded over the telephone and the consumer does not have a copy of the brochure or the terms of the contract in writing.  I think extending the period from seven to 14 days would not adversely affect consumer rights but would be more realistic.</P>
    <P>The Bill imposes requirements on minimum liability insurance cover.  I note what the Minister said in his speech but I believe this Bill will push up insurance costs and introduce a culture of litigation into holiday travel, the like of which we have never seen before. I make this point in the hope that the Minister will see his way to amending this provision on Committee Stage to mitigate the worse effects.  I believe this Bill will push up the cost of package holidays.  To give an example, an Irish holidaymaker may buy a package holiday to the Bahamas from an Irish tour operator, he may get food poisoning on holidays and he can then sue the hotel in the Bahamas.  Has the Minister ever tried suing a hotel in the Bahamas? That would effectively be impossible to carry through.  This provision means that the costs of outbound and inbound tour operators will increase significantly.</P>
    <P>In Germany, there is similar legislation and consumers have resorted to litigation against tour operators in cases where they have been rained out or fallen off a camel in Tunisia and suffered injury as a result.  Incredibly, a <Col N="331" /> case was brought because a holiday-maker suffered psychological stress due to the atmosphere prevailing in a holiday city.  It gives me no joy to say that this Bill is a recipe for litigation. Wait until the lawyers get their hands on it.  Under its provisions one can sue for defamation while on holiday and take a case against the local travel agent.  There is no limit under the Bill when one has suffered defamation.  I do not think it is the Minister's intention to put the culture of litigation in place but this is what happened in Germany and a number of other countries.</P>
    <P>The legislation has been fully implemented in Britain, France and the Netherlands and I have checked out what has happened.  In his speech the Minister said that some extra insurance by organisers may be necessary but the British and Dutch experience has shown that insurance costs have gone up by 40 per cent in three years.  Small operators found it impossible to get insurance and the viability of some operators was threatened because their margins were totally eroded.  The Minister should ask the local travel agent in Maynooth the effects of liability increasing by 40 per cent in three years.  A travel agent cannot afford to pay huge insurance costs on 5 per cent margins.  How will it protect the consumer if there are no travel agents operating at the lower end of the scale, allowing the larger travel agents to mop up the business?  That is not what the Minister intends.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I know it is not what the Minister intends but the British and Dutch experience has shown that it increased by 40 per cent in three years. I spoke to one large travel agent who said they expected that size of an increase.  I am not saying anyone would cry about it but it would spell the end of cheap holidays.  In his speech, the Minister of State said the added benefits and security which the consumer will <Col N="332" /> enjoy will more than compensate for any small increase in prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">

    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">

      <P>In Britain and Holland there was a 40 per cent increase in insurance costs.  Ask the travel agents whether they expect a dramatic increase in insurance as a result of this Bill and they will say &ldquo;yes&rdquo;.  It gives me no pleasure to say that.  An insurance company is asked to cover the provision of accurate information in brochures, to cover against defamation, repatriation and misleading information.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that but this legislation is an addition to existing legislation.  I take the Minister's point about the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act but if he felt there was sufficient protection for the consumer he would not need to include the retailer in this Bill.  He could say he was complying with the EU directive but clearly he does not feel that is so which is why he has brought in additional legislation.</P>
      <P>The Minister cannot have it both ways.  If he argues that the consumer is being given extra protection in this legislation then insurance costs will rise and if that is not his argument then he is not providing extra protection for consumers and insurance costs will not increase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The legislation will give rise to a dramatic increase in travel related legal cases.  Will the Minister consider some form of arbitration procedure for <Col N="333" /> claims?  If it rains all the time or someone in Spain falls into the pool having consumed too much alcohol or someone is given a brochure which does not contain the correct health information and contracts a disease, will the only remedy be to take such cases to the High Court or will there be some form of instant arbitration to deal with such cases? Some of these issues are emotional and could be dealt with quickly and coolly by an arbitrator.  Let us not forget what happened in the High Court in other jurisdictions.</P>
    <P>If small operators are forced out of business there will be less competition. Will the Minister ensure that small tour operators have access to insurance at realistic prices?  Perhaps he will see whether it is possible to package this insurance in such a way as to cover the entire trade.  The Bill should be amended so that the packages which commence within the State to destinations within the State are covered by the bonding and insurance arrangements already entered into by travel agents so as to comply with the 1982 Act which the Minister spoke about.</P>
    <P>The Minister must clarify how Part III of the Bill will impact on the small bed and breakfast operators who provide activity holidays.  Will they come under that definition of &ldquo;package&rdquo; and need written contracts and liability insurance as required by the Bill?  Is the Minister seriously asking bed and breakfast operators to provide written contracts for package holidays?</P>
    <P>My party is concerned that the words &ldquo;excluding a person who acts as an agent other than for reward&rdquo; may open a loophole which the Minister does not intend.  While it is no doubt intended for parish priests and others who organise pilgrimages it could also be used by unscrupulous operators as a way of getting around bonding.  There is a need to clarify how the Bill will impact on nonprofit making youth exchange organisations which could come under the definition of someone who &ldquo;otherwise than occasionally organises packages <Col N="334" /> and sells or offers them for sale to a customer, either directly or through a retailer&rdquo;.  As these organisations book return tickets for participants, provide accommodation with host families or in hostels and set up programmes of activities for classes they seem to fall within the Bill's definition of &ldquo;package&rdquo; although I note that the Minister will bring in regulations to make that clearer.  I support that.  As presently listed, school trips would appear to come under the definition.  These organisations could also be hit by the requirement to keep a funding reserve.  Will the Minister insert an exception clause for established bona fide youth and educational non-profit-making organisations without opening a loophole which would interfere with the travel agency business?</P>
    <P>The Bill requires intending passengers to be given information on a range of issues, including health formalities for the journey and their holiday stay. This requirement is onerous and could result in many legal actions being taken, for example, if a person contracted AIDS during a stay abroad.  The Bill requires travel agents to have expertise and confidence in health areas.  Perhaps the Minister will look at that area.  Travel agents should be able to discharge their duty by providing health information supplied or approved by the Department of Health in this or another jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>The Bill should be amended to protect the consumer in the area of advertising. Advertisements for travel and other services should include the licence number of the agent or operator.  There should be a common commencement date for the legislation in all EU countries. So far it has been implemented in full in Britain, the Netherlands and France.  If it is in force in the Republic but not implemented in another country, will the Irish operator and agent be the only one liable if a consumer has a difficulty in that other country?</P>
    <P>Broadly, I support the legislation and thank the Minister for introducing it.  I <Col N="335" /> ask him to consider my concerns regarding the wording of the legislation and see whether he can bring in appropriate amendments.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> Tiocfaidh ár lá is docha.  This is an important Bill.  Going on holiday is an important event for many people and looking forward to the holiday is often the most enjoyable part as one has the vision that everything will be beautiful.  It is not easy for an organiser and-or holidaymaker to get everything absolutely accurate.  Since we advertise ourselves as &ldquo;Ireland of the welcomes&rdquo; we must ensure that visitors have a good impression of our country and get value for money.  We are inclined to think of obtaining value for money only when we travel abroad but we must live up to the standards expected of us by foreign visitors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As with all legislation, the right balance is vital.  We live in a consumer society and are inclined to expect the consumer to be protected at all times. We must also strike the right balance in the case of travel agents and others who promote holidays.  Deputy Séamus Brennan referred to small travel businesses selling holidays to people based on brochures provided by larger firms. While one may see a beautiful hotel in its own grounds in a brouchure, it is very difficult to ascertain what it will be like in reality.  When one sees a description in a brouchure of a hotel located five to ten minutes from a town centre. I often wonder whether they have in mind Cáitriona McKiernan in the case <Col N="336" /> of the five minutes and of me in the case of the ten; what exactly does five to ten minutes to the town centre mean?  One would prefer brochures to give the exact distance, although the town centre may be somewhat subjective, dependent on whether one wants to go to a public-house, hotel, cinema or perhaps an arts centre.</P>
    <P>It is very difficult to strike the right balance because such descriptions can be misleading.  For example, what may be described as a beautiful beach adjoining a hotel might be one constructed of gravel that would cut one's toes.  A person might be comfortable on a sunbed to lie in the sun, but gravel would be anything but beautiful if that person had to walk on it.  Some brochures give a fantastic perception of amenities available, but people are often sorely disappointed on arrival to find them very different.  A person's perception of hotels and beaches may be dependent on his or her previous experiences.</P>
    <P>The additional responsibilities placed on travel agents or others selling holidays by this Bill will occasion more expense on them, something we must face up to.  The Minister in his speech said:</P>
    <P>I am aware that there is a lot of concern in the travel trade industry regarding the extent to which organisers could be held liable to the consumer following the implementation of this legislation.  In this regard, I would like to clarify that the retailers' liability to their customers will not be dramatically increased following the Bill's enactment.</P>
    <P>As a society, we appear to be prone to initiating public liability claims; people cannot trip on a pavement anywhere without lodging a major claim for compensation. The danger is that once people realise there is a legislative provision to allow them claim such damages, they will avail or overuse it.  I accept, as the Minister said, that insurance cover will represent a small cost only &mdash; travel agents merely having <Col N="337" /> to augment their insurance policies&mdash; when I inquired today, I was informed that a successful travel agent might have to incur a cost of at least £3,000 extra for additional cover to avoid getting into financial difficulty.</P>
    <P>The real difficulty will arise if and when such travel agents have claims lodged against them.  Some people may say it will be like insurance cover on a car, in the event of an accident, the premium will be loaded but, if and when the person has another, the cost of the premium would become almost prohibitive. The difficulty will arise in the case of travel agents if awards are made against them.  Automatically, their premia will rise and they will have to endeavour to recoup their expenditure from their customers.  Of course, genuine travel agents already provide good insurance cover so that whenever there is any difficulty or confusion about any holiday package, they are able to rectify it.</P>
    <P>Like all other facets of life, the cowboy travel agents will cause the greatest problems.  It would be no harm to ensure they are brought into line which, of course, will cost others.  Always there are the black sheep who cause such problems.  However, the genuine holidaymakers if they fall will get up and go about their business without lodging a claim while the black sheep will endeavour to claim that they broke their neck, back, ankle or whatever in some foreign seaside resort.  While I hope that practice will not be engaged in, if it is it will add to holiday costs. That is the fear of most travel agents. While they accept they must provide such insurance cover for holidaymakers and can do so by taking out additional cover themselves, their real worry is that some people might think these provisions provide a bonanza for unnecessary claims.</P>
    <P>Some of the provisions of this Bill are logical &mdash; such as, the accuracy of descriptions in brochures &mdash; to correctly represent the amenities or facilities at the holiday destination.  The provision advocating that a representative of the <Col N="338" /> organiser should be available to holidaymakers on arrival is also common sense and to be welcomed.  Arriving in a strange place, having to make one's way to an unknown hotel, particularly if taxis are not available, can be quite an experience.</P>
    <P>Another common sense provision is that which requires information to be furnished to holidaymakers before departure as to their exact destination, how near they will be located to civilisation and so on.  Obviously, a change in the price of a package holiday cannot be made without prior arrangement and no holidaymaker should be left to discover that his or her package deal costs have risen before departure.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Séamus Brennan that travel agents or organisers must be given reasonable time to prepare for the implementation of the provisions of this Bill.  People book holidays well ahead of departure time and holidays are sold now all year round &mdash; the relevant brochures are issued in autumn for the following year.  Even without these provisions, the information furnished in such brochures should be accurate.  At the same time, we must remember that these new provisions may lead to problems in the production of brochures whose publication has followed a certain pattern over many years.  It might be reasonable to allow a certain period lapse before implementation of these provisions, thus ensuring that holidaymakers do not buy a pig in a poke or find themselves located somewhere very different from their perceived destination.  Any provision that ensures the consumer is given better information on holidays is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>Travel agents are worried about the definition of &ldquo;package&rdquo; holiday, the Minister contending that, because the relevant EU directive allows so many possibilities, it is not easy to reach a definite interpretation.  Since the vast majority of people choose package holidays perhaps they are prepared to take what comes their way.</P>
    <P>The issue of occasional operators is <Col N="339" /> unusual.  The Minister said it is important to note that the Bill encompasses, in addition to travel agents and tour operators, everybody who organises or sells packages, such as carriers and hotels.  The exception to this are organisers who sell packages on an occasional basis who are excluded from the provisions of the Bill.  The Minister went on to say that he will be introducing regulations specifying precisely the classes of persons who are deemed to be acting occasionally as package organisers.  Occasional operators can be more &ldquo;occasional&rdquo; than &ldquo;seldom&rdquo; and it might be worthwhile to bring them into line because I would be very concerned about &ldquo;occasional&rdquo; organisers who see a quick killing to be made from organising a package holiday, outing or trip.  As such occasional organisers may organise trips on a once-off basis, they may try to make the most money possible by providing minimum facilities.</P>
    <P>Reputable travel agents who have to face the public annually must be accountable.  I would not be concerned that they would benefit at the expense of innocent holidaymakers.  I hope the Minister will introduce legislation to deal with this group to ensure that they are brought into line because they could do a good deal more damage than genuine, respectable tour operators.</P>
    <P>The issue of liability may give rise to problems if claims are made.  I understand legislation is in place which will allow for tour operators to be taken to task if people encounter major problems while abroad on holidays.  That has been the normal practice.  This Bill appears to be logical and necessary because as a member of the European Union we must ratify the European directive.  It is important that holidaymakers are protected and that genuine tour operators cannot be taken to the cleaners.  Both sides must be protected. It is difficult, but necessary, to strike the right balance.  I hope this Bill will ensure people will have happier holidays.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill as a number of its provisions are beneficial. <Col N="340" /> People are entitled to them and some suggest the Bill is long overdue.  It could be described as a consumers' Bill.  It will provide protection, not previously provided, for a substantial number of people.  I particularly welcome the provision that the Director of Consumer Affairs will determine whether this measure is successful.  We vividly recall that last year during the World Cup in America many people, particularly from Cork city and county, were stranded in a hotel and were generously helped by an American descendant of Irish parents. If it had not been for his efforts, I do not know what the consequences would have been.  If this Bill had been in place at that time, those people would not have encountered such problems because the travel agents would not have allowed them to develop.</P>
      <P>This Bill brings to mind another issue. Perhaps if our better hotels reduced their prices substantially, more people would stay at home and fewer problems would arise.  Increasingly people are becoming less interested in holidays in the sun and prefer to stay at home or travel to England and north European countries.  Perhaps the Minister would consider this matter.  Our young people like to travel on package holidays to places like Spain and Portugal and some travel agents cut corners because, as Deputy Browne said, the competition in the travel business is stiff and results in a substantial number of travel agents going out of business annually.  It also means that people who paid a substantial amount for holidays and booked them three to six months in advance lose out and it is time to put a stop to this.  The Minister should discuss this Bill with travel agents and not enact it as a matter of urgency, but as a result of such discussions.  This would ensure that everybody will be better off, the Bill will be more effective, the travel agents will have time to get their act together and the Director of Consumer Affairs will have an opportunity to ensure that it will be effectively policed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome many of the provisions of the Bill.  There was a reference to <Col N="341" /> occasional organisers and that the provisions of the Bill do not apply to such organisers arranging trips in Ireland. However, occasional organisers should not deal in this business.  I do not believe problems would arise if administrators in schools, educational institutions and so on contacted travel agents directly regarding the organisation of trips.  As the Minister said, the exemption applies only to home packages and that is as it should be.</P>
    <P>There was a reference to cowboy operators and if the provisions of the Bill are efficiently and effectively policed by the Director of Consumer Affairs, it would result in many cowboy operators being put out of business.</P>
    <P>I welcome this overdue Bill which will protect a substantial number of previously unprotected people.  It is a thought provoking Bill and covers an area in which legislation is long overdue. I hope the Minister will enter discussions with travel agents and that as a result of its enactment many people in the travel industry will realise that they can no longer get away with not giving their customers the type of protection and direction they require.  An Irish group of people on a holiday package who arrive at their holiday destination deserve a little more than being put on a plane in Dublin or Cork and then left to fend for themselves.  Travel agents must ensure that they provide the type of service at home and abroad for which their customers pay.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to make a brief contribution to this Bill. Its main provision enables a dissatisfied tourist to sue the people concerned abroad.  I support the point made by Deputy Crowley regarding what happened last year during the World Cup. <Col N="342" /> Irish supporters encountered a number of problems as a result of fly-by-night operators and some were left stranded. This legislation is welcome and will offset the problems people encountered last year.  The Bill gives effect to a European Union directive the purpose of which is to harmonise aspects of national provisions relating to package travel in the EU.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's statement that the directive makes a significant contribution to the protection of consumers and completion of the internal market by laying down rules and a common framework for holiday packages in all-member states.  I also welcome the provision on misleading information contained in brochures.  A problem for travel agents and people taking brochures at face value is that frequently on arrival at their destination people find that the information was false.</P>
      <P>The main provisions relate to the accuracy, clarity and content of brochures and other promotional material about packages, the information provided by the organiser, travel agent or retailer to the consumer about the package before the conclusion of the contract and the start of the package, and the liberty of the consumer to transfer bookings to a willing third person.  The consumer must be covered for all events.</P>
      <P>Travel agents should not be liable to compensate consumers for damage caused by misleading brochures and that issue is covered in the directive which was not intended to apply where, in the days of equal bargaining power, a firm and travel agent came together to conclude a purely commercial contract.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In view of the importance of tourism to Ireland this legislation is necessary. While our tourism efforts are successful a number of people travel outside the country and act as ambassadors, so it is important that this legislation is put on the Statute Book.  I welcome the provision which makes it an offence for a travel agent to supply a brochure which they know or have reasonable cause to believe is not accurate.  It should also be <Col N="343" /> an offence if a travel agent does not provide an intending consumer with proper information.</P>
    <P>Other points on transport and costings are covered in the legislation.  Last year a number of people who travelled to see the World Cup had to pay extra money on arrival due to a flaw in the contract but they had no comeback. This legislation will assist the tour operator as well as the consumer.  It is a step in the right direction and I welcome it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Much of the legislation that comes into this House is under the pretext of EU directives.  We are good Europeans and much of our legislation is Europe driven.  I accept we are subject to the rigours of the European Court, but should we just accept EU directives? Perhaps we should look at this in a broader context.  While I accept that this Bill is the result of an EU directive, experience has shown that in countries where the directive has been implemented the cost of package holidays has increased dramatically, particularly the insurance element. Holidays in the UK are cheaper because the volume of business makes them more competitive.  Will the Minister indicate how this legislation will impinge on the cost of holidays in the North and South?  On occasion it has been cheaper for people to fly from Belfast than from Dublin.  Will this Bill impinge on the cost effectiveness of travel packages here?</P>
      <P>The legal profession is often accused of trying to encourage litigation.  Will this Bill lead to a greater involvement by the legal profession in travel-type cases?  In the 20 years since I qualified I have always hated to see people wanting to sue as a result of a failed holiday or injuries suffered during the course of a holiday.  I accept people are entitled to recoup costs but it has been very difficult for them to recoup such costs.  This Bill is trying to follow the travel agent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="344" /> Our spokesperson gave an example of a person who sustained an injury in the Bahamas.  The onus to recoup costs will be on the travel agent who arranged the trip.  It is probable that people who made the arrangement directly through a travel agent in the North or the UK will not be able to sue whereas a person who has arranged a transaction through a travel agent in the Republic will.  This may entice a person to use travel agents here but at the end of the day people will seek the cheapest holiday they can get and it is possible that such a difficulty will not be surmountable for the person involved.</P>
    <P>I am surprised there has not been a bigger lobby on this legislation.  From a cursory look, it is obvious it will have a serious impact on travel agents here, particularly the smaller travel agents.  Apart from the fact that they can be sued, travel agents will have an enormous amount of paperwork to ensure they reserve their rights and if a person wishes to avail of a package holiday he will almost have to obtain legal advice.  The travel agent will probably insist that he obtains independent legal advice when signing the contract so that he knows exactly what he is doing.  This is unfortunate.  The hallmark of cheap travel abroad has been that a person could lift up a phone and within minutes arrange a package with the minimum of fuss.  The public should be aware that this will herald the end of the cheap, quickly arranged, package holiday.  I am surprised that there has not been a stronger lobby by the travel trade against the legislation or to have some of its provisions toned down.  I am not encouraging people to do this but for some reason the travel trade has been silent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Why is it not opposing legislation which will make travel out of the country dearer?  Fianna Fáil will not oppose the Bill which has been in gestation for a considerable time but we should let the public know that it will herald the end of cheap holidays.  This will give rise to great difficulties for many people who heretofore looked forward to taking a cheap holiday.  Some people may say that the legislation will entice more people to holiday at home but it also deals with bed and breakfast accommodation which is part of a more significant package.  The impact of the legislation in this respect has not been fully teased out.</P>
      <P>Every year at the beginning of spring travel agents issue a plethora of holiday brochures.  The Bill will place a severe onus on travel agents to know every sentence, comma and dot in their brochures as they will be liable for any misinformation or problems which arise as a result.  While the legislation will make it easier for people to recover their money in the event of something going wrong, we should strive to achieve a balance between protection of the consumer on the one hand and the availability of relatively cheap holidays on the other.  My party will put down Committee Stage amendments on the way to achieve this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a solicitor, I have always believed that disputes arising from holiday contracts should be dealt with through arbitration rather than in the courts.  Does the Minister intend to introduce a system of arbitration so that cases do not end up in the courts?  As a Legislature, we have been trying to reduce <Col N="346" /> the capacity of people to run to court with cases without first going through a proper procedure of mediation or arbitration.</P>
    <P>The Minister is excluding locally organised tours abroad.  The Armagh Diocese extends across the Border and I wonder how tours in that area will be affected.  I am glad that locally organised parish tours to Lourdes, etc. are being excluded.  The Minister said there were detailed discussions with the travel trade which I understand is trying to have such tours included in the Bill. This would lead to a reduction in this type of tour which is taken by people who may not necessarily go on a package holiday.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the provision on defamation, which the travel industry is particularly anxious to have deleted from the Bill.  It is very difficult to understand how a travel agent could be held responsible for defamation of people while abroad.  I find it strange that a travel agent in Dundalk or Ardee should be held responsible for accidents, etc., abroad or liable for statements made in the Bahamas.  I question the rationale behind this provision&mdash; perhaps it is in the EU directive.  Its implementation will be extremely difficult to police in practice.  I ask the Minister to listen very carefully to the representations made by travel agents in this regard.</P>
    <P>In recent years this House has responded very well in ensuring that people are properly protected while abroad, particularly in the case of insolvencies. The previous Government introduced legislation which ensured that all travel companies were bonded. However, I question whether this legislation goes too far and I ask the Minister to strike a balance between the protection of the consumer on the one hand and the availability of relatively cheap holidays on the other.  While Governments have always sought to encourage as many people as possible to holiday at home, the reality is that people want to go abroad for sun holidays. <Col N="347" /> I will go further than the spokesperson for my party by saying that this legislation will give rise to severe difficulties for travel companies in the future and will lead to the demise of small travel agents.  This will be a retrograde step and I ask the Minister to introduce on Committee Stage an amendment which will achieve the proper balance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kemmy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this legislation which seeks to close off loopholes in the travel industry and will give expression to an EU directive.</P>
      <P>If possible, we should all spend our holidays at home.  Given our relative poverty in the European Union with 300,000 unemployed and our economy in such a bad state, as public representatives, we should practise what we preach and spend our holidays and money at home.  We should explore Ireland before travelling abroad.  If we were in a good economic position and had full employment it would be acceptable for people to go abroad on holidays. However, perhaps people are depressed and in need of some sunshine following our very bad winter.  It is understandable also that some people may holiday abroad for health reasons but, in the main, we should spend our holidays at home in order to help the tourism industry and reduce the numbers unemployed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the travel industry matters cannot be left to market forces.  People frequently preach about market forces dictating this, that and the other and claim that they guarantee competition.  That is a fallacy, especially in regard to tourism and travel.  Market forces have created the need for this Bill.  They have duped and misled people and distorted the nature of travel and tourism.  This Bill is an attempt to protect not only Irish people but consumers across Europe <Col N="348" /> and that is welcome.  We all know that cheap holidays can frequently work out very expensive and painful in the long term.  They often turn out to be nightmares rather than good holidays.</P>
    <P>We must protect people from misleading and inaccurate advertising which distorts the facilities available at the destinations advertised.  People such as ourselves who live in countries with a high rainfall are vulnerable and can be misled by dreams.  It could be said that many travel agencies sell dreams to which we are all susceptible at times. We all dream about becoming successful and wealthy as well as having good holidays.  The travel industry capitalises on selling romantic images that can never be realised.  Holiday brochures portray images which lead people to believe they can become like JR or Sue Ellen Ewing, with plenty of money, power and riches and, in the case of JR, a different but beautiful and wealthy woman every night.  Those brochures peddle dreams.  They portray images of sun kissed beaches with beautiful men and women soaking up the sun &mdash; I must be careful not to use sexist language for fear I might get into trouble. Even elderly politicians such as myself would notice such attractive advertisements and wish to be part of the set. People dream about getting away from the doom and gloom and the hard work, misery and problems of everyday life, and the young and not so young are open to exploitation in that regard.</P>
    <P>The legislation is timely and worthwhile. It enhances the Transport (Tour Operators and Travel Agents) Act, 1982, extends it to the home industry and deals with protection, which is very important not only for those travelling abroad but also for people who holiday at home.  The bed and breakfast sector is not included in the Bill, but we are putting in place a legal contract which is a very welcome step.</P>
    <P>Irish travel companies are not blameless in all this, they are not all paragons of virtue.  Some have been involved in <Col N="349" /> misleading advertising and bad practices. A number of important considerations need to be spelled out and examined carefully.  For various reasons a large number of travel companies have gone into liquidation and out of business. In the past attempts were made by the industry to regulate its own business. Companies which accept that there are sharp operators, shysters and people involved in scams and cutting corners should be commended for supporting legislation to regulate their own businesses. As travel, by its nature, is mobile and not confined to one country or area this matter must be dealt with on a European or worldwide basis and cover all aspects of the industry.  Concerted action by the 15 states is required to achieve uniform protection of consumers.</P>
    <P>The Bill is worthwhile and attempts to close off many loopholes, scams and sharp practices which have bedevilled and disgraced the industry for too long. The legislation will apply across Europe.  While journalists and television programmes often attempt to expose abuses in the travel industry and show up rogue operators and shysters, they can only provide a substitute for legislation. The only way the matter can be tackled properly is to enact legislation which applies across Europe.  While Deputy Ahern tried to throw some cold water on the Bill by pointing out some flaws and shortcomings, much hard work has gone into its preparation and it is a step forward in protecting Irish consumerism in this vulnerable industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Kemmy for sharing his time with me.  I welcome the Bill with a guarded warning.  As a newcomer to the Dáil, I believe we are over-regulated and business people have enough regulations.  I went abroad on holidays only once, to Portugal for one week.  For the past ten years I rotated my holidays between Cork, Killarney and Tralee and I never again want to go abroad on holidays.  While I accept we do not have good weather, we have <Col N="350" /> everything else.  Please God we will have a good summer.</P>
      <P>People who work hard look forward to going on holidays.  On the one occasion I went abroad on holidays I was very nervous because there had been many aeroplane accidents around that time.  When we arrived at our scheduled airport it was fog-bound and we had to land at another airport from where a lunatic driver drove us to the other airport.  During the course of the journey I said to my wife that I hoped she had all our insurance policies paid up to date because we would never see Mayo again.  I thought it was all over for us and I doubt if we would have had any business trying to find out who would pay compensation if anything had happened us.  It is a mystery how that man got us safely to our destination.  I said the rosary that night because I knew somebody had been looking after us.</P>
      <P>It is important that people who work hard and want to go on sun holidays are properly protected.  Following our dreary winter I am sure many people will be looking forward to going abroad on holidays this year.  Having chosen their holiday from the beautiful pictures of swimming pools, golf courses and so on in a brochure, many people find on reaching their destination that the building is only half built and their holiday is ruined.  When they return the travel agent tells them there is nothing they can do.  I hope the Bill deals with that matter and that people who give false information are prosecuted.  People who work hard deserve the holidays they pay for.</P>
      <P>I would have had great difficulty supporting the Bill if it extended to the bed and breakfast sector.  Many an Irish family educates its children and supplements its income by making one or two bedrooms available to tourists. They supply a very good breakfast and give a good service and tourists are happy to go into these homes.  I am glad that these regulations will not affect them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="351" /> During the World Cup in Italy I was one of the people stranded and who had to stand at an airport from 10 o'clock at night until about 10 o'clock the next morning.  We were not told if we would ever go home again or who was going to pick us up.  We were put on a plane which must have been obtained from the Third World and the only refreshment on board was coke which was out of date.  I was relieved when we landed at Dublin airport.</P>
    <P>We have to call a halt to EU directives. Other countries in the EU find that they have over regulated and are trying unsuccessfully to deregulate.  That applies to industry as well.  The Minister should be careful not to go too far because people have to live.  If we continue to regulate there will not be enough offices in the country to contain all the paperwork.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and I hope travel operators will not increase prices because of the safety aspect.  Safety is important but there is no need for big price increases because that would defeat the purpose of the Bill.  People do not mind paying if they get what they pay for.  It is important that people involved in tourism know what they are getting and that they go and see for themselves what is on offer.  The most important aspect of any holiday, which I learned to my cost, is transport.  Proper transport must be provided, with properly qualified drivers, not lunatics who frighten the lives out of holiday makers.</P>
    <P>I welcome and support the Bill but I ask the Minister to leave it as it is.  We do not need regulations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to contribute on this legislation. The Bill should provide us with an opportunity to debate the tourism industry in Ireland and worldwide but I am sure the Chair will not be so tolerant as to allow us to go too far into extensive debate on the industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister graphically underlined the importance of the industry when he said that domestic tourism accounted <Col N="352" /> for an estimated 20,000 jobs in the economy in 1994.  That is a significant contribution to the economic well-being of the country.  It is a figure that many economic commentators feel we could dramatically increase if we developed the industry to the extent that we should.  In the wake of the peace initiative in the North, the tourism infrastructure in my own area in the north east is probably more developed than it is in the North and that area is set fair to benefit considerably over the coming years.</P>
    <P>The Minister also said it is estimated that in the region of 350,000 people will take holidays abroad in 1995.  I realise that we should not adopt a selfish, insular approach towards the industry &mdash; there must be mobility both ways &mdash; but that represents a significant loss to the Irish economy.  I am sure it is the wish of many in this House that some of those 350,000 people would reconsider their position and seriously examine the possibility of taking their holidays in one of the very many beautiful and satisfactory holiday locations in Ireland.</P>
    <P>We are taking our place in an assertive way as a member of the EU and we are obliged to give effect to directives at union level.  In giving effect to EU directives it is important that the implications of legislation for the economy and the industry be considered in detail.  It is an oft quoted assertion that by the year 2000 tourism will be the largest industry worldwide.  Not many people doubt that.  The significant growth in the sector in every country has been quite phenomenal in recent years.  We are in an era when people have more spare time for holidaying and recreational activity and the urge to travel is strong.</P>
    <P>As far as the travel trade in this country is concerned, quite a significant proportion of those 350,000 people take their holidays outside the EU area and it is worth asking how effectively the writ of the legislation will run outside the confines of the Union.  Many are the tales of woe of holiday makers who go <Col N="353" /> abroad &mdash; I will not name the destinations &mdash; when unanticipated difficulties arise and people are stranded for even longer periods than was Deputy Ring in Italy some years ago.  A vital link in the chain of arrangements for package holidays can unexpectedly breakdown.  There is always the risk of a breakdown in the most organised arrangements.  If such a breakdown takes place outside the EU, how relevant or effective will this legislation be?</P>
    <P>In a fine analysis of the Bill our spokesman, Deputy Séamus Brennan, touched on the cost implications of this legislation.  Insurance cover will be required and there will be bonding arrangements.  Effectively that means more money as far as agencies are concerned. I do not think the margin is such that it will allow them to absorb those additional costs, which will have to be passed on to the consumer.  As in the case of other legislation, we will have to wait to see what transpires. Of its nature, the travel trade must plan well in advance the preparation of promotional material and brochures.  It is not normal to have retrospection in regard to legislation but it is worthwhile to raise it. If there were to be retrospection that would have serious implications for those who had their material prepared before the publication of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Will there be a lead-in period for the legislation of, say, three to six months or will it be introduced immediately?</P>
    <P>The less experienced holiday maker, the person who travels infrequently or is travelling for the first time, faces the possibility of food poisoning because of a change in diet.  What will the position be under this legislation if a person suffers from food poisoning in Tunisia, Croatia or Bosnia?  Will the travel agent who cannot predict who may suffer from this complaint have to accept responsibility and will it be necessary for him to have insurance to cover this eventuality?  It is necessary to ask these questions as it is only when legislation is <Col N="354" /> implemented that its shortcomings and deficiencies become obvious.</P>
    <P>What implications will this legislation have for bed and breakfast establishments? In many parts of the country, including Deputy Boylan's constituency, my constituency of Louth and in Cork and Kerry, rural tourism forms part of rural development.  The provision of accommodation goes hand in hand with related farm activities.  The House recently dealt with the Occupiers' Liability Bill.  It is advisable that owner-occupiers have adequate cover.  Will it be necessary for the owners of bed and breakfast establishments to have separate insurance cover or will travel agents in other member states, including Germany, France and the United Kingdom, have an obligation to indemnify the owners of such establishments here? These questions will have to be addressed on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this legislation which has been in gestation for some time is to ratify the EU directive on the travel industry and meet its requirements.  As it will have implications for bed and breakfast establishments, we need to consider it in detail.  Will they be indemnified by tour operators and agents in other member states?  This matter should be clarified.</P>
    <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to make a contribution to this important Bill which will have implications for a sector in which there has been significant growth both here and worldwide. It, therefore, should be considered with care.  It is important that it does not hinder those who are struggling to develop their enterprises.  At European Union level there is an obsession with regulations. While there is a need for regulations in any developed society we should also use our common sense and not introduce legislation and regulations which will severely hinder those with a sense of enterprise.  There should be an adequate margin to ensure that they remain in business.  This legislation may have the undesirable effect of making <Col N="355" /> them less competitive.  In the open market in which we operate it is necessary for companies to remain competitive.</P>
    <P>Those who travel abroad on holidays on a regular basis wish to buy a package holiday at the cheapest rate possible.  It would be unwise to include provisions in this legislation which would have the effect of pushing up the cost.  We will have to await the verdict on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Essentially, we are talking about striking a balance between consumer protection and cost.  On the issue of cost, there is no question of giving travel agents <i>carte blanche</i>.  We are trying to guarantee greater consumer protection and at the same time to ensure that the package will not cost too much.  Any attempt to place greater emphasis on consumer protection is to be applauded.  It is for this reason I am glad the Opposition has not exerted any pressure and the Bill has been largely welcomed.  How can one object to or quibble with a Bill which provides for the minimum degree of protection for the consumer?  Neither can one quibble with a Bill which is designed to ensure an improvement in the quality of services provided for the consumer.  We are <i>ad idem</i> on that point.</P>
      <P>Deputy Ahern raised the question of the right of redress.  There are differing views on the best way of ensuring easier access to redress for the consumer. Deputy Ahern mentioned the possibility of going to arbitration rather than a court hearing, a legitimate point but it does not take from the fact that the Opposition accepts that it is desirable to ensure easier access to redress.  This matter can be teased out on Committee Stage to see how best we can give effect to this principle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill also deals with the availability of comprehensive and concrete information for the consumer.  That forms the basis of protection and no one <Col N="356" /> can quibble with this.  The Bill also provides for security in the event of insolvency. Similar provisions have been in operation here for some time.</P>
    <P>On the question of costs &mdash; the other side of the coin &mdash; we encountered horrendous problems in the early 1980's with the collapse of Bray Travel and other firms.  It is an ill wind that does not blow someone some good.  Long before the European Union introduced a directive we put our own house in order and provided for the bonding of travel companies.  As a consequence the additional costs incurred in complying with the provisions of this Bill will not be great.  This is not the position in other countries.  I understand that the authorities in the United Kingdom had to start from scratch when ratifying this directive.</P>
    <P>Having regard to consumer protection and cost, we are fortunate that much of the cost is already factored into the costs of travel agents and tour operators and the additional funding required to implement the provisions of this Bill will not be great.  This Bill is a major plus in that regard.</P>
    <P>We really do not have a free hand in this matter.  We are implementing a directive of the European Union the broad principles of which have been negotiated at European level.  This is a factor in more and more of our legislation. Although many of the suggested amendments are worthy of at least careful consideration, we all must bear in mind that any amendments which conflict with the letter or spirit of the directive cannot be accepted.  Whether we are in Government or Opposition we are all tied in that regard.  This Government was not in office when the directive was accepted at the time of the last Irish Presidency.  To some degree, therefore, the then Irish Government, a Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Coalition, was responsible for the directive we are now putting into domestic law. <Col N="357" /> Nobody in this House could object to the idea of harmonisation among member states and providing greater protection for the citizens of the European Union.  As tourism is more important to Ireland than to most of the other member states, we have a vested interest in ensuring a high standard of quality and protection and a great degree of harmonisation throughout the Community. Our reliance on tourism is only comparable to that in Spain and the Mediterranean countries such as Portugal. Greece and Italy.  If we are to resolve our fundamental economic problems, particularly unemployment, the tourism sector provides the greatest potential. We have a great interest, therefore, in ensuring that EU directives which enhance the image of tourism are implemented at European level and are translated into domestic law.</P>
    <P>Why did it take five years for this Bill to come before the House?  That raises the question as to whether we are really serious about the implementation of EU directives.  I am aware of the problems generally, in regard to legislation and I suppose a Bill of this type would not have priority but, despite difficulties in the draftsman's office or in the Attorney General's office in the production of Bills &mdash; not in relation to other matters with which I was dealing in a committee lately &mdash; five years is too long a delay. Perhaps we should consider whether it is proper for us, as a member of the European Union, to allow such a time lapse.  Only when one looks objectively at such an issue can one make a point which calls for a response which concerns our membership of the European Union.</P>
    <P>There has been much talk about the 350,000 Irish people expected to travel abroad this year.  Coming from a tourism area, I am not too keen to encourage people to travel abroad; I would much prefer them to follow the example of my colleague, Deputy Ring, and spend their holidays in the south west in particular, in Cork.</P>
    <Col N="358" />
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>They could go abroad to Kerry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>They could also spend their holidays in west Cork which is the centre of tourism in the south west.  I would even invite Deputy Brennan and his colleagues on that side of the House to sample the delights of west Cork.</P>
      <P>I am glad home holidays are covered by this Bill and it is clear that when a large number of people travel abroad, mainly for the sun, we have a responsibility to protect them as much as possible. They represent one-tenth of our population and are entitled to whatever protection we can ensure for them.  We have all heard horror stories about the experiences of people who had to put up with appalling situations abroad.  In the old days, travelling abroad was confined to what was then commonly known as the jet set but nowadays, because air travel is relatively cheap, particularly for package holidays, foreign travel is within reach of more people.</P>
      <P>It is all very well to sympathise with those who experience delays at airports and so on, but the real horror stories concern people who were accommodated in unsafe apartments, or injured and some people who died while abroad.  Such serious cases, fortunately, do not occur frequently but when they do they are horrific experiences for the families concerned.  I hope that in a small way this Bill will help to eliminate the worst aspects of such cases from a safety point of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I referred to home holidays and I will now get back on my hobby-horse and invite everybody here to holiday in west Cork.  It is proper that home holidays, where they are included in a package, are covered by the Bill.  This will lead to a greater number of people taking home holidays.  When we talk about tourism, we tend to forget the importance of home holidays.  We think in terms of the Americans, the Germans and Europeans generally holidaying here.  I hope the British will now holiday here in <Col N="359" /> greater numbers also as well as our friends from across the Border. However, the £400 million generated by home holidays last year is a substantial sum.  Furthermore, the 20,000 people employed as a consequence of home holidays is considerable.  We must protect and increase those jobs and, in a small way, this Bill will contribute to that.</P>
    <P>There has been reference to the possible amendment of the Bill.  Putting forward sensible ideas for amendments contributes to good, constructive debate.  That is the idea of having a nonpartisan Second Stage debate where nobody tries to make political capital and where people strive in the national interest, to ensure that we produce the best possible Bill.  That is parliamentary practice at its best and I hope my colleagues in Government and the Minister Deputy Stagg, who has been taking notes, will give careful consideration to the suggestions made and allow them to be reasonably argued on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>There was a reference to a delay in implementing the Bill.  It is not unreasonable to give the travel trade a fair chance to make whatever changes are necessary to ensure compliance with the Bill.  They have been aware for some time that the legislation would be introduced, but in whatever ultimately transpries in terms of implementation it should be ensured that they are not taken by surprise.</P>
    <P>If the Bill is applied to brochures that have been circulated in a bona fide way before its passage, it would be retrospective legislation.  Provision must be made to ensure no penalty is imposed in the case of such brochures which contain information that might not comply fully with the Bill.</P>
    <P>The exclusion of business travel and corporate consumers is a matter for consideration. It is important to bear in mind that any changes made must comply with the directive.  We are tied to a certain degree in this regard.  There is possibly some flexibility on the margin, <Col N="360" /> but if there is a question of changes conflicting with the letter or the spirit of the directive, they cannot be made.</P>
    <P>This Bill is worthwhile, it will not go down in history as the greatest improvement to the travel business, but it is a very worthwhile piece of the jigsaw.  In principle the EU directive is a good one, as are the terms of this Bill, but some issues must be teased out.  I have no doubt my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Stagg, will give careful consideration to the points made and deal with them in reply to Second Stage and by way of amendment on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. M. Kitt Mr. M. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this Bill.  I congratulate the Minister and Minister of State on introducing it.  As Deputy O'Keeffe said, it will not go down in history as the greatest improvement in this area but it is a genuine attempt to balance the requirement for protection of the consumer with the way travel agents and tour operators conduct their business. I am concerned about small operators, particularly in the west, who employ two, three or four people.  It has been difficult in recent times to set up business as a tour operator and it is acceptable that certain requirements such as bonds, insurance and suitable accommodation are in place before a licence is granted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many operators in small towns and villages are very successful, particularly in organising specialist holidays.  I am concerned that some of these operators may have to spend money on new insurance arrangements.  We are all aware of the difficulties in getting insurance.  As I stated last week on the occupiers' liability legislation, many insurance companies will not even quote for businesses they consider risky. That applies to the timber industry, the joinery industry and even public houses with dance hall facilities.  Will the small operator experience difficulty in this regard?  My information is that many tour operators have to get insurance in Britain and other countries.  I am not <Col N="361" /> very concerned about the bigger operators. As in all walks of life, they will be able to provide money for the glossy brochures and so on, and we hope they will comply with the terms and conditions.</P>
    <P>Package holidays are very popular because many people do not want the trouble of organising the details themselves. Irish people work hard and deserve a break, but more and more complaints are made about package holidays.  Last year I attended one of the World Cup matches in New York and I know people who travelled on the understanding that accommodation and tickets were included for the first three games, but they found that their accommodation was very poor and they did not get tickets for even one game.  Great efforts were made at the time, particularly by officials in embassies, to get tickets for people, but that is a typical example of a case where we wring our hands and ask what can be done.  In those circumstances people can do nothing about the problem until they come home and report back to the travel agent.  Cases have been brought to court and people have had to endure long drawn out processes to get their rights.</P>
    <P>Small operators are very successful because for the most part they concentrate on specialist holidays rather than simply on holidays to the sun.  Many people go on what I call energetic holidays such as hill climbing, skiing and mountain trekking.  Small operators are very involved in organising chartered flights to the various pilgrim destinations and have been very successful in this regard.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann condemns the handling of the ESB situation by the Minister for Transport, Energy and <Col N="362" /> Communications and, while agreeing that progress must be made in positioning the company for the future, calls on the Government to honour the commitment to finalise negotiations consistent with the principles of social partnership set out by the previous Government.</P>
    <P>A Cheann Comhairle, I may be giving the last ten minutes of my time to a colleague.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That is quite in order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad, as is my party, that the ESB unions have decided to go back into talks.  These talks are vital to positioning the ESB for the future.  They are important for the restructuring of the company and the preparation of the ESB for the challenging business environment which is unfolding.</P>
      <P>The ESB has served Ireland well since its establishment in 1927.  It has been the driving force behind the economic and social development of this State for 70 years, with rural electrification and the development of industry by Sean Lemass in particular.  The fact is that Ireland, unlike many developed countries never had to turn away industrial development projects because of an inadequate electricity supply.  We are now, however, in a new and changing Europe and the ESB, as well as other monopoly operators, has had to face up to change.  Reinvestment is also needed to keep abreast of technological and environmental changes and costs will have to be reduced.  The core issue of costs was being addressed in talks at the ESB in recent weeks.  The Minister interfered in the talks.  The negotiations should never have come off the rails and it is extraordinary that after five months of very sensitive talks the first person to try to derail them was the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has mishandled these negotiations in a most serious way and he is now being forced to back down. <Col N="363" /> Like the famous humming bird and with equal alacrity, he has turned 180 degrees, but not before doing serious damage to the ESB talks.  His undue interference has resulted in a politicisation of the ESB costs and competitiveness review.  Prior to his meddling, the talks were on an orderly course and the ESB management, unions and the Department were at one.  They had set and accepted a deadline of 31 May for the completion of the talks and procedures had been put in place for dealing with logjams and difficulties.  The Minister muscled in and engaged in unnecessary shadow boxing.  This led to the talks being disrupted and politicised.</P>
    <P>The Minister is now being forced by his coalition colleagues to climb down. It appears that in future he has to bring his Labour Party Minister of State with him when meeting with the trade unions.  It appears also that the Minister can no longer be let out on his own, and Labour or Democratic Left will have a word with him if he reverts to Fine Gael form and its view on the social partnership process.  The Minister should tell the House why his Minister of State. Deputy Stagg, met the ESB unions before he did and why he was at meeting with them.  What role did the Labour Party play last week in the ESB negotiations? Is there any connection between the replacement of Deputy Stagg on Kildare County Council and the Labour Party's approaches to ensuring that the Cabinet backs down on this issue?</P>
    <P>The Minister's first 100 days in office has seen him dicing with disaster at TEAM Aer Lingus and the ESB.  His public announcements on some of the other semi-State companies have amounted to little more than rhetoric. His promised initiatives at Telecom Éireann on the second mobile phone licence show that he is misguided and on an incorrect course of action, as I pointed out recently on the Adjournment. I pointed out that a crude auction <Col N="364" /> approach is being adopted to the tendering for the second mobile phone licence.</P>
    <P>The handling of the TEAM Aer Lingus difficulty was extraordinary.  The Minister blurted out in the Dáil that he was not satisfied with the pace of progress and in one fell swoop wrecked TEAM's hope of getting business as the media picked up on the comments.  The newspaper articles seemed to have alarmed potential customers who no doubt will use those newspaper articles against the company.  In my view the Minister's public comments on TEAM were unnecessary and he could have achieved the same result by going about his business quietly.  He has now seen sense and backed off his earlier untimely statements seeking instead a more measured five-year plan from Aer Lingus.  His handling of problems in other semi-State companies leaves a great deal to be desired.  Despite my requests on numerous occasions in this House, he is refusing to publish the report on the future options for Telecom Éireann.  We cannot have a debate on the future of the telecommunications industry without this strategic document. Why can we not have this strategic document on Telecom Éireann &mdash; so much for the public accountability promised by this Government?  If the article in <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> is accurate, Mr. Lowry was one of the key architects of this Government.</P>
    <P>The Minister has not given a time-scale for the introduction of legislation for the establishment of an independent regulator for Telecom Éireann.  He has been hesitant and uncertain in regard to Board na Móna's £180 million debt, with no clear decision being announced by Cabinet.  There are also issues on which the Minister has not acted and in many areas of transport, energy and communications we are awaiting his decision.</P>
    <P>The Minister's weekend media barrage was a diversionary tactic.  He has not said if what he said on the airwaves during the weekend is a Government decision.  Are there Government <Col N="365" /> decisions to back up his proposals for an independent procurer, his proposal to shed 2,900 jobs and to put in a new board and chief executive at sub-board level in the ESB?  Has a decision been taken at Cabinet level to appoint a regulator? It seems to me that the Minister and the Government's thinking on an independent procurer is extremely muddled.  On the one hand the Government has announced that the procurer will be independent but in the next breath the Minister told the country that while he would be independent he will be reporting to a board, which board will be reporting to the main board of the ESB.  How can one be independent and be reporting to the main board of the ESB at the same time?  That illustrates what I mean when I say semi-State thinking is in a muddle.</P>
    <P>The Minister appears set on a course of action designed to dismantle the ESB.  The Fianna Fáil Party is opposed to this attempted systematic dismantling of the ESB.  My party's policy is clear, we believe in the introduction of gradual competition in generation in keeping with the European Union requirements. The Minister's decision to enter the ESB negotiations two weeks ago appears to have resulted perhaps from believing some of the recent articles about his tenure as Minister.  Some spin-doctors are presenting the Minister as a tough uncompromising figure who will not dodge the hard decisions but, as he knows, hard men win all the tackles, do not throw the ball stupidly or undermine the scrum and they do not come out of clashes with a serious loss of face. One would want to be very careful before believing one's profile as a hard man because those self same profilers will take one to task for not remaining one.</P>
    <P>I suggest the Fine Gael Party is running scared from Labour and Democratic Left on this ESB matter.  This augers badly for the future of the Government.</P>
    <P>The Minister has denied that he was forced to climb down.  In his letter to the chairman of the ESB, Mr. Paddy <Col N="366" /> Moriarty, he stated categorically that cost savings had to be achieved within a very narrow timeframe, &ldquo;possibly no more than two years at the outside&rdquo;. Now he says that was a negotiating position. He appears, rightly, to have abandoned his insistence that the organisation should be reformed within two years at the outside as he told the unions there may be elements in the plan which could take a little longer. Does the Labour Party agree with the Minister's timeframe?  Has it been discussed by this three party Cabinet?  Why is Democratic Left silent?  Normally, if there was a prospect of 2,900 people being made redundant, it would be absolutely apoplectic in the Chamber with sheer rage.  Instead, no member of that party is present.</P>
    <P>What are the elements which could take a little longer?  Did the Minister identify the same elements to the unions and management?  Do they both understand the elements he is talking about? It appears the Minister has been saying one thing to management and a slightly different thing to the unions.  If this is so, it could create a dangerous misunderstanding in the negotiations.</P>
    <P>The manner of the Minister's embarrassing climb down has created enormous confusion in the ESB.  It is clear there are now serious ideological fault lines in the Government about the way forward for semi-State companies.  The Government does not have a coherent strategy.  Each of the three parties in Cabinet has its own one.  The sound Fianna Fáil policies implemented by the last Government are now in disarray. The Minister's meddling is hard to understand as he could not but have been aware of the special difficulties in the ESB.  However, there is no sign that he was so aware as he approached the negotiations like a bull entering a china shop.  The talks are important and necessary.  The international consultants, McKinsey, identified cost cuts of up to £120 million which need to be achieved if the ESB is to be positioned for the future.  I have no difficulty with that.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="367" /> Talks between the company, its unions and the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications began last year on the huge agenda of change which is required in the ESB. Given the scale of the proposed changes such talks would be delicate in any company. However, at the ESB these talks were even more fragile as the parties are still rebuilding relationships after a bitter strike in the company in 1991. That strike was momentous and is seen in retrospect as the catalyst which led to the Government review of the electricity industry and of the board's cost structures.  The electricians' strike was a watershed in the recent industrial relations history of the ESB in terms of its impact and consequences.  The four day action has been a major factor in transforming industrial relations at the ESB in the four years since it occurred. The rapid escalation of the dispute, its public handling by the unions and management and its settlement through ministerial and political intervention all suggest it had some unique characteristics.</P>
    <P>The issue at the centre of the April 1991 dispute was a 5 per cent pay claim sought by the electricians to compensate for changes introduced by management in the preceding four years.  It was the formal rejection of this claim by the joint industrial council that led to the strike.  The strike, which began as a row over measurement of and payment for past productivity, ended up as a major test not only of company management but of the board's industrial relations machinery and procedures and more specifically of national pay policy and the Programme for Economic and Social Progress.  Billed by management at the time as a strike that would never happen, its settlement and aftermath were to have a lasting impact both inside and outside the ESB.  Internally, it led to a joint review of industrial relations.</P>
    <P>The final report of the committee which carried out a review of relationships within the ESB was published in <Col N="368" /> February 1993, 18 months after the group was set up.  Chaired by Irish Congress of Trade Unions General Secretary, Mr. Peter Cassells, it consisted of five management and five union representatives with a secretary and project co-ordinator.  Its terms of reference were to commission and oversee a comprehensive review of relationships, including industrial relations in the ESB, to provide management and the ESB unions with the report and recommendations of the review and advise what further action, if any, needed to be taken.  In the review, all parties at the company and the Government committed themselves to rebuilding trust and relationships.  In fact, special mechanisms were put in place in the current talks process to recognise the difficult relationships at the company.  These mechanisms included a monitoring committee made up of representatives of the company, unions and the Department. It met every week and was to deal with log jams.  It was also the forum where any party to the talks could raise issues, such as the Minister's dissatisfaction with slow progress.  Why did he not use this forum to raise his dissatisfaction with the progress being made?  Until the Minister's intervention the talks were on a very orderly course and there was a real sense of trust and rebuilding of relationships.  It took a lot of difficult work and patience on all sides to achieve that but it was dashed rather quickly.</P>
    <P>The Minister's interference in the talks and his pre-emptive letters to the chairman of the ESB were highly dangerous.  He put the entire process at risk and undermined the mechanisms put in place to take account of the special relationships at the ESB.  Commentators might put some of this down to inexperience but combined with the Minister's handling of the difficulties at TEAM Aer Lingus the picture is being painted of a Minister with no direction. He must explain if his direct interference at the ESB is to be his approach in managing change at State companies. Are other State companies about to <Col N="369" /> receive a letter in which the Minister lays down what he wants done within a certain timeframe?  If that is to be his method of communication we are in for a stormy ride.</P>
    <P>He must explain what he meant by his reference to external interests in his letter to the ESB when he stated external interests were now dictating ESB policy. He must clarify his position on a price increase for the ESB I understand he gave one indication to the unions but was not quite as forthcoming with the media on the same question.</P>
    <P>I put a question to the Dáil and particularly to the three party Cabinet made up of Fine Gael, Labour and Democratic Left: is the Cabinet really calling for 2,900 redundancies over a two-year period?  Is the Cabinet pushing for corporate anorexia at the ESB?  If it is, the ESB redundancy bill will be £250 million over two years.  What kind of national sanity have we if this three party Cabinet considers buying 2,900 jobs at a cost of a quarter of a billion pounds?  If it is to attempt that, the least we must do is thrash it out on the floor of the House.  The ESB could not bear such a bill over two years.  Why the Minister chose two years is inexplicable.</P>
    <P>The scale of changes proposed is enormous.  To seek to achieve something like this over two years is totally unrealistic and raises questions about Fine Gael's commitment to the concept of social partnership.  The scale of cuts envisaged must be talked out realistically in this Chamber and cannot be done by diktat as one departs on a trip to the United States for St. Patrick's Day.  This Government and Cabinet must explain if it is sensible to axe 2,900 jobs at a cost of £0.25 billion.  Will some or all of these employees be taken back, as happened in the case of another semi-State company not so long ago? Will they be taken back if there is an increase in demand for electricity, as predicted, or if the ESB expands, as expected, into telecommunications, retailing, new contracts and so on?  Will these people be necessary to refurbishment work at the ESB brought <Col N="370" /> about by a planned, new investment programme?</P>
    <P>The social partnership process has been the key strategic element in this country's economic turn-around since 1987.  The Programme for National Recovery at the end of the 1980s played a key role in reversing the appalling economic mess left by that Fine Gaelled Coalition Government at the beginning of 1987.  The second national agreement, the Programme for Economic and Social Progress, continued economic recovery and provided stability.  The latest agreement, the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i>, got unions, employers and Government to reach a consensus on an economic and social agenda.  These deals were all negotiated by Fianna Fáil or Fianna Fáil-led Governments.  While we were negotiating those agreements the Minister and his colleagues criticised the process.  For instance, last year the Taoiseach, Deputy Bruton, told the Fine Gael ArdFheis that he opposed the Programme for Economic and Social Progress as its logical result would be extra taxation and claimed that national agreements led to insider-type policies.  The Taoiseach and his Fine Gael colleagues fail to understand that the social partnership process has been central to the success of our small, open economy. However, in Government Buildings he claimed to have had a conversion, when one of his first acts was to call in the unions and reassure them that the leopard had indeed changed its spots. However, it is now emerging that perhaps the leopard has not changed its spots but is just as dangerous in interfering in the social partnership process.</P>
    <P>That letter of instruction to the ESB has caused a rift in this three-party Coalition and exposed a dangerous crack in its foundations.  The seeds have been sown for major tension and friction within this Cabinet in the months ahead unless somebody changes direction. Worse, the talks at the ESB have been jeopardised; by intervening, title fight fashion, the Minister politicised them and undermined the costs and <Col N="371" /> competitiveness review.  It is now quite clear that the Labour Party has demonstrated yet again &mdash; as we know to our great cost on this side of the House&mdash; its political clout within this Government. Having done it once, let me warn the Minister it will do so repeatedly, when he will have many occasions to come in here and explain, not his policies, but those imposed on him by the Labour Party.</P>
    <P>What is now needed is a clear decision by this three-party Cabinet on its approach to semi-State companies, not three but one Cabinet approach to them, a rational assessment of the value of spending £0.25 billion on 2,900 redundancies and a clear statement of Cabinet policy in relation to the ESB.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil decided calmly and coolly to table this motion wishing to make it clear that the handling of the ESB talks has been extremely dangerous, showing up the cracks appearing in the Coalition Government.  We agree that progress must be made in positioning the company for the future but call on the Minister and Government to honour the commitment to finalise these negotiations consistent with the principles of social partnership set out by their predecessors.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanKenneally" hpid="Mr. Kenneally Mr. Kenneally">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenneally</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion tabled by Deputy Brennan on the handling of the ESB talks by the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications. I am glad to have this opportunity to contribute, particularly on the manner in which the ESB proposals will affect the south eastern region.  I sought permission to make a case on an Adjournment debate on certain ESB proposals and tabled a parliamentary question for answer tomorrow.  Both requests were refused on the grounds that the Minister had no official responsibility to this House concerning those matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While we accept that changes must be effected to enable the ESB to survive as our market opens up more and more <Col N="372" /> and the ESB becomes a target for outside competition, we must ask whether we are happy with the road the Minister and the company are taking to achieve their aim.  In this respect I, for one, have grave doubts.</P>
    <P>The Bible for the restructuring of the ESB is the McKinsey report but it appears that ESB management takes a selective view of that report.  Normally, when a package or proposal is presented to any company by a firm of consultants outlining their view on the manner in which to progress in the future, it hangs together only if all its components are implemented; if one begins removing chunks, the plan will begin to fall apart, as will be the case if one attempts to add other proposals.  For example, nobody would decide to omit the foundations of a house as, obviously, it would collapse. The same is true of any consultant's report; it should be accepted in its entirety or rejected.</P>
    <P>The Minister may say that the day-to-day decisions on how to run the ESB in the future are a matter for the company only.  We contend he has a role to play, in that he must ensure that any decisions taken by the company will result in its long term viability.  I cannot conceive of any Minister standing idly by, allowing measures to be implemented that could damage any company at some future date.  Therefore, I cannot subscribe to the view that the Minister does not have responsibility for the ultimate decision taken by the board; management will merely put forward proposals.</P>
    <P>At present there are six regional headquarters of the ESB located in Waterford, Cork, Limerick, Sligo, Dundalk and Dublin and two regions earmarked for downgrading &mdash; Waterford and Dundalk.  The existing south east region is comprised of the old Waterford and Portlaoise districts amalgamated in 1987 under a previous reorganisation. The present proposal would lead to the division of the existing region, the most efficient nationwide, and does not make economic sense in that Portlaoise would be managed from <Col N="373" /> Limerick and Waterford from Cork. The consequence of this proposal is that Waterford would lose its regional status, its effect on the south east region, Waterford in particular, being immense.</P>
    <P>I advocated earlier the total acceptance or rejection of the McKinsey report which made no reference to reducing the six regional headquarters to four, nor has it been shown that a saving would be effected by taking this course of action.  We are moving from the European definition of &ldquo;region&rdquo; in Ireland and from the area with the greatest future growth potential, the east coast.  The present proposal would leave one region of the ESB on the east coast, comprised of Dublin, to cater for the city and its environs only.  For instance, henceforth the Dundalk office would be managed from Sligo, leaving us with regions in the north-west, southwest, south and Dublin.</P>
    <P>No sustainable argument has yet been put forward by anybody to justify a reduction in the number of regions. Various announcements by different spokespersons for the ESB have been long on rhetoric and short on facts, stating that an irreversible decision has been made.  How can a decision have been taken when negotiations are continuing with the ESB unions which have not agreed to this reduction?  In addition, I had always thought the board of the ESB made the final decision and, as far as I am aware, it has not yet approved this proposal.  If the decision is made to reduce the number of regional offices, at that stage one must consider which regions have been most efficient.  Sensible commercial criteria would dictate that they should remain as the head offices of new regions.</P>
    <P>The Waterford and Cork regions are similar in that each has 218,000 customers. However, management's view appears to be that the Waterford regional office should close and the Cork regional office should prosper. Why is that so?  I believe the reason is that the closure of the regional headquarters in Cork would provoke such a <Col N="374" /> political outcry that the Government would not sanction it.  However, it is prepared to sanction the closure of the Waterford regional office.  While both regions have the same number of customers, the majority of Cork customers are in one county while customers in the south-east are scattered throughout a number of counties.  That means that any lobby would be more focused from Cork than from the south-east.  That is why the present recommendation is being put forward by management, and it has totally ignored commercial criteria which should be its primary consideration in reaching any decision.  The Minister must have a duty to intervene to ensure fair play.</P>
    <P>I will demonstrate what I mean.  Both areas have the same number of customers, but there is a staff of 896 people in the Cork regional office compared with a staff of 676 in the Waterford regional office.  There are 220 fewer people in the Waterford regional office serving the same number of customers. That has been achieved because the staff in Waterford have already embraced change in order to give a more efficient service to customers.</P>
    <P>The revenue cost per customer for the Waterford region is £94.60 while it is £127 in the Cork region, a difference of £32.40.  If that difference were multiplied by 218,000, the customer base, it can be clearly shown that it costs the ESB in excess of an additional £7 million to service the same number of customers in the Cork region as in the south-east region.  Management proposals were based on cost effectiveness. What criteria are being used in the decision to close the Waterford regional office?  Nobody will answer that question.</P>
    <P>The south-east region has the highest growth rate in terms of units of electricity consumed and energy generated. Regarding unit growth, the Waterford region has shown an increase of 6.1 per cent while the lowest unit growth of 3 per cent was recorded in the Cork region.  There has been income growth <Col N="375" /> of 5.3 per cent in Waterford with the lowest growth rate of 3.6 per cent recorded in Cork and Dublin.  Those are the ESB's figures.  By downgrading the south-east region the Minister is moving away from an area with the current highest growth rate and greatest growth potential, thereby denying the ESB the opportunity to grow with the other social partners in the south-east.</P>
    <P>The ESB proposals ignore European Union plans for the development of natural regions.  The south-east region is a recognised natural region with its own development authority.  If the ESB is prepared to follow EU guidelines on openness and competition, why not also follow its guidelines on natural regions? Last January the regional manager at a meeting of Waterford Corporation stated that only ten senior managers in the Waterford region will be affected. Since the managers in question will continue to be employed somewhere in the ESB, is it worthwhile destroying the ESB's high standard in the region for such a small saving?  Is there any saving? It has never been shown that there will be a saving.  The removal of ten people from the regional office is only the thin end of the wedge.  Those people have a backup staff reporting to them, secretarial assistants and so on.  While their backup staff may not be moved now, they will be moved at some stage in the future.</P>
    <P>Some of the effects which will ensue from this decision include the immediate transfer of existing senior management to the Cork region which will result in the vital decision-making apparatus and higher value work being removed from the region.  Portlaoise work, at present carried out in Waterford, will be transferred to Limerick, with the loss of further jobs.  The south-east region often competes with the Cork region for major industrial and port developments.  In such circumstances Cork will favour its own.  That will be to the detriment of the local economy with major loss of business to many commercial concerns such as local <Col N="376" /> suppliers, contractors, hotels, restaurants etc.  In addition, financial support through educational, sporting and cultural bodies, which was always generously given in the past, will be curtailed.</P>
    <P>The loss of the prestigious ESB headquarters will not help in our current efforts in the south-east to secure university status for that region.  Neither will it assist in attracting other State or semi-State bodies to our region, but could lead to an exodus where others might follow in the future.  In view of the Government's lack of action in progressing the decentralisation programme to Waterford it appears that it has little interest in that area.  Its policy appears to be to take away as many of the decision-making functions as it can from Waterford.  There is a proposal to close 48 shops out of a total of 120 nationwide.  The south-east region alone could lose as many as eight shops.  The customer will be affected directly by this move, although it is becoming increasingly evident that the ESB is not interested in the level of service it provides for its customers.</P>
    <P>The proposed changes are intended to improve cost effectiveness within the ESB, notwithstanding that the south-east region is at the top of all tables where key financial indicators are used. This proposal defies logic on a purely commercial basis.  The real purpose of the exercise is to obtain a price increase from the Government.  A price increase has not been sanctioned for some time and every effort will be made to force the Government's hand in this regard. The case for the south-east stands on its merits, but equally the case for maintaining the six regions also stands up to all scrutiny.  It appears that talk of their reduction is mere window dressing on the part of the ESB.  It is evident that the principles of social partnership, as set out by the previous Government, are not being adhered to by the Minister or the Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Lowry) Michael Lowry">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Lowry)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1: <Col N="377" /> To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann endorses the approach of the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications in encouraging and facilitating the achievement of efficiency and effectiveness and future employment in the ESB as part of the Government's strategy to revitalise State enterprises, to promote the interest of business and domestic consumers and to foster the spirit of social partnership.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I commend the Government's amendment to Deputy Brennan's ill-conceived motion designed to stir up conflict when the aim of the Government is to accelerate the pace of change which the ESB is undertaking.</P>
      <P>In putting forward this motion I cannot believe that Fianna Fáil is acting for the good of the ESB, its employees or the people of this country.  Instead, I believe that it is merely playing politics, attempting to score cheap political points at a time when the situation demands that a responsible and realistic approach be taken to the issue of providing a quality electricity service at a minimum cost to the consumer.</P>
      <P>I should not be too surprised at this intervention, since this is the same unrealistic approach adopted by Deputy Brennan when he was a Minister.  He proved incapable of grasping the realities in other State companies, and was a weak-kneed, ineffectual bystander as Minister.  He consistently dodged, ducked and side-stepped the hard decisions.  I do not intend to follow his example.  On the contrary, I intend to confront the contentious issues in a decisive, fair and co-ordinated manner but I must warn Deputy Brennan that playing politics with a vital and essential service is a dangerous game.  Unhappy with my success in bringing forward the timeframe for achieving cost savings at the ESB, the Deputy has now started to question the cost of rationalisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I note with interest the praise which Deputy Brennan has received from one <Col N="378" /> element of the trade union movement in seeking a price increase for electricity. It is inconceivable and outrageous that Deputy Brennan, and Fianna Fáil, would want to impose an additional and unnecessary cost burden on every home and every business in the country.</P>
    <P>Deputy Brennan is apparently satisfied to gratuitously impose extra unnecessary burdens on hard-pressed home-owners, widows and families. Does he not think that those people are finding it tough enough as it is?  Deputy Brennan is also apparently satisfied to impose extra unnecessary burdens on small businesses which have to compete internationally to survive.  Does the Deputy believe these companies are having it too easy just now and deserve to have an extra impediment slapped on them regardless of the consequences on job losses?</P>
    <P>I assure Deputy Brennan that I will not contemplate any price increase for electricity until agreement to the implementation of very substantial savings is in place.  The days of the Fianna Fáil type solution &mdash; the easy option &mdash; are well and truly over.</P>
    <P>I thank the Deputy, however, for the opportunity to reiterate the Government's viewpoint on this important subject even if the thrust of Deputy Brennan's motion shows a poor grasp of the issues involved.</P>
    <P>My approach, and that of this Government, to the semi-State sector is a balanced one which is wholly consistent with the commitment to revitalise State enterprise as outlined in our programme for renewal.  In response to Deputy Brennan's comments I appreciate the total support and encouragement I have received from all my Cabinet colleagues for the actions and the moves I have made to date on this issue. Deputy Brennan will be disappointed, as will many Fianna Fáil Deputies on the back benches, to learn that the Government is working exceptionally well.  Business is being conducted in a spirit of co-operation and trust.  Fine Gael, the Labour Party and Democratic <Col N="379" /> Left are giving real expression to the partnership style of Government.</P>
    <P>Two words summarise my approach to semi-State bodies &mdash; consumers and competitivenss.  I will consistently demand delivery of quality reliable service at the lowest price to the consumer My strategy is focused on competitiveness for companies to secure the long term future of employees and lead to job growth.</P>
    <P>On the specific issue of the ESB I wish to remind the Deputy of a few facts.  Independent consultants have identified excess costs at the company amounting to £120 million per year. That overrun, equivalent to £10 million a month, is a direct cost on the ESB's customers.  I want to see that cost base addressed as soon as possible.  This is vital if the ESB is to be a competitive player in Europe's deregulated electricity industry.  It also means that the long term benefits of this cost-saving exercise will be felt by every household and business here.</P>
    <P>Against this background I am astonished at Deputy Brennan's implication that the company's sole shareholder should have no input into the important cost and competitiveness review which is currently taking place at the group. Deputy Brennan's view is that I should have kept quiet and allowed electricity prices to rise unnecessarily.  He seems to think that there is something wrong with the Minister responsible for the ESB having direct communication with the company's chairman on an issue as vital as the future direction of the industry.  I also note that the Deputy is labouring under the illusion that my intervention has somehow threatened an agreed three to seven year rationalisation programme entered into by ESB management and its unions.  Being in Opposition is no excuse for being out of touch.</P>
    <P>The fact is that no such agreement was ever in place.  Ongoing negotiations seemed to suggest that this would be the agreed timescale but following my talks with management and unions last <Col N="380" /> Wednesday and Thursday I have succeeded in focusing the attention of all parties on achieving the bulk of the planned rationalisation in a much narrower timeframe.  As I reported at the time, most of the savings will now be achieved within a two year timeframe. With substantial costs at stake every year, it is clear that rationalisation is not an option &mdash; it is an urgent necessity.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand where Deputy Brennan got the notion that the pace of change in the ESB has to be restricted for financial reasons.  I am well aware that the total redundancy cost will be high.  Even a cursory glance at its annual reports will show that the ESB has no difficulty raising large sums of money from a combination of internal cash flow and borrowing.  Investment in changing work practices which are directly aimed at reducing costs will have a short pay-back period.  Relative to the ESB's conventional capital expenditure, this investment in enhanced effectiveness is much more attractive in financial terms.  There is no financial constraints which could justify prolonging implementation of the programme.</P>
    <P>I wish to put the cost of the total severance package in perspective.  The ESB is a company with annual revenues of almost £1 billion.  It is a company with a capital expenditure programme of £1.5 billion over the next five years which is £300 million per annum, almost £1 million per day.  That is an enormous outlay. The cost of achieving cost-effective rationalisation will probably be in the region of £200 million but the payback period on achieving that efficiency is only about three years.  That makes perfectly good financial sense.</P>
    <P>As a result of my intervention the talks are now back on course, there is a commitment to have them completed by the end of May and there is a new sense of realism from all parties concerning the steps that must be taken to restore the ESB's competitiveness.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity to acknowledge the positive and constructive approach adopted by the unions at our <Col N="381" /> meeting last week.  All parties are now agreed on the broad objectives and timing for the negotiations which are expected to conclude by 31 May.  I look forward to a positive and successful outcome to the CCR process.</P>
    <P>In the rest of my contribution I will be touching on specific issues which affect the ESB's short and long term performance, but first I wish to refer to the general subject of State enterprises and some recent commentaries on electricity matters.</P>
    <P>In overall terms, the State bodies play a very significant role in our economy. Many of them are among the largest companies in the State, and have a significant effect on overall economic activity.  While the commercial State bodies have much in common with privately owned enterprises, there are some significant differences which arise from the fact that they are owned by the State and a substantial proportion of total national resources is under their control.</P>
    <P>The State exercises the ownership right of State bodies on behalf of the community as a whole.  It is the duty of Government to initiate and shape policy, in the broadest sense, for the State bodies.  In turn, it is the Government's responsibility to ensure that where public moneys are invested in the State bodies, they are safeguarded and used effectively; that State bodies conform generally to overall Government policy and that the public sector operates efficiently and in a manner that serves the best interests of their customers and the wider community.</P>
    <P>It is from that perspective one must look at the excess costs which exist in the ESB and my communication with the board on policy.  The Government would not be fulfilling its public policy role if it were to allow the ESB a price increase without carefully examining the scope for savings and efficiency.  The policy agreement between the partners in Government, A Government of Renewal, reinforces the commitment to <Col N="382" /> the further development and strengthening of a dynamic and efficient State enterprise sector.</P>
    <P>This Government has highlighted the importance of revitalising public enterprise.  We believe there is a need for managed change in some State companies, among them the ESB.  The environment in which these State companies operate is rapidly becoming more and more competitive as a result of the twin drivers of technological change and EU competition rules.  As stated in the policy agreement forming this Government our approach to these inevitable forces will be to ensure that all change will be managed in the best interests of employees, taxpayers and consumers.  One of the benefits of the new competitive environment is that costs and, thus, prices to consumers will be kept to a minimum.</P>
    <P>In the ESB's case it is imperative that it tackles its costs and it is imperative that the Government provides an appropriate structure for the electricity supply industry so that the ESB can operate even more profitably and commercially in markets that are becoming increasingly competitive.</P>
    <P>IBEC's recent report, Energy &mdash; 2000 and Beyond, is a welcome addition to the debate about moving forward in this vital area of economic activity: The report points out that Irish business needs a secure, competitively priced energy supply to make its contribution to the economy.  In its discussion of electricity matters, IBEC stresses that competitively priced electricity is essential to the maintenance of employment and the continued growth of Ireland's industrial base.  I, too, am vigilant on electricity pricing.</P>
    <P>On pricing, I would also highlight an ESRI paper of 13 February 1995, entitled &ldquo;Energy Utilities and Competitiveness&rdquo;. This paper includes an interesting review of current policy issues.  In its discussion of pricing by energy utilities, it refers to the risk that a lack of competition can lead to excessive costs or abnormally high profits by monopolies.  The paper also points out <Col N="383" /> that unless these tendencies are curbed by public policy initiatives, there can be adverse consequences for the economy such as movement by firms away from electricity to other energy services, loss of competitiveness and a reduction in the disposable income of consumers. Analysis under the ESRI medium-term model suggests that cost savings in energy utilities such as the ESB could generate increased employment in other sectors.  Firms in the tradable sector would take advantage of improved competitiveness to increase output and employment and the consequent growth in GNP would eventually benefit consumers as a whole.</P>
    <P>The focus on the consumer must be central to any appraisal of the efficiency and effectiveness of the ESB.  If we neglect to look at the ESB from the consumer perspective there is a danger that the self-interest of the utility will dominate our thinking.  This is no criticism of the fine public spirit which the ESB management and employees have displayed over the years.  However, we cannot rely solely on the goodwill of utilities to operate with maximum effectiveness and efficiency.  The spur of competition and the pressures of strong and probing regulation can be a healthy feature of the day to day running of a utility.  I intend that the optimum balance of regulation and competition necessary to make the ESB more consumer conscious and efficient will be established in a new electricity market. However, the most immediate benefits to the consumer hinge upon the outcome of the CCR.</P>
    <P>The cost and competitiveness review embodies social partnership and consensus. If successful, as I trust it will be, the CCR could become the prototype for similar developments in other firms. Social partnership is based on engendering trust and understanding between management and employees and building on a shared commitment to the firm's welfare.  It attempts to break away from conflict and confrontation and to substitute a partnership between <Col N="384" /> management and employees.  In such a relationship employees are recognised for their value to the effectiveness of the firm; their co-operation is viewed as an asset to the firm's growth potential and its capacity to respond to customer needs.  Unfortunately, in the past the ESB was subject to some unfavourable criticism because of its industrial relations record.  I recognise the CCR as a milestone in the board's history and that it has the potential to inject a new realism and maturity as regards the conduct of its business.</P>
    <P>The CCR is overseen by a steering group, representing my Department, ESB management and unions.  The tripartite nature of the steering group has enabled my Department to see at first hand the issues faced by the ESB, to review progress and to monitor the work of the consultants engaged to compare the ESB's performance with best practice in other countries.  However, my Department has no direct role in the negotiations on changes within the ESB designed to realise the savings identified. My role and that of my Department is to champion the cause of the consumer and to represent the shareholder. In so doing I will encourage the new climate in the ESB and, where appropriate, set out certain policy parameters to facilitate the conduct of negotiations.</P>
    <P>In the short term, the CCR represents the most effective opportunity to improve the economics of the electricity sector.  In the longer term, competition, particularly in power generation, combined with new regulatory arrangements, will be the means by which we can achieve the best deal for the consumer. My Department is currently preparing legislation to modernise the electricity market.</P>
    <P>I wish to give the House a clear picture of the issues which have to be considered in relation to any change in Ireland's relatively small electricity sector. First, electricity is different from other goods and services because it cannot be stored.  It must be generated at the instant it is needed and at very high <Col N="385" /> quality.  Second, there is no practical alternative to the use of extensive electric cables to distribute power.  Third, the electricity business is highly capital intensive &mdash; in particular, the economies of scale of electricity generation mean that each generating station represents a large long term investment.  These factors have a major impact on the scope for competition and the realistic structural options which a Government can consider.  Regardless of scale, nobody is recommending the duplication of transmission and distribution systems.  There is no threat to the ESB's existing monopoly electricity networks. The key area of potential competition lies in the generation of electricity.</P>
    <P>Generation accounts for over half of the ESB's costs and it is the area where the potential for competition is greatest. However, it is important to note that the small size of our market and the relatively large size of a cost effective new power station present a particular problem. An investor is unlikely to spend £200 million building a power station, if he has no guarantee of selling its power on a continuous basis for at least 15 years.  The encouragement of market entry by investors requires a reasonably predictable and stable operating environment. Unbridled competition in power generation would have serious consequences for existing investment and would deter new investors.  In a small market, we need to establish a competitive framework appropriate to the country's needs.</P>
    <P>The best way to get savings in generation is to create a central power purchasing agency for the procurement of generating capacity.  The characteristics of the Irish market mean that the benefits of competition can best be captured in long term contracts with investors. However, to be effective and to comply with EU law, competition must be conducted in a fair and impartial manner. I intend to achieve this by introducing arrangements to ensure the independence of the power procurer.  The approach which I will propose to <Col N="386" /> Government will ensure that this function operates at clear arms-length from the rest of the ESB.  The power procurement office will be charged with establishing formal contracts &mdash; power purchasing agreements &mdash; with each of the generating stations on the system for the purchase of the electricity which they produce.  These agreements will be complex, legally binding contracts, and will specify such things as the price to be paid to the generator for the electricity, incentive payments for above standard performance and penalties for failure to meet contracted obligations.</P>
    <P>The EU Commission is pressing for the liberalisation of the electricity and gas markets.  Negotiations on the Commission proposals are at an important stage and we must take steps now to ensure that the competitiveness of the electricity sector is protected in the long term.  The ESB must address its cost structure if it is to be competitive in the coming liberalised market.</P>
    <P>The Commission believes that the EU Treaty already entitles electricity businesses to establish in any member state and entitles consumers to buy electricity from producers in another member state.  The Commission also believes that central planning of electricity systems has resulted in too much capacity at the expense of consumers.</P>
    <P>Proposals for an electricity Directive put forward by the Commission last year are intended to provide mechanisms to give effect to these rights.  The draft Directive provided for a tendering or authorisation procedure for new generating capacity, increased transparency in utility accounts and the introduction of third party access, that is generators contracting directly with consumers or distributors and having access to national networks.</P>
    <P>As I just mentioned, the requirements of the small, isolated Irish market are different from those of highly interconnected continental systems and in the negotiations on the Commission proposals I have been stressing the importance of central planning and control in <Col N="387" /> our system.  The option of a &ldquo;single buyer&rdquo; has now emerged, where all power would be sold to a central purchasing agency as an alternative to the Commission's favoured third party access approach.  This is similar to the power procurement function provided for the ESB's restructuring.  The Commission has indicated a willingness to accept the &ldquo;single buyer&rdquo; provided certain conditions are met.</P>
    <P>While considerable negotiation is required on the Commission proposals and in particular on the &ldquo;single buyer&rdquo; option it is clear at this stage that, if it is to be acceptable to the majority of member states, the final Directive will require open competition for all new and replacement generating capacity, a regulatory regime that ensures there will it be no discrimination against electricy producers in other member states and greater transparency in utility accounts.  Bearing in mind that the &ldquo;single buyer&rdquo; model is the most appropriate in Ireland's small system the moves towards a liberalised market will bring a requirement to demonstrate that competitions for capacity and system operation can be carried out in a transparent and impartial fashion.</P>
    <P>In parallel with pressing for liberalisation by means of the draft Directive, the Commission has also initiated legal proceeding alleging that existing legislation in Ireland and four other member states confers exclusive rights for importing and exporting electricity contrary to the requirements of the Treaty of Rome.  Ireland is defending the Commission action on the grounds that it is based on a mistaken interpretation of existing statutory provisions and that the relevant provisions in the ESB legislation do not infringe Treaty obligations.</P>
    <P>Recent media attention has been given to proposals by the ESB relating to Poolbeg power station.  Planning, especially power station planning, also has a strong bearing on the price of power.  Investment in new capacity must take account of future electricity <Col N="388" /> demand&mdash;never an exact science as many utilities learned to their cost in the late 1980s when high rates of demand growth suddenly evaporated.  To have a reliable electricity system it is essential to have reserve generating plant which can take over when a power unit breaks down or when a station is out of action for routine maintenance.  The key requirement is to minimise the amount of that reserve capacity.  This is largely achieved by minimising the downtime of existing power stations.</P>
    <P>However, power stations cannot be constructed overnight.  When one takes account of the need for planning permission, specification, design and competition as well as ordering and erecting complex plant it is unlikely that a new power station can be operational in under four years from when it is first considered necessary.</P>
    <P>I must take this into account when considering the ESB's proposal to complete the new Poolbeg power station.  In 1992 the ESB's view was that new capacity was needed towards the end of 1994, 1995 and 1996 and this would be catered for by the three phases of the Poolbeg station.  The ESB argued that there was insufficient time for a competition and approval for the first phase was given at the end of 1992.  That unit is now operational.  However, approval for the remaining phases has not yet been given with the result that the earliest they can now be operational is mid-1997 and mid-1998.  This delay has had the effect of reducing the amount of reserve generating capacity with a significant saving for consumers.  In spite of continuing strong growth in demand, the ESB's programme of improving performance in existing power stations means that there will be no increased risk to power supplies.</P>
    <P>The questions which I must now consider are whether the ESB is likely to build and operate the Poolbeg station as cheaply as a competitor or whether any risk to electricity supplies caused by the time needed to hold a competition would be offset by a lower overall cost of power from a competitively chosen <Col N="389" /> alternative.  The issue of Poolbeg is under consideration in my Department and I intend to make a decision on the matter by mid-June at the latest.</P>
    <P>In commending my amendment of Deputy Brennan's motion.  I have ranged over a number of issues which will influence the ESB's future and the potential gains for the electricity consumer. The Government has a coherent strategy for our State enterprises.  In the ESB's case this strategy will be tailored to customer needs, the potential for improved efficiency and the beneficial impact of appropriate competition underpinned by new regulatory arrangements. However, the most significant immediate issue for the ESB and its consumers is the CCR.  I will not countenance any price increase until agreement to the implementation of very substantial savings is in place.  If the spirit of social partnership is allowed to flourish and a sense of realism prevails, I have no doubt the electricity consumer can look forward to a new value for money era.  Consumers will have the reassurance that electricity pricing reflects best standards and performance, with the management and employees of the ESB participating in a new dynamic company with healthy prospects and rewarding employment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>My colleagues and I listened with interest to the Minister and we are amazed at his change of philosophy. He stated:</P>
      <P>Social partnership is based on engendering trust and understanding between management and employees and building on a shared commitment to the firm's welfare.  It attempts to break away from conflict and confrontation and to substitute a partnership between management and employees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister did not do much to advance that philosophy in recent times. He spent a great deal of time criticising my colleague, Deputy Brennan when he should be concentrating on the job given to him in the new Government. <Col N="390" /> Only last week newspaper reports carried the headlines &ldquo;Unions force Lowry retreat on cut plan&rdquo; and suggested that the Minister, Deputy Lowry, was forced into an embarrassing retreat from his tough position with the ESB unions.  He was certainly talking tough and warning the company about the timetable for a cost saving plan, but after a 90 minutes meeting with the union leaders all had changed and in hurling terms &mdash; in which he is well versed&mdash;he had been pulling at fresh air.  It appears the Minister of State, Deputy Stagg, had stolen his sliotar and gone on a solo run.</P>
    <P>The game is by no means over.  The dust may have settled temporarily and the Minister and Minister of State are politically happily playing together again, apparently on the same team, but irreparable damage has been done to the whole concept of social partnership and the Minister, Deputy Lowry, has done little to promote confidence in the Government's input to this process.  I would go so far as to suggest that he has damaged much of the good work done by previous Governments in this area. If this is what we are to expect from the Minister and the Government in dealing with sensitive issues where large numbers of jobs are at stake.  I do not predict longevity for this regime.</P>
    <P>We have witnessed chaos over the past few weeks.  It is one thing to be a hard man and stick to one's position&mdash; I would expect that from the Minister and I respect what he has done in regard to hurling &mdash; but it is another thing to act the hard man and then run away when things get tough.  We heard Deputy Lowry was good at getting things done, fixing things and was determined. I certainly was impressed by reports of what he would do as a Minister, but the reality has been different.</P>
    <P>Our criticism of the Minister's handling of this crisis as it emerged is based on the facts as presented to us.  The Minister has undermined the whole process of social partnership by what I can only describe as reckless interference in the negotiations between the ESB, management and unions on the company's <Col N="391" /> rationalisation plans.  He has backed the wrong horse.  The whole process was developing steadily when, for some reason we cannot understand, he decided to intervene and then pull back. I would remind the Minister that the country has benefited immensely from social partnership and I am amazed that Fine Gael and the Minister have not yet realised the benefits of effective social partnership although, having listened carefully to him tonight, it seems he has been converted.  Social partnership has worked very well in the semi-State sector under previous Governments.  It is a pity this Government, through its incompetence, risked sabotaging the many achievements.  I welcome the fact that this has not happened and that talks have resumed.  I cannot help but feel that Fianna Fáil has been left as the sole defender and supporter of this process.</P>
    <P>I welcome the resumption of the talks on the restructuring of the ESB.  I can only describe the interference by the Minister as reckless and ill-judged.  His approach does not augur well for this Government's respect for the principle of social partnership.  The cost and competitiveness review involving ESB management, the unions and the Department has been steadily proceeding for the last year.  The steering group, with representatives of the three parties, has been examining ESB costs and working towards a plan which will involve change in work practices and cost reduction.  This was and is a unique approach, the first of its kind in the history of Irish industrial relations.  The key element was that negotiations were taking place honestly and steadily behind closed doors.  Trade unions and management have learned from disputes in other semi-State sectors that negotiations through the media can only lead to distrust and the hardening of positions on both sides.  We have seen enough of that in recent times.</P>
    <P>By interfering in the ESB negotiations, the Minister almost destroyed the work done to date by all concerned. <Col N="392" /> The electricity industry is changing dramatically within the European Union and worldwide.  We listened with interest to the Minister's lengthy presentation. It was a very interesting strong analysis and there were some suggestions, to which I will refer later, as to what he has in mind.  The EU will soon come forward with new regulations for the electricity market.  These will mean increased competition, and it is accepted that this will take place in the case of electricity generation.  The central question as far as we on this side of the House are concerned is what exactly is this Government's policy for the ESB. We have received different and confused messages from the Minister.  It is obvious he is being closely and suspiciously monitored by the Minister of State, Deputy Emmet Stagg.  This double speak is a recipe for disaster.  I have no doubt that before this debate is over we will hear treble speak as we heard here last week during the debate on the Non-Proliferation Treaty when Deputy Kathleen Lynch of Democratic Left said she strongly supported the motion proposed by my colleague Deputy Ray Burke, and had no time for the Government's position but then walked through the Government lobby.  We look forward with interest to hearing that party's views.  We need to know where the Government stands.  We have heard some elements of its position tonight and no doubt we will hear more.</P>
    <P>A new generating capacity will be required in a couple of years, and this will involve a tendering process.  The issue of third party access will obviously be a crucial one, particularly for a small peripheral country like Ireland.  The ESB, both management and unions, is alert to the competitive environment that lies ahead.  The McKinsey report referred to job reduction of 2,900 workers and potential savings of £120 million a year.  As Fianna Fáil spokesman on labour affairs I want to make it clear that we do not accept this.  Imagine the social implications of 2,900 individuals losing their jobs and the effects on their spouses and families. <Col N="393" /> The cost and competitiveness review should lead to a tripartite agreement.  Its stated objective is to reach consensus on change and cost reductions.  Fianna Fáil supports the union concerns that 2,900 job losses is being presented as a <i>fait accompli</i>.  These negotiations will be extremely difficult.  The essence of the approach is that any worker leaving the ESB will leave voluntarily.  The unions have never accepted the McKinsey conclusion that there are 2,900 excess people in the company but are prepared to sit down and discuss the complex matters involved, taking into account the social implications.</P>
    <P>In the Programme for Government this Rainbow Coalition promised to provide jobs in semi-State companies.  It is therefore extraordinary that in their first outing in relation to the semi-State sector they are promoting massive job losses.  Much concern was voiced by certain individuals in the Labour Party and the Democratic Left about jobs at the time of the TEAM Aer Lingus crisis. Where are the voices of concern about potential job losses on this issue?  Perhaps we will hear them before this debate is through.</P>
    <P>The ESB has been a soft target for right wing commentators.  Whereas it has to be accepted that the company will have to undergo change in order to position itself for the future, it must be emphasised that the ESB has had no price increase for nine years, has achieved approximately 4,000 redundancies and has suffered from the virtual collapse of its rural network.  It has to compete with its European fellow member states; yet it manages to have the third lowest price for its product in the European Union.  It is important to take all these factors into account when discussing the future of the ESB.</P>
    <P>There are, in effect, five key elements to the negotiating process.  I will refer briefly to some of them.  First, there is the question of the £120 million saving. McKinsey suggests that this will come about by staff reductions and savings in other areas.  He looked at the practices operating in other utilities in the US and <Col N="394" /> Europe.  I suggest that a type of cherry-picking process was pursued and recommendations were subsequently made. The trade union position is that the question of the £120 million saving is down for discussion and I would accept their position on the basis that one needs to consider carefully how this position was reached and that an agreed position must be found.  The second element is the 2,900 job losses and the timescale for the implementation of change.  In view of his subsequent drawing back, the Minister was most unwise to state in public that changes were to be brought about in two years.  He will find it difficult to recover from this debacle.  We listened to him while he made an effort to address the matter.  I have no doubt that the parties concerned will agree to certain recommendations, some of which can be implemented immediately.  The approach must be based on consensus. We are not suggesting that the Minister should remain silent; on the contrary he should monitor the position in the ESB and other semi-State companies and involve himself in the process.  We welcome the fact that he has climbed down and decided to agree to the timescale for change suggested by the unions.</P>
    <P>On the question of the existing business unit structure, I trust the Minister will have no difficulty in adhering to the agreement reached between the unions, management and the Fianna Fáil-Labour Government.  This would involve breaking-up the company into business units.  There is also a necessity for a price mechanism.  I understand the Minister will consider this when the review of costs and competitiveness has been completed.  A cash injection will be required as the system is in urgent need of refurbishment, a cost of £600 million has been mentioned.</P>
    <P>The Minister raised the question of supplies from Poolbeg.  The position is that phase one has been completed.  It is hoped that the Minister will consider favourably proposals which will be put forward by the unions for the future development of the plant.  There is an <Col N="395" /> open cycle system with exhaust steam released into the atmosphere and as a consequence, there is much unnecessary waste.  What is required is a recycling process which would make for greater efficiency in making full use of the energy generated.  I understand that agreements are in place with other parties which would result in Poolbeg becoming the leading plant of its type in the world.  The Minister outlined some of his views and it appears he will be seeking private sector involvement.  Will he clarify the matter in the next few days and weeks? It is important that he works closely with the unions involved.</P>
    <P>The tripartite approach, which involves the building of a consensus on the best way forward for the ESB, is correct.  We need to put in place a strong indigenous company with the capacity to expand both at home and abroad. When I was Minister of State with responsibility for overseas development I saw at first hand the quality of the services provided abroad by ESB International. Many people do not appreciate the invaluable work being done by this subsidiary of the ESB.</P>
    <P>ESB International employs approximately 600 and offers engineering, design and consultancy services in practically every corner of the world, including central and eastern Europe.  I was very pleased on behalf of the Government to provide grant assistance to support its project to provide electricity for the people of Phnom Penh in Cambodia and a similar project in Vietnam.  It has enormous potential for expansion and to provide many additional jobs for Irish men and women and valuable services for those in need throughout the developing world in particular.</P>
    <P>The treatment of the ESB by the Government has been disgraceful.  In a macho-like manner the Minister interfered in delicate negotiations.  Having been taken in hand by the Minister of State, Deputy Stagg, there was a damage limitation exercise.  The Minister said that he succeeded in focusing the attention of all the parties involved, but <Col N="396" /> not before he had made a mess of the matter.  We now want to hear the Government speak with one voice, if possible.  I appeal to the Government to demonstrate clearly its support and respect for the principle of social partnership.</P>

      <P>As a Deputy who represents the area, I congratulate the Minister, Deputy Lowry, for going to Europe and obtaining a commitment that it will help fund a peat fired power station in the midlands.  For two and a half years the former Minister, Deputy Cowen, huffed and puffed.  While this project was included in the Community Support Framework 1994-99 it was made known repeatedly that the European Commission was not committed to it and that major barriers would have to be overcome before it could support it. Perhaps he did not try hard enough, have the necessary clout or consider the project to be important for the midlands but, for whatever reason, Deputy Cowen failed to meet Commissioner Millan to discuss it and deliver on his commitment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that context I am delighted to congratulate the Minister, Deputy Lowry, who, within such a short space of time, had met the relevant commissioner and secured a commitment that £21 million will be made available for the project. This is a tremendous boost for the midlands. The Bog of Allen will be a disadvantaged area unless an industry is located there.  The only sources of employment are Bord na Mona and the <Col N="397" /> ESB and that is why it gives me particular pleasure to see this project firmly on the rails.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that there will have to be open competition with companies throughout the world being allowed to tender to build this power station at a location in the midlands.  There is a decided plus in locating it there and I am sure the Minister will take the opportunity to draw this to the attention of the various companies concerned during the tendering process.  A peat fired power station already exists at a strategic location within the Bog of Allen&mdash;the Rhode Power Station&mdash; with a small network of railway lines as well as cables and power lines.  I would point out also that the unions concerned in this particular power station have taken a mature approach to the need for change, rationalisation and, hopefully, expansion.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Treatment of Kurds in Turkey.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. E. Byrne Mr. E. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>For decades the Kurdish people have been caught between two unrelenting forces &mdash; the Turks and the Iraqis.  The Iraqi persecution of the Kurds is familiar and has been extensively detailed in the media.  There can be little doubt that the Iraqi regime has pursued an active policy of genocide, including the use in the past of poison gas against unarmed villagers.  Less attention, however, has been paid to Turkish human rights violations against the Kurds.  We all remember television pictures of the Kurds being hounded by Saddam Hussein and arriving at Turkish borders only to be kept at bay by the Turkish guards.  Turkey afforded them no sanctuary, Kurdish enclaves in southeast Turkey have been attacked on an ongoing basis under the guise of combating the PKK, and human rights violations are reported there almost on a daily basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="398" /> Neither I nor my party hold any brief for the PKK because we believe it is a terrorist organisation which has killed countless civilians since its terrorist campaign began.  We all know, however, that terror should not be used to counter terror.</P>
    <P>It appears that the Turkish authorities have decided to tar all Kurds with the same brush.  Their methods have included extra-judicial executions, disappearances, torture and detention without trial.  They have now decided to carry their campaign into northern Iraq in a blatant violation of international law and all accepted international practice. With the exception of the European Union, the international reaction has been the silence of appeasement.</P>
    <P>The only time the Kurds received recognition and protection from the international community was when they were useful pawns in the fight against Saddam Hussein.  It is their status as a buffer between Iraq and the west which caused the so called safe havens, where the Kurdish people are now living, to be established in northern Iraq.  The term &ldquo;safe haven&rdquo;, however, must be one of the great misnomers of the late 20th century because on 20 March 35,000 Turkish troops were able to enter that area with seeming impunity, bombing Kurdish camps and causing, according to informed estimates, up to 200 casualties including an unknown number of civilians.</P>
    <P>When challenged on the invasion, the standard Turkish line is that the PKK must be flushed out of their northern Iraq boltholes.  Yet the Turkish actions scarcely comply with the &ldquo;hot pursuit&rdquo; concept generally sanctioned by international law.  In particular, the United Nations High Commission for Refugees has expressed concern that Kurdish refugees may have been forcibly rounded up and transported back to Turkey.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that Alain Juppé, on behalf of the European Union Council of Ministers, condemned Turkey's <Col N="399" /> actions.  I also welcome the strong representations made to the Turkish authorities by the European Union Troika of Foreign Ministers.  The EU reaction, however, is in marked contrast to the US reaction which has been mute, to say the least.  Last week, President Clinton expressed &ldquo;an understanding of Turkey's need to act decisively&rdquo;.  It is apparent that United States' concern for the Kurds depends on whether they are being persecuted by Saddam Hussein or by a NATO ally.</P>
    <P>The Turkish invasion, however, is just one sympton of a continuing problem.  It is quite clearly a continuation by other means of the ongoing persecution of the Kurds which is taking place in southeast Turkey.  Those violations have escalated since the imposition of emergency legislation in ten south-eastern provinces of Turkey.  Both the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and the UN Committee Against Torture have published reports to the effect that torture is widespread and systematic in Turkey.</P>
    <P>Given the close links between Turkey and the European Union, all EU member states have a special obligation to ensure that international human rights standards are observed in Turkey.  As we all know, Turkey is eager to enter into a customs union with the European Union and its application in this regard comes up for renewed consideration by the European Parliament next September. The EU is thus in a position to exercise a certain degree of leverage on the Turkish treatment of the Kurdish minority.  Indeed, it has been made abundantly clear by both the European Parliament and Alain Juppé that any agreement in this regard must depend on human rights progress within Turkey.</P>
    <P>An EU delegation of human rights monitors, with a mandate to investigate allegations of abuse in south-eastern Turkey, would focus international attention on the plight of the Kurds and would further strengthen the European Union's stance in pressing for human <Col N="400" /> rights improvements.  As one of the few members of the EU not allied with Turkey through NATO, Ireland is well placed to press for the despatch of such a delegation.  I hope the Minister will give this proposition favourable and sympathetic consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Ms Burton) Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Ms Burton)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Ms Burton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully share the concerns expressed by the Deputy about the continued reports of human rights violations in south east Turkey.  The Government takes a close and continuing interest in the human rights situation in that country and avails of all appropriate opportunities in bilateral contacts with the Turkish Government to pursue these issues.  It is also very concerned about the escalation of the situation following the intervention of Turkish forces in northern Iraq in recent days.</P>
      <P>Our aim and that of our partners in the European Union is to encourage further progress in the process of democratisation and the protection of human rights in Turkey.  In some respects, the general situation in Turkey has improved over the past decade or so. The restoration of a democratically elected government was most welcome and has been followed by some positive steps in relation to the protection of human rights.  Reform of the legislation inherited from the period of the military government remains incomplete, however, and this continues to give rise to serious problems, particularly in relation to the situation in south east Turkey.</P>
      <P>We recognise that the situation in that region has been seriously complicated by a sustained terrorist campaign and that a difficult and volatile situation now exists there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We condemn all acts of terrorism unreservedly and we are fully conscious of the problems that such acts pose for the Turkish authorities.  We have nevertheless made it clear that the fight <Col N="401" /> against terrorism must be conducted within the law and with full respect for human rights.  The response of the Turkish security forces to the terrorist campaign has given rise to reports of serious abuses of human rights and we have impressed on the Turkish authorities the need to address these allegations. We have also joined with our partners in the European Union in expressing concern about the lifting of the parliamentary immunity and subsequent conviction of members of the Kurdish Democratic Party.</P>
    <P>We believe, moreover, that the situation in south east Turkey should not be approached purely as a security problem. To be sustainable, a solution will need to attract the confidence of the broad mass of people in that region.  We have called, therefore, for a political settlement which, while respecting Turkey's sovereignty and territorial integrity, would allow for appropriate expression of the Kurdish cultural identity.</P>
    <P>I share the view that we need to maintain the pressure on the Turkish authorities to withdraw from northern Iraq and to respect the commitments they have entered into on human rights. These points were raised directly with the Turkish Government on a recent visit to Ankara by the French, German and Spanish Foreign Ministers, who constitute the current European Union Troika.  I also agree that a visit of an international human rights monitor mission to Turkey would be desirable.  At this stage, however, the most appropriate channel for pursuing this is through appropriate international organisations which have a recognised role in the monitoring and protection of human rights and of which Turkey is a member. To this end, Ireland has joined with its European Union partners in calling on Turkey to grant access to an OSCE human rights mission.  Turkey has, however, declined to agree to this.  The question of what further steps might be <Col N="402" /> pursued within the OSCE framework will be pursued, in consultation with our EU partners and other like-minded OSCE countries.</P>
    <P>Our approach will continue to be guided by our assessment of what is most likely to contribute to progress in the reform process and protection of human rights in Turkey.  The European Union, in accordance with its Treaty commitment to promote respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, has made it clear that the observance of a state of law and basic liberties underlie the development of its relations with Turkey.  The proposed customs union with Turkey is intended to improve the framework for economic progress and help thereby to foster a more favourable climate for acceleration of the reform process.  By integrating Turkey more closely into European structures, Turkey's European orientation should be strengthened and the European Union's capacity to exercise a positive influence on developments in Turkey enhanced.  Closer relations with the European Union should reinforce the position of those elements in Turkey which are striving for the application of European standards in relation to human rights in that country.  However, while we are willing to assist the democratisation process in Turkey in any way possible, there is a corresponding onus on the Turkish authorities to respond to this opening on the part of the European Union by accelerating the pace of internal reform.</P>
    <P>We hope that the constitutional review initiative recently announced by the Turkish Prime Minister will contribute to the process of reform.  We understand that the review will concentrate on provisions of the Turkish Constitution which permit restrictions on freedom of political expression and on which the Kurdish parliamentarians were convicted, and which affect the liability to prosecution of State officials. <Col N="403" /> These changes if adopted would represent an important step forward in the exercise of public freedoms and could facilitate public debate on the Kurdish issue.  We wish to see the review process completed and effective reforms implemented in these areas with all possible speed.</P>
    <P>The Government is deeply preoccupied by the implications of the intervention of the Turkish forces in north Iraq in an area designated by the international community as a protected zone for civilians and refugees.  We have been particularly alarmed at reports of extensive bombardments and the concerns expressed by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees about the risks that such actions pose for the civilian population.</P>
    <P>Ireland and her partners in the European Union have called on Turkey to withdraw its forces rapidly from northern Iraq and to co-operate fully with the United Nations High Commissioner to ensure that civilians are not further endangered.  We believe that any genuine security problems for Turkey deriving from the situation in north Iraq should be addressed within the United Nations framework and should not be the subject of unilateral action by Turkey.</P>
    <P>In summary, we recognise the need to assist democratic forces in facing the major political and economic challenges with which Turkey is currently confronted. However, Turkey must, for its part, respond positively to the European Union's gesture and accelerate the internal reform and democratisation process in the sense envisaged by Prime Minister Ciller's Government and ensure that adequate reforms in the area of human rights are effectively implemented in practice.  We will continue to avail of dialogue with Turkey to pursue improvements in human rights and we will work with our EU partners and in the OSCE to this end.</P>

      <P>My initial interest in this matter is in my capacity as party spokesperson on local authority housing. I tabled the question some days ago and I accept that in the last week information has dribbled out on this issue.  I thank the Minister of State for coming in to reply and I hope he will make a comprehensive statement on the matter tonight.</P>
      <P>I am amazed at the decision of the Department of Finance in this regard. I have no objection to the payment of equality arrears; it is the way the resources are raised that concerns me. My first reaction was that this was privatisation of a capital fund and I wonder how the Minister reconciles this privatisation with the Programme for Government.  How has he sold it, particularly to Labour and Democratic Left backbenchers, and why has he quickly changed his principles on privatisation and fiscal rectitude?</P>
      <P>My party in the past privatised capital assets, but capital funds when liquidised should be used for capital projects, not for day-to-day expenditure.  Is this a sale to a foreign bank or a funny money job, with part of the local loans fund being sold to the HFA or the National Treasury Management Agency which will then have to borrow the money privately to finance it? How much of the fund is being sold? Is it going at a discount and, if so, how much? What effect will it have on the agreements between mortgage holders and local authorities? What effect will it have on local authorities which currently trade when redeeming loans?  Will penalties be involved if a loan is redeemed early? What effect will it have on the future provision of local authority housing?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand the £40 million or £50 million interest that comes in every year directly or indirectly is earmarked for the Department of the Environment, particularly local authority housing.  Can the Government give a guarantee that <Col N="405" /> future expenditure on housing will not be affected by this reckless decision? It is selling the family silver for short term gain.</P>

      <P>When the Government took office the budget was balanced for the first time in almost 30 years.  The Minister promised firm management of the public finances.  He said that firm discipline would be needed and strict adherence to the commitments as laid down in the Programme for Government. This promise has quickly gone out the window.  It is a political scandal that within a few short weeks of the budget the Minister has breached his own expenditure limits by such a large margin.</P>

      <P>This extra payout, without corresponding savings elsewhere, will raise the ceiling of 6 per cent on the increase in current expenditure to over 7 per cent, and next year's promise to tighter limits has gone out the window.  If this extra borrowing is added to the public sector borrowing requirement the figure will increase to 3.4 per cent of GNP &mdash; last year it was only 2.5 per cent.</P>
      <P>The technical term for this procedure is securitisation, but &ldquo;screwitisation&rdquo; of the taxpayer might be a more appropriate term.  This decision undermines the credibility of the Department's financial policy and confirms the view that the Government seems hell bent on a spend, spend policy as if there was no tomorrow.  I hope the Minister will give some reassurance on the points I raised, particularly the housing aspects.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. J. Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity to clarify the position of the local loans fund.  The Minister for Finance referred in his budget statements to the commitment in the Government's policy agreement to payments of the legally determined entitlements of married women to social welfare equality payments.  He indicated that he was including £60 million in the budget for this purpose in 1995 and that if it should prove necessary to spend more on these exceptional payments this year there were funding possibilities open to him through the disposal of State assets which were not in commercial semi-State bodies.  Funding of any such payments in excess of the £60 million by the disposal of such assets would not increase the target for the EBR.</P>
      <P>The judgment of the High Court on the entitlements of women under the Equal Treatment Directive was delivered on 3 February 1995 and the Government announced recently that it was accepting the judgement and it committed itself to paying the £260 million as quickly as possible.  The reason for speeding up the payments is that they are legally due and must be paid as quickly as possible.  In the current year payments to the affected women will amount to approximately £200 million. These payments are of an entirely exceptional and non-recurrent nature.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, additional expenditure of £140 million over the amount provided in the budget will arise in 1995 and it is proposed, as indicated already, to fund this by the disposal of certain assets.  Sales of assets will be limited to the amount needed to cover the additional Exchequer cost arising from the decision to accept the court judgment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Possible methods for the disposal of <Col N="407" /> part of the local loans fund loan portfolio for this purpose are being examined at present.  The local loans fund is a statutory fund under the control of the Minister for Finance.  It has assets of about £550 million, of which £490 million are fixed rate loans made to local authorities which the authorities used to advance mortgage loans to persons who satisfied a means test qualification.  The local authorities make capital and interest payments on these loans to the fund twice a year.  Almost all of these loans were made prior to 1 July 1986 and since then most of the capital required by local authorities to finance their mortgage lending activities has been provided by the Housing Finance Agency at variable rates of interest.</P>
    <P>An important point to note is that the liability to repay the loans to the local loans fund rests on the local authorities themselves and is independent of the liability of individual mortgagees to make payments to the local authorities on foot of the loans they have received from the authorities.  In fact, there are no arrears owed to the fund; the housing loan accounts of all the authorities with the fund are fully up to date.</P>
    <P>The capital of the local loans fund has been provided by the Exchequer by way of borrowings and accordingly the Exchequer has liabilities which match the assets of the fund.  Two avenues for disposal of part of the assets of the fund are being examined at present.  One would involve a securitisation by the National Treasury Management Agency and the other would be by the activation of section 15 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act. 1992, which allows the sale of local loans fund assets to the Housing Finance Agency. The comparative merits of each course are being examined at present by officials in my Department who are being advised by the two agencies and it is expected that their recommendations will be available shortly.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="408" /> It needs to be made absolutely clear that the sale of the loan assets will not affect people with mortgages from the local authorities in any way.  What will be sold are the loans from the fund to the local authorities.  People with mortgages from the local authorities will continue to make their mortgage payments to the local authorities as they have always done.  There will be no change of any sort in their position.  The only impact the sale will have on local authorities is that instead of making repayments of loans to the local loans fund they will make them to the new owners of the assets.  There will be no change in their financial position or in the arrangements for funding capital projects by the authorities.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance expects to make a decision on the route to be followed in relation to the sale of the assets in the near future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NedOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. E. O'Keeffe Mr. E. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the most relevant issues that will face the community across this country in the weeks ahead is the question of new age travellers. New age travellers have located in property owned by Coillte Teoranta in east Cork.  They have come here as a result of new laws being enacted in the United Kingdom which have made it difficult for them to reside there.  We are now seeing a large influx of such travellers to our shores.  I am rather worried for the people of Ballyhooley and the area generally that we will see an estimated influx of 2,000 people when the new ferry season begins.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>New age travellers in the Ballyhooley area pose a threat in terms of fire which would cause a major disaster in this woodland area.  In the United Kingdom such travellers are subject to tax but here they pay no VAT on their trading and pay nothing to the State compared with ordinary citizens.  They are eligible for health concessions and for medical <Col N="409" /> cards.  They are entitled to a supplementary welfare allowance as well as other rights which no Irish citizen has without undergoing a means test.  They are helped all the way.</P>
    <P>Rave parties are identified with drugs.  We have seen a few rave parties in west Cork and they are likely to occur in any area.  People are genuinely concerned that drugs and rave parties present a threat to the community.  This would have a major influence on teenagers. I believe new legislation is necessary to protect people from the threat of new age travellers.  The citizens of Ballyhooley and the surrounding areas are entitled to protection.  The Garda Síochána have been informed and on many occasions they have expressed concern.  Nothing has happened to date that has disturbed the area but there is a build-up to something happening because there will be a greater influx of such people.</P>
    <P>I urge the Government to investigate immediately the possibility of enacting new legislation or amending existing laws.  I do not know which Department is responsible for new age travellers.  I believe they will cause problems whether for the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry because they are residing on land owned by Coillte Teoranta, the Department of Justice or the Department of the Environment. Something should be done to sort out this problem and help our citizens.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Ms Burton) Austin Currie">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Ms Burton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter.</P>
      <P>With regard to the particular case referred to by the Deputy I have had inquiries made with the Garda authorities which have informed me that seven families of new age travellers, approximately 30 people in total, are camped on wooded land at Gurteen, Ballyhooley, Fermoy, owned by Coillte Teoranta.  No complaints have been received locally by the Garda about these travellers, who are regarded by the local gardaí as not presenting any problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="410" /> On the more general issue of new age travellers trespassing, the position is that the law treats trespass, unless the trespass is accompanied by specific behaviour which would bring it within the remit of the criminal law, as a civil matter to which only civil remedies apply.  By and large our criminal law does not involve itself with trespass.</P>
    <P>As I understand it, the problems created by what are called new age travellers are ones associated with simple trespass and the annoyance to landowners and local communities that this can cause.  Rarely do these travellers infringe on the criminal law, and where they do, they are dealt with by the Garda Síochána as is every other person in the State.</P>
    <P>There seems to be an impression abroad that the Minister for Justice can introduce some form of legislation which would categorise the problems associated with new age travellers as a &ldquo;law and order&rdquo; issue, the solution to which lies exclusively with changing the criminal law.  Parallels have been drawn between the situation in Britain and that in the south of Ireland but they are not comparable.  I am aware that the police in Britain have powers under the Public Order Act, 1986, to move people on.  To involve our criminal law in dealing with trespassing by new age travellers would, however, represent a fairly radical departure from the <i>status quo</i> for the reasons I stated.</P>
    <P>Introducing legislation along the lines of the British Public Order Act would be disproportionate to the problems which exist in this country.  There is also the wider point that the problems posed by the behaviour of these travellers fall short of public disorder and are instead a nuisance to local landowners and townspeople.  They arise in a complex set of social circumstances, the appropriate remedy for which does not lie in changing the criminal law.</P>
    <P>Essentially what is involved here is a social-environmental problem.  If legislative measures are warranted to deal <Col N="411" /> with the problems posed by these travellers, it would not seem to be a particularly effective approach for individual legislative measures to be considered in isolation.  If the problems posed by travellers and other mobile congregations are to be effectively tackled through legislative change, it would be necessary to obtain the advice of the Law Reform Commission and ask it to review the law on trespass with a view to strengthening the powers of the various statutory agencies in dealing effectively with the problems caused not only by new age travellers but all similar mobile communities.</P>
    <P>I take on board the points made by the Deputy regarding the risk of fire in the summer season.  I will bring that matter to the attention of the Garda and Coillte.  I will also raise with the Garda the question of drugs and rave parties in that part of Cork although they have taken strong action on the drugs problem as the Deputy will be aware.</P>
    <P>As we are a member of the EU and enjoy free movement between Britain and Ireland we must take into account the conditions which Irish people enjoy in other countries.  We must be careful when we propose changes in the law. The kind of changes the Deputy suggests for dealing with this specific problem, which involves a small number of people, would be draconian and affect a wide range of issues.</P>

      <P>I wish to register my utter disbelief and outrage at the attack levelled by the Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications, Deputy Stagg, at members of the travelling community on the RTE programme &ldquo;Questions and Answers&rdquo; last night.  It would appear <Col N="412" /> that the former Minister with responsibility for housing and the settlement of travellers and the homeless believes that, among other issues, &ldquo;one of the things they believe is that the system within the traveller movement where men are dominant and women are effectively slaves should be preserved&rdquo;.  He went on to state that &ldquo;a traveller man can beat his wife&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I, with many others, am stunned by these outrageous remarks.  It gives me no pleasure to say that the comments of the Minister of State display a complete dearth of common humanity, compassion and charity and a complete and perplexing lack of understanding and appreciation of the traveller's way of life.

The Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Act, 1989, implemented by the then Fianna Fáil Minister for Justice, Deputy Burke, who extended the original draft Bill to include travellers, clearly states in section 2 that it is an offence for a person to use words if they are threatening, abusive or insulting and are intended or, having regard to all the circumstances, likely to stir up hatred.  Under the 1989 Act a person guilty of an offence under section 2, an offence of which Deputy Stagg stands accused, shall be liable, on summary conviction, to a fine not exceeding £1,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months or both.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to set the record straight, to rebut the wild, false and outrageous allegations by the Deputy across the floor and to deflate his puffed-up hypocritical indignation.  My record on the issue of travellers' rights is second to none.  I have been attacked, abused and vilified by members of the Deputy's party because of my support for travellers.

I wish to state also that I support the right of any group to preserve and develop particular aspects of their Irish culture be they Dublin people, Kerry people or travellers.  What I do not and will not support is the continuation of a culture of degradation, poverty, infant mortality, disease and premature death. That is not a culture I support, but it <Col N="416" /> is currently the lot of more than 2,000 traveller families and is a disgrace to this so-called Christian society.

The latest statistics show that in late 1993 approximately 1,577 traveller families were living in local authority houses and a further 893 on local authority halting sites.  In total this means that 70 per cent of traveller families have some form of accommodation.  It must be acknowledged that 1,176 families remain camped on the side of the road all of them living in appalling conditions. In an effort to increase the provision of alternative accommodation for members of the travelling community while I was Minister with responsibility for housing, I directed local authorities to include proposals for halting sites in the 1994 housing programme.  Some local authorities have not yet submitted proposals for additional halting sites. Despite that, I am pleased that an additional 287 families will be accommodated at halting sites this year.</P>

      <P>I mention also that as an incentive to encourage members of the travelling community to purchase their homes, I doubled the first time buyer's grant available for the purchase of their own homes to £3,000.  That incentive was specifically focused on the traveller community.  In the case of a new house, that special grant is in addition to the <Col N="417" /> new house grant which amounts to £6,000.</P>
      <P>In addition to that, while I was Minister with responsibility for housing I promoted group housing schemes for travellers.  Substantial progress has been made in that area and my colleagues, the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Howlin, and the Minister of State with responsibility for housing, Deputy McManus, have announced that funding for the group housing scheme for travellers will be provided separately from the general local authority housing scheme this year.  On a broader front there is no doubt about the Government's commitment, as part of its equality agenda, to take the necessary actions to address the needs of the traveller community today.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 19 and 34 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware of the newspaper article referred to.  Extensive data bases available for the two particular pesticides mentioned in the article have been <Col N="225" /> evaluated by the relevant European and WHO scientific bodies which concluded that, when used as recommended, neither pesticide poses a carcinogenic risk for humans.  Furthermore, the article admits that there are weaknesses in the report particularly as regards methodology and evidence.  I am nevertheless arranging that the text of the original paper is studied here to see whether it requires any action.</P>
    <P>Legislation and evaluative structures for all pesticides used on the Irish market are already in place under EU and national legislation.  The monitoring system on new developments or scientific information is continuous to ensure that there are adequate safeguards for human health.</P>
    <P>Legislation is being prepared to give implementing effect to further rules which the EU recently decided should apply to trade in certain pesticides which are designated as dangerous chemicals under Council Regulation 2455/92 and Commission Regulation 4111/94.</P>

      <Quest>if he will request the inclusion by the EU of non-viable farm holdings under the farm retirement scheme to allow young farmers time to redevelop holdings over a period of time while retaining their income from an outside employment.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates)</NameTxt>
      <P>The early retirement scheme for farmers provides an incentive for older farmers to cease farming and pass on their farms to younger trained farmers who thereby enlarge their holdings to create more viable units.  These farming transferees must agree to farm the enlarged holding for at least five years or for as long as the pension is paid to the retired farmer. Farming in that context means spending <Col N="226" /> at least 50 per cent of time and earning at least 50 per cent of income from farming.  If forestry, on-farm tourism and crafts are also undertaken the income from farming above must be at least 25 per cent of the total.</P>
      <P>I have no plans to change these conditions of the scheme which are requirements for the EC Council Regulation on which the scheme is based.</P>

      <P>With the abolition of compulsory preventive sheep dipping <Col N="232" /> arising from a commitment in the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i>, there is a risk that there would be some increase in the incidence of sheep scab. However, there is no evidence available that this is the case.  I do not accept that there has been a change in the value of sheep as a result of the revised policy.</P>
      <P>The Deputy is, no doubt, aware that there is still statutory provision for the compulsory treatment of scab-infected flocks by the local authorities.  As I conveyed to the House on 28 February, I am currently reviewing the arrangements for controlling the disease.</P>

      <Quest>in view of his remarks of Thursday 16 February 1995, in reply to a parliamentary question from Deputy Hugh Byrne stating that his Department's veterinary costs are excessive and unjustifiable, the per unit cost to his Department of veterinary inspection at meat factories for cattle, sheep and pigs; if he will provide in tabular form a complete account of all veterinary costs to his Department in each of the years 1992 to 1994; the costs expected in 1995; and the steps, if any, he is taking to curb such costs.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is difficult to quantify precisely the costs of the veterinary inspection at meat plants because staff employed in this service undertake the functions of meat inspection and the implementation of controls on market support activities, disease eradication and premium schemes.  Therefore, it is not possible to isolate the cost of the meat inspection service on the basis requested.  I can, however, give the unit cost of the entire veterinary service provided by my Department to meat factories. These costs were as follows in 1994: Cattle/sheep &mdash; £8.20 per livestock unit; Pigs &mdash; £1.45 per head.</P>

    <P>Producers contribute to the meat inspection element of the costs.  The revenue collected from the meat factories <Col N="233" /> in respect of meat inspection fees for 1994 represented a unit cost of £3.30 per livestock unit for cattle and sheep and £1.01 per head for pigs.</P>
    <P>My Department has recently put a package of measures to the meat industry in relation to the future system for collecting meat inspection charges.  This package includes the employment of independent consultants to examine the efficiency of the meat inspection service with a view to reducing its cost and isolating more precisely the costs attributable to departmental staff employed on meat inspection activities.</P>
    <P>The information requested in respect of all the veterinary costs to my Department in each of the years 1992 to 1994 and the forecast for 1995 is outlined in the following tabular statement.</P>

      <P>During a recent interview on the forthcoming farmers' charter, I outlined what steps had already been taken and what was required in the future to bring about a modern user friendly service to the farming community.  I also indicated that since the reform of the CAP in 1992 massive changes had taken place in the administration of payments.  This has, <i>inter alia</i>, involved an increase in staffing in Michael Davitt House, Castlebar, from 137 in 1992 to its present level of 180 which will shortly be further increased by a number of additional staff.  The increased staff numbers have put pressure on space in the office and I have secured a commitment from Office of Public Works that additional space would be provided to accommodate these staff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 180 personnel currently located in Michael Davitt House are working on <Col N="235" /> a range of schemes including the administration of the headage-premia payments, quota allocations, collection of Land Commission annuities, forestry services and the complete range of farm development, livestock and veterinary services available to the farming community in Mayo.</P>

A review of the area of trusts established by the Land Commission to <Col N="236" /> oversee management of lands set aside for communal use was carried out within my Department in 1993-94.  Following this review it was decided that where lands the subject of a trust are no longer required for or used in accordance with its terms such trusts should be revoked and the lands disposed of under land purchase Acts.  While it is likely that many cow parks will fall into this category each trust case must be considered in the context of its own individual circumstances and the future of each trust estate must be decided accordingly.</P>

      <Quest>the action, if any, he intends to take following publication of a recent Consumers Association of Ireland report showing that illegal substances were present in products readily available in Irish butchers' shops; and the number of persons charged and convicted under the Animal Remedies Act, 1993.</Quest>

      <P>The report to which the Deputy refers was published in the February edition of <i>Consumer Choice</i>, the magazine of the Consumers Association of Ireland.  It was based on a survey, funded by the European Commission, carried out by the Belgian Consumers Association.  The names of the premises from which meat with illegal substances present was obtained are with my Department and an investigation to ascertain the source of the contaminated meat is in progress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I take a very serious view of any abuse of illegal substances, the results of the Consumers Association of Ireland report indicated that Ireland has one of the lowest incidences of abuse of illegal substances in the EU and recognised that Ireland is seriously tackling <Col N="238" /> the problem.  These efforts will continue.</P>
    <P>It is a matter of serious concern to me that a small minority of beef farmers may be continuing to use illegal substances. My policy in this area is clearcut; where abuse is encountered evidence is gathered, those involved are prosecuted and every means open to me is pursued to have them brought to justice. To this end, a special task force in my Department carries out investigations on farm and at points of distribution of veterinary medicines to detect abuses.  In addition, animals presented for slaughter are examined and, where the presence of illegal substances is detected, the meat is declared unfit for human consumption, denatured and destroyed.</P>
    <P>The Animal Remedies Act, 1993, provides a modern, flexible framework to tackle the problem of the use of growth promoters effectively.  The Act gives extensive powers to authorised officers to enforce the law and also substantially increases the penalties that the courts may impose on offenders.</P>
    <P>Three persons have been convicted of criminal offences under the Animal Remedies Act, 1993.  A further 25 cases under the Act have been referred to the office of the Chief State Solicitor with a view to instituting legal proceedings and 30 cases are under investigation within my Department.</P>

      <P>The EU veterinary fund is designed to complement the generally limited national moneys which most member states can allocate to disease eradication programmes.  The aim <Col N="239" /> is to attain harmonised health status, facilitating ease and efficiency of trading throughout the Union.</P>
      <P>Because the veterinary fund is limited there is strong competition between member states to have their programmes funded.  The Standing Veterinary Committee and the Commission have in principle agreed to provide for TB eradication programmes.  The programme that has been approved for 1995 in Ireland incorporates a strategy for a changed testing arrangement designed to improve the efficiency of the testing system.  My Department is currently in discussion with the Irish Veterinary Union in regard to the introduction of the appropriate testing arrangements.</P>
      <P>The Government is committed in the Programme for Competitiveness and Work to draw down the EU funding, creating the potential for a reduction in the farmer levy and Exchequer contribution in relation to the programme. Farmers currently contribute some £28 million annually towards the cost of the TB eradication programme.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to inform the Deputies that, as provided for in the programme, A Government of Renewal, I intend to introduce legislation to control wandering horses in urban areas.  My Department has commenced consultations with a view to the early drafting of the necessary Bill.  I shall consider all the relevant issues in this matter and I would welcome views and comments from interested parties on the topic to assist in completing the draft.</P>
      <P>As regards the specific issue of cruelty to horses, legislation already in place&mdash; the Protection of Animals Acts, 1911 and 1965 &mdash; deals with cruelty to all animals, including horses.  These Acts provide penalties in the form of fines and imprisonment and are enforced by the Garda Síochána.  Any person with information about acts of abuse or cruelty to animals should contact the Garda in the matter.  An order was made in my Department last year which doubled the fine for cruelty from £500 to £1,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of straying horses, the present position is that the Animals Act, 1985 includes provisions for increased powers to local authorities and the Garda to impound wandering <Col N="241" /> horses with increased fines for allowing horses to be turned loose and wander on the public road.  It also abolished the immunity of owners-occupiers of land adjoining the public road in relation to damage caused by their animals straying on to the public road.</P>

      <P>I am aware of concern on the part of many people about the safety of this person's conviction.  I understand the case has been taken up by a prominent UK solicitor who has prepared a detailed submission which will be forwarded to the Home Secretary shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Embassy in London has carefully monitored this case since it came to attention some years ago and the convicted person has been visited in prison on a number of occasions by Embassy officials, most recently in July 1994.  The <Col N="251" /> Embassy is also maintaining close contact with the solicitor involved in the case.</P>
    <P>Applications for parole were turned down by a Parole Board in December 1990 and February 1993 and a further application is to be considered in May 1995.</P>
    <P>The possibility of representations to the Home Office will be considered in the light of the solicitor's advice, the decision of the Parole Board and the response to the legal submission.</P>

The taxpayer should be advised to submit his P45 with details of any benefit he may be in receipt of from the Department of Social Welfare to his inspector of taxes. Any tax overpaid will then be refunded without delay.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 47 and 48 together.</P>
      <P>The position in relation to public spending in 1995 is shown in the following table.</P>
      <P>The Government's projected increase in expenditure on current supply services of 2 per cent above inflation in 1996 and 1997 is based on the increase of 5.8 per cent in gross current supply services provided for in the 1995 budget.</P>
      <P>The recent announcement regarding the Government's decision to accept the judgment of the High Court in relation to the social welfare entitlements of married women under the EU equal treatment directive does not undermine the Government's commitment to adhere to the strict limits on spending which it has set for itself.  The Government has committed itself to paying the full equal treatment arrears amount of £260 million as quickly as possible.  In the current year, payments to the women affected will amount to an estimated £200 million.  These liabilities are, of course, non-recurrent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the budget, I made a provision of £60 million against this contingency. The additional expenditure of £140 million in 1995 will not increase the <Col N="253" /> Exchequer borrowing requirement because the Government has decided to finance it by the sale of certain assets. For the purpose of calculating the 2 per <Col N="254" /> cent increase in current supply services expenditure in 1996, the additional £140 million spending in 1995 will not be included in the base.</P>

    <P>The area in question is not within any of the catchments which have been <Col N="257" /> drained by the commissioners to date and is not on the priority list of catchments to be considered for future catchment drainage schemes, if any.</P>
    <P>The Government has approved proposals for the amendment of the Arterial Drainage Act to empower the Commissioners of Public Works to undertake schemes for the relief of flooding in localised areas.</P>
    <P>An initial group of nine areas has been identified where serious localised flooding occurs repeatedly and in respect of which sufficient data is already available from various sources to enable the design of flood defence works to be commenced.  It is intended to progress these schemes in advance of the preparation of a national priority programme.  The inclusion of the works necessary to relieve the flooding in Roxboro, Ballysheedy and Rosbrien, in the national priority programme, will be considered.</P>

A person with no income who is medically eligible for disabled person's maintenance allowance would be entitled to this allowance pending actions in the court for a personal injuries claim.

        <i>Limerick East):</i> The position is that the number of patients on in-patient waiting lists is regularly monitored throughout the year.  In line with the provisions of the programme A Government of Renewal, £8 million has been provided this year to continue the progress of the past two years in reducing waiting lists. The detailed allocation of the resources provided this year has yet to be finalised.  However, as in the past two years, resources will be allocated shortly to those specialties where the waiting times for treatment are excessively long.</P>
      <P>I understand that the patient in question, who has been awaiting a hip replacement operation in the Adelaide Hospital, has received an admission date of 24 April 1995 subject to bed availability on that day.  The Deputy will appreciate that the scheduling of admissions to hospital is a matter for the consultant concerned and each patient is assessed to determine their medical priority.  Should the patient feel that her condition has deteriorated, she should return to her general practitioner who will be in the best position to emphasise the urgency of her case to the consultant directly.</P>

The comparable figure for 1994 was £8.965 million.  The 1995 determination of health expenditure includes additional funding for increased staffing levels in respect of the changing profile of the agency's clients, additional Exchequer funding to ensure the continued provision of 73 training places by St. Michael's House and the full year cost of the new services put in place during 1994.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, additional funding amounting to £12 million is being made available in 1995 for the further development of services for people with mental handicap.  This funding will be used to provide a broad range of additional services, including respite services.</P>
      <P>I am not yet in a position to indicate the amount of additional funding which will be allocated to the individual health board regions.  The precise services to be provided in the eastern region will be agreed by the Eastern Health Board's Mental Handicap Central Planning Committee, on which St. Michael's House is represented, within the guidelines issued by my Department and subject to my approval.</P>

Nevertheless, in view of the services offered by the company in question, I asked the Eastern Health Board to meet with the company to determine what assistance, if any, the board could offer it.  At this meeting which took place last week, the board was informed that the company's financial position has improved considerably since the end of 1994 and that it is now trading at a profit.  It was agreed that the board would examine a number of options which would assist the company's financial position and service provision in the future.  I understand that the company is in negotiation with FÁS to seek to retain a grant it has been receiving from FÁS since 1990.</P>

This vaccine is still in the early trial stage and has not been tested as yet to the point where it could be used on a population-wide basis.  The WHO is not prepared to recommend its use at this point and we would need much more data as to its efficacy and safety before considering its use here.  I will, of course, be monitoring developments with a view to introducing an immunisation programme as soon as a safe, effective and acceptable vaccine is available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht (Mr. M. Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>Ballyteigue Burrow was established as a national nature reserve in 1987 under the Wildlife Act, 1976, and as a biogenetic reserve &mdash; as part of the Council of Europe's network &mdash; in 1989.  Before the site was established as a nature reserve, the Department of the Marine was consulted in accordance with the provisions of the Wildlife Act and that Department had no objection to the establishment of the nature reserve.  In 1990 the State owned and managed nature reserve was designated a special protection area under the European Community's birds directive.  This is testimony to the international conservation importance of this site.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The National Parks and Wildlife Service &mdash; NPWS &mdash; is opposed to commercial aquaculture at Ballyteigue Nature Reserve.  I am advised that such development is not compatible with its nature reserve status and would be detrimental to the proper conservation of the site.  In particular, the NPWS is concerned that aquaculture operations <Col N="265" /> might disturb wildfowl which frequent the site and might cause damage to the delicate sand dune habitat and rare floral species contained in the reserve.</P>
    <P>Aquaculture development was proposed at this site in 1987 and the then Wildlife Service objected on conservation grounds.  No licence was issued for any development in this area.  I understand however that there has been an unlicensed development in the area but the Deputy will appreciate that it would not be appropriate to allow unauthorised development in an important conservation area and then to give retrospective authorisation.</P>
    <P>In circumstances where substantial investment has been made.  I would be prepared to allow the developer to harvest the existing crop, provided he will then relocate to another area and vacate this important State-owned conservation area.  I understand that the Department of the Marine will assist the developer in finding an alternative location.</P>
    <P>With regard to the consultation process when the site was designated a special protection area.  I have been advised that as Ballyteigue Burrow was State-owned land and already statutorily protected under the Wildlife Act, 1976, further consultation on the designation of the State-owned site as a special protection area was not considered necessary at the time.</P>
    <P>I am not aware that BIM has encouraged oyster growers to locate within the nature reserve at Ballyteigue Bay but I am satisfied that it would not be appropriate for it to do so without reference to the NPWS and the Department of the Marine.</P>

      <P>The practice in relation to vacant residences within the national park is as set out in the management plan of the park. Residences which become vacant are offered to park employees or retired employees in the first instance. However, some of the uninhabited houses are unlikely to be required for residential use because of their lack of modern facilities, remote location and, in some cases, their relatively small size. In certain cases they are put to alternative uses, such as information offices etc. Recently one cottage has been made available under licence to the Muckross Residents' Association for local community use.</P>
      <P>Cottages for which no residential or other use can be found will be conserved as safe ruins while other houses will be repaired as and when resources permit.</P>

These negotiations commenced in 1990 but purchase was not completed until early this year.

      <P>It is the policy in framing new legislation that appropriate functions should be devolved to local authorities and unnecessary controls removed. Recent roads, road traffic and local government legislation provided accordingly in areas such as extinguishment of public rights of way, abandonment of public roads, speed limits, traffic management, parking controls, by-laws, provision of amenities and general competence of local authorities, as does legislation currently before the Oireachtas in relation to casual trading. Local authorities were given full responsibility for the various new schemes in the plan for social housing and requirements for Department approval in housing construction were reduced.  In 1993 a wide range of central controls on local authorities were removed by regulations, affecting matters such as land disposals, staffing, car parks and local authority procedures. Future legislation affecting local authorities will continue these trends, wherever possible.</P>

    <P>It is, of course, a matter for each local authority, in framing its annual Estimate to determine levels of expenditure and the sources of finance for each of its programmes.

      <P>My Department agreed in 1988 to allow the Dominican Sisters to lease St. Michael's national school building to the Ballyfermot Resource Centre for a ten year period on condition that the building could be taken back at any time if the need for extra primary school accommodation in that area arose.  My Department has not sought the vacation of these premises since that time. However, it has not been in a position to give any guarantees in regard to long term tenure because of potential school accommodation requirements.</P>
      <P>The Dominican Sisters have very recently indicated to my Department that the board of management of the resource centre has decided to surrender the lease as from 31 July 1995.</P>
      <P>At present there is a need to assess the overall primary school accommodation needs of the area and my Department's inspectors are carrying out a survey in this regard.  The Dominican authorities have recently been informed that until this survey has been completed and evaluated it will not be possible to give any definite indication of the longer-term availability of the St. Michael's premises to the resource centre.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the concern which exists in the Leixlip-Confey area of County Kildare due to the increase in the level of crime there.  I have recently agreed to meet the Leixlip Town Commissioners to discuss the policing arrangements for the Leixlip-Confey area.  However, the contention by the Deputy that there has been a spate of armed robberies in the Leixlip-Confey area recently is at variance with the facts.  While acknowledging fully that the occurrence of any armed robberies is a matter which understandably gives rise to concern, at the same time it is necessary to record the facts.  The facts, according to the Garda authorities, are that there has been one armed robbery in this area in the past year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am informed also by the Garda authorities that they have taken steps to tackle the recent increase in crime in the area.  The community gardaí for the area have provided crime prevention and security information to residents in response to the number of burglaries in the locality recently.  A mobile crime prevention unit was established last year <Col N="282" /> which has sole responsibility for policing the Leixlip-Confey area.  In addition, the strength of the divisional task force has been increased recently and will be deployed in the Leixlip-Confey area to augment existing foot and mobile patrols there.</P>
    <P>I would also refer the Deputy to Parliamentary Question No. 100 of 1 March 1995 which addresses the question of a full-time Garda station for Leixlip.</P>
    <P>I am informed that the policing arrangements for the Leixlip-Confey area are kept under continuous review by the Garda authorities and that any redeployment deemed necessary by changing circumstances will be introduced.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the policing needs of the Donaghmede and Baldoyle areas are kept under constant review to ensure the optimum <Col N="283" /> police service to the public and that there are currently no plans to locate a Garda station in either the Baldoyle or Donaghmede areas.  The Garda authorities stress that one difficulty with opening a new Garda station, apart from the capital cost involved, is that it would absorb manpower which could be better used on outdoor patrol duties. The essential point the Garda authorities make is that it is far better to maximise the number of gardaí available for outdoor patrol and crime duties rather than tie up manpower indoors in manning a new Garda station and taking up the additional burden of administrative work which this would inevitably involve.</P>
      <P>Baldoyle is policed from Howth station and is also served by gardaí from the surrounding stations of Coolock, Raheny and Clontarf.  A community garda is assigned to the Baldoyle area on a full-time basis and is assisted by an additional community garda from Howth.  Donaghmede is policed by gardaí from Coolock station.  There are three gardaí assigned permanently to community policing duties in the Donaghmede area.</P>
      <P>The Garda clinic at Donaghmede shopping centre was closed on 6 October 1994 due to construction work being carried out in and around the clinic.  Following refurbishment work at Donaghmede shopping centre a new location, within the shopping complex, has been identified for the Garda clinic. I understand that the Office of Public Works is in discussions with the landlord's agents in this regard.</P>

      <P>As the question is addressed to the Minister for Social Welfare, it is assumed that the Deputy is referring to cover for occupational injuries benefit.  I indicated previously in reply to Question No. 82 of 15 March 1995 that share fishermen who are employed under a contract of service, that is where they are subject to direction and control of <Col N="288" /> the employer, are insured for all benefits, including occupational injuries benefits.</P>
      <P>Share fishermen who are engaged under a contract for service as their principal means of support are insured for a limited range of benefits.  The former legislation under which their employment was deemed to have been insurable under the Acts was ruled to be <i>ultra vires</i> under a High Court judgment in February 1992.  As a result they have to be regarded as self-employed persons.</P>
      <P>A special scheme for share fishermen engaged under contract for service was introduced in the Social Welfare (No. 2) Act, 1993, which allows those persons to join an optional social insurance scheme.  The new scheme enables them to top up self-employed contributions and provides entitlement to treatment benefits for themselves and their spouses and also disability and unemployment benefits.</P>
      <P>They are not covered for benefits under the occupational injuries scheme which is confined to persons who are employed under a contract of service.</P>
      <P>The operation of the new optional social insurance scheme is being monitored by my Department.</P>

      <P>The provisions of the Pensions Act, 1990, on equal treatment are in <Col N="289" /> accord with the judgments of the European Court of Justice in this matter.</P>
      <P>The questions addressed by the court related to access to schemes for part-time workers.  The majority of part-time workers are women and the court had previously decided that their effective exclusion from schemes was in conflict with the equality provisions of the EU treaties.  Section 70 of the Pensions Act provides that an employer shall comply with the principle of equal treatment in relation to the manner in which he affords his employees access to an occupational benefit scheme.  The recent judgments confirm that the exclusion of part-time workers from an occupational pensions scheme where that exclusion affects one sex more than another constitutes discrimination contrary to Article 119 of the Treaty of Rome, unless it can be established that the exclusion is based on objectively justified factors in no way related to discrimination based on sex.  The judgments also extend its application back to 1976.  I am seeking clarification from the Attorney General as to the precise effects of this and, in particular, how statutory time limits under national legislation affect it.</P>

A person would not qualify for an allowance if he or she is living with someone, including a child aged over 15 years, who is able to summon help in an emergency.</P>
      <P>The composition of the household in this case is the person concerned, his wife and their 16 year old son.  Both adults are in receipt of invalidity pension from my Department which is a qualifying payment for the allowance. However, as their son is over 15 years of age, a free telephone rental allowance was refused on the grounds that the household conditions of the scheme were not satisfied.</P>
      <P>There would be cost implications if the scheme rules were amended to allow retention of free telephone rental allowance where dependent children over 15 years old were resident in pensioner households.  This would have to be considered in a budgetary context.</P>

      <P>The person concerned is being paid unemployment assistance at the personal weekly rate of £53.90 from 26 March 1994 on the basis of a means assessment of £5.  The means are derived from the benefit of free lodgings in a friend's home and he has not been assessed with any other means.</P>
      <P>As he now appears to have moved to another address, it is open to him to apply to have his means reassessed and for an increase in respect of any qualified dependants.  The maximum rate of short term unemployment assistance for a man with an adult and one child dependant is £108.70 a week.  The maximum rate of lone parent's allowance for a lone parent and one child is £76.20.</P>

      <P>At present my Department is funding 25 local money advice and budgeting service projects throughout the country.  An additional £500,000 has been made available in the 1995 budget towards the expansion of this service. As I have already announced, I am committed to making this service available throughout the State within two years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>New projects are established on the basis of being given funding for a period of one year initially.  After one year's successful operation, projects can be offered a three year funding commitment, which involves signing a formal contract with the Department of Social Welfare.  The contract includes a three <Col N="292" /> year work plan prepared by the management committee of the project in which it sets out the work it will undertake and what it hopes to achieve in the three year period.  Such contracts have been signed with a number of projects set up in 1992 and 1993 and my Department is awaiting draft workplans in the remaining cases.  It is expected that these will be received and contracts can be signed before too long in those cases.</P>
    <P>My Department has received an application from the South Inner City Community Development Association SICCDA, for funding of a separate money advice project in the Liberties area.  Since 1993, this area is one of four, the others being Blanchardstown, Crumlin and Rialto, covered by a project which operates under the auspices of the National Social Services Board and is funded by my Department.  This NSSB project is managed by a committee that brings together a range of relevant community groups and statutory agencies and is based on the citizens information centres in the four areas involved.  Following a review of this project and in light of the demand for money advice locally, it was agreed by all concerned that autonomous local projects should emerge in some or all of the areas concerned.</P>
    <P>In the case of the Liberties, my Department is working with local voluntary and statutory organisations with a view to establishing a new project to continue and expand the existing money advice and budgeting service in the area as soon as possible.  Discussions are ongoing and there have been a number of meetings with SICCDA and other interested parties in that regard.  I would hope that these discussions can be completed soon.  In these discussions, my Department has stressed the importance of the principle of partnership in the management of projects.  I regard it as essential that local MABS projects bring together all relevant bodies, statutory and voluntary, which are both represented on the management committee and act as a referral network to the MABS project.  Projects are run by a <Col N="293" /> management committee, representative of all the above, which forms itself as a company limited by guarantee.  The service provided must be seen as an independent service by the citizen and must have the full support and participation of all relevant local bodies, voluntary and statutory, for it to be effective in meeting the needs of people in difficulty with moneylending and overindebtedness. In the case of the south inner city area, for example, relevant community partners in the new project would include, as well as SICCDA, the Fountain Resource Centre and the Connolly Centre for the Unemployed.</P>

    <P>Already this year payment of the final instalment of ewe premium was made a month earlier than last year and payment of the balances under both suckler cow and special beef premium schemes commenced two months earlier than last year.  In general, the vast majority of applicants under the above schemes have now been paid either an advance payment or full entitlement.  The remaining cases are, in the main, problem cases and payment will be made as soon as the problems are resolved.</P>
    <P>Payment of November 1994 special <Col N="301" /> beef premium is due to commence this week.  November 1994 suckler cow premium and extensification premium payments will commence in early April.</P>

    <P>The two fisheries measures allow projects to be funded under the arrangements applying to two sources of EU funding.</P>
    <P>For the fisheries I measure, the funding mechanism is the Financial Instrument of Fisheries Guidance, FIFG, which funds certain measures in the operational programme for fisheries, 1994-99.  For the fisheries II measure, the funding mechanism is the European Regional Development Fund, which funds measures in various operational programmes, for example, fisheries; transport; environmental services; tourism, etc.</P>
    <P>The final breakdown of EU aid as between the two fisheries measures will depend upon the types of projects approved for grant aid under the North-South INTERREG programme.  Projects will be aided under the arrangements applying to the appropriate EU financial instrument: European Regional Development Fund or FIFG.</P>
    <P>In the course of the implementation of the North-South INTERREG programme funds may be moved between the two measures and the procedures for grant assistance altered, subject to the availability of funds and the European Union's budgetary rules.  At present an information pack is being prepared by the Department of Finance which will contain a copy of the North-South INTERREG programme; notes for guidance and application forms for those seeking assistance from the programme. This package of documentation should be available by mid-April 1995.</P>
    <P>The project selection criteria for the fisheries measures are as follows:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="305" /> Measure: Fisheries I (FIFG)</P>
    <P>Project Selection Criteria:</P>
    <P>&mdash;Priority will be given to viable, worthwhile projects which are cross-Border in nature.</P>
    <P>&mdash;All projects must show the degree of cross-Border economic impact envisaged.</P>
    <P>&mdash;Benefits must accrue to a specific or the general fisheries dependent-rural community in the eligible areas as defined in the Programme.</P>
    <P>&mdash;Projects must contribute towards the economic development of the Border regions and the generation or stabilisation of employment.</P>
    <P>&mdash;Projects must demonstrate a strong prospect of viability, i.e. can become self-sustaining.</P>
    <P>&mdash;Projects must be compatible with the Common Fisheries Policy and EU Environment Policies.</P>
    <P>&mdash;Projects must, where appropriate, contribute towards protection-improvement of the environment.</P>
    <P>&mdash;Where the proposed work(s) require planning and other statutory approvals, such permission(s) must be obtained prior to commencement of any works.  Evidence of same should be available to the administering agencies.</P>
    <P>Measure: Fisheries II (ERDF)</P>
    <P>Project Selection Criteria:</P>
    <P>&mdash;Priority will be given to viable, worthwhile projects which are cross-Border in nature.</P>
    <P>&mdash;All projects must show the degree of cross-Border economic impact envisaged.</P>
    <P>&mdash;Benefits must accrue to a specific or the general fisheries dependent/ rural community in the eligible areas as defined in the Programme.</P>
    <P>&mdash;Projects must contribute towards the economic development of the Border regions and the generation or stabilisation of employment.</P>
    <P>&mdash;Projects must demonstrate a strong prospect of viability i.e. &mdash; can become self-sustaining.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="306" />&mdash;Projects must be compatible with the Common Fisheries Policy and EU Environment Policies.</P>
    <P>The joint Ireland Wales programme under the INTERREG Structural Funds Community Initiative, 1994-99, the maritime INTERREG programme, is under discussion with the EU Commission. It is expected that the Commission will be in a position to approve that programme and, the project selection criteria for the measures which it supports, in the near future.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the drilling, blasting and dredging project at Burtonport is ongoing at present. Although this project has suffered from serious setbacks it is hoped to complete the work in the coming months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have asked my officials to look at the overall needs of the fishery and aquaculture industry with regard to landing places and the necessary infrastructure for the safe and efficient handling of fishing boats and their catches. This is a separate exercise from deciding what can be done with available money and is intended to quantify how much the sector has been undercapitalised. The further development at Burtonport will be considered and costed in this context.  Of course, the implementation of any development proposals must be kept within available funding, but it is clear that the operational programme envelope of some £8 million is not adequate to meet the needs of the fisheries industry and so it is my intention to make every effort to secure <Col N="307" /> additional Exchequer funding for fishery harbour works.</P>
