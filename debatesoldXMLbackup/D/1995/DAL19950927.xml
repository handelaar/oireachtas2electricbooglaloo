      <P>Before coming to the Order of Business I propose to deal with a number of notices under Standing Order 30 dealing with two different topics.  I propose to deal with these topics separately and will call on the Deputies in the order in which they submitted their notices to my office.  I call Deputy Brennan to state the matter of which he has given notice to me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I seek the Adjournment of the Dáil to debate a matter of specific and important public interest requiring urgent attention, namely, the allegations by the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications of corruption in semi-State companies, his <Col N="2" /> attacks on the staff of semi-State companies, the alleged surveillance of the Minister and senior executives and the Minister's refusal to answer questions before the Oireachtas committee or to make documents available to it despite a unanimous request to do so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach welcome the decision of the European <Col N="7" /> Court of Justice on the Gibraltar Three case and, in the light of that decision, will he urge the British Government to alter its approach to the peace process? The British Government must recognise that in terms of protecting the state and its citizens from terrorism it went beyond what is legitimate and it, too, is a guilty party.  Will the Taoiseach agree that it is now necessary to consolidate the peace process in a spirit of much greater genorosity than we have seen over the past few months?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding legislation on the transfer of prisoners and the rules applying to it, in view of the British Government's refusal to transfer prisoners, will the Taoiseach indicate if he has made contact with the British Government on the operation of that legislation?  I note the Government's intention to accept republican prisoners in Portlaoise Prison, but, apparently, the British are seeking a derogation from that legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the summer recess the Taoiseach said the legislation would be introduced shortly.  I am sure he is aware that there is a good deal of despair among the institutions interested in acquiring an interest in the Trustee Savings Bank and among its management.  I urge the Government to end the stalemate in Cabinet on this issue and to make a decision on it.</P>

      <P>On a point of order, on 1 March 1995 these Houses unanimously passed an order authorising the Joint Committee on Commercial State-sponsored Bodies to send for Ministers and papers &mdash; the Dáil unanimously implemented the relevant sections 4 and 11 on 7 April 1993.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Brennan, it is somewhat audacious of you to challenge me on this matter without daring to do me the courtesy of advising me in advance.  The Deputy knows full well that the Ceann Comhairle of this House has no function in relation to committees of the House and will not interfere in the domestic affairs of such committees.  The Deputy is picking on the wrong man.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding the proposed debate on the Government's amendment to the Constitution, does the Taoiseach envisage that the order of speakers will take into account the valid opinions of the technical group and the Green Party so that they may be included in the first round of speakers rather than having to wait for a possible opportunity to contribute later?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

      <P>The Taoiseach indicated recently on the Order of Business that the Government Chief Whip would bring forward a programme on Dáil reform.

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <P>We thank the Minister for Finance for information we received by way of parliamentary reply that there have not been any breaches of the Cromien guidelines on semi-State companies in the case of semi-State bodies.  We have requested the Minister Deputy Lowry to lay details under the Cromien regulations before the House.  He has the confidential data and annual reports sent to the Minister.  If there have not been breaches why does the Taoiseach consider it necessary to employ 25 accountants for four weeks working day and night to justify an allegation made by the Minister?</P>

      <P>The debate which we are beginning today represents the culmination of many years of determined and dedicated work towards addressing the problems of those whose marriages have broken down.  Many tens of thousands of our citizens are involved in marriages which have broken down beyond hope of reconciliation, and which have in fact, if not in law, irretrievably come to an end.  It is their welfare that I wish to place at the heart of today's debate, and the debate which faces us in the weeks to come.</P>
      <P>A referendum on a Bill to amend the Constitution is a particularly solemn legislative procedure, involving the agreement of this House and the Seanad as a preliminary step to seeking the consent of the people.  Governments do not propose constitutional amendments lightly or without care or examination. The Bill which I commend to the House today has been the subject of the most extraordinarily detailed legal and policy examination over many months prior to its publication.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill is the latest stage of a careful and detailed programme of family law reform which has been pursued by successive Administrations.  Under each <Col N="15" /> and every Government over the past decade, including Governments involving both Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats, as well as the three parties now in Government, this careful package of legal reform has been constructed.</P>
    <P>Eighteen pieces of legislation have been introduced.  All of the issues arising on marriage breakdown have received attention &mdash; except the issue which this Bill is designed to address, the right to remarry.</P>
    <P>Much of the detailed work in preparing this Bill was done by the Cabinet sub-committee on divorce, and I would like to pay particular thanks to the members of that sub-committee, the Ministers for Finance, Health, Social Welfare, Justice and Defence and the Marine and the Attorney General, for the careful and detailed way in which the putting together of these proposals was approached.</P>
    <P>This Bill is accompanied by a Government paper, entitled <i>The Right to Remarry,</i> which sets out the detailed implications of divorce in relation to financial and legal issues such as maintenance, succession and pensions.  That paper also contains the full text of a 39-section draft Bill which would be introduced by the Government following a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote.</P>
    <P>In drawing up this draft Bill, and the associated Government paper, I and the staff of my Department have built upon the work of previous Administrations, but particularly on the White Paper on Marriage Breakdown published by the then Minister for Justice, Mr. Pádraig Flynn, in September 1992.  Mr. Flynn's paper was an excellent basis for the Government's work during the three years which followed its publication, and I would like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to him for his key role as Minister in laying the groundwork for today's debate.</P>
    <P>The White Paper set out the 1992 status of the work in progress on family law reform.  The <i>Right to Remarry</i> paper sets out the 1995 position, and I believe <Col N="16" /> it represents an exceptionally comprehensive survey of all of the issues of interest to people in connection with divorce.  In order to ensure wide access to the Government's information paper, I am arranging to have copies of the paper sent to every public library in the State, and every citizen's information bureau in the NSSB network, where it will be available for consultation.</P>
    <P>The Government has made a clear and reasoned case in favour of this amendment.  We will set out this case with integrity and commitment.  We have constructed a detailed legislative basis for the proposed amendment which we now bring before this House for approval.  We will set out our case for this amendment here and in every other forum available to us, in the confident belief that the Irish people will take this opportunity to vote &ldquo;yes&rdquo; for the right to remarry.  The Government has a duty and a responsibility to give the people all of the information they need in relation to this issue, and in relation to family law entitlements generally, and we will discharge that duty fully.  This Bill is not about party politics, about positioning oneself to appeal to this or that section of the community, or to maximise the benefits to oneself and it is not about scoring a political success.  The only success that matters is success for the approximately 75,000 people involved in broken marriages in putting their lives and their legal affairs in order at last.</P>
    <P>The Government welcomes the detailed debate on marriage breakdown. Ever since the decision to prepare a White Paper on Marriage Breakdown more than three years ago, family law reform has been high on the agenda of Governments.  The high priority given to family law has given rise to a sustained degree of analysis and debate. a healthy and positive development. The debate in this House today is neither the beginning nor the end of that national debate on marriage and the remedies for its breakdown, but it marks a distinct phase in the Government's commitment to come to terms <Col N="17" /> with social realities which have been ignored for so long.</P>
    <P>I cannot but observe that those who are sometimes loudest in calling for debate on this issue do not always give enough recognition to the debate which has already taken place.  Today we are not for the first time on a journey into unexplored legal territory.  Rather we are jumping on a moving train, which has already traversed a vast expanse of family laws and family services.</P>
    <P>In the sequence of events which led up to today's Bill, the role of Deputy Alan Shatter, must be recognised.  His far-seeing decision to introduce the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Bill in 1987 led to the enactment of the 1989 Act, which in turn became one of the principal foundations of the Family Law Bill, 1994, and the draft Family Law (Divorce) Bill, 1995.</P>
    <P>The development of services for the family and its members has also been an essential part of the Government's comprehensive approach.  The Government Paper <i>The Right to Remarry</i> sets out a number of the very many improvements in family services which have been made since the establishment of the Department of Equality and Law Reform in January 1993.  Since then, funding to marriage counselling services has dramatically increased, and the counselling sector has been revitalised.  The Family Mediation Service has seen its funding more than doubled and a development plan put in place.  The Legal Aid Service has seen its most radical nationwide expansion since its establishment 16 years ago.</P>
    <P>In developing these services, and in strengthening our family laws particular priority has been given to the protection of the welfare of children.  The rights and welfare of children will continue to be a priority for my Department and for Government.  I have asked my Department to undertake a review of the laws on guardianship of children generally, and I will give detailed consideration in that context to the helpful submission on children and marriage breakdown <Col N="18" /> published yesterday by Deputy Michael Woods.</P>
    <P>The Government has also taken the opportunity to look at divorce laws in other countries, and to see how we can address in an Irish context the concerns about some of those laws.</P>
    <P>We are determined to protect and support the institution of marriage and the family in so far as is possible.  We wish to ensure that divorce will not be available on an easy or casual basis.  We wish to guarantee that there will not be an adjustment or easing of the basic grounds for divorce without reference to the people.  For these and other reasons the Government has decided to propose to insert the basic conditions for divorce in the Constitution.  The people are acutely aware of their relationship with the Constitution.  They are its ultimate guardians and they appreciate that the Government is not seeking to take to itself the power to change, or make easier the grounds for divorce.  Instead, the Government is inviting the electorate to support a form of wording which cannot be changed without further consultation with the people.  This is the essence of democracy in action, and reflects an approach which has been considered carefully.</P>
    <P>The overwhelming majority of people who marry do so with idealism, hope and determination to make it work. Some marriages have clearly irretrievably broken down.  Many of the people affected have gone on to form subsequent long-lasting relationships within which children have been born.  The adult partners in such relationships have few legal protections in our society. They and their children are denied the sense of worth which comes from being a fully recognised family within the community although they are such a family in every way except in the eyes of the law.  One consequence of this referendum proposal, if it is approved by the people, is that it will enable these individuals to take on the dignity and status which is properly theirs.</P>
    <P>This Bill proposes that Article 41 of the Constitution be amended so that a <Col N="19" /> court may grant a dissolution of marriage only where it is satisfied that each of a number of specific conditions has been fulfilled.  The first of these is that, at the date of the institution of the proceedings, the spouses have lived apart for a period of, or periods amounting to, at least four years during the previous five years.  The term &ldquo;living apart&rdquo; is used in the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act, 1989, and it is also a familiar term in many other jurisdictions where it has been held that this phrase will clearly cover where the spouses have physically separated and are living in different places.  The case law also states that where domestic life is not shared it is possible for there to be two households under the one roof. The term &ldquo;living apart&rdquo; has a clear and settled meaning in the law, and I am satisfied that the courts will follow this meaning in a divorce context.</P>
    <P>The amendment also provides that the four-year period of separation can be cumulated over a five-year period. The reason for this is to allow a couple to make a reasonable attempt at reconciliation in the knowledge that, if it does not work out, they will not have lost their option to apply for divorce.  The four year period itself is a guarantee that spouses will not enter into divorce lightly, and that they will have the necessary time to reflect on the serious step which they are undertaking.  It may also encourage spouses to attempt to reach agreement on the terms of their separation in a way which will ensure that, if the divorce application does come before a court, many of the key elements relating to children, finance and property may already have been settled between the spouses.  In this way, the hearing itself may well be less acrimonious than it otherwise might be.</P>
    <P>Under this amendment, the terms on which individuals may obtain a divorce are real and substantial.  There will be no &ldquo;quickie&rdquo; divorce under this amendment. There will be no divorce culture under this amendment.  I have confidence in the innate common-sense of <Col N="20" /> the vast majority of Irish people to make a judgement that the Government's response to the problem posed by the inability of people in second relationships to remarry, which arises due to the absence of divorce, is a balanced and measured one.</P>
    <P>If the referendum is passed and divorce is introduced, people will not be able to enter into a marriage in the expectation that, if problems arise, divorce will offer them a speedy way out of their difficulties.  The terms of the constitutional amendment reflect this society's awareness that marriage is a process, that it needs to be worked at, and that it is intended to be a lifelong commitment.  However, where that commitment has come to an end, not today or yesterday, but many years ago, it is a denial of what we understand by marriage to demand that both spouses continue to be bound by a legal relationship which is devoid of real meaning.</P>
    <P>The second condition of which a court must be satisfied before a divorce will be granted concerns the absence of any reasonable prospect of a reconciliation between the spouses.  The fact that solicitors for both parties will already have discussed the prospects of reconciliation with their clients will, in most cases, be sufficient to indicate whether a genuine possibility of reconciliation exists. Clearly, if such a possibility exists, a divorce cannot be granted.  That is also the reason legislation will specify that the divorce proceedings may be adjourned at any time to enable the spouses, if they both so wish, to work towards a reconciliation.</P>
    <P>The third condition in the amendment is designed to ensure that vulnerable spouses and dependent children are provided for.  It ensures that the court must be satisfied, having regard to the circumstances, that proper provision exists or will be made for the spouses, any children of either or both of them and any other person prescribed by law. This last phrase is designed to cover a child where a spouse is <i>in loco parentis,</i> for example.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="21" /> As will be seen from an examination of the terms of the draft family law (divorce) Bill, the court will have extensive powers at its disposal, which parallel those already available to it in the context of judicial separation, to make financial and property adjustment orders in a way that is designed to do justice to both parties and to any dependent children of the family.</P>
    <P>These powers include the ability to make a maintenance order which can be either periodical or a lump sum payment. Orders for the direct deduction of maintenance out of the paying spouse's earnings may be made.  A property adjustment order, whereby property may be transferred either to a spouse or to a dependent child of the family is also possible.  Detailed provisions will govern the position relating to occupational pensions so that, for example, a court may &ldquo;earmark&rdquo; a portion of the retirement benefit of the spouse who is a member of a pension scheme.  In this way, when that person dies, the benefit will be paid directly to the former spouse.  It will also be open to a former spouse to &ldquo;split&rdquo; the pension benefit so as to create an entitlement to an independent and separate benefit.  The position with regard to succession rights is also dealt with comprehensively.</P>
    <P>The draft divorce Bill also provides, as does the current legislation which allows for judicial separation, that in the making of all financial and property orders the court must have regard to a very broad range of matters so that the circumstances of both spouses can be evaluated in full.  In particular, the vital contribution of a spouse who has chosen to look after the home and care for the family cannot be overlooked and must be taken into account by the court when it comes to the overall adjustment of property.</P>
    <P>The fourth condition in the amendment is that a court must be satisfied that any further conditions prescribed by law are complied with.  In the draft divorce Bill, an example of such a condition would be the condition that the Irish courts could dissolve a marriage <Col N="22" /> only if one spouse had been living in Ireland for a year or was domiciled here when the case began.</P>
    <P>This Bill, as I have already indicated, cannot be seen in isolation.  It has been preceded, over the past decade, by a raft of legislation in the family area which is designed to support the family, both materially and otherwise.  It is accompanied by a draft Bill which clearly spells out the detailed provisions which would apply if divorce is introduced here, In addition, counselling and mediation services are in place which will assist couples who wish to obtain guidance in resolving differences in their marriages or who are willing to negotiate separation agreements on an amicable basis.</P>
    <P>Legal aid will be available to individuals seeking a divorce in the same way as it is now available to persons seeking a judicial separation.</P>
    <P>The Social Welfare (No. 2) Act, 1995, ensures that a divorced person will not be at a loss in terms of his or her social welfare entitlements.  Detailed taxation provisions have been devised which, in essence, will mean that divorced couples will be treated the same way for income tax purposes as separated couples.  Similarly, property transfers between former spouses on foot of a court order governing a divorce settlement will be exempted from all capital taxes.  Taken together, these provisions amount to a package which ensures that divorce, if introduced here, will be underpinned by firm legislative supports and will not operate in a vacuum.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to be able to inform the House that the Department of Foreign Affairs is making arrangements on my behalf to ratify the UN and European Union conventions on maintenance within the near future.  This will enable me to make an order giving effect to the maintenance Act shortly.</P>
    <P>When the body of family legislation which has been put in place over the past decade is taken as a whole, and put in the context of the comprehensive package of services and measures developed by Government, one fact, <Col N="23" /> essential to this debate, is highlighted. The problems of marriage are with us already.  The costs of marriage breakdown, both social and financial, are with us already.  Those problems and costs must be faced by society, independently of the proposed referendum, and that is what we have been addressing over the past decade.  What this Bill proposes to add is to give legal recognition to the fact that unfortunately some marriages can and do irretrievably come to an end, and to enable the option to be given to the parties, if they so wish, to remarry.</P>
    <P>This House has a duty to approach this issue with responsibility and care. There will be many voices who will urge on us a narrower view of our responsibilities as parliamentarians, or who will put forward closed or curtailed versions of society or our social objectives.  But our role is to take the broad view &mdash; to address the welfare of the people and the reality of their lives, even where that reality has fallen short of their hopes and aspirations.</P>
    <P>Members of this House are asked on an almost daily basis to help people experiencing legal, administrative, or practical difficulties of one kind or another.  We know as well as anybody the extent of the problem of marriage breakdown that exists in Ireland today, and the increasing difficulties being created by the failure of the law and Constitution to recognise the reality of that problem.</P>
    <P>For all of these reasons, the Government has brought this Bill before this House and is seeking the approval both of the Houses of the Oireachtas and of the people for our proposals.  I hope, in the weeks ahead, that while Government and Opposition will inevitably have differences in emphasis, we can find common cause in seeking a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote in the referendum in November.</P>
    <P>The weeks ahead will provide many opportunities for us to set out our case with clarity and detail.  I am confident that when the Irish people are asked, as they will be on 24 November, whether they are willing to recognise in law the <Col N="24" /> situations of so many tens of thousands of people in this country, and to accord to them, if they so wish, the right to remarry, the answer they will give will be &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Fianna Fáil Party supports the principle of changing the Constitution to allow for remarriage and will support the passage of this Bill through the Oireachtas.  The party is deeply committed to upholding in a positive way the primary role of the family in Irish society but this includes support, understanding and the provision of legal remedies for families involved in marriages that break down. We regard as particularly important the inclusion of children, vulnerable spouses and other family members in the Fifteenth Amendment of the Constitution (No. 2) Bill.</P>
      <P>We have made it clear that we will not support quickie divorces.  That is why we sought the four year gap between breakdown and divorce to allow for counselling, reconciliation and a period of adjustment, especially for children. The wisdom of this approach is confirmed by the findings of our recent research into the effects of marital breakdown/divorce on children.  Apart from the opportunity this gap provides for counselling and reconciliation, it also provides a crucial period for children to adjust to the emotional and psychological trauma.</P>
      <P>We saw the need to underpin the serious commitment involved in marriage and the high regard in which we hold that institution as the fundamental unit of society.  Our approach is based on balancing responsibility for the family with compassion for those whose marriages have broken down and who wish to remarry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has met the criteria which we considered essential in framing this document.  Accordingly, we support the Bill.  It may be inconvenient but security for children must be copperfastened in the Constitution.  We intend to press for the strongest possible support <Col N="25" /> and protection for children in the divorce legislation because they are the most vulnerable and most frequently harmed by the disharmony and acrimony which is often experienced in marriage breakdown and divorce.</P>
    <P>Why should we support this amendment? The issue of divorce and remarriage is a difficult one for Irish society. We have a strong family tradition on which we place great value.  Over 95 per cent of marriages in Ireland are still recorded as intact.  This compares favourably with over 80 per cent in the UK and over 70 per cent in the USA. However, the rate of breakdown and separation in Ireland has accelerated over recent years.  The rate of marriage breakdown <i>vis-á-vis</i> new marriages in 1994 has reached an alarming rate of one in six marriages.  We now have a significant number of people who want to remarry.  They come from within the 75,000 people who were recorded in 1994 as being from broken marriages. The key issue for society is how to respond to the demand from a growing number of our citizens for the right to remarry.  There is also a demand from others for divorce so that they can end an unhappy, acrimonious marriage and broken relationship.</P>
    <P>We recognise that in providing a right to remarry additional problems &mdash; over and above those which arise at present from marital breakdown &mdash; may arise by virtue of remarriage.  We are already dealing with the disharmony and damage which result from breakdown and separation.  We must now address in a calm, considerate, caring and practical way the extra difficulties which can occur as a result of remarriage.  Most of the problems are already there; the extra challenge is to focus our minds and actions on the supportive work in which we should already have been deeply engaged in tackling the problem of marital breakdown.</P>
    <P>In supporting this Bill we look forward to the Government putting in place a five year strategic action plan to address and provide solutions for the downside aspects of marital breakdown, <Col N="26" /> separation and divorce.  Should the Government fail to implement such a programme we will do so on return to office.  The programme should be put on the table before the referendum takes place and it should include the five year strategic action plan.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's comment that he will give detailed consideration before the referendum to our submissions and to the paper we presented earlier.  Under the five year action plan &mdash; which we believe to be particularly important &mdash; many actions can be taken. The Minister might suggest some and I will suggest a number which will highlight the important issues.</P>
    <P>We need to address the declining status of marriage, particularly in the perception of young people.  There were 18,573 marriages in 1986; by 1994 the number had declined to 16,297.  In practical terms, the lack of a job and the inability to get a house or to get or sustain a mortgage have a devastating effect on those who wish to marry.  It also puts marriages under extreme pressure during the early years.  All TDs will be aware of such problems from their constituency work.</P>
    <P>We are also faced with important changes in the workplace.  Increasingly, both parents are likely to continue to work either full-time or part-time. Arrangements in the workplace in relation to childcare will be necessary to keep pace with developments in the status of the family in our society.  The taxation system should enhance the family and should support families with children, especially where incomes are low.  As part of the current programme, the Minister for Finance should set up a review committee to make proposals for the development of the tax system to enhance the position of families and especially families with children.</P>
    <P>It is essential that we have a skilled, professional counselling service throughout the country that is adequate to meet demand.  At present, the need for counselling is met by voluntary organisations for which extra funding has been provided in recent years.  They <Col N="27" /> have built up a highly professional service and they should receive the funding they need to provide a service to all who need it throughout the country.</P>
    <P>It is essential to ensure that this service is availed of by all those whose marriages are in difficulty.  It would be a tragedy if the opportunity to resolve marital disharmony and preserve families intact were neglected or ignored because, perhaps, one or even both spouses were focused solely on reaching separation or divorce.  The divorce Bill, therefore, should contain a provision which would oblige the spouses in separation or divorce situations to participate in counselling.  Proof of meaningful participation should be an essential prerequisite for securing a divorce from the court.  The proof could take the form of a certificate from the counselling service or a similar document.  This approach would ensure that counselling is not overlooked, neglected or deliberately avoided by people who might be excessively focused on the separation or divorce.</P>
    <P>There must be a positive programme of financial support for less well off families who are experiencing marital disharmony. The State supports families under stress through various measures, including household budgeting, money advice centres and personal development courses.  These are valuable in tackling the roots of the problems which cause tension.  The problem of inadequate housing, in particular, should be examined in the context of being a contributory factor to marital breakdown.</P>
    <P>It is important that young people are educated and prepared for marriage as a lifelong relationship.  The schools curriculum can be used for this purpose. Children and young people should learn about the importance of marriage as a source of well being for most adults and of its importance for the stability and general welfare of society.  They should be educated to see lifelong marriage as a desirable status for adult life.  The <Col N="28" /> Government should develop an educational programme of this kind as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>We need better support and time out for parents who care for children and people with disabilities in the home.  A start has been made in the social welfare area, but this should be followed up by a system of credits which recognise the value to society of such work in the home, to help families, particularly those where husband and wife are working, to deal with marital difficulty. Legislation should be introduced to provide for &ldquo;time out&rdquo; or leave where one or both need to devolve time to preserving the marriage.  Periods of leave of this kind might be appropriate while the couple are engaged in counselling or mediation.</P>
    <P>Where all efforts to save a marriage fail and separation and-or divorce is taking place, in order to minimise the harmful emotional and psychological effects on children and to minimise the emotional trauma being suffered by parents, it is essential that there is available throughout the country a skilled professional mediation service.  Whatever resources are needed to put such a service in place must be set aside for this purpose.  The current level of expenditure, at £300,000, is entirely inadequate to support a nationwide service.</P>
    <P>We are concerned about how pension rights can be resolved in mediation given that, under section 11 of the Family Law Bill, 1995, passed last week, it appears that it will be necessary to get a court order to split pensions.  Perhaps the Minister could clarify this position in his reply.  If it is necessary to get a court order this will, of course, deter people from mediation.  We believe that mediation is particularly important and valuable and it is important to develop a national network of mediation services. We are not looking for compulsory mediation, as takes place in some countries, because it is almost a conflict of terms in itself and we recognise that.  We feel that information is somewhat different and people should at least have to <Col N="29" /> avail of the information, particularly in relation to children.</P>
    <P>In order to establish objectively and as precisely as possible the effects of marital disharmony, separation, divorce and remarriage on children, the Fianna Fáil committee set up to advise the parliamentary party on all aspects of marriage breakdown undertook an examination of this topic.  This committee has available to it the best expertise in the field of psychiatry and child psychiatry. At the request of the committee, these experts conducted a study of available professional literature on this topic. They produced a paper which reviewed the outcome of over 200 studies conducted world-wide to ascertain the effects on children of marriage breakdown and divorce.</P>
    <P>The conclusions which they drew from these studies are briefly as follows. In the short term, the first one to three years of marital conflict, through separation and/or divorce and remarriage, children can suffer significant emotional and psychological harm.  In the long term, some children suffered serious long term social disadvantage characterised by poorer educational and career achievement and a predisposition to marital disharmony.</P>
    <P>In supporting this Bill, we do so on the basis of these downside effects and on the grounds that they are recognised and addressed.  The first step in that direction should be that real protection for the interests of children will be built into the divorce legislation.  The welfare of children in this context must be given due status and consideration.  I am happy that the Minister, in a helpful way, is prepared to look at that aspect immediately.</P>
    <P>In order to ensure adequate protection for children in practice, we believe that there must be a statutory officer whose job it would be to ensure that the interests of children are vindicated by the courts in disputes between the parents. Thus, we propose that there be a commissioner for children attached to the courts who would be responsible for <Col N="30" /> highlighting to parents the needs of children in marriage breakdown/divorce and for pressing the needs of children in court where necessary.  It could also be helpful if parents had to go through an information session on the short- and long term effects on their children of the marital breakdown/divorce, to advise them on the legal implications of guardianship, custody and access for themselves and for their children, and on the potential financial cost of separation and divorce.</P>
    <P>The greatly extended civil legal aid network provided by the Fianna Fáil/Labour Government is now meeting needs in a much more realistic way. We now have a nationwide network of 30 law centres and £6.2 million per annum in Exchequer funding.  The introduction of divorce would lead to a greatly increased demand for the service provided by the legal aid system over the first few years.  It is important, in the five year programme, to make allowance for that and to ensure that the service is provided over that period.</P>
    <P>Since the introduction of judicial separation in 1989 we have seen a huge increase in the number of family law cases going through the court system.  In the event that this amendment is passed, we must be prepared for another large increase in family law litigation, at least in the short term.  At present, there is only one Circuit Court judge assigned to hear judicial separation cases for the whole of Dublin.  In country towns, the Circuit Court hears family law cases for only one day every three months &mdash; that is only four days a year.  Delays of over a year or 18 months are average before a person gets his or her case to court.</P>
    <P>Apart from the shortage of judges, facilities are clearly inadequate.  People who are contesting family law cases often find themselves in a draughty corridor opposite the spouse who caused them so much pain, waiting for hours until their case can be heard.  Courthouses rarely have enough private consultation rooms or comfortable waiting rooms for the dozens of people who attend every day.  Even without the <Col N="31" /> introduction of divorce, this situation cannot be allowed to continue.</P>
    <P>As part of our five year strategic action plan, we call on the Government to introduce the following: at least three new Circuit Court judges to deal exclusively with family law, one to be based permanently in Dublin; a separate family law court with a specialist judge in the country areas, as is currently the practice in Dublin; and the upgrading of courthouses to provide private consultation rooms and at least two waiting rooms so that spouses do not have to wait together.  These three positions should be put in place as early as possible, so that the system will be ready for divorce cases, if they come on stream in two years' time.</P>
    <P>We would also recommend a comprehensive review of the family law court system at the end of the five year period. We are not asking the Government to agree instantly to these proposals because we know it will take time to deal with them.  However, we feel it is particularly important in advance of the referendum to put the cards on the table, say what will be done and make the commitments here and now on a time scale of over five years.  This is reasonable but also very necessary and we ask the Government to proceed along these lines.</P>
    <P>There has been much controversy surrounding the Government's apparent plans to spend £500,000 on a PR campaign to promote a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote in the referendum. I say &ldquo;apparent&rdquo; plans because I do not know what the position is at this stage.  I am totally confused and the Government itself seems confused as to what exactly it will do.  In my view the Government has a clear right to put forward its own proposals and advocate their acceptance.  As the decision makers in a referendum are the people, the Government has a responsibility to ensure that both sides of the issue are adequately ventilated so that the people can make a fully informed decision.  In that context it is clear that a heavily <Col N="32" /> financed PR campaign on one side without a similar campaign on the other is not conducive to achieving the balanced flow of information which would enable the people to make the best decision.</P>
    <P>Before the House rose for the summer recess, I asked the Minister to consider this aspect and to try to ensure balance. During the summer Deputy O'Rourke also called for balance in this area.  Our spokesperson on the environment, Deputy Dempsey, suggested the present commission to resolve this problem.  This was accepted in principle by the Government although I think Deputy Dempsey would have preferred if it had gone further.  Consequently, for this occasion we have a commission with a limited brief and resources.  For the future a parliamentary commission should be established to oversee the holding of a referendum and to distribute a specified budget to ensure balance. Even at this late stage the Minister should tell the House what his plans are in regard to funding a PR campaign in this referendum.  I hope he will do so when he is replying to this debate.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil has been entirely constructive on this important issue since it was raised in the 1986 referendum. Since that time many of the deficiencies which were then identified by us have been put right by Fianna Fáil led Governments.  The Minister referred to 18 Acts and he is right when he says that a major body of legislation has been implemented in the interim.  We now have a substantial body of modern legislation to cater for marriage breakdown. We also have greatly improved the support services for those involved.  While I would be critical of these services in some respects.  I fully recognise there has been considerable improvement, more so in some cases than in others. Coping with the consequences of marriage breakdown, separation and divorce is an ongoing process.</P>
    <P>We support this Bill as being appropriate at this time.  We support the placing in the Constitution of these important provisions.  We called for it in advance, we were sincere in what we <Col N="33" /> said, we believe the Minister is right in what he has done and he will have our support.  We also rely on the Government to put in place the additional measures we have identified to address the downside effects of marriage breakdown, separation and divorce.  If we address these measures, everybody in the House can be satisfied with what we will have done.  This is the desire of every Deputy.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>Dáil Éireann&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  conscious of the desire of many people to amend the Constitution by repealing the absolute ban on divorce, and</P>
      <P>(ii)  being of the opinion that it would be inappropriate to insert in the Constitution detailed and specific conditions for the granting of divorce, declines now to read the Bill a second time.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before I explain our reasons for moving this amendment and consider the detailed provisions of the Bill.  I wish to make one matter crystal clear.  Since the day the Progressive Democrats were founded, we have supported the lifting of the constitutional ban on divorce.  It has been a central plank in our policy <Col N="34" /> for ten years and during that time we have not altered our position one iota. I bury any notion that the Progressive Democrats have changed tack on that issue.  If there is any doubt in anybody's mind, let it be buried forever.</P>
    <P>This party also believes the Government is making a fundamental mistake in inserting in the Constitution the conditions on which divorce will be granted. The House should not need to be reminded of the catastrophic consequences which flowed from the well meaning but ultimately misguided abortion amendment of 1983.  The trauma of the X case, the bitterly divisive debate which followed it and the three constitutional amendments which were required to clean up that mess should have shown the House in no uncertain terms that it is folly to attempt to legislate by way of constitutional amendment.</P>
    <P>Trying to put the terms into the Constitution shows the House in a bad light. It indicates we do not learn from experience. The Progressive Democrats believe we must learn from experience. In this case experience has relentlessly shown that the Constitution should not be used when legislative action is more appropriate.  To use an analogy, it is like using an articulated lorry to deliver a letter.  The letter will arrive and this is better than it not arriving but it is grossly out of proportion in that it misuses the truck and energy.  Using the Constitution for this purpose is a precedent of which nobody in this House should be proud and, if followed in years to come, it will trivialise and damage civic understanding of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>That being said, we welcome the fact that the electorate is being given the opportunity to vote on the question of whether to lift the divorce ban.  Like many other groups, such as the Church of Ireland, and like many legal commentators, we believe that the manner in which the question is phrased is wrong. This has always been our position and it is why I was so outraged when the Minister accused us of having done &ldquo;an <Col N="35" /> extraordinary U-turn&rdquo; on this issue.  His attack was based on a statement I made in the House on 26 March 1993, during the debate on the White Paper on Marital Breakdown.  I am not entirely clear how he arrived at this conclusion.  The position appears to be that he inferred from what I said on that occasion that I supported the notion of inserting the detailed conditions for divorce into the Constitution.  He is wrong.  The Dáil Official Report of 26 March 1993 shows that I said the following:</P>
    <P>Since its foundation the Progressive Democrats have actively supported and worked for the repeal of the provision in the Constitution which provides that no law shall be enacted providing for the grant of a dissolution of marriage.  Should the remainder of Article 41 be left in place?  A question arises as to whether any constitutional amendment should be a simple deletion or whether there should be an insertion that the State can enact laws providing for the dissolution of marriage.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats Party is committed to far reaching constitutional reform, but even if there is to be a single issue referendum in the lifetime of this Government on divorce, the exact nature of the amendment is still a matter on which we have to proceed carefully.  It would be a major mistake to insert into the Constitution a set of circumstances in which divorce can be granted.  The Constitution is not the place for such provisions.  The last attempt of the Fine Gael-Labour Coalition to deal with the issue by referendum was unduly complex and we suffered because of that.  If simple deletion is possible having regard to Article 41.3 that would be preferable, but perhaps a new Article is necessary.  I put forward the following wording for discussion:</P>
    <P>That the State may, however, by its laws provide for the grant of a dissolution of a marriage where it is determined in accordance with such laws <Col N="36" /> that such a marriage has irretrievably broken down and that such a dissolution would be just.</P>
    <P>In the past we have seen that complexity in a referendum leads to its own problems.  It would be a fundamental mistake to set out in the Constitution any condition for irretrievable breakdown, or any preconditions for divorce.  The proper place for that is in statute law.</P>
    <P>The statement I made then set out clearly a policy in favour of divorce but against the insertion of the conditions for divorce into the Constitution.  It is a position which I and my party colleagues have held consistently ever since.  It is a position we have stated publicly and which, as the Minister very well knows, we have also expressed to him in private forcefully and repeatedly. I am at a loss to understand how the Minister can accuse me or my party of having done a U-turn in the light of what the Dáil record shows.</P>
    <P>If the Minister or his advisers had taken the trouble to read the contributions to the debate that followed, he would see that my views were supported by the Democratic Left speaker, Deputy Eamon Gilmore, who is now a Minister of State, as well as by Deputy Joe Costello of the Labour Party and Deputy Trevor Sargent of the Green Party.  Furthermore, the Minister, in column 1063, actually congratulated me for my &ldquo;very constructive contribution&rdquo; to the debate.  So if anyone has made a U-turn it is not me.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister and his colleagues in Government will now call a ceasefire in the phoney war and the political misrepresentation. Sniping is fruitless, misleading and dangerous because it diverts the electorate's attention and the Minister's energies from the real issues in this debate.</P>
    <P>The Minister rightly said the Bill is not about party politics, and that is the way we should proceed.  A constitutional referendum is the only medium <Col N="37" /> through which the people have an opportunity to directly make law.  This referendum is of crucial, even historic, significance both for society at large and for the many people whose marriages have broken down and who are now living in a state of legal limbo.</P>
    <P>The amendment has been brought before the House by the Progressive Democrats because of our strong conviction that the Government's intention to enshrine the conditions for divorce in the Constitution is a fundamental error. We would be shirking our duty as legislators if we did not do everything in our power to try to persuade this House to change its mind.</P>
    <P>The Government's proposed amendment will insert into the Constitution four separate conditions for granting a divorce.  Before considering the effect the provisions will have in practice, it is important to remind this House that there are other Articles of the Constitution which the courts will be obliged to take into account when interpreting the amendment and when applying any legislation that may later be passed on foot of the amendment.</P>
    <P>Article 41.1 of the Constitution provides that:</P>
    <P>1º The State recognises the Family as the natural primary and fundamental unit group of Society, and as a moral institution possessing inalienable and imprescriptible rights, antecedent and superior to all positive law.</P>
    <P>2º The State, therefore, guarantees to protect the Family in its constitution and authority, as the necessary basis of social order and as indispensable to the welfare of the Nation and the State.</P>
    <P>Article 41.3.1º, the subsection which also contains the prohibition on divorce, provides that:</P>
    <P>The State pledges itself to guard with special care the institution of Marriage, on which the Family is founded, and to protect it against attack.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="38" /> The effect of these provisions on the interpretation of the proposed amendment, and any legislation which may be brought on foot of it, is immeasurable. Given the strong degree of protection they provide for the family based on marriage, it is impossible to avoid the conclusion that judges will be constitutionally obliged to give the new amendment the narrowest possible interpretation.  I will return to that point later.</P>
    <P>On the specific provisions of the amendment, the first and key provision is that couples will only be able to apply for a divorce where they have lived apart from one another for a period of or periods amounting to at least four years during the previous five years. This provision will rapidly become the single most litigated provision in the Constitution.  Although, on their ordinary meaning, these words appear to me &mdash; and I believe to most people &mdash; to require the couple concerned to have lived separately in separate accommodation for the four year period, the Minister has stated his belief, reiterated here today, that judges will come to interpret this phrase in a broad way so as to permit couples who live separate lives under the same roof to apply for a divorce.</P>
    <P>It is certainly true that in other jurisdictions courts have interpreted similar provisions in this manner.  For example, in England the concept of desertion has come to include not only the physical withdrawal from a place but also a mental withdrawal from a marriage. However, this analysis ignores the fact that Irish constitutional law, unlike that in other countries, requires the State &mdash; and this includes judges who are engaged in interpreting the law &mdash;&ldquo;to guard with special care the institution of marriage&rdquo; in the language of Article 41.3.1º, and &ldquo;to protect the family in its constitution&rdquo; in the language of Article 41.1.2º.</P>
    <P>These Articles will place a constitutional obligation upon judges to interpret the phrase &ldquo;living apart from one <Col N="39" /> another&rdquo; in the narrowest possible manner. In practical terms this will require couples to separate fully before there will be any possibility of a divorce being granted to them.  Before the full impact of the proposed amendment can be appreciated it will be necessary for the Supreme Court to pronounce upon it.</P>
    <P>The interpretation of the phrase &ldquo;living apart&rdquo; is of more than just academic or theoretical importance.  It will, for example, be of huge practical significance for people living in local authority housing.  As those of us who are involved at local level know, no one will be re-housed by their local authority unless he is regarded as homeless. Where a couple separates amicably by way of a formal or informal separation agreement, the local authority will not re-house the person who is leaving the family home since he or she is regarded as having voluntarily made himself or herself homeless.</P>
    <P>If the spouse who is leaving is to be re-housed, local authorities currently require the separating couple to obtain a court order, known as a property transfer order, directing the spouse concerned to vacate the property.  Only then will that spouse be placed on the local authority waiting list, and we all know how long such waiting lists are.</P>
    <P>The only way this order can be obtained is under the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act, 1989.  In other words, couples who are in this situation &mdash; no matter how amicable the separation and even if all issues of maintenance and custody are agreed &mdash; must go to court for a judicial separation before they can actually start a new life in separate homes.  The option of going to their solicitor and negotiating a separation agreement will be closed to them.  To these couples the question of how living apart is to be interpreted is of more than theoretical interest.</P>
    <P>Should the courts decide that the wording permits couples who have been living separate lives under the same roof to apply for a divorce, they will have the <Col N="40" /> option, at least, of attempting to struggle through the requisite four years under the same roof.  Whether that is a good thing for the individuals concerned or, in a very acrimonious situation, whether it is a good thing for the children, is open to question.</P>
    <P>However, if the Minister is wrong and the courts decide that couples must live separately in separate accommodation for four years, the picture is very different. Couples who are the tenants of local authority housing will be forced to apply for and obtain a judicial separation before the four years can even start to run.  This is grossly unfair.  Tenants of local authority housing will be at a huge disadvantage in terms of costs and delay.</P>
    <P>People rich enough, however, will be able to start the four year clock running as soon as they wish after the marriage has broken down.  They will be able to go their separate ways as informally or formally as they choose.  The clock will start to run as soon as one spouse packs his or her bags.</P>
    <P>By contrast, tenants of local authority housing will have to wait to see a solicitor. They may have to wait for many months if they require an appointment at a law centre.  They will then have to apply for their judicial separation.  The costs attached to that may be considerable but the delays may be even more considerable.  In a non-contested case they may have to wait for six months, while in a contested case they may have to wait for two or more years.</P>
    <P>The Minister has repeatedly stated that it will not be necessary for couples who wish to divorce to get a judicial separation. While there is no requirement in the proposed amendment or in the proposed divorce legislation that couples do this, the Minister has ignored the danger that many couples will, for practical reasons, be forced to get a judicial separation whether they want one or not.  This may add a further two years to the process of obtaining a divorce for some couples.  After they have completed their four year separation, couples may then be forced to wait for <Col N="41" /> a further two years pending the hearing of their divorce application.  Given that every contested case is appealable and could lead to a constitutional action, it will be almost impossible for lawyers to advise their clients on when the process of obtaining a divorce will reach a final conclusion.  This means there will be no quickie divorce.</P>
    <P>In this climate of uncertainty and confusion, with the lengthy delays inherent in the amendment, many couples will separate at the first sign of trouble in order to start the four year clock running. I do not believe that people, particularly women, will delay getting into a second relationship and starting a second family.  In other words, this wording militates against what should be the Government's two principal objectives, encouraging couples to stay together and regularising the position of second families.  At present, it could take up to two years to obtain a judicial separation.  People will then have to wait a further four years before applying for a divorce and then it could take them a further two years to get into the divorce court &mdash; a total of eight years. Unless there is a substantial increase in the number of judges and court resources, court delays will substantially increase.</P>
    <P>The Government's recently published information paper on the divorce referendum states that in 1994 there were 3,000 applications for a judicial separation and 4,400 applications for barring orders.  If these applicants applied for a divorce, the number of applications to the Circuit Court would increase from 3,000 to 7,400.  A percentage of the 75,000 people who are already separated must be added to that figure.</P>
    <P>There are other difficulties with the wording which the Government seeks to enshrine in our Constitution.  The second condition requires the judge to satisfy himself or herself that there is no reasonable prospect that the spouses can be reconciled.  In other words, there will now be a constitutional imperative on judges to ensure that there is no reasonable prospect of a reconciliation <Col N="42" /> between the spouses and that proper provision, having regard to circumstances, exists or will be made for the spouses, for children of either or both of them and for any other person prescribed by law.</P>
    <P>Court hearings will, therefore, have to be more detailed and judges will be constitutionally obliged to take more time over each case in order to satisfy themselves of the complete financial circumstances of the parties and the arrangements for the children.  Judges will not be able to accept without inquiry even consent orders, where people have agreed all terms of the divorce order and where there is no acrimony.  They will still have to satisfy the judge in relation to financial arrangements and arrangements for the children.  Furthermore, judges will have to inquire into the background of the marriage in order to satisfy themselves that there is no prospect of a reconciliation.</P>
    <P>I do not think anyone can predict how judges will interpret their constitutional obligation to ensure that there is no reasonable prospect of a reconciliation. Some judges may take the view that any couple who has reached the divorce court must of necessity be unable to be reconciled.  Other judges may take a more subjective view of the matter.  If one spouse contests the divorce and states that he or she wishes to try again despite everything, is a judge required to take that person's word for it?  Is the judge required to direct the couple to try again?  We do not know.  However, we know that judges have little or no experience of family law, that they do not receive any formal post-qualification training in the area and that, in default, many judges have nothing to fall back on but their own experience of family life, whether good, bad or indifferent.</P>
    <P>I agree that judges should be trained and that there should be comprehensive support services for married couples and the family, especially counselling and mediation services.  I welcome the fact that increased resources have been <Col N="43" /> made available in those areas but it saddens me that it takes a divorce referendum to focus attention on family life. We must deal compassionately with those who are in need of our support and we must care for children in particular. This <i>quid pro quo</i> sends out all the wrong signals in relation to divorce.</P>
    <P>Divorce will not cause marital breakdown because that is already a sad reality.  I agree with the Minister who said:</P>
    <P>The problems of marriage breakdown are with us already.  The costs of marriage breakdown, both social and financial, are with us already.  Those problems and costs must be faced by society...</P>
    <P>My party wants to see those who want a loving relationship to be acknowledged by the State and given that opportunity.  I wish the Government would accept that there is a better way to do this.  I have highlighted some of the difficulties with the proposed amendment to the Constitution.  The issue of divorce and the type of divorce regime to be introduced will always be a vexed and controversial one.  That is one of the reasons it is wrong to enshrine it in the Constitution.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak in the House on the Fifteenth Amendment of the Constitution (No. 2) Bill, 1995, which represents the Government's determination to present the people on Friday, 24 November, with a careful and responsible approach to the removal of the ban on divorce from the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Today's debate marks the culmination of many months of painstaking and often tedious work by my colleague, the Minister for Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Taylor.  I am conscious that the Minister has devoted three years of hard work to identifying and closing loopholes that have existed in the area of family law reform.  I take this <Col N="44" /> opportunity to acknowledge the work of the Cabinet subcommittee which has devoted many hours to considering the many complex issues involved in the area of family law and divorce and has ensured that the proposals we are debating today have the full support of every Member and, I hope, will gain the support of the majority of the House.</P>
    <P>It is only right that the Government should have invested so much time and thought in preparing and presenting the people with a balanced and commonsense approach to the right to remarry. The people have now been presented with the most carefully prepared and well informed campaign in the history of constitutional referenda.  The Government has approached this debate with clarity and vision.  We realise that we face a period of intense but, I hope, open and honest debate.  I hope that in the course of that debate we succeed in avoiding the politics of fear which in the past have caused so much hurt and destruction.  Deputy Keogh's contribution attempted to scatter seeds of destruction.  The Progressive Democrats' amendment demonstrates political antics and posturing.  I remind the House that the 1986 wording also included the terms on which a divorce may be granted &mdash; this inclusion of the terms in the constitutional amendment was not a political issue at the time.  The Progressive Democrats supported putting the conditions of divorce into the Constitution as a means of providing guarantees for the people.</P>
    <P>Why have the Progressive Democrats chosen to express their opposition in this manner while maintaining they support the introduction of divorce?  They are certainly creating doubt among their own supporters.  I consider the Progressive Democrats' amendment and the arguments they have put forward a non-issue. Any attempt to make a comparison between the wording of the 1983 amendment and the wording before the House today is simply a non-runner. The 1983 amendment expressed a vague statement of principle while the wording <Col N="45" /> today is clear, precise and easily understandable.</P>
    <P>As politicians we all have a very acute sense of realism about the removal of the ban on divorce from the Constitution. At present divorce is prohibited in all circumstances and, as legislators, we have no power to introduce any from of divorce without the approval of the people.  Therefore, the Government has taken the decision to provide the people with a constitutional wording that not only removes the ban on divorce but also spells out clearly the conditions for divorce.  The people who are the creators of the Constitution, will have the ultimate sanction to give vigorous effect to the Government's fifteenth amendment.  As democratic legislators I hope we will soon be in a position to dispose of the Progressive Democrats' concerns and that all parties in this House will work together in what is our definitive objective &mdash; the removal of the ban on divorce.</P>
    <P>Since 1993 the Minister has succeeded in completing a major programme of family law reform.  He has built on the work carried out by successive Governments. Over the last decade a series of measures have been introduced to create a legal framework which reflects the fact that marriage breakdown has become a sad reality of Irish life and that the State needs to take a very forceful role in ensuring that the rights of children and spouses are protected. Thus, a careful and thoughtful package of measures has been put together to strengthen our family law, update mediation services for families and improve provisions on the welfare of children, maintenance, property, pensions, domestic violence, civil legal aid and many other issues.</P>
    <P>It has been clear throughout that time that the process of family law reform could not be completed without addressing the issue of remarriage.  The net issue that remains, after all the legislative and administrative changes of the last ten years, is whether there should exist in this country the right to remarry for those whose existing marriages have <Col N="46" /> irretrievably broken down.  The Government is convinced that to continue to deny such a right would represent a grave injustice to many thousands of our citizens.  That is why we are asking the people on Friday, 24 November, to vote in favour of change, remove the constitutional ban on divorce and replace it with the carefully considered wording that is before the House today.</P>
    <P>At the centre of the proposed wording is the Government's support for the family and the institution of marriage. The authenticity of this support can be seen in the package of action, involving both laws and services, to prevent marriage breakdown in so far as possible and to provide mediation services for couples and children when irretrievable breakdown occurs.  There has been a dramatic increase in Department of Equality and Law Reform funding for marriage counselling organisations which provide pre-marriage counselling and assist marriages under stress.</P>
    <P>The Government has introduced legislation to raise the age of marriage from 16 to 18 and to require three months' notice of intention to marry.  In addition the State has radically increased the funding of the family mediation service and I understand a new blueprint for the service is in the process of being implemented.  This will ensure a more widely available service for families throughout the country.  The Government recognises the family as a fundamental part of our society and is committed to legislation designed to help families.  The Government has set up a commission on the family to advise on family issues in the context of a changing economic and social environment.</P>
    <P>Despite all the good intentions in the world, relationships can and do break down.  We all know of people whose marriages have broken down and we all know of people whose only wish is for a second chance.  I believe these people should have that right.  It is against this background, the development of a balanced and commonsense package of family law reform, that the State is now <Col N="47" /> recommending to the people the recognition of the right to remarry.  Support for the Government's wording on Friday, 24 November, will create a more tolerant and compassionate society for all our citizens.</P>
    <P>It is a reality of Irish life that, despite the absence of a right to remarry, marriage breakdown has continued to exist and, unfortunately, increase in Ireland. The latest Labour Force Survey indicates that 75,000 people are involved in broken marriages.  No right to remarry has not meant no marriage breakdown. The absence of divorce in Ireland has not safeguarded those spouses and children who have witnessed the disintegration of their parents' marriages.  It has not protected them, as we should all like to protect our children, from the initial pain and confusion which result when parents decide their marriage is at an end.</P>
    <P>As we are all aware, the unavailability of divorce in this country has meant that the lives, relationships and commitments of a large number of people have become increasingly divergent from their legal status.  Is it a help to them, or to our society, that we continue to ignore these facts and fail to recognise the reality that some marriages can and do come to an end beyond any hope of reconciliation?  The Government cannot continue to ignore these realities and has a responsibility to provide a legal remedy for those whose marriages have clearly and irretrievably broken down. Our society is now mature enough to accept that marriages do irretrievably break down and that people need to be in a position to regularise their second relationships.</P>
    <P>When the Government was considering the issue of marriage breakdown and the right to remarry it examined the experience of other countries and came to the conclusion that mistakes had been made in some countries where the right to remarry is too easy.  We want to secure protection for the vulnerable people, especially children and dependent spouses.  We are not asking the <Col N="48" /> people to vote &ldquo;yes&rdquo; to easy divorce. There will be no &ldquo;quickie&rdquo; divorce under this amendment.  There will be no &ldquo;divorce culture&rdquo; under this amendment. The wording before the House spells out that spouses must be living apart for four years during the five years preceding the application.  This will not be changed without the agreement of the Irish people.  No law could make the grounds for divorce easier without reference back to the people.</P>
    <P>As public representatives, it is our duty to address, on an ongoing basis, legislation that protects the rights and reflects the needs of our people.  Over the last ten years we have developed a coherent legislative framework of family law reform and, in order to complete that process, we must ensure that the removal of the ban on divorce in the Constitution is carried by the people.  As legislators it is our duty to look beyond our personal experiences and to realise that our responsibility is to assist in the creation of a more tolerant and compassionate society on this island.</P>

      <P>The referendum is being held on 24 November, a Friday.  I presume the thinking behind this was that young people returning to their homes would be caught.  Listening to the chat around my own table, I am not certain that the young people will necessarily vote <i>en masse</i> in favour of the amendment.  However, on the basis that this was the theory behind the date chosen by the Government, I am not certain it was the correct one.  For obvious reasons, I would not suggest Sunday 26 November would be the correct date; Saturday, 25 November might have been the convenient time to catch &mdash; and I use this word with respect &mdash; as many people as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In time, I have no doubt the Government, whether or not it is a Fianna Fáil one, will look at Sunday as the proper day for referenda generally and general elections in particular.  This is a small <Col N="49" /> point and it is not intended to be a critical one.  I am in favour of the referendum and I will vote yes.  I make this point for that reason only.</P>
    <P>It appears to be emerging that in some way I am intolerant of the point of view of those people who wish to vote &ldquo;no&rdquo;, that I would be suggesting they might not be entitled to express their opinions.  Throughout the whole country there will be a volume of &ldquo;yes&rdquo; and &ldquo;no&rdquo; points of view.  That is as it should be in a democracy.  While personally I might have any problem with it, I do not.  I only want to place that on the record of the House.</P>
    <P>I was on a programme with a Mr. McCarroll, who would be strongly and articulately against divorce.  I was most impressed by him and his point of view. At the same time, we could discuss the different opinions in a civilised way and neither of us &mdash; nor other participants in that particular panel discussion &mdash; was injured at the end of the day.  There was no blood on the floor.  It was a civilised debate.  We should try our best to raise the debate to a level of civility.  This will show not only ourselves, which is important, but others outside this benighted island that we can deal with issues of this nature in a balanced and decent fashion and that we can listen with tolerance to the other person's point of view.</P>
    <P>On the referendum Bill, I also want to pay tribute to the work of the Minister for Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Taylor, the Minister leading the campaign on this issue.  He has been dedicated and single minded.  I expect he does not suffer from an overdose of charisma nor do many of us in this House, unfortunately.  This issue is not about charisma.  It is about a Minister who has dedicated himself to pursuing a matter in which he believes.  He has clearly outlined the parameters of what we can expect when divorce becomes a reality.  Whether he is charismatic or not, I would have thought is, in the circumstances, irrelevant.</P>
    <P>This is the type of referendum which should be conducted in a low key <Col N="50" /> fashion.  I do not mean low key to the point where one cannot hear those who are in favour or against.  I am afraid the present Government falls into that latter category, despite the best efforts of Deputy Taylor, and I am glad to see my colleague in my constituency, Minister for Education, Deputy Bhreathnach, speaking publicly on this issue for the first time.  I hope it will not be the last because it is important the Government and its supporters express the official Government line on this matter.  There has been a deafening silence to date in that regard.  I welcome this as the beginning of what we can expect from the Government in future.</P>
    <P>To say that this debate is about divorce is misleading.  Divorce is defined in &ldquo;The Oxford Dictionary&rdquo; as &ldquo;the legal termination of a marriage, the separation of things that were together&rdquo;. Osborne's law dictionary defines divorce as &ldquo;the dissolution of marriage&rdquo;. The present debate concerns a single issue.  Do the Irish people wish to permit separated persons, whose marriages are no more, to remarry?  That, as I understand it, is the net issue.  However, it is not quite as simple as that.</P>
    <P>The present law provides for the circumstances where marriages have broken down.  It regulates the legal and financial implications of the breakdown of marriage for the parties to the marriage and the dependants.  The only gap in the present law is that once a marriage has broken down the Constitution prevents the Oireachtas from providing the legal means by which separated persons would become legally entitled to remarry.  If separated persons did not, following the separation, become involved in subsequent relationships &mdash;&ldquo;living in sin&rdquo; was the old expression and a term once popular &mdash; there would be no need to have this referendum since there would be no question of a remarriage.  The constitutional prohibition on remarriage would, in practical terms, need no amendment.  So-called liberals might decry the denial of their vision of human rights to the populace but, since the populace would have no <Col N="51" /> need of their solicitude, there would be no popular call for the law to be amended.</P>
    <P>Regrettably, and I say this from the heart, there is such a need.  Few families in Ireland are untouched by marriage breakdown, including my own.  The statistics may give rise to argument yet the fact remains that the breakdown of marriages in Ireland is a shocking and serious economic reality, not just for the individual family involved but for the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>In Government, Fianna Fáil, as has been acknowledged generously by the Minister, introduced a comprehensive package of law reforms to tackle the fallout of the rising incidence of marriage breakdown.  Apart from calling the divorce referendum in 1986 too early, the then Government failed to put in place the package which is now available to those people who find themselves in circumstances of separation or who would now have divorce available to them after 24 November, if this referendum is successful.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil, as individuals and as a party, recognise the need to protect vulnerable parties in marriage breakdown. An intrinsic part of this recognition is the need to ensure that the law of the land is comprehensive, fair and accessible to all.  Fianna Fáil has played its role in bringing forward the 15 pieces of legislation which are now in place; after last week there may be 16 pieces of legislation and there are two more to come.  Soon there will be 18 pieces of legislation in place since 1986 which were not there before that date.  That is some achievement and Fianna Fáil had a definite role in all of that.  The Minister also generously acknowledged the part played by Fianna Fáil and particularly in the preparation of the White Paper on marital breakdown by former Deputy Flynn.</P>
    <P>Within our party there are people with a different point of view than my own and I acknowledge this.  I also acknowledge their entitlement, on the basis that we are a democracy, to take <Col N="52" /> whatever role they wish in this referendum. My party leader has indicated that the Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party is calling for a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote and supporting the Government.  On the other hand, he has properly and correctly made provision for those people who might have a different point of view.  I support that provision.  The position taken by my party leader in this matter is indicative of good quality leadership.</P>
    <P>With the exception of a reform of the law of nullity which the Government, for reasons best known to itself, appears reluctant to tackle and proposals to provide for lawful remarriage following lawful separation, the present law is a realistic reflection of the needs of citizens in a modern pluralist society.  If this is taken as a party political scoring point then so be it.  However, those who are familiar with my career as a Member of this House will know that my criticism of the failure of the Government to act in certain areas has never been confined to other political parties and never will be.</P>
    <P>I hope this debate will lead to an endorsement by the electorate of the need to allow separated persons the legal right to remarry, while underlying the pre-eminent role of the family in the social fabric of our nation.  While I realise my unequivocal belief that remarriage is a fundamental right is not shared by all Members of the House or all of the electorate, my understanding of justice and my belief in fairness and compassion allow me no other view.</P>
    <P>Critics of the proposal to remove the constitutional ban on divorce say that marriage will never be the same.  They say that the introduction of the right to remarry will cause marriages to break down and discourage people in marriages which are under strain from making a proper effort to keep their marriages together.  We are all familiar with the floodgates argument and we know that religious organisations which forbid divorce will, in exercise of their pastoral duty, reiterate their attitude to marriage, their abhorrence of divorce and <Col N="53" /> their concerns about the effects of divorce on society in general.  I accept that a church &mdash; I am not referring exclusively to the Catholic Church &mdash; has a duty to direct the attention of its members towards its appraisal of the implications of marriage breakdown. This duty will extend to giving advice to members about where their duties as such lie and it may even embrace an outline of the sanctions which default may entail.  However, no organisation, no matter how large, powerful or earnest, is entitled to dictate to persons other than its members on how they should lead their lives.  The Government must be mindful of the many strands of opinion in the country.  In fairness, most religious organisations have clearly acknowledged that regardless of their stance the Government must legislate as it sees fit.</P>
    <P>The Government must do its best to include all citizens within the embrace of its laws.  When provisions in international law are not fundamentally consistent in a material way with the mores of our nation then the Oireachtas is precluded from enacting or upholding any law which is repugnant to that law.  Our Statute Book is filled with laws which did not orginate in the Dáil or Seanad. Our membership of the European Union involves us in an extensive regime of economic, social and political legislation which has revolutionised the rights and expectations of our citizens and dragged Ireland &mdash; many say reluctantly &mdash; into the 1990s.  An Irish farmer may seem to have little in common with a German factory worker but the legal framework which regulates their lives is remarkably similar.</P>
    <P>Our membership of the European Union and other international organisations such as the United Nations and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development has required us to take real and practical account of the standards of conduct which apply to the business and social affairs of other nations.  Other influences such as the ever increasing powers <Col N="54" /> of the media, improvements in the standard of living and the eschewing of traditional concepts of power and authority inside and outside the home have made the world in general and Ireland in particular radically different today from the way they were in my youth.  The seemingly endless array of new technology and the sheer scale of the availability of information are taken for granted, particularly by young people, while the hunger for more technology and information seems to be insatiable.</P>
    <P>In this context the waning interest in the political process among young people is not a great surprise, particularly when one considers that many young people believe the political process has little relevance to them.  Studies of the pattern of voting in recent national elections have indicated a serious decline in the number of young people who voted.  This year many thousands of young people are entitled to vote for the first time while many more thousands who are entitled to vote have never voted.  Unfortunately, a number of categories in our society do not rate high on the scale of human values while politics and politicians rate lowly.  It does not give me any pleasure to say this as I have the greatest respect for the profession of politics and the greatest personal respect for politicians of all parties.  These young first time voters may not look to politicians for leadership while those who do so may think they are not getting it.  Everyone who is entitled to vote should exercise that right in this referendum.</P>
    <P>This referendum is not about Fianna Fáil versus the other parties or parties of the left versus parties of the right. Rather it is about people's lives.  It is a personal matter and if the decision is to reflect the view of the majority then every voter must tell us, as legislators, what laws they want, no more or no less.</P>
    <P>People who have firm opinions will exercise their right to vote.  The pro and anti divorce lobbies will be out in force, particularly on polling day.  However, these people are not in a majority.  Most of the electorate are not involved in <Col N="55" /> either movement and should not be tempted to leave the issue to those on opposite sides of the debate.  There are many people in the middle ground, the so-called silent group &mdash; I am not saying they are the majority on this occasion &mdash; who have not voiced their opinion.  The only place they express their opinion is at the ballot box, which is as it should be.  These people should exercise their franchise, whether it is for or against divorce.</P>
    <P>The vast majority of the electorate are deeply disturbed not about the issue of divorce but about marriage breakdown. The Government's proposals are a fair and reasonable reflection of the requirements of the people to ensure that the long-term stability of the family in Irish life is promoted, fostered and protected, having regard to the realities which no responsible and reasonable person can ignore.</P>

      <P>I welcome this Bill and applaud the Minister for Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Taylor, for bringing it before us in line with the agreement in the programme for Government. The timeframe for the introduction of this Bill is much the same as that agreed with Fianna Fáil.  I also welcome the many support measures the Minister has put in place to date.  I support the points made by Deputy Andrews who has a genuine commitment to people's right to remarry.  I urge all citizens, whether for or against divorce, to exercise their franchise on polling day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I and many other Deputies would like to have had a simple black and white provision deleting the ban on divorce from the Constitution.  However, we <Col N="56" /> have to deal with the realities that concern people, and we must show leadership. That is why I am prepared to fully support the provisions before us.</P>
    <P>I consider this a balanced text.  It establishes the right to dissolve a marriage that has irretrievably broken down and allows the separated spouses to enter into new lawful relationship if they so choose.  It thereby enhances the human and civil right of all men and women to the pursuit of happiness.  I consider this right, which is stated in many constitutions, as the supreme objective of all societal organisation.</P>
    <P>At present between 70,000 and 75,000 marriages have broken down irretrievably, as defined in the text before us, and we have to deal with that.  On the other hand, the provisions provide for a period of four years living apart prior to the institution of divorce proceedings. This ensure that there will be no question of passing fancies resulting in divorce and that so-called quickie divorces will not be possible.  That is the context of our discussion.</P>
    <P>The background to this is equally impressive in the manner in which we have dealt with it since 1986 when the previous divorce referendum was defeated.  Nineteen pieces of legislation have been put in place to deal with the nightmare of marital breakdown and protection of the family.  That is a substantial body of legislation.  It provides for legal assistance with more funding, the provision of more legal centres, the appointment of extra judges, easier access to the courts and civil legal aid for those on social welfare and, on a means-tested basis, for people who are employed.  It includes a major programme of family law reform covering provisions for the maintenance of children and spouses, the distribution of property, succession rights, maintenance of all existing social welfare entitlements and the updating of a host of other relevant items.</P>
    <P>Most important of all, and something we perhaps do not discuss adequately in the debate on marriage breakdown and <Col N="57" /> divorce, is that the institution of marriage itself is very much under threat from other factors at present.  This Government and the previous one have gone out of their way to strengthen the institution of marriage, but the number of marriages has declined steadily since 1986.  In 1986 the number of marriages was 18,573.  In 1994 it was 16,297.  That is a substantial decrease.  Twenty per cent of first births now take place outside marriage.  In my constituency in the north inner city over 50 per cent of first births take place outside marriage. There is a crisis in marriage, and it certainly is not the result of divorce because divorce is not in existence. Lone parent births in Ireland have now reached a higher percentage than in any other of the European countries.  That is a sociological factor that has not been fully examined and which requires careful examination.  Certainly divorce is not the cause.</P>
    <P>The institution of marriage is under threat, but the present Government has put in place strong measures to protect it and to protect the family.  The Family Mediation Service has been put in place and given extra funding; the marriage counselling organisations are being substantially funded this year &mdash; £.75 million has been allocated, and they are being strongly promoted; the legal aid and legal advice centres have been extended to every country in Ireland and have been allocated substantial resources, an increase of about 130 per cent this year; the age of marriage has been raised to 18 years and three months' prior notice must be given of an intention to marry.  This means that marriages will not be thoughtlessly entered into and people will be more mature when they marry.  All of that is a necessary build-up to ensure the stability of marriage.  I believe that all right-minded citizens who are genuine in their compassion for those whose marriages have broken down, who are concerned about the right of every citizen to the pursuit of happiness, and who embrace a pluralist society will welcome this <Col N="58" /> legislation and vote &ldquo;yes&rdquo; to the amendment to the Constitution on 24 November.</P>
    <P>There are specific provisions in both programmes for Government, the 1993 and the 1994 programmes, which I would like to put on the record.  It should be remembered that all parties in the House, with the exception of the Progressive Democrats and the Green Party, have sponsored one or other of those manifestos.  In the 1993 document it is clearly stated in the section on women's rights that changes in legislation will include:</P>
    <P>A major programme of family law reform, culminating in a referendum on divorce by 1994 &mdash; we have missed that by about a year &mdash; modernisation of the law of nullity; placing a monetary value on women's work in the home for the purposes of property distribution; extension of barring order legislation; legislation to give each spouse an equal share in the family home and household belongings; increase in the age of marriage to 18; enhancement of the rights of parties in non-marital unions;</P>
    <P>Every iota of that has been put in place and now, in 1995, we are putting forward the referendum.</P>
    <P>This Bill is enhanced by the present programme for Government which reads, under the simple heading of divorce:</P>
    <P>A referendum to remove the constitutional ban on divorce and remarriage, on the basis of irretrievable breakdown, will be held during 1995. The Government and the Parties will recommend a Yes vote in the referendum.</P>
    <P>In advance of the referendum a comprehensive paper will be published indicating the text of the amendment proposed by the Government, and addressing issues such as:</P>
    <P>&mdash;the protection of children;</P>
    <P>&mdash;taxation;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="59" />&mdash;social welfare;</P>
    <P>&mdash;inheritance laws and pension entitlements.</P>
    <P>At the same time we will complete the steps necessary to ensure that:</P>
    <P>all dependent spouses and children are fully protected; the Family Mediation Service is strengthened and expanded; the family courts are strengthened.</P>
    <P>That programme has been put in place. It is now sponsored by Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, the Labour Party and the Democratic Left.  That is why I feel the Progressive Democrats are the only party playing politics with this.  On the one hand they say they are not happy with the four year living apart provision and would prefer a simple deletion of the ban on divorce.  Many others would also prefer that.  However, the Progressive Democrats want to have their cake and eat it.  Because they have not got exactly the text they want they will oppose it but, once the Bill is passed, they will support the referendum.  One could say that Fianna Fáil is adopting the other position, that it will accept it in the House and allow a free for all when the text is passed.  Given the remarks by the leader of Fianna Fáil, I believe he, like Deputy Andrews is genuinely committed to ensuring the divorce referendum is passed.  I am sure he and his party which agreed a manifesto which included the introduction of divorce proceedings will travel the highways and byways to canvass for a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote on 24 November.  However, I urge against the Progressive Democrats confusing the issue and seeking political expediency not so much by taking the high moral ground but to gain some high profile publicity in its rather spurious proposal to get ten people to call for a division on the issue.</P>

It should accept the reality and the balance in these provisions and support the Government in them.</P>
      <P>The ban on divorce was introduced in the 1937 Constitution.  The 1922 Constitution did not have such a ban, and neither did the Brehon laws.  The ban was introduced when perhaps there was very conservative thinking on social matters, a short period after the Eucharistic Congress in 1932.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 9, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>Since I last reported to the House, the Government has continued to engage in dialogue with the Northern Ireland parties. We have held further meetings with the SDLP, the Alliance Party and Sinn Féin.  We have also held our first formal meetings with the Ulster Democratic Party and the Progressive Unionist Party.  We greatly value all these meetings.</P>
      <P>The common theme of these meetings has been the peace process and the way forward.  Such meetings serve two very useful purposes.  First, they enable the Government to explain our position. Second, they ensure that we are informed of the positions and concerns of the parties, so that these can be taken fully into account in the formulation of our policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government will continue with its programme of dialogue with the relevant parties in the weeks and months ahead.  I am looking forward to meeting <Col N="62" /> the new Ulster Unionist Party leader, Mr. David Trimble, MP next Monday, 2 October.  It is obviously of critical importance that we should hear the voice of the largest party in Northern Ireland and that we should have its input into the peace process.</P>
    <P>In all the meetings held to date, I have been greatly impressed by the obvious sincerity and commitment of all the participants.</P>
    <P>I believe that, provided the key question of trust is resolved to everyone's satisfaction, we will be able to move from bilaterals to a situation where, in due course, all the political parties and the two Governments can talk to each other, around the same table.  As I have already said both inside and outside the House, everybody has a role to play in building that trust.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for his reply.  Regarding his meetings with the PUP and the UDP, did he raise the issue of the decommissioning of loyalist arms with them and, if so, what response did he receive?  Did those parties give a commitment that they would use their influence regarding that aspect?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, I raised the matter with them.  The response was to draw my attention to the fact that they have indicated in a formal declaration that the organisations with which they are associated would not be the first and would make a formal agreement not to be the first to initiate any use of arms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding the meetings the Taoiseach had with the UDP and the PUP, did he notice any difference between their approach to decommissioning and that of Sinn Féin?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter to which I referred in response to Deputy Ahern is an area where there is some difference. There is probably a greater willingness on the part of those parties to participate in structures being put forward to deal with the issue, but I do not see <Col N="63" /> much benefit in getting involved in minute parsing and analysis of slight or significant differences of position between various parties on this matter. We need to create trust and to do that we need to take the threat of the use of arms out of the political equation.  This is not, therefore, solely a question of decommissioning existing stocks of arms, it is also one of creating a degree of confidence that even if all the arms were disposed of the organisations in question will not contemplate ever acquiring new ones.  That is just as important an aspect of the issue.  We are talking about the creation of a trust that violence will never be resorted to or its use threatened directly or indirectly. That will not happen overnight.  It will be developed as part of a process over a period of time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>We have all noticed that there has been far more openness to dialogue during the past two or three weeks, especially from the Ulster Unionist Party, loyalist parties, and leaders from the loyalist community who have invited this House to be more involved in their meetings and dialogue during the winter months.  When speaking to the loyalist parties did the Taoiseach make any attempt to persuade them that the proposals in the Framework Document have much merit?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have, but it is important to persuade them of the validity of the ideas in the document rather than to get them to accept any particular document in which those ideas may be present &mdash; if the Deputy accepts the distinction I am making.  The Framework Document contains a comprehensive, realistic and balanced outline of a possible settlement of the issue, but the Governments have said from the day the Framework Document was announced that we were not asking anybody to accept this document as a blueprint, that we wanted to hear other <Col N="64" /> people's ideas, proposals and suggestions and that the Government's proposals were being put forward as a challenge to other parties to deal with the range of issues in the Framework Document. By putting them together in one document we hope we are able to ensure that none of the relevant issues others have to deal with will be left out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>In the Taoiseach's meetings with those parties associated with terrorist organisations or paramilitaries, did he raise the question of punishment beatings and, if so, what response did he get?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I did raise the question of punishment beatings.  The parties concerned condemn punishment beatings and regard them as wrong, as I do. The law should be enforced by duly constituted authorities, not by anybody else.</P>
      <P>It is important also to recognise that in Northern Ireland we are dealing with a society which has emerged from the trauma of 25 years of violence, where the culture of violence continues to have some adherents and where direct action, rather than the painstaking process of normal administration of law, has some historic precedents.  Obviously it will be a slow but essential process to wean people away from those types of reflex actions in regard to local problems.  It is very important that all who have influence in areas where punishment beatings are taking place, including particularly parties associated with organisations formerly using violence, should use their political influence, and should be seen publicly to do so, to stop these punishment beatings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for his response in relation to what he said was the use of arms by the loyalist paramilitaries.  Because the two former paramilitary groups have a similar attitude in relation to the decommissioning of arms &mdash; I believe they both have the same attitude in relation to the use of arms &mdash; will the Taoiseach not accept <Col N="65" /> that in that event it is extremely difficult to build up the trust he is referring to in the absence of talks, whether they be bilateral or all party?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>One should not underestimate the great significance of the talks that took place between the Irish Government and the Progressive Unionist Party and the Ulster Democratic Party.  The fact that they, as Unionist parties, were willing to come to Dublin and have these meetings is, in itself, a major confidence building measure in their own communities and it should be seen in that context.  It is a clear indication by them of a commitment to political dialogue with people with whom they would traditionally have had an antagonistic relationship, and that is of great importance.  It is important also to recognise the fact that the parties concerned, and the people they represent, have expressed remorse for what happened during their campaign of violence, specifically that word was used.  It is important also to recognise the validity of what they have said in regard to not being the first to use arms.  It is important that one should push them further along that road but also that others who hold arms should be willing to travel that road too.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Taoiseach met the UDP and the PUP, did they raise with him the whole question of the prisoners issue?  I was part of a Fianna Fáil delegation which met their representatives in Belfast some months ago and they asked our party to intervene with the Government and the British Government and to use our influence in respect of the prisoners issue which they saw as a key to the loyalist ceasefire. Did they raise that issue with the Taoiseach and what was his response in relation to same?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>They certainly did raise the issue with us and indeed we raised it with them also.  The Tánaiste outlined to them the work he has been doing over many months in the context <Col N="66" /> of the Anglo-Irish Conference to deal with the problem of both loyalist and republican prisoners imprisoned in different parts of the United Kingdom. We assured them that we would continue to work on that subject, as I have done since that meeting and as I will be indicating in response to the next set of parliamentary questions.  The Deputy is quite right; the question of prisoners is an important issue in the minds of both the loyalist and republican communities. It is very important that people should see that their commitment to peace is recognised by reasonably early release of prisoners once a fair share of their sentence has been served and also that, in so far as is possible and practicable, those who remain in prison should be able to serve their prison sentences as close as possible to home so that they can have the maximum reasonable relationship with their family members and friends outside, thereby facilitating their reintegration into the community on release.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach said here last week that if the parties associated with terrorist organisations were not happy with the Government's approach on decommissioning they should put forward their own suggestions. How many of those parties have put forward their own suggestions to the Government in this area?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am hoping that they will because it is very important they should do so.  I did not expect to see a response within a week, and one has not been forthcoming, but it is important that the Taoiseach in Dáil Éireann be seen clearly to appeal to the entire community, which gives support to those who hold arms politically, to recognise that the community has a responsibility to allay the fears of the other community in regard to the possible use of those arms, and that there is a clear responsibility on those who hold arms to recognise that their first duty is not to reassure their own community but to reassure the other community which <Col N="67" /> fears that those arms might be used against them.  It was in that context, and in the spirit of the Downing Street Joint Declaration, which is very clear on this in paragraph 6, that I made the request last week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to what the Taoiseach has just said about the attitude of the loyalist parties with regard to prisoners, has he passed on their comments to the British Government? In regard to the Framework Document, I accept that from the outset the Government stated that the Framework Document, though negotiated between the Irish and British Governments, may not be written in stone and that the Taoiseach would accept submissions from others.  Has the Taoiseach received any submissions during the past six months from others that would amend or be an addendum to the Framework Document?  A number of the parties have recently talked about assembly elections and other internal solutions. Will the Taoiseach reiterate his commitment to the centre piece of the Framework Document, that of the Irish dimension?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as the Framework Document is concerned, the invitation issued to all of the parties to meet me was stated not to be around any particular agenda item but rather an open agenda.  Therefore, I did not invite the parties concerned to meet me to discuss the Framework Document; I invited them to meet me to discuss the matters they wished to raise.  The Deputy will recollect that I made that point when he previously questioned me about these invitations.  In any of our discussions we did not go into that document line by line; it was discussed in a general way as part of the overall discussion but not in a particular way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With respect to the concept of any settlement in regard to Northern Ireland being one that must involve three strands, that is not just the policy of the Irish and British Governments, it <Col N="68" /> is also the policy of all those who participated in the talks between 1991 and 1992.  All of the parties who participated, including the Unionist parties, accepted the three standed nature of the required settlement and that the settlement must have an all Irish dimension just as it must have a British-Irish dimension.  The approach one should have to any suggestions put forward, like those canvassed by Mr. David Trimble on behalf of the Ulster Unionist Party, is one of listening constructively to the proposal before trying to find any deficiencies that may or may not be contained in it.  During many years of Irish history there has been a tendency to reject proposals because of the quarter from which they came rather than on their merits, having examined them.</P>
    <P>I appeal to everybody who is considering proposals, whether they be made by the SDLP, Sinn Féin, the Ulster Unionist Party, the DUP or anybody else, to look at what is good in those proposals first and seek to see how it is possible to integrate one's own ideas within the structure proposed by somebody else rather than insisting on the structure that oneself is proposing. However, at this juncture, I will not go into any detail on the proposal made by Mr. David Trimble for the very good reason that I will be meeting him in person shortly and I would prefer to hear from him, face to face, the thinking behind this proposal and to tease out any difficulties or misunderstandings there may be about it.  I would urge anybody else who is interested, particularly those of the Nationalist community in Northern Ireland who have reservations about the proposal, to discuss them with Mr. Trimble just as I would urge Unionists to discuss, in the same way, any proposals that might be put forward by the SDLP or Sinn Féin directly with them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume the Taoiseach &mdash; I do not wish to misinterpret him &mdash; would not in any way listen to proposals based on an internal solution.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I have read the proposal but I am not only talking about Mr. Trimble's proposal.  I was thinking of somebody else.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been an effort in recent weeks to try to say the Framework Document is dead.  What I am seeking is the Taoiseach's commitment &mdash; forget about amendments and addendums &mdash; to the central section of the Framework Document which is that there will be no internal solution, no old tricks and that the Irish dimension of a North/South framework will be sacrosanct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not have to go to the Framework Document to find the first statement that there has to be an all Irish dimension and that it is a three stranded approach.  The idea that a solely internal settlement would work was one that was off the agenda long before the Framework Document.  It has been off the agenda for quite some time. It has been accepted by all the parties, including the Unionists, that it is not a purely one stranded internal settlement approach that we are looking for.  Anybody who studies, for example, Mr. Trimble's proposals will see that he recognises the need for a Strand II or all Ireland dimension.  He might have a different view from the Deputy or myself about what that might be but that is something that is legitimate and reasonable for us to discuss.  It is very important, however, &mdash; and this is what I want to stress very strongly &mdash; that if parties with whom one might have traditionally been in disagreement come up with ideas that in their view are intended to be constructive, that they should be received in a constructive way, that one should not look for the flaw in them, that one should look for what is good in them and try, in the process of building on them, to remove the <Col N="70" /> flaws rather than simply reject them on the grounds of the flaws.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it the Taoiseach's view as a result of meeting with parties of the Unionist tradition that they are committed to an Irish dimension as well?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, of course I think it is an indication of the recognition of an Irish dimension that people are willing to talk to us.  That is not to say, however, there is agreement about the nature of that dimension or how it might be expressed.  One of the purposes of discussion in an all party talks context is to work out the nature of the Irish dimension that will be acceptable all round.  That means a lot of work because the subject of the Irish dimension is one upon which there is much general conversation but not a sufficient degree of specific practical work.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>The whole North-South Irish dimension is a central plank in the Framework Document.  All we are seeking to clarify is that the Taoiseach stands over that particular dimension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach came in and signed it at the end.  He is exaggerating slightly if he talks about negotiating it.  However, my question relates to the meetings with the UDP and the PUP.  I welcome the announcement &mdash; which has been reiterated by the Taoiseach &mdash; by the loyalist paramilitaries in relation to not using arms.  Did the Taoiseach ask them, during the course of his discussions with them, to use their influence with the loyalist paramilitaries to go one step further and to take the step of decommissioning their arms as a gesture to take the peace process one step further and, if so, what was their response?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I did and their response was quite favourable.  The <Col N="71" /> position in regard to the approach to the Government is absolutely clear.  I am replying now to the first half of Deputy Dempsey's question or, perhaps, to his preamble.  The position, as I have said to various other Deputies of his party, is absolutely clear.  The final negotiation of the Framework Document was done by the Government of which I am the Taoiseach.  It is a document to which I am committed fully, but committed on the basis that it is put forward for discussion with others and on the basis of a willingness to listen to the viewpoints and concerns of others.  I would hope I would not be asked to put it in any other way because if I did I would be foreclosing discussion and that is not desirable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>We have been talking much about loyalist parties.  Will the Taoiseach accept the importance of remaining in close consultation with the Nationalist parties in the North and that in any initiatives he may undertake he needs to assure himself of, at least, the support of the SDLP?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the questions tabled relates to the meeting I held with the SDLP in the last two weeks.  It was a good and useful discussion.  We are in almost daily contact with representatives of the SDLP and, indeed, of other parties.  We are anxious to ensure and we recognise that a settlement can only work if all of the relevant parties are going along with it, Nationalist and Unionist.  It is very important that the Irish Government should, of course, concern itself with the fears and the worries of the Nationalist community. To give the Nationalist community the reassurance they need and to make the breakthroughs on their behalf that they need, we have also got to have a very constructive, close and trusting relationship with the Unionist parties in Northern Ireland too.  I am glad to say that that is in the process of being established. It has taken a long time and much work by many people to get to the <Col N="72" /> point we got to last week and that we hope to reach next week where we are now opening dialogue with the majority of the Unionist parties.  It is something I have been strongly committed to personally. I recognise there are many others in the House, including the Deputy, who are equally concerned with it and have made efforts in that direction also.  I am very glad we have reached that point and let us build on that.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10 to 27, inclusive, and Question No. 98 together.  The key objective for everybody at this stage in the peace process must be to create the conditions in which round table talks can take place, leading to a negotiated settlement based on consent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the House will be aware, the decommissioning issue represents the main obstacle in the way of achieving all-party talks in round table format.  In the lead up to the summit planned for 6 September and following intensive discussions with many of the relevant parties, the Government believed it had identified a way forward out of this impasse.  However, in discussions with the British Government and Sinn Féin in the days immediately preceding the Summit, it emerged that this was unlikely to work.  In these circumstances, the only responsible course of action was to seek a postponement of the Summit.  It would be counterproductive to elaborate on the background, having regard to the need for confidentiality in the ongoing efforts to <Col N="76" /> resolve the problem.  I cannot reasonably be expected to interpret for this House the positions of the other parties involved.</P>
    <P>There was no intention of calling round table talks, as has been suggested, in the absence of adequate progress on the decommissioning issue.  Certainly, the Government wishes to see round table talks taking place as soon as possible, as it made clear following the meeting of July in Dublin Castle with the SDLP and Sinn Féin.  At the same time, however, it fully recognises that, as a matter of both principle and practical reality, the requirements of paragraph 10 of the Downing Street Declaration must be met to the satisfaction of all concerned.  It all boils down to a question of trust.  The Irish Government has trusted Sinn Féin that the cessation of IRA violence is irreversible and it continues to be encouraged in this by the absence of violence for over a year now. However, the British Government and, more importantly, the Unionists do not yet fully share in this trust.</P>
    <P>Following the postponement of the Summit, the Government is continuing with its intensive efforts to identify the way forward with the British Government and with the other relevant parties, including by way of an international commission.  As I stated in the Dáil last week, there have been contacts on an almost daily basis between officials of the two Governments and as Deputies will be aware, I reviewed the position with the Prime Minister Mr. Major on a number of occasions during the recent EU informal Summit in Majorca.  Since then, I have been and will continue to be in ongoing communication with the Prime Minister.  As Deputies will be aware, the Tánaiste is now in the United States and the US Administration continues to engage in the peace process in a very balanced and constructive way.</P>
    <P>While the two Governments are not yet in a position to reschedule the Summit, the contacts at official and political level to which I have referred have allowed us to take stock of each other's <Col N="77" /> position.  In addition, during my discussions with the British Prime Minister in Majorca, we took the opportunity to explore some possibilities for moving matters forward.  I can assure the House that the Prime Minister and I are totally committed to working our way to a solution and that we will continue to work together intensively over the short term to this end.  We are determined to use the opportunity presented by the cease-fires to ensure that the people of Northern Ireland are given the political stability and certainty which have eluded them for so long.  I am convinced that we can succeed.</P>
    <P>In the course of my meetings with the Prime Minister Mr. Major in Majorca, I emphasised the continuing importance of constructive movement on prisoners issues, which are of concern to both loyalists and republicans.  In that regard, I am pleased that Ireland has now ratified the Council of Europe Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons and discussions have already taken place between officials of the Department of Justice and of the Home Office about the practicalities of giving effect to the Convention in our two jurisdictions. These discussions have been useful, but there are significant issues to be resolved.  The Irish Government has now asked that the discussions be progressed urgently with the British authorities and it will pursue the matter accordingly.</P>
    <P>The British Prime Minister and I also discussed ways of developing the east-west strand of the three relationships on these islands and we have put in hands work at official level on this matter.</P>
    <P>I raised with the Prime Minister the strong concern in Ireland at the presence of nuclear power stations on the west coast of Britain.  I stated that the 1993 incident at Wylfa power station in Wales was a matter of particularly grave concern to the Irish Government.  The Prime Minister undertook to come back to me on the points which I raised.  In light of the importance of the employment situation in Cork, and in Cobh in particular, I sought the Prime Minister's <Col N="78" /> support for the proposed sale and 100 per cent disposal of the Irish Steel plant in Haulbowline in the forthcoming discussions on the issue at the EU Industry Council in November.</P>

      <P>Were the Taoiseach's adviser and the head of the Anglo-Irish division of the Department of Foreign Affairs told by representatives of Sinn Féin that if the Government went ahead with the Summit and established an international commission there would be &ldquo;bodies on the street&rdquo;?</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will recollect, I stated in my reply that I did not think it would be particularly useful for me to become involved in interpreting the positions adopted by others. I remind the Deputy that shortly after the postponement of the Summit I offered a confidential briefing to her party which was graciously accepted and that was an occasion at which most of the questions that the Deputy's party has on this matter were answered in a way that would not be prejudicial to the overall interests of the peace process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not asking the Taoiseach to interpret anything, but we need to know and the public at large needs to know the reason the Summit was cancelled; if the Government caved in to the threat of violence by Sinn Féin everyone should know that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Irish Government did not cave in to any threat, nor would it ever cave in to a threat from a paramilitary organisation.  The Irish Government in the interest of peace wishes to bring all the relevant parties, including paramilitary organisations with it on an agreed basis towards a solution. That requires &mdash; I am sure the Deputy would not urge otherwise &mdash; that we take into account the views of parties associated with paramilitary organisations because we need to get their agreement to put their guns out of commission.  We have to work at that and we have to listen to them in order <Col N="79" /> to reach that objective.  That does not mean and will never mean that at the end of the day they will have the final say.  It is the Government, elected by the people who will make the decisions.  The Deputy will recollect that I made that very clear at a dinner in Dublin Castle, at which her party was also represented. The Deputy will be well aware of what I said, but should she want a copy of what I said I will furnish it to her. However, in her absence I gave a very full briefing to Deputy Desmond O'Malley on all the matters raised here. If the Deputy wishes to ask me all those questions in public, she may certainly do so but the purpose of the briefing was to enable me to give a fully comprehensive reply.  If the Deputy checks with Deputy O'Malley she will find that my answers to his questions were full and there was no question that I did not answer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>This party was most grateful for the briefing it received but there was one issue on which we did not agree.  Will the Taoiseach in hindsight now agree that it was foolish to attempt to hold a Summit in the week of a Unionist leadership contest and it would have been better, as had been stated by the Tánaiste a week earlier, to postpone it because of lack of preparation?  Does the Taoiseach accept that the abrupt cancellation of the summit, the day before it was scheduled to take place, damaged trust between both Governments and both communities in the North?  Admittedly the Taoiseach has been working in recent weeks to resolve the matter but does he agree that this was the effect of his handling of the situation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>At the beginning of June when I was in Moscow I had a summit meeting with the British Prime Minister and we agreed to meet again in September.  Early in August we agreed the date of 6 September.  The decision to meet on that date was made long before there was a vacancy in the leadership of the Unionist Party and without having <Col N="80" /> the facility for prophecy it would not have been possible for us to have taken that issue into account.</P>
      <P>The position with regard to the Summit was that the two Governments had agreed on a certain approach which I believe was reasonable.  Despite it having been modified to take account of Sinn Féin's concerns, Sinn Féin indicated to us a very short time before the meeting that it would not co-operate. Subsequently, in discussions with the British Government it became clear that the answers to supplementary questions that might be put to them &mdash; not on the communiqué but on contingent matters arising from the communiqué &mdash; might not be sufficiently clear in regard to Washington 3 being subjected to, and not being something that was retained in defiance of the report of the commission.</P>
      <P>I briefed the Deputy privately about the two problems that arose.  Whether the first caused the second is a matter upon which speculation may take place in the history books.  Whether the position of the British Government was less clear because of the position being adopted by Sinn Féin and whether it might have been different if Sinn Féin had not adopted that position is something about which one can only speculate. The material facts are that this difference or divergence only became absolutely clear in both its dimensions to me on Tuesday and I decided, with the advice and support of my Government colleagues, that it would not be responsible to proceed with the summit unless we were confident that the purposes for which the summit was being called were going to be achieved.  That was the correct decision and events will prove that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also believe that the problems that are there, which are now clearer than they would otherwise have been if no date had been set, will be resolved more easily as a result of the work that is being done.  It is important to recognise that the peace process is a process of building trust.  No one meeting will solve <Col N="81" /> all the problems but we must be satisifed that we will be moving forward all the time and not in any other direction. I believe we are moving forward at this juncture.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to what would have been asked of the British Government at the press conference, it is clear that it was not going to give the right answer to what was written in the draft communiqué.  However, that refers back to the central position of what is delaying the peace process moving forward. This side of the House accepts that it is a process.  I hope the Taoiseach is correct.  I listened to Mr. Mayhew speaking to the British-Irish Association at Cambridge, I listened to what Mr. Mates said and, in the last few days, I listened to Mr. Ancram.  I do not see the subtle difference yet.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach is aware that in May 1994, in the process of clarification on this issue, Sinn Féin asked the British Government in question 18A what exactly renunciation of violence meant. That was a clear question.  It received a vague and general reply.  I cannot remember the exact words but at no stage did the British Government insist on arms decommissioning as a precondition. If that was its view &mdash; and that is what it is stating now &mdash; it would have answered thus in direct correspondence with Sinn Féin.  It is still the same issue. Since the failed or delayed summit, has the Taoiseach, in the course of his direct talks and yesterday's telephone conversation with Mr. Major, resolved that issue?  Does he or will he accept that decommissioning was not a precondition? That is what is creating the difficulty for the Taoiseach&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We have made some progress on it.  There is a determination in all quarters to find a solution now. The Deputy can quote from certain documents and I can quote from others. In paragraph 6 of the Downing Street Declaration, for example, it is clearly established that the occupant of my office has an obligation to work to create a new era of trust in which suspicion of the motives or actions of others is removed on the part of either community.</P>
      <P>That imposes an obligation on me, as Taoiseach, to work to satisfy the nationalist community that loyalist arms can never again be used against it and, equally importantly, to satisfy the unionist community that IRA arms can never again be used or threatened against it.  That is a clear obligation imposed, with the agreement of my predecessor, on me and on any successor I may have.  That is the basis upon which I am working to resolve the decommissioning issue.</P>
      <P>We must provide reassurance to both communities that the guns still held by organisations which insist on their right to hold them will be put out of commission as soon as possible and, certainly, that their use will never be threatened again.  I am acting on the basis of the Downing Street Declaration which is a commitment of the Irish Government, entered into by my predecessor, and not on the basis of a British Government answer to a Sinn Féin questionnaire.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Paragraph 10 of the Downing Street Declaration states that the parties who support paramilitary organisations must establish a commitment to exclusively peaceful methods.  That must be established to the satisfaction not of their friends but of their foes.  It is easy to <Col N="83" /> establish one's good faith to the satisfaction of one's friends; in a peace process one must establish one's good faith to the satisfaction of one's foes.  That is the challenge for Sinn Féin, the Progressive Unionist Party and the Ulster Democratic Party in paragraph 10.  The obligation on me is set out in paragraph 6.</P>

Would the Taoiseach agree that we need to create the circumstances or the environment where it will be unreasonable for anybody to stay away <Col N="84" /> from the table?  We must create the circumstances in which it would be unreasonable for anybody &mdash; whether it is the unionists or Sinn Féin &mdash; to stay away from the table.

      <P>I entirely agree with the proposition that it is the obligation and responsibility of this Government to create the conditions in which all the relevant parties would come to the table.  There is no point in starting talks to which one side comes because they are satisfied with the conditions, and the other side stays away because they are not satisfied.</P>
      <P>As the Government of this country, it is our job to make a judgment at any given time as to whether an agreement is sufficient to achieve that objective.  I made the judgment on the day before the summit that what was in prospect at that stage would not fulfil the objective. Therefore, there was no point in going ahead with it unless we were going to ruin it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am working, however, to achieve a situation, with the assistance of my Government colleagues, the Tánaiste, the Minister for Social Welfare and others, to get to a point where we have an agreement that will bring all the relevant parties with us, but, as I made abundantly clear in my speech in Dublin Castle, this sovereign Government will make decisions at the end of the day. We will seek to bring others with us but, if we have to move forward without their prior agreement, having done everything necessary to get their prior agreement and failed, we will go ahead. We are not going to do that recklessly or precipitously.  If we take the time necessary and do not set artificial deadlines or speak the language of crisis or confrontation &mdash; we are careful in our choice of words &mdash; we will get it.  The <Col N="85" /> more talk there is about crisis, the more difficult it becomes to achieve the trust that is needed.</P>

      <P>I know the Taoiseach was being careful in his choice of words. I put it to him that within days of the postponed summit, he gave a speech in which he said that the two Governments soon might have to move on, in relation to decommissioning, without the participation of a number of elements whereas, within 24 hours of that speech, the Tánaiste made what might be regarded as a diametrically opposed speech, where he said there was no point proceeding with the forum or commission for decommissioning without the participation of the main components that the Government would be addressing within that.  I put it to the Taoiseach that those two speeches were checked by the respective officials who, apparently, did not see any difference between those two speeches which I cannot understand.  Could the Taoiseach explain that?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Clearly &mdash; this is something which I hope the party opposite, speaking of Fianna Fáil, agrees with &mdash; in the final analysis, the Governments have a right and an obligation to move forward if others cannot be brought along.  I recollect Deputy Bertie Ahern saying here on a number of occasions that the Irish Government should not see itself simply as a broker. By that I understand him to mean that, in the finaly analysis, the Government must act as well as attempt to facilitate agreement.  That is precisely what I was saying in my Dublin Castle speech.</P>
      <P>Equally, the Tánaiste was saying in his speech the following day to the British-Irish Association, as I have said here and also said in the Dublin Castle speech, that in pragmatic terms we must do everything possible to bring all the other parties with us and, if that involves postponing the summit until we have conditions right, then we should postpone the summit until we have brought all parties with us.  If that does not work, as I said in response to Deputy Harney, the position set out in my Dublin Castle speech stands: the Government, having made its effort, has the right and the obligation to go ahead to use leadership in this matter.</P>
      <P>As far as the nuclear power issue is concerned, I raised that matter with the Prime Minister and, as I said in my reply, I am awaiting a response from him and, if needs be, we will discuss the matter again.</P>

We had reached an advanced stage in that communiqué, it is true, but some of the conditions surrounding the communiqué, as distinct from the communiqué itself, which were necessary for the success of the objectives set out in the communiqué, were absent.

      <P>There are number of questions down for answer by the Taoiseach which asked when he became aware of the fact that Sinn Féin was not prepared to go along with the proposed decommissioning. In the reply he gave, he responded that it was &ldquo;in the days immediately before&rdquo; the proposed meeting.  In a reply to a supplementary he said that it was &ldquo;a short time before&rdquo;. I am trying to get precision.  What do &ldquo;in the days immediately before&rdquo; and &ldquo;a short time before&rdquo; mean?  Do they mean on the Monday or Tuesday, as some Government spokesmen are claiming, or do they mean the Thursday or Friday of the previous week, as Sinn Féin is claiming?

As far as the other matter referred to in the Deputy's question is <Col N="88" /> concerned, I know the Deputy has much experience in this area, but he will be wasting his time trying to find divisions in this Government as far as this matter is concerned.  The Government has been working in a concerted and careful manner in regard to this and all parties in the Government are complementing one another in the work that they are doing to promote the peace process. Deputy Dempsey, in particular, would not be the man to be entering into this area, in view of his own experiences.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach has put much emphasis today on the word &ldquo;trust&rdquo; and the trust that the Irish Government has to build up between Nationalists and loyalists.  The most revealing thing that the Taoiseach said when talking about the cessation of violence and the fact that the Irish Government, as we do on this side of the House, believes that we have reached a &ldquo;definitive end of violence&rdquo;&mdash; in the words of one of Sinn Féin's leaders &mdash; was that the UK does not share that trust.  The way they are handling the prisoners issue is another example of that.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, it is a precondition &mdash; not of the making of the Taoiseach or anybody in this House &mdash; made after the event that is causing the difficulty.  Does the Taoiseach see any movement from the British Government that might unlock this situation in the foreseeable future?  Can I take it that the summit is unlikely to take place in the foreseeable future?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important that we should not see the problem of dealing with decommissioning solely as one created by the British Government and I hope the Deputy is not pretending that this is the case.  It is clear that in the <Col N="89" /> Downing Street Declaration there is a requirement on the Irish Government to work to achieve trust on the part of the unionist community that IRA arms will never be used against them.  Independently of anything the British Government might do, we are obliged under paragraph 6 of the declaration to work to persuade Sinn Féin and the Unionists to provide one another with sufficient reassurance that IRA arms will never be used again against the Unionist community.  The same applies in reverse to Nationalist fears about loyalist arms.  The problem is not created by one Government.  Both Governments agreed with the terms of paragraph 10 of the Downing Street Declaration which dealt with that matter.  In this instance it was a predecessor of mine from a different party who agreed to that paragraph.  There is an obligation on both Governments, on the relevant communities and, in particular, on parties associated with those who hold arms to help solve this problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Ms McManus)</NameTxt>
      <P>Most of the bodies under the aegis of my Department are subject to independent audit, either by the Comptroller and Auditor General or the Local Government Audit Service.  Efficiency and value for money auditing is now an important and developing feature of the audit practices of these two independent bodies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="90" /> The Comptroller and Auditor General (Amendment) Act, 1993, empowered the Comptroller and Auditor General to examine economy and efficiency in the use of resources; a majority of the State-sponsored bodies under the aegis of my Department are subject to such examination.</P>
    <P>All local authorities, together with three of the State-sponsored bodies under my Department's aegis, are subject to audit by the Local Government Audit Service within which a value for money unit was established in 1993.  The unit, which undertakes reviews of selected local authority operations, assists authorities in the provision of services in an efficient and effective manner and in ensuring that value for money is obtained from the resources available. Ongoing performance, in the light of the reviews, is monitored at the annual audit of individual accounts.</P>
    <P>I am generally satisfied that these arrangements, as they develop, will assist the bodies concerned to deliver services in a cost effective manner. However, I will be keeping the situation under review to see if further measures should be taken.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for her reply.  The Comptroller and Auditor General is not empowered to audit local authorities.  Will the Minister of State consider extending the brief of the Comptroller and Auditor General to local authorities specifically to allow him introduce value for money audits?  I am aware of what the local government auditor does; he just checks the books to make sure money is not spent incorrectly but I am talking about getting value for money for local authorities. Most Deputies and members of local authorities would admit that we are not getting value for money in many areas.  Why are value for money audits carried out by the local government audit service and the Department not made public?  Surely the public and members of local authorities have a right to know whether an authority is carrying out its business efficiently and <Col N="91" /> effectively and that the public is getting value for money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been a general improvement in auditing and in achieving value for money.  The Comptroller and Auditor General (Amendment) Act, 1993, has improved matters and widened the scope of responsibility.  At the moment the Local Government Audit Service has responsibility for auditing the accounts of all local authorities, motor tax offices and some minor local bodies.  I said in my reply that this matter would be kept under review.  The fact that there have been improvements and a general increased awareness among local authorities and other bodies of the concept of value for money is an indication that we are making progress.  I will take on board the points raised by the Deputy but the progress which has been made must be recognised and acknowledged.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Minister is sincere in saying there have been improvements but none of us knows if this is so because nothing is made public. These audits should be made public so that members of local authorities and the public would know whether there was efficiency and value; this would be similar to the system which applies in Wales and England.  Does the Minister agree that the public has a right to know why surface dressing of roads in Monaghan and Mayo is 250 per cent cheaper than in Fingal and 100 per cent cheaper than in Dún Laoghaire?  Why can we not be given this kind of information? Will the Minister ensure that value for money audits are published?</P>

Road tests must be introduced by 1 June next and we are the last EU country to introduce them.  Ireland and Denmark, which has a restrictive motor testing regime, have the highest rates of motor insurance in the EU.  Why are proposals not before the Government?

      <P>EU legislation on the environment, which covers practically all sectors of the environment, applies throughout the Union for the benefit of all EU citizens.  Primary responsibility for the implementation and enforcement of this legislation rests with member states who are required to establish the necessary legal and administrative arrangements at national level, and in accordance with national practice, for that purpose.  Responsibility for taking legal proceedings to ensure compliance with Union environment legislation rests primarily with the European Commission. It is also open to a member state, under Article 170 of the Treaty on European Union, where it considers that another member state has failed to fulfil an obligation under the Treaty, to bring the matter before the Court of Justice.  No fundamental change in this allocation of responsibilities appears at present to be contemplated within the EU.</P>

      <Col N="95" /> Community involvement in relation to nuclear issues is based on the EURATOM Treaty.

      <P>Would the Minister accept that there is a major gap in both the Treaty of Rome and the Maastricht Treaty because no Euro law is in place to control or govern transboundary pollution? As a result, emissions from plants in a member state can, with impunity, cause serious damage to the health or livelihood of citizens in a neighbouring state.  Would the Minister agree that this country is particularly vulnerable because of our proximity to places like Sellafield and Wylfa?

This is the first time that the Government has set up such a group specifically in response to our concern about Sellafield.  The Deputy has raised a point which is of great concern to all parties so I do not see it solely as a Government concern. The group is looking at the treaty involved as well as assessing the possibilities of legal action.  We will be seeking advice from the Attorney General on that.

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;it would not be a problem, but we are part of a much larger group of countries.  We have to pursue that approach and there is general agreement that a review is necessary. The way in which it is framed at the moment is not adequate.  As regards taking legal action as an individual country, if we are dependent solely on a cross-European approach it may be that we are not taking every opportunity open to us.  The ministerial group has adopted a comprehensive view including a review of the EURATOM Treaty. While it is obviously a vital one, we may not be able to wait for it.  We want to make sure that we take all the options open to us.</P>

      <P>Rent supplementation under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme provides a means, in addition to local authority housing and the other social housing measures, by which persons in need of housing and unable to provide it from their own resources can get access to suitable housing.  SWA rent supplementation is funded by the Department of Social Welfare and administered by the health boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A review group on rent and mortgage supplementation under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, established by the Minister for Social Welfare, is at present completing its report. <Col N="98" /> The Ministers concerned have agreed that, after this report has been considered, an interdepartmental committee, under the aegis of my Department, will then be set up to examine the major issues involved in transferring the administration of SWA rent and mortgage supplementation to the local authorities in accordance with the commitment given in the policy agreement, A Government of Renewal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>What are the Minister's priorities for that review group? When it reports will the Minister insist that local authorities control rent allowances in future?  Will the Minister see to it that for a house to be approved for a rent allowance the standards that have been brought in will apply?  What is the Minister's view on those matters? Specifically, the Minister may have noticed that lately Dublin Corporation is taking a very hard line in evicting drug dealers for anti-social behaviour. However, such people are going to the nearest clinic and getting a couple of hundred pounds a month to rent a private house which is nullifying the corporation's good work.</P>

      <P>Can the Minister of State, in co-ordination with the Minister for Social Welfare, take some immediate action to stop that practice, whatever about the long term review group? It is making a skit of the good work the corporation is doing.  The State should not help to re-house people who have been evicted from a corporation house for known and proven anti-social behaviour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government adopted the principle in <i>A Government of Renewal</i> that such payments should come under the aegis of the local housing authorities.  At present, there is a difficulty because these allowances are paid by the Department of Social Welfare. I am sure the Deputy supports the Government in the approach it has <Col N="99" /> adopted.  I must wait until that comes into force in order to determine how payments are made.  Perhaps the Deputy should table his question to the Minister for Social Welfare.</P>
      <P>The reply I gave clearly outlined my approach once the report, which was set up by the last Government and prepared for the Minister for Social Welfare, is completed.  Once it is out of the way we can establish an interdepartmental group to work out how this transfer will take place.  I understand the Deputy's impatience but he must understand that this change will require consideration and consultation to ensure that we do it in the best possible way. We must ensure that the crossover to which he referred, where Dublin Corporation takes one action and it appears to have been diluted by a Department, does not happen.  However, that requires attention from a number of Departments to ensure we get it right.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>

We cannot wait a year or 18 months for Dublin Corporation to do something about it.  After a lot of reluctance it is now evicting people who are known drug dealers.  I ask the Minister to take immediate action in this regard without waiting for the review group's report.  It is ludicrous to evict people if another State agency houses them in expensive private areas where their anti-social behaviour will cause problems.</P>

The consultants will undertake a wide ranging review of the impact of the various schemes which have come into operation since 1986, including Temple Bar.

      <P>The Green Party has supported the lifting of the constitutional ban on divorce for many years.  This referendum is long overdue.  It is a pity it has been framed in such a way as to ensure that the legal profession stands to gain considerably from the litigation which will result from dealing with such a complicated issue in the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I speak as a Green Party TD but also as a former teacher.  Proposals from the Government, other parties and interest groups should emphasise the welfare of children in any arrangements to prevent marital breakdown.  When breakdown is unavoidable, the situation should be dealt with in the most humane and <Col N="178" /> understanding way possible.  It is important to remember that it is the breakdown of marriage which damages families and children.  The results of that are known to all of us in this House and many people outside.  Divorce is a symptom, or perhaps a partial solution, but it is breakdown which we must try to prevent and for which we must provide.</P>
    <P>I have been calling on the Minister for Equality and Law Reform to improve mediation services since I entered the House.  I have also called for family mediation, not simply mediation for couples, and I have stressed that this should be properly resourced.  The training of people who work in mediation and counselling is vital because it must be a professional service. I feel strongly about this; further work is required in the area.</P>
    <P>As a Green Party spokesperson, I have been shocked at the lack of conviction I have detected in a number of the Government spokespersons when advancing the arguments for or explaining the Government's proposals. I know the Minister will disagree because he has worked on this for so long.  However, he depends on other Government spokespersons to put the case and they have not been quite as strong as those in Opposition when participating in television and radio programmes and in the media generally.</P>
    <P>I am further shocked that, rather than training the Government to speak with conviction on its own proposals, a large quantity of the taxpayers' money is being provided to repeat to a large extent the injustice done during the Maastricht referendum when the Government line was forced through by the expenditure of large sums of money on PR.  This will not result in the harmony we would like to see in society following the result of the referendum.  It is as well to avoid the type of recrimination that can result when the Government adopts a blatantly partisan approach to a referendum.  Acknowledging that there has been some review of the Government's one-sided campaign, I still believe that we have not <Col N="179" /> seen the spirit of fair play in the referendum as yet.</P>
    <P>For all those reasons I welcome an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> today by Vincent Browne.  He sets out a number of the arguments which should have been advanced by Government spokespersons but which seem to have been left for articulation by somebody in the media.  While that person may have some time to think about what they have to say, it is important that the Government has answers for people who try to argue against lifting the ban on divorce.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that the Constitution is being used by the Government as a kind of smoke screen to facilitate a complicated change when legislation could and should have been used to greater effect.  The Constitution is becoming a weighty document and as such is being demeaned.  A constitution of any organisation, not to mention a country, ought to be as short and concise as possible.  It should not deal with complicated matters which are more properly dealt with in legislation.</P>
    <P>Some commentators who are opposed to the lifting of the ban confuse the Constitution with the bible.  They are very different documents with different purposes.  People should remember that the bible can be interpreted in many different ways and it is irresponsible to use it as something with which to bash people who disagree with the views of the majority church in this country.  We are here to speak for all the people.  In the media one sometimes hears mention of &ldquo;the church&ldquo; as if there was only one church.  It is important to stress the pluralist context in which we are dealing with this issue.</P>
    <P>I believe in democracy and also that TDs should be made account for their views on this referendum.  I therefore believe I have no choice but to support the PD proposal which will force a vote in the Dáil.  In that way people outside the House can see how Deputies view this referendum.  This is my reason for supporting that proposal.  If there is no <Col N="180" /> vote in the Dáil on such issues, it is another indication that the claim of transparency we often hear about is empty and indeed absent.  I hope Deputies will be allowed vote on the matter and express to the electorate exactly what they think before they ask the electorate to do the same.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I pay tribute to the Minister, Deputy Taylor, for the steady preparation in which he has been involved in bringing this Bill to this House.  In many ways it has been low key but it has been thorough.  I have said this outside the House in the past.  I also pay tribute to the manner in which he introduced the Bill today by acknowledging, quite rightly, much of the work done by previous Governments and Ministers.</P>
      <P>In many ways divorce and the proposed referendum mark a defining moment in the development of modern Ireland.  The outcome of the referendum will reflect how we in Ireland approach not only the tragedy of marital breakdown but, on a deeper level, how we view the complex relationships between church and State, religion and law and between the majority of our people and minority groups.</P>
      <P>Unhappy and tragic marriages are nothing new.  Violence, abuse and neglect have haunted many families in the past and, unfortunately, will do so in the future.  For one reason or another persons find that they can no longer cope with the relationship from which love has gone, if it ever existed, and which is replaced by loneliness, fear and even despair.  Marital breakdown is a social reality and pretending it does not happen, or wishing it would not happen, will not make it go away.  Despite the best efforts of mediators, conciliators and even the parties themselves there will always be a number of persons for whom an irretrievable breakdown is a sad reality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For a long time we in Ireland chose to ignore or hide our social problems but they did not go away.  They remained in the background like some dark family secret which we were too <Col N="181" /> embarrassed to discuss or debate.  We have been forced to confront many of those problems in an open and public manner in recent times.  Marital breakdown and divorce are yet another social issue which we must face realistically and honestly.  No one can seriously dispute that marital breakdown is part of our society.  We, as a Legislature, have passed a number of significant measures to deal with the effects of such breakdown. The legislation governing judicial separation now deals comprehensively with the rights and duties of separated spouses, the division of assets, the maintenance and support of children and questions of custody and access.</P>
    <P>In effect, we have already dealt as a Legislature with the after effects of broken marriages.  The proposed amendment will not change the law dealing with income or property upon marital breakdown, nor will it change the law dealing with maintenance or support of children, access or custody. The net effect of the amendment will be to grant the right of remarriage to those whose marriages have irretrievably broken down.  That, in essence, is what we are asking the people to vote for or against.</P>
    <P>Take, for instance, the plight of a young woman, the victim of domestic violence and, ultimately, desertion by her husband.  If, after some time, she meets someone else and enters into a rewarding, stable and loving relationship, are we to deny her the opportunity to remarry and the right to have her long term and loving relationship recognised and regulated by law as marriage?</P>
    <P>Many people already find themselves in long term second relationships.  Many children have already been born into these second relationships.  This is the reality.  Surely, the children of these long term relationships can expect the State to recognise the relationship between their parents and allow them to remarry so that the children of second relationships can be afforded the same social and legal recognition as others.  Why should they carry a social or legal stigma when they are innocent?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="182" /> In many if not most instances of marital breakdown and separation the parties have no desire to remarry and the proposed amendment will have little or no effect on such persons.  However, in some instances there are those who wish to marry again.  There are people who have entered into long term second relationships.  There are children born of these second relationships and failure to recognise and give effect to such circumstances cannot be right.</P>
    <P>Divorce is not a cure all.  It is not a solution to marital breakdown; it is simply a recognition of reality.  We must always bear in mind the consequences of marital breakdown on children.  An unhappy and riven home life can scar children for life.  Children are damaged by the breakdown in the relationship between husband and wife, the absence of love in marriage, the fighting, the tension and the unhappiness in the home. It is the breakdown of the relationship between husband and wife which damages children not the making of a judicial separation order or the granting of a divorce.</P>
    <P>As Professor Anthony Clare pointed out, research suggests that the cleaner the separation or divorce, the better the outcome for the health and welfare of the children.  The introduction of divorce will afford the parties to a broken marriage the opportunity to finalise their affairs, make a clean break and offer the possibility to both them and their children of a second, more stable and loving relationship.</P>
    <P>We hear about damage to children as if it were inevitable that all children of separated parents are emotionally and socially scarred for life.  This is a grave injustice to thousands of single and separated parents who, often in difficult circumstances, have successfully reared their children to become happy and well adjusted members of society.  It is a grave injustice to thousands of children of separated parents who adapted, sometimes painfully, to the break-up of their families but who have grown up to become perfectly normal adults. Undoubtedly, the break-up of a family <Col N="183" /> will have an effect on all members of that family and may present children with particular difficulties in adjusting to the absence of a parent, the lowering of living standards or to any new relationship their parents may form.  As a society we need to support and assist children in this situation but we cannot do this by pretending that marriage breakdown does not happen in Ireland or that second relationships are not formed. We must acknowledge the realities of Irish life and of Irish families.</P>
    <P>For many the issue of divorce is a question of religious principle.  On grounds of personal conscience and religious conviction, they feel they cannot support or introduce a law which runs contrary to their religious beliefs. However, we now live in an Ireland which has changed dramatically since the adoption of the Constitution in 1937.  Our society is now more diverse than ever and our State institutions and laws ought to respect and reflect that diversity.</P>
    <P>We in this House have a duty to shape the law to meet the legitimate needs of all our people.  This duty is not necessarily fulfilled by modelling the civil law on the teaching of one particular church, even if those are the beliefs shared by the majority of the population. The law must respect the rights of those of different faiths and of none who are equal citizens of this State.</P>
    <P>I would describe myself as a republican and, as such, I believe in a democratic society, the separation of the powers of Church and State, the dignity and rights of each individual and the principles of tolerance and compassion.  As a Catholic I am affected by questions of conscience but, as a republican and democrat, I know my own religious beliefs cannot and should not be used to justify laws which would force others of differing views into a legal and moral straitjacket, which neither respects nor recognises their separate beliefs or traditions.</P>
    <P>As a State, we must try to cater for all our citizens and not just for those <Col N="184" /> who share our own religious or moral ethics.  We in the Fianna Fáil Party come from a great tradition of republicanism stretching back beyond this century which strove to ensure that Catholic, Protestant and dissenter could live together in freedom and harmony on this island.  At a time when continuing peace in Northern Ireland is an increasing reality, we have never been so conscious of the need to understand and respect differences in belief, culture and lifestyle.  The measure of our democracy is not only in how we give effect to the wishes of the majority but also in how we respond to the needs and rights of the minority.  Now, perhaps more than ever, we need to show a degree of tolerance and diversity in our approach to social and moral issues.</P>
    <P>We can recall the often quoted reference to Northern Ireland as a Protestant State for a Protestant people.  The intolerance and narrowmindedness behind that concept has left a painful and lasting legacy upon a part of our island.  As we now seek to build a new and better relationship between the people of this island and as we talk of peace and reconciliation, can we match our action to our words?  Can we give practical effect to the concept of minority rights, tolerance and understanding or will we be regarded as merely a Catholic State for a Catholic people?  How we tolerate and accommodate the views, beliefs and needs of those who differ from the majority illustrates whether, in fact, we are, as we proclaim, a caring and compassionate society.</P>
    <P>I firmly believe in the family as the fundamental unit of society and that it is the duty of this State to encourage and support married and family life.  I also believe it is the right of persons in any civilised society to be allowed to put unhappy and broken marriages behind them and be given the chance to start again where due provision has been made for the health and welfare of affected parties.  For this reason I believe we should have divorce but we should channel more energy and <Col N="185" /> resources into supporting and maintaining family life.  We should have sufficient confidence in ourselves and in our maturity as a nation to trust that the right to remarry provided by this amendment will be exercised responsibly by those of our fellow citizens who are now locked into the legal limbo of permanent separation, and will not bring about the end of society as we know it.</P>
    <P>Since the last divorce referendum in 1986 we are an older, wiser and possibly sadder community.  We have had to face up to many unpleasant social issues.  We have had to look at victims where previously we saw no crime.  We have had to question many values which we used to take as read.  Despite the many difficulties I believe that this last decade has been a period of growth and understanding. When we go to the polls on 24 November it will be an acknowledgement of the complexities of marriage breakdown and compassion for those caught in the present legal vacuum.</P>
    <P>The Minister rightly acknowledged in this speech the many years of work done by previous Governments and Ministers in addressing the problems surrounding marital breakdown.</P>
    <P>He also referred to the significance of the White Paper on marriage breakdown published by the then Fianna Fáil Minister for Justice, Mr. Pádraig Flynn, in September 1992, which laid the groundwork for this debate.  As legislators we must deal as best we can with the problems affecting the tens of thousands of people whose marriages have broken down.  This Bill has been preceded by ten years of legislation on the family and marriage breakdown. It is accompanied by a draft Bill which clarifies the position if divorce is introduced.</P>
    <P>There has been some criticism in the media about my party's response.  It needs to be understood that Fianna Fáil, the largest political party, will naturally represent within its ranks a diversity of opinion. What goes on in Fianna Fáil is public knowledge and the parliamentary party meeting is no longer a private event.  At meetings on social issues the <Col N="186" /> diversity of opinion has been very evident and reported on.  I respect that diversity and the conviction of people who hold different views.  It needs to be appreciated that what happens in Fianna Fáil reflects in many ways what is happening in the wider society.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil has dealt with the issue of divorce and made clear its position on the Bill.  I ask the Government parties to put some enthusiasm and conviction into their campaign on this important referendum.  A heads down approach will not work and will be seen for what it is by the electorate.  I hope such an approach will not be pursued as it may lead to a disastrous outcome in so far as those of us who support a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote are concerned.  The Fianna Fáil Party will support the passage of the Bill through the Oireachtas and our party spokesman, Deputy Woods, has put forward a five year action plan of back-up support for cases of marriage breakdown. Will the Government give serious consideration to these proposals?</P>
    <P>Deputy Woods referred to the status of marriage.  Setting up the Oireachtas Committee on the Family was a recognition of the economic and social pressures on marriages and families in a modern society and the changes in the workplace where in many cases both parents work full-time or part-time.</P>
    <P>Child care was also referred to.  When I became a Member of the House in 1987 child care was a live issue at the Committee on Women's Rights.  What concrete measures have been taken in this area?  There has been reference to crèche facilities and many excellent proposals on paternal leave have been put forward at EU level.  However, as a nation we lag far behind many of our EU colleagues on these matters.  It is necessary to put measures in this area on a statutory basis.</P>
    <P>Deputy Woods referred to the counselling service.  In this respect there should be an obligation on the spouses in separation or divorce cases to participate in the counselling process.  At present this service is provided by voluntary organisations.  They must be <Col N="187" /> properly funded.  We have also emphasised the need to focus on providing help for families in need.  Many families, particularly less well off ones, have financial and housing problems.  These need to be addressed as they contribute to marriage difficulties.  The role of education was also referred to.  An educational programme on marriage and what it entails must form part of the school curriculum.  Other proposals relate to time-out for parents and the appointment of a commissioner for children attached to the courts who would be responsible for and represent the needs of children in cases of marriage breakdown.  We also propose a fundamental upgrading of the family courts.</P>
    <P>We have heard much from the anti-divorce lobby about the need to protect the family, even in cases where one parent is absent and the step-parent loves, supports and nurtures the children.  In their rush to be seen to protect the family these lobbyists have failed to realise that the individuals most committed to the institution of the family are those who have endured the trauma of marriage breakdown and who still wish to confer the legal status of marriage on their second relationship and the constitutional status of a family on the children of that relationship.</P>
    <P>Those who oppose the right to remarry will no doubt use scare tactics and try to concentrate the minds of voters on the issues of property and land. They will try to deflect the arguments from the fundamental and central questions of civil and human rights to more self-centred and emotional questions which will no doubt create fear and worry in the minds of the public.  The truth is that women are the main victims of marriage breakdown and in many instances they suffer domestic violence and abuse in silence.  It takes considerable courage and strength to end such a relationship.  This referendum campaign does not need a scaremongering witch-hunt against people who are vulnerable because of an absence of appropriate legislation.  Rather we need a caring and <Col N="188" /> supportive legal structure which will allow for remarriage in specific circumstances. I am confident this House and the electorate have the capacity, will and compassion to get it right on this occasion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare (Mr. Durkan) Bernard Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare (Mr. Durkan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment Deputy Kitt on his constructive, supportive and unemotional contribution to this debate.  I also compliment the Minister for Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Taylor, for bringing this Bill before the House and putting in place adequate back-up legislation to ensure a proper debate and the enactment of this Bill.  I hope the debate inside and outside the House will be objective and unemotional with no personal animosity and that no one will seek for reasons of political expediency to exploit the tragic situation in which many people find themselves.  I also hope that anything I say will not undermine their position.</P>
      <P>It is important to ponder on the concept of divorce for a moment.  People will not pursue divorce as a social option available to them.  Marriage breakdown is a fact of life and there has been a huge increase in the number of cases of marriage breakdown in recent years.  There are those who will say we should not encourage marriage breakdown. We are not encouraging marriage breakdown.  Rather society is evolving that way and public representatives cannot change what is happening.  Are we fit to judge people whose marriages have broken down?  Why should we think we have the right to say to people whose marriages have broken down, perhaps through no fault of their own, we cannot help you and we do not propose to help you?  That is an uncaring attitude and is certainly not in keeping with that of a caring society which we claim to be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us look at some of the other issues.  The main churches have already indicated their opposition to divorce, as is their right.  They are entitled to speak to their respective flocks and inform <Col N="189" /> them of their views on the issue, and have no difficulty with that.  The churches have had to adapt to changes in society and have, in their respective ways, made provision in a humane way for marriage breakdown.  Are we then to suggest that the State should not fall into line?  Is the State to ignore what is happening and do nothing?  What the Government is doing is correct and I hope all parties within this House &mdash; I know there is consensus already &mdash; will do likewise.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that the politicians in this House have a cosy arrangement and that they do not represent the people.  However, they are elected by the people who have the right to re-elect them or otherwise at the next election.  The people have elected the Members of this House to speak for them, and that is what we propose to do.</P>
    <P>Let us look at some of the arguments for and against divorce.  I abhor the scaremongering emanating from some quarters by way of misinformation.  It has been suggested that divorce will put an end to many existing marriages.  Marriages where couples have separated by agreement or otherwise will come to the fore in the early stages in the event of the passing of this legislation.  However, there is nothing we can do about that.  If a couple have agreed to separate, that cannot be reversed by legislation.  We cannot force people to live together if they have agreed to separate.</P>
    <P>On the question of the welfare of wives and children, I compliment the Government on the preparatory legislation it has put in place in the last few years.  When a referendum of this nature was last put to the people, sufficient time was not given to put such legislation in place.  This has now been done and there is no reason for any scare about succession rights or the welfare of children.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that this legislation, if passed, will encourage separation and create a further threat to children and wives.  It has also been <Col N="190" /> suggested that a woman could be divorced against her will.  Does that mean that legislation could change irretrievable breakdown of a marriage and the separation of a couple?  On what basis could somebody be divorced against their will?  I am not an expert in this area but I have dealt with the situation on behalf of my constituents for many years.  Of what benefit will it be in regard to maintaining the children and keeping up the family home if the State refuses the right of a separated spouse to remarry?  There is no benefit.  Does a woman who is deserted and left to look after a family have a choice?  Although the legislation will not solve her problem, it will not make it worse.  It will improve it considerably by virtue of the provisions for her and her children.</P>
    <P>There has been criticism that the grounds on which a divorce may be granted are not liberal enough.  This is an old question.  Some will say we have gone too far, others that we have not gone far enough.  We cannot win.  The legislation as proposed, including the constitutional provision, is the best that could be arrived at in any circumstances and makes the necessary provisions prior to the introduction of divorce legislation.  This has been dealt with in great detail and in such a way as to take into account the anxiety of the people to retain certain provisions in the Constitution and retain for themselves certain powers relative to legislation.  That is not possible in all situations but it is desirable in some, and this is one such situation.</P>
    <P>It has also been suggested that divorce will encourage the break-up of marriages, but this trend has been increasing in the last ten years, and not because divorce was in existence.  It is happening because of changes in society.  It may not be a good thing and I am sure everybody will do their utmost to ensure that it does not continue. Some people say divorce legislation will make it easy for that to continue. I do not think it will.  It is not easy at present, but still marriages are breaking down.  It is most important to <Col N="191" /> emphasise that divorce will not be mandatory.  It will not be enforceable by law that everybody who gets married will have to get divorced.  We are merely lifting the constitutional ban on remarriage. If this ban was not in the Constitution, would we introduce one?  I do not think we would.  On what grounds could such a ban be introduced?  Could it be introduced on the grounds that it would slow down the break-up of marriages? It would not do that.  Changes are taking place in society whether we like it or not.</P>
    <P>Another piece of misinformation also being bandied about is that there will be an extra cost to the Exchequer and that the State will not be able to meet the costs of divorce.  That has already been debated in the context of the Social Welfare Bills and of the Finance Bill. My colleague, the Minister for Social Welfare, Proinsias De Rossa, has repeatedly dealt with that issue.  The best estimate is that the introduction of divorce will cost about £1 million in the first five years and £2 million in the next five year period.  To those who scoff at that idea I say that at present, given the trends in the past ten years, we are already making provision for marriage breakdown.  We had to make provision by way of allowances for deserted wives, lone parents and so on.  Present trends are likely to continue in the foreseeable future and it is on that basis the Department has arrived at its projection which is a reasonably accurate one.  I do not accept there will be a huge increase in the cost to the Exchequer and that as a result of this legislation the taxpayer will have to pay extraordinarily excessive taxes.  The taxpayer is already carrying the cost of marriage breakdown and will have to continue to do so.  In case it might be suggested that should not be the case, what is a woman to do who may be left with large debts, a family and no income unless she can rely on the State to provide for her in a reasonable way?  That is what is happening at present.  I expect that provision to continue and that society would expect us, <Col N="192" /> as legislators, to continue to provide for people in such cases.</P>
    <P>There is now greater emphasis on mediation services and marriage counselling. Those services were not given the same attention ten years ago as they are given today.  It is generally recognised that greater time and effort must be put into mediation and counselling and that is being undertaken by the Government on a phased basis and must continue to be done.  The question of funding agencies providing such services is ongoing.  Available figures attest to the success or otherwise of counselling and mediation services.  The figures are reasonably good.  It is an indication of the Government's intention that we should proceed along that road to prevent marriage breakdown in so far as it is possible.  This legislation is necessary to deal with cases where it was not possible to prevent marital breakdown.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the issue of whether couples who disagree or do not wish to live together should be forced to remain together.  From my experience of the majority of such cases with which I have dealt in my constituency, and I do not know whether I speak for everybody in the House, the woman has been the victim in the household.  Surely in such cases we must expect that the tab should be taken up by the State, and that is already happening.  There seems to be a lack of recognition in some quarters of the plight of such women.  I am sure all Members have met women in their clinics on a Friday evening or Saturday morning who have told them that their husbands for one reason or another have disappeared and left them with a spate of bills, huge responsibilities and no means.  It would be a very callous society which could provide these women with the necessary subsistence payments by one means or another in the interim, but not allow them to enter into a subsequent relationship.  We do not have the right to be judgmental to that extent.  There was a time when people said that such things only happened to others, but among our friends <Col N="193" /> and our community we know of countless people who have separated, in some cases tragically and in others by agreement. That is how society is evolving. Society may change again, but we must make provision for changes that are happening now.  The proposed legislation is a humane way of dealing with a difficult situation.</P>
    <P>I hope the legislation will be supported by everybody in the House.  It is generally recognised that it is needed to address the problems we have talked about.  I hope the legislation will be supported outside the House and will not become a divisive issue.  I do not believe that any of us have a monopoly on wisdom in this or any other area.  All we can do is rely on our experiences, relate those to the general issue and consider the extent to which we can accommodate those who are affected by changes that have taken place in society and how best we can address their problems.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister for Equality and Law Reform for introducing the legislation and the Opposition for supporting it.  The fact that politicians consider it within their remit to support such legislation is a recognition by all parties of the need to address this problem.  If we did not do that, we would not be as representative of the people's views as we should be.  I support the legislation and I hope when the referendum takes place on 24 November that the people will support the views Members of the House will have expressed.</P>

      <P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I am totally opposed to the removal of the ban from the Constitution to allow divorce be introduced.  I will not be supporting the referendum.  I will vote &ldquo;no&rdquo; and give guidance and leadership to my friends and constituents by encouraging them to do likewise.  The <Col N="194" /> people will make the decision and it is their right to do so under our Constitution. I am opposing the legislation and while that may seem a contradiction, my opposition is based on the fact that details of the required period of separation before a divorce can be granted should not be written into the Constitution. That is more proper to legislation. Do we not have confidence in ourselves as legislators to legislate on these issues?  Writing such a provision into the Constitution is another means by which the Government, and I am saddened it is supported by my party, intend to hoodwink the Irish people into thinking that it will not be possible to get an easy divorce.  Irish people are not fools and will realise that this effort by the Government is one by which it proposes to introduce divorce by stealth or by the back door, but it will not succeed.</P>
    <P>While the opinion polls indicate that the majority of people favour the introduction of divorce, those opinion polls are only valid on the day they are taken. On the day of the referendum when the real decision will be made the people will vote &ldquo;no&rdquo; and reject these proposals as they did so decidedly in 1986. There is no widespread demand to remove the ban on divorce in the Constitution and this will be proven on the day of the referendum.</P>
    <P>Divorce is basically wrong and will destroy the fabric of family life and values.  The wording should be simple. The people should be asked to vote &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo; as to whether they wish to remove the ban on divorce from the Constitution.  As I have already stated, this Government, supported by other parties, will go to any lengths to lead this country down the road of the liberal agenda which will be rejected by the vast majority of people.</P>
    <P>Since I made public my opposition to divorce I have received many letters and telephone calls not only from people living in rural areas but, more particularly, from people living in Dublin city and county.  Their message to me was that they agreed with me in my opposition <Col N="195" /> to divorce and that they would have their say on the day of the referendum.</P>
    <P>On this occasion, unlike 1986, Fianna Fáil is also seeking a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote in this referendum.  I wish to state here, lest the impression be given otherwise, that this is not the unanimous decision of Fianna Fáil; it is far from that.  Many of my colleagues in the parliamentary party are against the introduction of divorce and the vast majority of our supporters throughout the country are opposed to the stance Fianna Fáil has taken.  This will be proved, beyond any doubt, by their widespread rejection of these proposals on the day of the referendum. The message coming to me loudly and clearly from Fianna Fáil members is that on this occasion we have once again got it wrong.  They are asking the question: must we slavishly follow the Government line in this legislation?</P>
    <P>Divorce should not be introduced in this country.  Contrary to what the Minister of State, Deputy Durkan, said, many more marriages will break up when divorce is introduced because more people will avail of it.  My opposition to divorce falls under three headings, the first of those being the question of property which is one of the major issues in this referendum.  Notwithstanding the legislation in place, people are concerned about the division of farms, house property and business premises. In a divorce, who will get the house, the farm or the family business?  Under this legislation, that will be decided by a judge.  Therefore, having spent years building up one's farm or business which may have been in the family for generations, a judge will have absolute authority to dispose of it as he or she wishes.  I am not in favour of that.</P>
    <P>It will be argued by the Government and the Opposition that we already have provision for judicial separation.  In cases of judicial separation, however, the parties involved decide on the division of property.  In cases of divorce, they will not have any say in this matter under this legislation.  Will it be the case that the side which can afford the better <Col N="196" /> lawyer will end up with the assets while the poorer one will be left dependent on social welfare?  Under this legislation, a farm, business premises or homestead will most likely have to be sold in the event of divorce.  That raises the question of the enormous financial and emotional cost to the already over burdened taxpayer, to society, to women and to children.  Divorce is, therefore, a social evil that we can well do without.</P>
    <P>My second point concerns the psychological effects of divorce on children. Must the children of existing unions grow up with psychological scars?  Are these children to be a further burden on the already overtaxed taxpayers?  I will develop this point by referring to claims made by speakers on the opposite side of the House and by the pro-divorce lobby which suggest that the non-availability of divorce is in some way part and parcel of the denial of a civil right. Since its foundation my party, Fianna Fáil, has laid claim to securing the widest range of civil and political rights. The Constitution, which was framed by Fianna Fáil, guarantees to Irish people everywhere the means to secure their individual rights as human beings and as citizens of Ireland.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil should not consider supporting measures which would deny people fundamental and implicit human rights.  The principle of common good is firmly enshrined in our Constitution and wherever the common good is cited, the enjoyment of right must always take precedence over the right of enjoyment. The natural rights to security, enshrined in our Constitution in favour of the children of this nation, are superior to that of the fulfilment of an individual's right to remarry.</P>
    <P>The notion has been put forward by the Government and by the pro-divorce lobby in this debate that freedom and liberty is a simple entitlement to do what one likes.  Every constitutional provision, statute and law is drafted to protect real liberty.  The protection of liberty requires its boundaries to be defined and once we begin to transgress <Col N="197" /> those boundaries, we trade liberty for the path to lawlessness.</P>
    <P>I challenge my opponents and all those who favour the introduction of divorce to say publicly that the right to remarry is a superior right to the right of security enjoyed by children.  I challenge the Government to tell the people in this referendum how it came to hold the view that a child's right to security is inferior to the right not only of its parents but of one parent to permanently threaten that security.</P>
    <P>My third point concerns the question of cost and I am basing my figures on the cost to taxpayers in the United Kingdom.  The experience in the UK has been that the cost of divorce to taxpayers is in the region of £2.6 billion. The cost to this country on a pro rata basis will be in the region of £500 million per year.  Can the Irish taxpayer afford this expenditure?  It cannot.  How many people can afford to support two or three families?  The majority of people own a house and have a large mortgage and when that house is sold there is little to divide.  In the case of divorce, a judge cannot divide what is not there.  We all know, therefore, that poverty will result, particularly for women and children.</P>
    <P>With regard to pension rights, a separated woman is currently entitled to 50 per cent of her husband's pension.  If divorce is introduced, she will have to share her half with wife No. 2, 3 or even 4.  That represents a considerable reduction in her pension entitlements. Once again the taxpayer will be called on to contribute.</P>
    <P>Those in favour of divorce will say I am alarmist, but the fundamental facts cannot be denied.  The reality is clear that the poor will get poorer because of cutbacks in health, social welfare etc. which must come of necessity if divorce is introduced.  Is this the society we want in Ireland?  Even the US and the UK are going in the opposite direction from where we are going.  Can we not learn from their experience?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="198" /> Will divorce be voluntary?  It will not, contrary to what the Minister of State, Deputy Durkan, has said.  If one partner decides to apply for divorce, under this legislation the other party will have no say.  Therefore, the family will be left in poverty.  Is this justice?  One partner could be an innocent party and still could end up on the streets with her children.  The &ldquo;no fault&rdquo; divorce proposals mean the judge will not take into account that, perhaps, one spouse is an alcoholic, a gambler, etc.  The innocent and the guilty will be treated equally before the law.</P>
    <P>The Government and certain sections of the media will produce people who will say with conviction on the airwaves that they are part of a second stable relationship and the absence of divorce will be cited by them as the only factor diminishing the stability of that relationship. Neither the Government nor the media will tell the full story.  The full story will be told at the ballot box when the other partners in these relationships, who suffer needlessly, will voice their view and vote &ldquo;no&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>An environment has been created in Ireland recently where it has become unpopular to say no.  There is a very substantial silent majority saying no and that same substantial majority will stand at the ballot box on referendum day and will determine, by their vote, the kind of society they wish for Ireland by saying no.  I believe they will look at England and America and will decide that when people say they prefer to rear their children in Ireland they will want to keep it that way.</P>
    <P>I condemn strongly the campaign of secrecy engaged in by the Government relating to the issues in this referendum. The people object to being treated as fools and reject totally the concept of propaganda, particularly when disguised as information.  It is wrong of the Government to suggest that there is a balanced information campaign.  The people will reject very strongly the concept of being told they may vote any way, so long as they vote &ldquo;yes&rdquo;.  In what document did the Government tell the <Col N="199" /> people who will pay for divorce?  I have already outlined the details on this &mdash; the people will have to pay for divorce, if introduced.  This country cannot afford to have divorce and cannot afford to contribute additionally and permanently to support a new dependency culture.</P>
    <P>From the standpoint of the Constitution, the proposed amendment is a disaster.  It is drafted in such a way that its effects are contrary to what the Minister claims.  The Minister for Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Taylor, has presented the amendment as being based on a long period of separation. This is simply not true.  A man who has been living with his wife for the past year can walk out and claim a divorce forthwith.  He is permitted to invoke an earlier period when they were apart but, more fundamentally, there is no requirement of physical separation.  It is possible for a court to hold that a husband has been living apart from his wife if he has mentally withdrawn from the relationship, even though he has not expressly announced to his wife that he has repudiated her.  We are not talking here simply about cases where spouses physically live apart under the same roof.  Under the Minister's proposal, a mental withdrawal will be sufficient.  A man who comes into court and says he has had a poor relationship with his wife to such an extent that there was an emotional distance between them, at least in his eyes, will be granted a decree of divorce against his wife.</P>
    <P>I wish to return to the so-called protection of spouses in the area of property. If you look closely at the wording of the amendment you discover that the court is not required to be satisfied that the spouse seeking a divorce has to give adequate financial support or property to the spouse who is being divorced against her will.  What the amendment actually says is that the court must be satisfied that what is termed &ldquo;proper provision&rdquo; will be made for both spouses.  Therefore, the court is required to ensure that the spouse who is <Col N="200" /> rejecting his wife must receive proper provision.  If he is to get proper provision, often there will not be much left to the wife whom he is divorcing. Neither will it be necessary that the husband give his wife any financial provision in a case where his entitlement to proper provision leaves nothing for her. In such a case the divorced wife will go on social welfare.</P>
    <P>The Minister knows perfectly well that divorce of the kind he is proposing will drive divorced wives in their thousands on to social welfare, requiring the court to take into account a husband's entitlement to remarry and take on new financial responsibilities to a new wife. The only way this can be done is by reducing the husband's responsibility to support his wife.</P>
    <P>If we change the Constitution to allow divorce we will then have the contradiction we now have with regard to the right to life of the unborn.  If we say that the family is the basic unit of society, divorce will surely destroy the very fabric of our family.  Our Constitution upholds the importance of the family in society.  Can we not learn from other countries?  As surely as night follows day this referendum will be defeated, notwithstanding the efforts of the parties in Government and &mdash; I am sad to say &mdash; the goings on of my own party. The impression abroad is that Fianna Fáil is in favour of the introduction of divorce.  I repeat, nothing could be further from the truth.</P>

      <P>I respect the differing views that clearly exist in relation to divorce and accept that there are some people who have moral objections to the whole question of divorce.  Every Deputy in the House has a responsibility to be accurate and clear when making statements in relation to this issue.  That responsibility includes the previous speaker who, I believe, has misled, has been inaccurate and in certain instances has been wrong in what he has stated in regard to what the divorce legislation is all about.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="201" /> Nobody doubts that the reality of marital breakdown is painful.  Nobody should be under the illusion that it is a reality a Government or a constitutional provision can actually prevent.  No government in the world can ensure that couples stay together no matter what. We have the evidence here.  Despite the fact that we have no divorce we have seen an increase in marital breakdown. That is a fact and one we must live with and face up to.</P>
    <P>We certainly have a serious obligation to support families.  We have to ensure there are social and economic foundations for stable long-lasting relationships. Poverty, unemployment, bad housing and indeed lack of housing are factors that militate against families and are issues that this Government is determined to address not only in the interests of families but of society as a whole.  In educating our young people we have to ensure they are taught about responsibility in relationships and in particular about responsible parenthood.</P>
    <P>I am very glad my colleague the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Proinsias De Rossa, is about to establish a commission on the family.  That is an important step.  We have to look at ways and means of ensuring that families can be supported in a world that is changing rapidly.  Even allowing for supports and ways of encouraging families to stay together, people make their own decisions at the end of the day and some people will decide to separate.  We cannot determine that decision, whether it be to separate or to reconcile but we can help to alleviate some of the practical difficulties which accompany marriage breakdown.  We can ensure that individual financial entitlements are protected as we have in the Social Welfare (No. 2) Bill; we can ensure to the best of our ability that vulnerable families are protected, as we have in the Family Law Bill.  We can ensure that people are not forced to suffer for the rest of their lives the consequences of a single mistake.</P>
    <P>Today we are paving the way for people to have their say on the right to <Col N="202" /> remarry.  Essentially this is what the referendum is all about.  On 24 November 1995 we will seek to complete a journey which started when the Oireachtas passed the Status of Children Act, 1987, the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act, 1989, and other legislation. Legislation which recognises the reality of marriage breakdown has been introduced. The introduction of the right to remarry will not encourage marriage breakdown but provides a second chance and will introduce an element of stability for the children of second unions who currently are in a legal and social limbo.  Our society is built on the family and this Government is determined that family structures will be protected, maintained and strengthened.</P>
    <P>Due to the absence of divorce in this jurisdiction, we have recently witnessed an increase in the number of family units that are not recognised in the tax and social welfare codes and are simply outside the system.  We have an expanding tier of second-class families. It could be argued that the constitutional ban on divorce militates against another constitutional provision, the injunction on the State to protect the family.  The most vulnerable members of any family are the children and marriage breakdown can harm children.  We all know the effects of parental strife and insecurity.  This has been used &mdash; I think wrongly &mdash; as an argument against divorce.  The absence of divorce has not had an effect on the rate of marriage breakdown.  By the same token there is no evidence that the introduction of divorce will increase the rate of marriage breakdown.  The marriage breakdown rate in the Republic and in Northern Ireland &mdash; probably the most comparable jurisdiction &mdash; is similar in spite of the fact that divorce has been available in Northern Ireland for some time.  In that context it is worth noting that there is an onus on us to ensure that our Constitution is not divisive and is inclusive rather than exclusive.</P>
    <P>When framing the amendment the Government was conscious of the need to avoid the pitfalls into which other <Col N="203" /> jurisdictions had fallen when legislating for divorce, while providing an effective and accessible remedy for those whose marriages had broken down.  We have had the advantage of being able to learn from other people's experiences and we have used it to good effect.  The provision that divorce may be granted to individuals who have been living apart for four out of the previous five years is a sensitive one which recognises the reality.  It will enable people who have tried a short period of reconciliation during the past five years to obtain a divorce.  It also caters for those who for financial and other reasons have been forced to share the same accommodation while living apart in all other respects.  The previous Deputy painted a false picture of what that aspect of the amendment entails.  We are well aware that there are many couples whose marriages have broken down who simply cannot afford to separate.  It does not mean their marriages are still alive but simply means they are occupying separate space under the same roof and have as much right to access to the courts and to divorce if this amendment is passed as those who are more fortunate and have more money with which to make arrangements for an independent life.</P>
    <P>The amendment drafted by the Government represents a compromise, not only between the partners in Government but also between the various strands of society.  In an ideal world Democratic Left would have favoured a simple deletion but we do not live in an ideal world and the amendment before the House is the best possible option. The terms of the amendment will reassure those who are concerned that we could open the door to the regime adopted in other jurisdictions where so called &ldquo;quickie&rdquo; divorces are the norm rather than the exception.  This is the best proposition that we can put and is in tune with the concerns of Irish people.  It reaffirms values and it can only be altered by the people.</P>
    <P>One may ban divorce but one cannot ban marriage breakdown.  It is estimated <Col N="204" /> that up to 75,000 people are living apart from their spouses, many of them having lived apart for a considerable period. The unpalatable reality is that the number of marriages breaking down is increasing at an unprecedented rate yet, as in so many other areas constitutional reform has lagged behind social change. In 1993 there were 15,000 marriages but in the same year there were 3,000 applications for barring orders and 1,000 separation applications.  That means that a minimum of 4,000 marriages had broken down in that year, many of them irrevocably. Of course, the official figures do not include all those people who make their own arrangements privately without recourse to the courts.</P>
    <P>I listened with interest to Deputy Michael Noonan and I can understand what he and other anti-divorce people are saying but I cannot accept it because I believe they are hankering after a past that will not return.  It is understandable to be nostalgic but it ignores modern reality.  While I accept the sincerity of those arguing against divorce I find it hard to accept their lack of faith in marriages when we see all around us evidence of solid happy marriages.  This fearfulness is based on mistrust and a belief that people have to be protected from themselves.  I have more faith in the people, in their maturity, in their good sense and in their regard for the family and their children.  Irish people cannot be equated to Pavlov's dogs who will somehow automatically react to this new right.  The mere presence of divorce legislation will not prompt couples automatically to rush to seek a dissolution any more than the mere presence of abortion information legislation will prompt women to seek a termination of pregnancy without having serious good cause and giving it serious reflection.</P>
    <P>Those harbingers of doom who prophesied Armageddon following the passage of the abortion information Bill and who are engaging in a campaign of misinformation in the run up to the divorce referendum are unable to accept that we can exist in the modern world <Col N="205" /> without losing our values and our common decency.  They appear to view the modern world as a bacillus to which Ireland is peculiarly susceptible.  As an Irishwoman living in that world, I find that notion deeply offensive.  We live in a society that is based on the family; that will be the case in future as well as at present.  However, we also live in a society where most families have some experience of marital breakdown whether it is in their own family or in that of a relative, friend or neighbour.  It has touched most families.  It exists and people know it.  It is a painful issue but the breakdown of a marriage should not mean that the partners must always and forever be denied a second chance.</P>
    <P>The amendment before the House balances the rights of those in failed relationships and those who have entered second unions against the concerns of those who fear the introduction of the lax divorce regime present in some other jurisdictions.  If passed, the amendment will facilitate the introduction of sensitive and compassionate legislation which will recognise modern realities while at the same time protecting families and the rights of family members.</P>
    <P>All parties in this House are on record as favouring the right to remarry. Some parties, however, have displayed more courage than others.  While recognising and respecting the reservations of individual Fianna Fáil Deputies, I welcome Fianna Fáil's commitment to supporting the Government referendum.  It is not easy for an Opposition party to support the Government but, in this case, it is logical and in line with its viewpoint.  It is good for Irish society that we have such consensus.</P>
    <P>All parties in this House favour the right to remarry, and few have been more vociferous in their advocacy of that right than the Progressive Democrats. Only four months ago, Deputy Keogh, when debating the Social Welfare (No. 2) Bill, stated that the Bill was one of the building blocks in an edifice designed to ensure a successful divorce referendum.  She went on to say that she <Col N="206" /> was reluctant to stand in the way of anything that was helpful in that regard.  I regret that she, together with her colleagues, has apparently overcome her reluctance to stand in the way of a successful divorce referendum for the sake of scoring a few political points.  The Progressive Democrats have undoubtedly garnered a few column inches. However, they have also done a disservice to people who are trapped in failed marriages and to those in second unions who wish to regularise their position and that of their families.</P>
    <P>Marital breakdown is not a new phenomenon in Ireland; it goes back over a long time.  Divorce is not a new phenomenon being introduced for the first time.  We are not introducing divorce but reintroducing it.  Under Brehon law marriage and divorce were simple, easy and equally available to both parties.  However, there is a difference in today's debate.  We are more aware of the effects of marital breakdown and more conscious of human relationships, their frailties as well as their strengths.</P>
    <P>There has been a great deal of debate about marital breakdown and the impression is given that somehow it has emerged in the last 20 years.  There have always been unhappy marriages.  Certainly, there are more now and people are separating to a greater extent than they did in the past.  However, that is not to say that at some point in the past there was a period when marriages were all happy, when all children were cared for and when women were never abused or battered.  It is part of human nature. We must ensure that the constitutional amendment is a way of resolving the difficulties that people must endure when they move into a new relationship and are unable to have it legally underpinned in the same way as the rest of us who are fortunate enough to be happily married.</P>
    <P>I hope this referendum will be passed. There is a general willingness among the public to view it in a good light and not to see it constantly in terms of darkness, distrust and despair.  Irish people do not <Col N="207" /> feel that way about themselves any longer.  We are beginning to trust ourselves and to trust our own judgment when it comes to confronting difficult problems wherever they arise.  The abortion information debate and the legislation on homosexuality showed that people could accept change.  Many of the people who argue against divorce do not trust the people as they should. They are constantly fearful that somehow the foundations of the State will disappear.  The evidence for that does not exist.  They are misleading, obfuscating and confusing people on the basis of a misconception.</P>
    <P>The referendum will be passed because the Irish electorate is mature enough to see through the scare-mongering of the anti-divorce lobby and the protestations of those who face both ways on the issue.  The Irish people know good sense when they see it.  This amendment is about good sense.  People know that marriage breakdown is a reality in Irish society.  They also know that there is life after marriage breakdown. As legislators we have a duty to legislate for the world as we find it &mdash; not as we might wish it to be.  That is what we are doing today.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>The 1986 referendum campaign left a bad taste.  It left in its wake an all-pervasive sense that justice had not been done.  It certainly was not seen to be done by a great many people and I am not simply referring to the people who were advocating divorce. This arose from an impression that the issues had not been properly addressed or, at least, that the proper issues had not been addressed.  There was an impression that there had been an undue emphasis on side issues that did not go to the root of the case for or against divorce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was more than a little justification for that impression.  The Government campaign in 1986 was &mdash; to put it charitably &mdash; incoherent.  There was no preparatory work carried out.  The absence of the necessary preparatory <Col N="208" /> legislation and the anaemic campaign that resulted gave people the opportunity to divert the debate into side shows and concentrate on issues which were marginal to the question of whether divorce should be introduced. That led to a real sense of injustice and to a situation where many people &mdash; I am not just referring to people in the pro divorce lobby &mdash; simply did not accept the outcome of the campaign.</P>
    <P>Much has happened since 1986.  We are older and, hopefully, wiser.  A mosaic of legislation has been put in place to meet many of the concerns that were raised in the 1986 campaign.  I do not doubt that the then Government would have put these measures in place subsequently if the divorce referendum had been passed.  Obviously it was not going to let the problems which were going to arise continue.  Nevertheless, the preparatory work should have been done in advance of the issue being put to the people.  The fact that it had not been done allowed the campaign to be sidetracked to a great extent.</P>
    <P>There should, at least in theory, be no confusion on this occasion.  However, amazingly and unfortunately, the Government campaign to date has again raised the spectre of a rerun of the acrimony, divisiveness and confusion which blighted the 1986 debate and caused a large number of people to refuse to accept its outcome.</P>
    <P>I listened carefully to Government spokespersons and to the Minister for State, Deputy McManus.  The more I listen to Government spokespersons the more I cannot believe what I am hearing.</P>
    <P>All I am hearing is a mantra-like repetition of the phrase &ldquo;remarriage is the only issue&rdquo;.  They have said it so often at this stage that they cannot say it in a way that shows they actually believe it. It is being repeated with all the spontaneity and enthusiasm of a &ldquo;speak your weight&rdquo; machine.  Of course, that proposition is demonstrably false.</P>
    <P>If we are to get this campaign off the ground properly, the Government will have to concede that the anti-divorce <Col N="209" /> lobby has a strong and cogent case.  Failure by the Government to even acknowledge, let alone address the strength of the case against divorce will undoubtedly, and unfortunately, encourage some people to vote &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  It cannot be gainsaid that marital breakdown brings misery and hardship in its train.  It almost invariably, and certainly usually, has a deleterious effect on children. It causes loss of social cohesion.  It has adverse financial consequences both for the families involved and for the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>Divorce changes attitudes to marriage. It changes the perception of marriage as a lifelong contract.  Because of this, it will probably lead to an increase in the incidence of marital breakdown and, consequently, to an increase in all the attendant misery, hardship and suffering which that entails.  At present marriage, in law, is a lifelong contract from which there is no escape.  The introduction of an escape clause will inevitably weaken that contract.  It is true to say, as the Minister of State has said, that marriage breakdown is a reality already and, unfortunately, it is growing.  It is going to continue to grow because of change in social attitudes. The issue which the Government must confront is whether the introduction of divorce will substantially increase the incidence of marital breakdown.  My view is that it will not but there are those who honestly disagree and they are entitled to their viewpoint.  It is quite impossible, even though I have a view on the matter, to predict the extent to which divorce will increase the incidence of marital breakdown with any degree of certainty or anything approaching certainty.  The Government will have to confront the reality that these reservations and the arguments that underpin them have real force.</P>
    <P>However, honesty is not a one way street.  The anti-divorce campaign, for its part, will have to accept that the problems arising from marital breakdown have nothing whatever to do with divorce.  They arise, as is quite evident, from the fact of marital breakdown.  If <Col N="210" /> these problems could be avoided by the absence of divorce, we would not have them.  To date we have no divorce here, yet marital breakdown, and all its attendant consequences, have long been a reality of Irish life and the problem is growing, even in the absence of divorce.</P>
    <P>Within five years of the introduction of the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act, 1989, annual applications for judicial separation have doubled.  In the 1992 census, 55,143 people described themselves as separated &mdash; an increase of almost 50 per cent on the 1986 figure.  Between 1981 and 1991, the number of births outside marriage more than doubled and now account for more than one sixth of all births here.  The estimate by the Combat Poverty Agency that 10 per cent of all families in Ireland are headed by a lone parent places us just below the average in the European Union, where the corresponding figure is 11 per cent.  There is also the fact that the incidence of marriage is in decline.  That demonstrates, if further proof were needed, that people are less ready now than heretofore to commit themselves to a lifelong union from which there is no legal escape clause.  All this has happened in the absence of divorce.</P>
    <P>The anti-divorce lobby will also have to accept that there are tens of thousands of previously married people in second relationships who demand &mdash; indeed crave &mdash; a legitimisation of their new union.  Those people genuinely feel that they have a civil right to have their second union legitimised.  There are also people whose marriages have failed and who have no intention of getting remarried but who want to be in a position to sever any legal relationship with the previous partner.  Not only do they not want to have any social or physical contact with the previous partner, but they do not want to have any legal contact either.  They feel that is their civil right and who can deny that?  The anti-divorce lobby will also have to admit that to concede to the demands of these people represents the sympathetic approach.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="211" /> Marital breakdown, as anybody like myself who regularly encounters its victims will know, is generally an unpleasant affair.  I have encountered victims of marital breakdown who feel they are in a long dark corridor from which there is no escape &mdash; there is no light at the end of the tunnel.  If those people are lucky enough to meet somebody else and find love, trust and happiness in a second relationship, why should they be forced to pay a price for this?  Why should they be forced to pay the price for finding happiness by being forced to effectively live outside the law?  The anti-divorce lobby will have to deal with that in their campaign if they are to engage in honest debate on the real issues before the people in this referendum.</P>
    <P>The anti-divorce lobby will also have to accept that they are making impossible demands on the civil law in a modern democracy.  In a dictatorship, the civil law can, though to a decreasing extent, dictate reality.  In a democracy, the most civil law can do is reflect reality, but governments in a democracy have an obligation to ensure that the civil law does reflect reality.  Anybody who looks at the procedure in this House will find that on the Order of Business we are engaged in asking the Government when particular legislation will appear.  The main Government activity in the House consists of putting legislation through the House.  The reason is that we have to constantly change and update the civil law to reflect social change and reality.  That is what we are generally about.</P>
    <P>The law must keep abreast of reality and changes in society.  The more the law fails to do this, the more injustice that will result and the more respect for and compliance with the law diminish. It is a fundamental principle of good civil law that it reflect reality in so far as possible.  How close it is to reality on the ground is regarded by all commentators as the badge of good law and, of a good legal system, how quick it <Col N="212" /> changes to keep pace with social change and reality.</P>
    <P>The function of civil law is to reflect reality and to keep abreast of social change.  It is not the function of civil law to maintain an old social order in the face of a torrent of change.  It is not entirely inconceivable that society may change back at some time in the future. We may see a fundamental reversal of what is happening now.  Monogamy may again become the order of the day and the day might arrive when marital breakdown will virtually be a thing of the past.  Can anybody in the anti-divorce lobby argue that if that situation comes about the laws should not be changed accordingly to reflect that if divorce goes through on this occasion?</P>
    <P>The issue before the people in this referendum is whether the case for a sympathetic approach and good law which reflects reality should outweigh the negative consequences &mdash; and there will be negative consequences &mdash; which arrive from whatever increase in marital breakdown which result from the introduction of divorce.  That may depend on how substantially one thinks the introduction of divorce will increase the incidence of marital breakdown.  On balance, it is my view that the case for the sympathetic approach and good law outweighs the consequences arising from an increase in marital breakdown which, in any event, will be marginal.</P>
    <P>I stated earlier that I could not believe what I was hearing from various Government spokespersons.  It is also true to say that I cannot believe what I am not hearing, which is a straight answer to the question of how much is going to be spent by the Government on funding the divorce campaign and how, precisely, it is going to be spent.</P>
    <P>Initially the Government announced that the £500,000 would be spent on actively promoting the &ldquo;yes&rdquo; case.  We were then told it would be spent on educating the people on the consequences and implications of divorce.  We were told later there would be an information leaflet in which both sides of the case would be stated and that the balance of <Col N="213" /> the funding would be used to finance an information campaign which would advocate a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote.  The Minister and the Government repeatedly told us on national television that the figure was not £500,000 but £250,000.  I urge the Minister, when he concludes this debate, to come clean on this issue.</P>
    <P>The Government is rightly sponsoring the campaign but the idea of it providing education on the issue is dishonest and is a charade.  The people will decide the issue; the Constitution gives them the right to do so.  In effect, the Government, which is on one side of the debate, is taking money from the people who will decide the issue in order to educate them about the implications of what they are doing.  If it is true that this objective information can be provided by the Government, which is a protagonist on one side, it is equally true that we could provide it differently and give the £500,000 to people who are anti-divorce, who are protagonists on the other side, to provide information.  I know what the reaction of the Minister would be if I suggested this but it is the ultimate logic of his position.  If protagonists on one side can be in charge of the information campaign, it is equally true and logical that protagonists on the other side can also run that campaign.</P>
    <P>People are suspicious because of the furtive and shabby approach so far by the Government to the issue of funding. It should come clean on this issue.  It has raised suspicions in people's minds and this will help divert the debate, as happened in 1996.  The information campaign is a side issue.</P>
    <P>Deputy Woods suggested a formula for future referendum campaigns but he pointed out that it is not too late to do something approximating to his suggestion for this campaign.  The Government could do worse than use the model employed by the Government of Finland for its campaign during the Maastricht referendum.</P>
    <P>The Government has not announced what it will do about the unacceptable situation of family courts.  It has a Law Reform Commission report available to <Col N="214" /> it which clearly sets out what needs to be done to reduce the present chaos which has resulted from the extraordinary increase in business in family courts.  The Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act, 1989 was introduced without any corresponding provisions on judicial or other resources to meet the increase in business which arose therefrom.  Whether or not the people vote &ldquo;yes&rdquo;, I have no doubt that the family law business arising from marital breakdown will increase.  I also have no doubt that if divorce is introduced it will increase further than it otherwise would, although I think this increase will be marginal.</P>
    <P>At the last sitting of the south-western family court, Mr. Justice Kevin O'Higgins was presented with approximately 59 family law cases to deal with on a single day.  The corresponding figure in Trim, County Meath, was in the order of 78 and in Dundalk it was 88.</P>
    <P>People who have been before family courts come to me to complain and I am sure they also go to other public representatives. They have a great sense of grievance and feel they did not get their day in court.  They feel they were not listened to and that the issues in their cases were not properly debated and adjudicated on because the cases were too rushed.  If in this chaotic situation more business is created without any corresponding increase in judicial and other back up resources, it will be reduced to a Kafkaesque nightmare.</P>
    <P>If these matters are dealt with and people on the pro-divorce and anti-divorce sides deal honestly with the real issues of the campaign, regardless of the outcome and of how little or large the margin of victory is, we will minimise the prospect of residual bitterness and refusal to accept the result, as was the case in 1986 in spite of the disappointment of those on the losing side.  This would be healthy in a democracy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DeclanBree" hpid="Mr. Bree Mr. Bree">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bree</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the debate on this amendment to the Constitution. When the Labour Party entered Government with Fianna Fáil, we <Col N="215" /> ensured that the Programme for a Partnership Government included proposals for a major programme of family law reform which would culminate in a referendum on divorce.  Along with appointing a Minister for Equality and Law Reform, we also said we would pursue a broad programme of institutional, administrative and legislative reform aimed at enhancing the rights of women.</P>
      <P>With the formation of the Government of Renewal, that overall philosophy was maintained and in its programme the new Government promised that a referendum to remove the constitutional ban on divorce and allow for remarriage on the basis of irretrievable breakdown would be held in 1995.  The programme said the parties in the Government would recommend a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote in the referendum and it further stated that in advance of the referendum a comprehensive paper would be published indicating the text of the amendment proposed by the Government and addressing issues such as the protection of children, taxation, social welfare, inheritance laws and pension entitlements.</P>
      <P>At the same time we said we would complete the steps necessary to ensure that all dependent spouses and children would be fully protected, that the family mediation service would be strengthened and expanded and that the family courts would be strengthened.  This overall programme relating to the protection of the family and the proposed divorce referendum has all party support because all parties recognise that marriage breakdown has become an unfortunate reality of Irish life and that the rights of children and dependent spouses need to be taken care of.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government and every party represented in this Parliament recognise the family as a fundamental part of society and we are committed to legislation designed to help families.  We also recognise that despite everyone's best efforts, relationships can and do break down and that the absence of divorce <Col N="216" /> has not prevented marriage breakdown in Ireland.  Over 70,000 people are in marriages which have broken down and many would like the opportunity to remarry.  However, the unfortunate reality is that our Constitution and laws as they now stand fail to give legal recognition to the position of irretrievable breakdown experienced by large numbers of spouses.  We have legal remedies equivalent to divorce in every respect except one, which is the right to remarry.</P>
    <P>Article 41.3.2 of the Constitution states that &ldquo;No law shall be enacted providing for the grant of a dissolution of marriage.&rdquo;  In essence this constitutes an actual threat to family life by forbidding the possibility of divorce and remarriage.</P>
    <P>Considering the existence of widespread evidence of marriage breakdown and the suffering of those who endure it without any means of re-establishing themselves in society, it is time the Government set a date for a referendum to give the right to remarry to couples whose previous marriages have irretrievably broken down.</P>
    <P>Today, the Government recognises the family as a fundamental part of society and is committed to legislation designed to help families.  It has set up a commission on the family to advise on family issues in the context of a changing economic and social environment. However, notwithstanding increased Government supports, marriage breakdown is still with us and is increasing.</P>
    <P>Those in favour of divorce base their case on a number of factors: the existence of marriage breakdown in all social classes and in all parts of the country; the need to remove the sense of isolation and insecurity felt by those whose marriages have failed; the importance of ensuring the dignity and freedom of the person whose marriage has failed by giving him or her the choice of remarrying; the desirability of giving full recognition to the growing number of relationships already entered into by persons whose first marriages have failed; the need to correct the injustice <Col N="217" /> and double standards of our laws which permit church annulments while not recognising remarriage; and, of course, the importance of having family laws which correctly reflect social realities so that they can command the respect of all the people.</P>
    <P>In recent times the anti-divorce lobby has argued that the removal of the constitutional ban on divorce would seriously damage children.  This is nonsense. There is no evidence that children of divorced parents do any better or worse than children of parents who are separated.  Research has shown that marriage breakdown can damage some children and in that context it would be more honest to say that it is the marriage breakdown, and not any subsequent divorce, which might damage children.</P>
    <P>Marriage breakdown does not happen in the courtroom, it happens in the home and in the heart.  The availability of divorce does not cause this type of breakdown.  Obviously, the breakdown is always devastating for those concerned. When a broken marriage cannot be repaired many would see divorce as the beginning of a healing process, a legal statement whereby people can go on with their lives in a forthright and mature manner.</P>
    <P>There is strong evidence that marriage breakdown can be made less stressful for children if it is handled in an open and responsible way and if it involves sensible arrangements about custody and access.  In an effort to address this issue and protect children affected by marriage breakdown, substantially increased funding has been provided for counselling and mediation services.  Our overall objective is to try to help parents resolve their differences or, if they cannot do that, to help them manage their conflict in a way which least damages their children.</P>
    <P>I would have preferred to see a simple amendment to the Constitution which would delete the ban on divorce and permit the Oireachtas to grant the dissolution of marriage subject to such conditions as might be prescribed by <Col N="218" /> law.  However, I am aware of the tactics of many of the extreme right wing activists in the anti-divorce lobby who would manipulate and twist the facts to suggest that the Government wished to introduce a quickie divorce culture.  I am also aware of concerns expressed by conservative Fianna Fáil members who would not be prepared to support a more liberal approach to the issue.</P>
    <P>In this context I can understand the proposal from the Government.  Central to the Government's position on divorce is the need to protect the family and the institution of marriage while at the same time providing remedies for the increasing numbers of cases of irretrievable breakdown.</P>
    <P>In many other countries divorce is available after only short waiting periods, but the proposal before us involves a substantial separation period.  The spouses must have lived apart for a period or periods amounting to four years out of the previous five years before making a divorce application.  This can hardly be called the introduction of a divorce culture.  It must be remembered that there can be no change in such conditions unless or until the people decide to make a change in another referendum.</P>
    <P>In the last ten years successive Governments have introduced many changes to family law.  Throughout that time it has been clear that the process of reform in family law could not be completed without addressing the issue of remarriage.  The one issue that remains after all the legislative and administrative changes of the last ten years is whether a right to remarry should exist for those whose marriages have irretrievably broken down.  I am convinced, as are the great majority of people on this island, that to continue to deny such a right would represent a grave injustice to thousands of individuals.</P>
    <P>In everything it has done in the course of its preparations for the referendum, the Government has sought to take into account its duty to the institution of marriage, the family and <Col N="219" /> particularly the rights of children.  To the best of its ability, the Government has balanced the needs of a society in which the family has always been central, with the needs of many thousands of people trapped in the pain of failed marriages.</P>
    <P>Despite widespread support for the right to divorce and remarry in consecutive opinion polls, we can ill afford to take things for granted.  I well remember the last divorce campaign and I am aware of the extreme right wing activists who have attempted to dictate Ireland's social agenda over the years and attempted to undermine the democratic consensus on every proposal for progress and change.  They use the politics of fear as one of their major weapons.</P>
    <P>During their last campaign against divorce they suggested that people in working class areas would lose their social benefits and people in middle class areas would lose their pension rights.  They suggested that farmers would lose their holdings and that a divorced woman would be like a secondhand car.  The unfortunate reality is that due to Government inactivity at that time their scare tactics worked.  In recent years these same elements have been organising to defeat this new proposal to introduce the right to divorce and to remarry.</P>
    <P>Like the Orange Order in the North, we have our own equivalent here in the South &mdash; the Knights of Columbanus, a patriarchal, sectarian, secretive and fundamentalist network of influential men who have exerted power and influence in all sectors of society.  While some people might be under the impression that the Knights of Columbanus is a type of charitable organisation, this is not the case.  The reality is that in the North the Orange Order wants a Protestant state for a Protestant people, and in the South the Knights of Columbanus want a Catholic state for a Catholic people.  In the North the Orange Order has represented the most backward and reactionary elements in society and, likewise, the Knights of Columbanus <Col N="220" /> represent the most reactionary and conservative elements in southern society.</P>
    <P>Having entered active politics at the age of 16, I can recollect the activities of the knights and other fundamentalists over the years.  For decades they ensured that people were denied the basic right to plan a family.  They fought tooth and nail to maintain the ban on contraception without any consideration of the consequences for women's health and life expectancy.  They were the people, also, who remained silent regarding the lack of family home protection legislation which might protect women and families.</P>
    <P>When Mary Robinson and other progressive politicians attempted to bring about change in relation to the availability of contraceptives and family planning in the early 1970s, the same fundamentalists including the Knights of Columbanus vociferously opposed them.  At that time, the late Archbishop of Dublin, John Charles McQuaid, denounced artificial methods of contraception stating that any successful attempt to legalise them would gravely damage private and public morality.  He said it would remain a curse upon our country.</P>
    <P>Decade after decade, year after year, the Knights of Columbanus have manipulated the activities of the fundamentalist movement and the right wing extremists in their ongoing campaign to dictate Ireland's social agenda on matters such as family planning, sex education, women's health, the protection of the family or the right to remarry.  Fortunately, the fundamentalists and the Knights of Columbanus are now being resisted more than ever before.  Despite the fact that they wish to remain in the background where they can manipulate and influence the agenda in a subtle and simple manner, events in recent years have exposed them and people are now becoming aware of the negative and reactionary role they have played in the recent history of our country.  If these fundamentalists had their way, there would be no <Col N="221" /> access to birth control in Ireland, doctors would not be allowed to prescribe the pill and retail outlets would not be allowed to sell contraceptives. Consequently, the number of people going to England for abortions would increase, women's health clinics would be closed down because of their family planning services, books would be banned, rape crisis centres would be closed, sex education in schools would be unheard of and women would be treated as second class citizens.</P>
    <P>I am proud that politicians are now facing down the extremists and fundamentalists on many fronts.  We must do so if our democracy is to survive and develop.  We must say to these people that if they want to dictate policy from now on, they must place their names on the ballot paper and face the electorate. They must not be allowed to manipulate events through secret meetings in Dublin 4.</P>
    <P>The nature of family life in Ireland has changed dramatically over the past 30 years.  The immense social, cultural and economic changes which have occurred since the 1960s have altered family structures.  Family life is similar to that of our European partners, including a falling marriage rate, an increase in the number of children born outside traditional structures and an increase in the incidence of marital breakdown.  Many people wish to ignore these changes and bury their heads in the sand.  However, any society which is concerned about the well-being of its children and its family structures has a duty to respond to these changes, which necessitate ongoing reform of our legal system and social life.</P>
    <P>The only mature response to marital breakdown in Ireland is to allow divorce so that separated people have a chance to begin again.  Divorce is a civil right and it is incredible that people in a modern society are forced to remain tied to a marriage that has long ceased to exist as a loving and supporting relationship. Divorce provides people with the opportunity to restart their lives and <Col N="222" /> bestows on them their full rights as individuals. We already have judicial separation and the only difference between judicial separation and divorce is the right to remarry.</P>
    <P>There is no lack of compassion and humanity in the people.  When the public has an opportunity of considering all the implications of this constitutional amendment, it will throw its weight behind it.  A sizeable number of people in Ireland are against divorce because the Catholic Church is against it. However, Ireland is a changing society and more people are recognising that other citizens either belong to different religions or to no religion at all. Allowing everyone the right to divorce and remarry, if they so wish, would be a step towards the republic of Connolly and Pearse, a pluralist republic which will unite Catholic, Protestant and Dissenter.</P>
    <P>Many marriages in Ireland are already over.  It is hypocritical to pretend that marital breakdown does not exist here.  A &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote will help to create a progressive society which is more honest, tolerant and open and in which respect is given to different and diverse forms of family relationships.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have a problem with giving the public the opportunity to express its views on whether the ban on divorce should remain.  This is a democratic process and we all agree that a referendum represents the ultimate in democracy.</P>
      <P>I expressed my views on this issue during the debate on the Referendum Act, 1994.  I could quote from that because my views do not cause me any embarrassment 18 months later.  I expressed the view that Governments should facilitate referenda without controlling them.  They should provide information fairly and give people the opportunity to put forward their points of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support this referendum because opinion polls show that a sizeable number of people want the opportunity to express their views.  We should have a <Col N="223" /> referendum on issues such as bail laws or abortion if opinion polls show that a substantial number of people, for example, 35 per cent, want it.  However, we must have a fair referendum and both sides in the campaign must be properly funded.  It is an unequal battle if £500,000 is made available to the pro-divorce side and only a legal leaflet is made available to the anti-divorce people.  This last gesture was only agreed to by the Government when it was reminded of the statements made before it came to Government by the Taoiseach, Deputy John Bruton, and the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte.</P>
    <P>There is a case to be made for public moneys to be spent on both sides of the argument in this referendum and in other national debates on major constitutional change.  Some agreement must be reached in the long term on the procedures for fair referenda and legislation should be introduced to control this area.  The purpose of a referendum is to refer a matter to the people for their decision.  For this purpose, the people should be given as much factual information as possible.</P>
    <P>The Government's decision to give the advertising contract for the campaign to Quinn McDonnell Pattison Ltd. is a disgrace.  We know that Mr. Conor Quinn, brother of the Minister for Finance, is a senior partner in this firm.  I know nothing about the firm, but I am sure it is a professional and competent agency.  However, if a Fianna Fáil Government gave a contract to the brother of a Cabinet Minister, there would be uproar in the media.  However, this issue seems to have passed by with only a whimper.  The media should examine why they seem to adopt different standards for different parties.  Perhaps they feel the Labour Party is just being consistent in doing what it has done since 1992, that is, giving every possible job to their families or friends.</P>
    <P>The argument for divorce is based on sad cases and relies on our Christianity and generosity for a fair hearing.  We have heard of many sad cases where the <Col N="224" /> understanding thing to do would be to allow divorce.  However, many of these hard cases have been solved by the legislation introduced over the past ten years.  Should we legislate for the individual sad case or for the common good of society?  If divorce is introduced, are we helping some while, at the same time, destabilising and demeaning the 96 per cent of stable marriages?  We are told it is a civil right to allow people to remarry.  However, there are many civil rights and liberties which must be set aside or curbed for the common good. The cult of individualism has gone too far.  Does it mean that the maximisation of individual rights or liberties is equal to the maximisation of the common good?  I find it extraordinary that many commentators argue for the rights of the individual when discussing divorce and other social issues.  When the same people are talking about economic issues, they speak very much against individualism.  Experience of economic issues over the last 15 to 20 years has shown that individualism leads to greed and that which was fostered and promoted by Thatcherism.  It is extraordinary that the people who find themselves on one side of the argument on social issues are on the other side when it comes to economics and issues of greed.</P>
    <P>There are different groups on both sides of the referendum campaign.  I hope that over the coming weeks there will be an open debate in which all the individuals and groups concerned will participate.  I hope we will find some genuine liberalism and that people will be tolerant enough to listen to opposing views.  To date I have found it extraordinary that some Government Ministers &mdash; specifically Deputy Michael D. Higgins and Deputy Burton &mdash; feel obliged to speak out loud and clear every time a Catholic bishop speaks his mind.  Labour Party Ministers and Deputies will have to shed their arrogance and intolerance and control their own utterances and those of loose cannons such as Niall Stokes.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="225" /> I hope that the church will take a full part in the debate in the coming weeks and that it does not allow itself to be frightened away from presenting its moral teaching.  The church has a right and a duty to present its point of view, as has any other group in society.  I hope they will make a timely and meaningful contribution to the debate and that they do not, as they did on previous occasions, make lofty theological statements in the last hours before polling day.  If one wants to have an influence, there is no point in waiting until the race is nearly over.</P>
    <P>The church has been almost browbeaten for 20 years by knockers and agnostics in the media, some of whom hardly know what the inside of a church looks like.  If it were not for Archbishop Connell and a few of his colleagues, we would hardly know the Catholic teaching on many issues nowadays.  The church has allowed itself to be browbeaten and has withdrawn.  It is almost over concerned about offending parishioners by forcefully pressing their point of view as they and any other group has a right to do.</P>
    <P>As legislators it is not our responsibility to uphold the church's view on morality.  However, this is a mainly Christian and indeed Catholic country. It is right and proper that we bear this in mind when passing legislation which should conform with, or evolve from, the norms and ethos of our society. With all the demands for secularism and pluralism, one wonders when there will be a demand to have the rest day on Tuesday or Wednesday rather than Sunday lest it be identified with some church groups.</P>
    <P>The campaign against some church figures in recent days has been an absolute disgrace and journalism should hang its head in shame.  I realise that following the closure of the <i>Irish Press</i>, there is much competition in journalism but it must be one of the few professions where competition leads to a drop rather than an improvement in standards. I believe that this campaign is orchestrated and designed specifically <Col N="226" /> with this referendum in mind and constitutes an effort to undermine and weaken the church's influence.  I find it difficult to believe this has happened at this time by accident.</P>
    <P>I have to be honest and say that I voted against the introduction of divorce in 1986.  I am not an ultra conservative; neither would I be in the natural constituency of those who are constantly pushing for social change. However, I have heard nothing in this debate so far which would encourage me to vote in favour of divorce.  If anything, as days go by, I find myself slipping further into the anti-divorce lobby. However there are many weeks left so the Minister should get working on me and others in society.</P>
    <P>I am aware that almost 4,000 couples have been separated under the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act, 1989.  However, I would like to see some further analysis of the numbers detailed in the last census.  I would like to know specifically how many of them are on social welfare or paying differential rents to local authorities.  We all know that there are many people in those categories who pretend to be separated for financial reasons.  Because the State, in its wisdom, has been very favourable, it often pays people to move out of a private house and rent cheaply from a corporation or county council.</P>
    <P>We are told that divorce exists in Ireland in everything but name &mdash; I think that was the Minister's own statement. Why then do we need it?  This question has not been answered satisfactorily. Previously, there was an argument that divorce was necessary because of the legal limbo in which many people found themselves. However, we are told that over the last ten years legislation has dealt with most of those problems and that all we need now is the right to remarry.  Must we have divorce so people in second relationships can refer to their partner as husband or wife?  If there are more telling reasons, they should be spelt out and explained.  This certainly has not <Col N="227" /> happened to date.  The Minister mentioned dignity and status and talked about giving people a sense of worth. Are we just talking about status and dignity at this stage?  If there is more to it than that, the Minister should have it spelt out loud and clear for his own benefit.</P>
    <P>I fully realise that every marriage is not made in heaven.  We all understand that some marriages will, unfortunately, break down.  This has long been recognised by church authorities which have adopted a much more caring and compassionate approach to such marriages than the State through the granting of annulments.  They may have created a legal limbo but they represented a genuine attempt to recognise difficulties in some marriages.  One must give credit to the church for trying to be more flexible and caring than the State in some cases.</P>
    <P>Marriage is a commitment to a life long relationship.  Many feel that the introduction of divorce will undermine every marriage in the State and inevitably have disastrous social consequences, as has happened abroad.  We must ask what effect divorce would have on other marriages.  Would it have a widespread destabilising effect on marriages which would otherwise remain intact?  I firmly believe that divorce damages society and has a traumatic effect on children.  I am aware of the marriage breakdown situation but the question is whether divorce will improve matters or make them worse. We may help solve the problems of the 3.5 per cent of marriages which, sadly, have broken down but will we put the other 96 per cent of marriages at risk?</P>
    <P>Internationally, there seems to be a realisation that easy divorce is not a solution. Why must we go through the same trauma to learn the same lessons which can be observed abroad?  Oddly enough, the liberal consensus on divorce seems to be weakening.  People are starting to accept arguments about its psychological effects on children, the poverty culture and so on.  Indeed, this <Col N="228" /> attitude seems to have reached our own Cabinet Ministers.  The Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa, recently said that Ireland must accept divorce because, with international opposition hardening, it is a case of now or never.  Deputy De Rossa, like many liberals pushing for divorce, seems to be locked in his own time warp in the 1970s and is still trying to achieve a radical agenda from that time, although international experience would suggest that things have moved on.  Are we trying to give people what is good for them or that towards which we or members of the Cabinet are ideologically driven?</P>
    <P>The Minister has said the ability to remarry is the essential difference between divorce and judicial separation. If this is all we are trying to achieve, we must ask why bother?  We are told that the legal framework is now in place to manage the breakdown of marriage and organise civil separation.  Why must we go further and put the 96 per cent of sound marriages at risk in order to give a tag of respectability to a relatively small number of second relationships?</P>
    <P>Bringing in divorce abolishes marriage as we know it.  Marriage up until now was lifelong, based on a permanent commitment.  If divorce is introduced, every marriage in the State is made temporary in the eyes of the law.  Introducing divorce may, at first, seem to affect just a few separated people who want to remarry but it may soon spread and undermine many stable marriages to the extent that it abolishes lifelong marriage and the family which is based on it.  With all the legislation introduced over the last ten years, is there anything now denied to a couple in a second relationship other than the official legal recognition of a married union?  Can some form of notification or registration of the second relationship not be introduced which would give the status being sought without undermining all existing sound marriages?</P>
    <P>I object to the use of the phrase the &ldquo;right to remarry&rdquo; in the Title of the Bill.  This is a blatant attempt to disguise the real purpose of the Bill.  It is about <Col N="229" /> divorce.  It is about the ending of a marriage and we may as well be honest and straight and call it what it is.  In fact, one could say that we already have the right to remarry in certain cases if a spouse dies.  The Bill is about divorce and not the right to remarry.</P>
    <P>It is also extraordinary that we are moving so quickly to no fault divorce. Internationally, most countries started with a fault type of divorce and only after many years moved on to what we are currently recommending.</P>
    <P>I have grave doubts about the introduction of divorce.  In summary, my reservations are based on the effect on children and the damage it will do to society and the common good.  I hope the public will study all sides of the argument deeply in the coming weeks.  I hope there will be a high turnout on 24 November and that the people make a clear choice as to the future direction they wish society to take.</P>
    <P>This is a referendum.  It is the ultimate in democracy.  The people have the final say.  We have a duty to put the case to them fairly so that they can make an informed and reasoned decision.  There may well be an argument that some people deserve to be given a second chance.  However, there is no argument whatsoever that they should be given a third, fourth or fifth chance and that seems to be built into what we are putting to the people.</P>
    <P>We cannot continue having a referendum on the divorce issue every nine years.  Before the referendum, the Minister should lay down future policy on this matter.  The Government should give an undertaking that, say in 15 or 20 years time, there will be a referendum if a substantial number of people request it.  It should not be a case of having referendums to change the Constitution and allow divorce and continuing to push that door until it is finally opened. An undertaking should be given that in ten or 15 years time, irrespective of the result this time, if opinion polls show the people would like to vote again, they will be given that opportunity.</P>
    <P>Since the Chair has allowed me to <Col N="230" /> continue, I want to address the part of my speech which I skipped.  One interpretation of the wording of the referendum that persons could get divorced if they were living apart for four of the last five years is that it means &ldquo;quickie&rdquo; divorce for somebody within the first year of marriage on the grounds that they were not living together before marriage.  I know that is not what is intended but people are nervous after the previous referenda dating back to 1983 when, some years later, the courts ruled that people who had voted one way had really voted the other.</P>
    <P>I also have great concern about how one proves people are separated.  Are they separated or are they living under the one roof?  It would not be right for people, by agreement or otherwise, to say that they have been separated for the last four years.  I would like to think that this is the sort of issue we can take up on Committee Stage.  There would have to be some system of notification of separation whereby, within the first year or so of separation, one would have to record that fact.</P>
    <P>If there must be divorce, I totally agree with the philosophy that putting this into the Constitution is the most likely way to bring many fair minded people on board because people have found in the past that they could not trust their politicians.  I want to see a little hardening on that issue.  A couple could not say they were living apart or that the husband has been living in the box-room for the last four years and that they should be allowed divorce.  If the four years provision is to mean anything, it must be tied down a little better.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="231" /> I welcome the opportunity to speak on this legislation preparing for the referendum. Immediately, let me discount any suggestion that there was some elaborate conspiracy recently hatched to dislodge any particular interest or that that is what is at stake.  I was a Member of Seanad Éireann in the period 1973-77.  I recall being one of the cosponsors of the second attempt to allow family planning legislation to be introduced into this country.  It is one of the most welcome changes in Ireland that we do not have the atmosphere now which prevailed then.  It was an offensive atmosphere, one which was not marked by the tolerance of which the last Deputy spoke.</P>
    <P>I also recall early attempts to abolish the status of illegitimacy being referred to by otherwise well meaning people as &ldquo;socialism under the sheets&rdquo;.  People did not really care that children could go through life stigmatised and separated from other children.  People did not seem to imagine that women could be unable to exercise control over the decision to have children.  People did not seem to care about the conditions which prevailed in relation to adoption.</P>
    <P>It was my lot to speak of these matters in the seventies and again in the nineties.  For much of that period I was, in another part of my life, a sociologist and I worked in the social sciences.  I often think back and ask myself one question: was that a golden age, the seventies, a period that was full of these intolerances to women, families, children and people who had adopted children? What was superior about it?  On reflection I think it was a society comprehensively characterised by fear and an abuse of authority, an authority which was later to be more comprehensively abused.  What I learned from those discussions of the seventies and the debates we had in the eighties and nineties is that we have dragged ourselves to the point where now we may be able to discuss matters upon which there are legitimate and genuine differences in a more civilised way.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="232" /> The referendum will be about more than the right to remarry and it is important for us to be forthright about this.  For some people it will be about the right to put an end to a marriage which has not worked and has caused grief and hurt the continuance of which would do irreparable damage in comparison to the consequence of its being formally ended.  It is about the right to remarry and to rightfully end that which has irretrievably broken down.</P>
    <P>It would be silly for me or anyone else to suggest that life will be the exact same after a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote in the referendum since the legal position will have changed.  As I listened to the previous speaker I asked myself about the 96 per cent of marriages which are supposed to be threatened by a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote in the referendum. What wonderful effect did the &ldquo;no&rdquo; vote in the last referendum have on marriages?  Did people write to the papers, telephone radio programmes and go on television to say their lives and marriages were a thousand times better because the electorate voted &ldquo;no&rdquo;?  When the votes were being counted in the last referendum people told me they did not think they could go through it again.  What they meant was that they had hoped for a change but it had not happened.  As they left the polling stations they thought they would not have another chance.  There are no winners or losers on occasions like this.</P>
    <P>Deputy Noel Ahern referred to my comments on a radio programme in reply to statements made by the Archbishop of Dublin, Dr. O'Connell.  I was replying to a statement in which it was suggested that political leaders in favour of divorce were sending the wrong moral messages to people.  I did not question Dr. O'Connell's right to express his views but I object to his suggestion that those who hold an alternative political opinion are less than moral.  This comment is offensive and inaccurate.  It is intolerant of a person to think he should not only be the sole arbiter of what is moral but that his version should be given a unique and special representation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="233" /> This referendum is about the right to remarry and I object to the suggestion that it will give respectability to second unions.  People in second relationships are respectable by any definition of that word and they are not seeking respectability. I ask those who argue the opposite case &mdash; I appreciate that they are developing a viewpoint &mdash; what is morally superior about evasion.  I am at a loss to understand the advantage of telling someone with three or four children that their marriage is annulled and that their children are factually but not legally there.  This evasion sends a bad signal in terms of the courage required to achieve a balance between the law, society and moral structures.  Many people with different traditions and tendencies, intellectually and otherwise, try to be moral.  We try to respect that and build tolerance around it but the law applies to all citizens, to those of no denomination and different denominations. As legislators we must try to strike the best balance we can in arriving at the best solution, often between competing versions of the common good.</P>
    <P>I thank the Deputies on all sides of the House who realise this is a complex issue and have been willing to change their minds and say that as legislators we must realistically recognise that before we decided this issue marriages had broken down.  That process was not initiated by the availability of divorce and neither was it stopped by the non-availability of divorce.  We are trying to achieve a humane and balanced adjustment of the law to cater for reality.</P>
    <P>To those who give lectures on morality, how moral is it to stay silent on a matter which does not affect oneself but which affects 75,000 people?  To suggest that 75,000 people constitute hard cases which need not be taken into consideration in comparison with the wider population is very curious.  It is also the distinction referred to in the previous contribution between individualism and personal freedom, the difference between individualism in an economic sense that has destroyed so many social <Col N="234" /> values during the past 15 years and concepts of personal freedom.  The philosophy of personal freedom means respecting the rights of every person in which case the argument for changing the law on divorce falls on all of us; we will be lessened as a society if the legal regime is uncompassionate, without care and deliberately authoritarian.  I take pleasure in saying that I not only support a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote in the referendum but intend to make the case for it as it is the sign of a compassionate and caring society.  Many people would put a different structure on the question being put but there is consensus that the time has come to do at least this much.</P>
    <P>It has been said that 96 per cent of marriages will automatically be in more danger the day after the referendum. This raises more questions about marriages than it does about the law.  Maybe it is a question we should ask ourselves more often in terms of the responsibilities involved.  During the two decades I practised as a sociologist I spent much of my time looking at the havoc created by cultures of fear.  One does not create good marriages by locking people irrevocably into them.  One does not create wonderful children by telling them they have to stay in the scenes of conflict.  One does not respect women by telling them they have had their one chance, they have made their bed and must now lie in it.  These are the marks of a dreadful, uncaring, harsh, tyrannical and authoritarian society to which we must say goodbye as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>It was not a golden age.  I lived in the countryside, and I lived in towns and cities. People like to tell us that, if we could go marching back to that dark time, we would be marching into some pleasurable situation.  When one thinks of the changes that have taken place, it has not been a fall from some garden of Eden.  One study mentions a woman whose husband never spoke her name after they got married but said &ldquo;are you there, Mrs&rdquo; or &ldquo;is the tea ready, Mrs&rdquo;. All of this beautiful &ldquo;garden of Eden&rdquo; communication went on.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="235" /> We are challenged by the changes that will take place to be human and compassionate.  I hope we will listen to each other in this debate.  I listen to people who make the case against divorce. I can understand it and will not deny that life will not be the same afterwards. As we handle marital breakdown and adjust to it and the legislation required, many suggestions made by them in regard to support for marriage will still be necessary.  What is important is that we will have ended some comprehensive evasions, for example, annulment. I have never understood that &mdash; perhaps I am not gifted enough to understand it.  I do know that telling people that their marriages are fictions never convinced me.  It is much better for the law to be the law and for people to have a legal existence.</P>
    <P>I also think that we are encouraged outside an atmosphere of fear, threat and intimidation.  It would be horrific, for example, to have grade A marriages, grade B marriages and third or fourth marriages which one would not recognise at all.  It would be like the Scottish football league.  It would not impress enormously.  If a church has a view, of course it is entitled to preach it.  I stand for that.  However, I object to any representative of any church suggesting that because I do not follow a single denominational line as they would judge it, I am less moral or less socially convinced. I repeat what I have said both on the airwaves and here this afternoon. I find such a remark offensive.  I also find it arrogant and quite intolerant.  It is an intolerance we could do without.</P>
    <P>As we enter this debate in a better atmosphere, few of us will want to see a repeat of the dissension and the divisions which characterised the 1986 divorce campaign.  Some of the fears will have been allayed by the comprehensive legislative programme that has been built up.  My colleague, the Minister for Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Taylor, has said that there are protections of marriage and of the rights and <Col N="236" /> entitlements of those whose marriages have irretrievably broken down.</P>
    <P>There were many questions in 1986 to which there were not sufficiently clear answers.  This provided an opportunity not just for confusion but for exploitation of the Constitution.  Legislation and family law reform since 1986 have gone a very long way.  In 1987 we had the Status of Children Act, in 1989 the Judicial Separation Family Law Reform Act, in 1994 the Maintenance Act and the Family Law Bill of 1994 which will deal with pensions and arrangements. Many issues have been dealt with which should not be left vague and which would otherwise have bothered people.</P>
    <P>To those who say we should legislate not for hard or sad cases I counter that I hold the opposite view.  The test of good legislation is the degree to which it takes into account persons or individuals who are not in a majority.  I spent 20 years in the United States, England and Ireland as a sociologist.  I caution, though, against these instant analyses of society. If there have been abuses in those 20 years, it is in the making of assumptions and the use of findings to make statements of a general nature which are without substance.  What is meant, for example, by a divorce culture?  This is a cliché.  What we are talking about is a society in which a large number of marriages have irretrievably broken down. So we have to choose between the cliché, and responding to the reality and making our law fit it.</P>
    <P>Regarding the statements made about those people who hold views such as mine &mdash; not, I emphasise, directed at me only &mdash; that they are knockers and agnostics, I would only say that beyond the social effects and the need to address the legal effects adequately, it is very wrong to assume that compassion, values and so on must have a trade mark on them to qualify as spiritual. There is very often a degree of compassion and a great heroism in people in second unions who, when the law would not recognise their situation and regarded their children as illegal, and who were sometimes told that their <Col N="237" /> marriages were fictional, continued on as households with compassion and caring and responsibility.  To say that these people, somehow or another, are less than a family that is sealed by fear and told they are stuck together whether they like it or not is a horrific image. What we are stuck with is being legislators, in a Legislature in a State where we will be judged by the quality of law, informed by tolerance, able to understand and anxious to put an end to fiction and evasion and, whether it is regarded as moral or not, making the law fit the social situations to which we must respond with compassion.</P>

      <P>This debate has evidenced a great degree of maturity in this House in the manner in which Members are approaching a question on which we are not all agreed.  My party has decided that it will support the legislation which will allow people to decide whether they want to lift the ban on divorce.  That is proper and it would be totally unacceptable for any individual or political party to think otherwise.  Equally it has allowed an opportunity for those of us within the party who hold differing views to give expression to those views. I want to assure my colleagues on all sides of this House that I do not propose to think less, morally or otherwise, of anybody who holds different views from mine.</P>
      <P>In such an important debate in which major constitutional changes are proposed it is only proper as a result of this debate that we should know that what is being said does not stem from an ulterior motive nor is intended to condemn persons who hold differing opinions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not subscribe to the idea that the removal of the ban on divorce will serve this society well.  I am satisfied that the implications of such a change will have serious consequences for marriage and <Col N="238" /> families in the future.  The constitutional position of marriage is well stated in our Constitution and we cannot interfere with that without imposing a new situation on families.  While &ldquo;family&rdquo; is not defined in the Constitution, it is nevertheless recognised as being based on marriage and is protected.  In the context of the Constitution it requires and is given all the support the State can muster.</P>
    <P>We have been prepared to engage in a series of legislative changes with the ultimate objective to ensure that divorce is the final goal.  Many things contribute to irretrievable marriage breakdown or create serious difficulties in marriage and not all of them have been dealt with sufficiently.  Over the years the House has commented on the impact of unemployment upon families, homes and marriages.  It has recognised that marriage difficulties often result from what has been described for years as &ldquo;poverty coming in the door and love going out the window.&rdquo;  We should not have the romantic notion that marriages properly interpreted as a union for life, necessarily have to be a union of love for life. Many partners have remained in a marriage and the love that was initially evident in the union may not have been evident at a later stage.  They were soundly based relationships where the partners recognised their responsibilities and the necessity to ensure that offspring of that union were protected.</P>
    <P>We must take into account that under the legislation many difficulties are likely to be unresolved and worsened by the removal of the ban on divorce.  I am concerned that a &ldquo;no fault&rdquo; divorce system seems to be the preference &mdash; a divorce obtainable without the consent of the other partner.  To qualify for divorce a couple may live apart in the same house, an extraordinary concept which defeats me.  To assist and protect marriages and to underscore the importance of the marriage contract requires more than the availability of divorce.  We have heard there are 75,000 people whose marriages have irretrievably broken down.  An irretrievably broken marriage <Col N="239" /> does not necessarily suggest that all the people in such marriages want divorce. Account must be taken of the considerable number of people with sound marriages. The direction in which we are going, even in the absence of divorce, is worrying in that there is irretrievable marriage breakdown and an increase in cohabitation or common law marriages. If divorce is introduced, rather than solving a problem, it will worsen current difficulties.  The day is fast approaching when there will not be any marriages and consequently no divorces.</P>
    <P>The issue of morality was mentioned by the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Higgins.  In many quarters morality has the protection of law.  Many people consider it necessary to uphold views which a large number of people would support from a position of personal morality.  Nevertheless, it would be naive to believe it could be left to people's morality to ensure the right things would be done all the time.  In many instances morality needs to be supported by the protection of law.  I will not vote on the day of the referendum to lift the ban on divorce. Throughout the campaign I will respect the views of others and I hope I will have an opportunity to express my views more extensively on another occasion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

      <P>Like any other society, Irish society is changing rapidly.  Political conservatives fully accept this and welcome it as part of the political process. They want to keep what is good and discard what is bad.  There is no doubt that there were many bad things in Irish society in the past, domestic violence and child sex abuse, to name but two.  Nevertheless there are a good deal of positive things in Irish society such as the central importance of the family.  Unfortunately, some believe that everything should be thrown out in an attempt to slavishly imitate other societies for no obvious reason, not recognising that many of them are also <Col N="240" /> constantly changing and re-evaluating their priorities.</P>
      <P>As the Irish political system matures, conservatism will no doubt become a respected and acceptable political philosophy, as in the case of the USA.  The role of the conservative is to question and debate each proposal and on occasion to slow down the pace of change.  That is not a very exciting role, but nevertheless a necessary one in any Parliament.  Somebody has to do it.  In due course I will be glad to call myself a conservative with a small &ldquo;c&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The people are about to be asked to make a major decision.  Divorce is a controversial issue and the result of the referendum will be a defining moment for Irish society.  Divorce will not be introduced because no Irish person wants to pay two ESB bills.  That is what a man from Ballybough told me in a pub the night Dublin won the Sam Maguire Cup and no doubt that man does not want to pay more tax, and he has a point.</P>
      <P>The forthcoming referendum is not a Church issue as far as most of us are concerned.  Let us leave the Church out of this debate.  It can fight its battles although it is perfectly entitled to put forward its view on the matter.  This referendum will be fought on economic, social and constitutional arguments.</P>
      <P>I appeal for a calm and rational debate between now and 24 November. I hope we can demonstrate that we are a mature democracy, capable of taking decisions without tearing ourselves asunder in the process.  It would be helpful if the ultra right wing Catholic conservatives and the fully paid up bitter anti-Catholics stayed out of the debate.</P>
      <P>I hope it is not too much to expect, however, that anyone who expresses an opinion on divorce over the coming weeks will have that opinion respected. In addition, we should be careful in the language and phrases we use during the campaign.  Dramatic language, using adjectives such as &ldquo;drastic&rdquo;, &ldquo;disastrous&rdquo; and &ldquo;devastating&rdquo;, does not help and only succeeds in raising emotions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been a public representative <Col N="241" /> for the past ten years and in that time I was never canvassed by any person for the introduction of divorce.</P>

      <P>Any decision to seek an amendment of the Constitution cannot be taken lightly or without substantial cause.  The Constitution is the fundamental law of this State.  It has the authority of the people.  It is a statement by them of the manner in which they wish their society to be ordered.  Since 1937, this House has considered seeking the approval of the people to have their Constitution amended on only 14 occasions.  The rarity of Bills of this nature is powerful evidence of the fact that the Constitution has served us well and has been seen by the people, and by this House, to have served us well.  Any person moving a Bill which proposes an amendment of the Constitution carries an onus to establish to the satisfaction of this House, and ultimately the people, that the present constitutional position is defective or deficient to an extent that causes a real and substantial injustice in society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The manner in which Article 40.4.1º of the Constitution has been interpreted by the courts has, in recent years, resulted in a real, substantial and continuing injustice to the people of Ireland.  This Bill is designed to give the people an opportunity to remedy that <Col N="242" /> injustice and rectify the deficiency in the Constitution.  The ultimate decision as to whether the Constitution ought to be amended is one which only the people can make.  My purpose in introducing this Bill is to allow the people to have their voice heard on the matter.</P>
    <P>Over the past 30 years, the constitutional law of this State has developed in a manner that can hardly have been envisaged by its founders.  This is no bad thing.  A Constitution must, of necessity, be a living document &mdash; alive to changes in society and technology which affect the lives of ordinary citizens.  There is, however, a danger that the vast volumes of jurisprudence which relate to the rights of accused persons will eclipse the equally important rights of their victims and potential victims.</P>
    <P>The Constitution is a document which exists for the protection of citizens and society; it does not exist exclusively for the benefit of persons charged with criminal offences.  The Constitution ought to exist as a sword for the advancement of righteousness and justice as well as a shield for the protection of the accused.  It is the duty of this House to ensure that is so and to afford the people their right to wield that sword in the protection of their fellow citizens.  This is a Bill designed to let the people do just that.</P>
    <P>Article 40.4.1º of the Constitution provides that: &ldquo;No citizen shall be deprived of his personal liberty save in accordance with law&rdquo;.  The law as it currently stands does not permit our courts to remand a person charged with a criminal offence in custody even if the court is satisfied that the accused person is likely to commit serious criminal offences if released.  This has been part of our law for almost 30 years since the Supreme Court delivered its judgment in the case of the people <i>v.</i> Roger O'Callaghan which is reported in 1966 Irish Law Reports at page 501.  It ought not to be assumed that this decision of the Supreme Court was inevitable or followed universal legal practice.</P>
    <P>It is frequently forgotten that the decision of Mr. Justice Murnaghan, a <Col N="243" /> distinguished jurist, in the High Court in the O'Callaghan case was that one of the matters which a court may and should take into consideration in hearing an application for bail was &ldquo;the likelihood of the commission of further offences whilst on bail&rdquo;.  Mr. Justice Murnaghan expressed the view that &ldquo;a prisoner facing a heavy sentence has little to lose if he commits further offences.  A prisoner may consider that he has to go to prison in any event and, in an effort to get money to support his family, may commit further offences&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Those words of Mr. Justice Murnaghan have a strong ring of common sense that will appeal to many on all sides of this House.  I cite them to demonstrate that there was a significant body of jurisprudence in this country at the time the O'Callaghan decision was delivered which was of the opinion that the likelihood of further offences being committed was a legitimate matter to be taken into consideration by a court in deciding whether to admit an accused person to bail.</P>
    <P>In 1966, when the Supreme Court delivered its judgment in the O'Callaghan case, society was very different from what it is today.  The consumption of controlled drugs was unknown.  The existence in society of many thousands of people who had a daily need to acquire significant sums of money to fund a drug addiction was unthinkable. Even in those relatively crime free days it was recognised that the right to bail was not absolute.</P>
    <P>The precise terms of Mr. Justice Walsh's judgment in the Supreme Court are worth remembering.  He said: &ldquo;From the earliest times it was appreciated that detention in custody pending trial could be a cause of great hardship and it is as true now as it was in ancient times that it is desirable to release on bail as large a number of accused persons as possible who may safely be released pending trial&rdquo;.  Many will share my view that a person who will probably commit <Col N="244" /> crimes while awaiting trial is not a person who, in Mr. Justice Walsh's view, &ldquo;may safely be released&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The change in our Constitution I propose this evening on behalf of Fianna Fáil is not one so radical as would make the Irish legal system different from all other common law countries.  It would bring our law broadly into line with the position which pertains in the United Kingdom.  There, the Bail Act, 1976 provides:</P>
    <P>The defendant need not be granted bail if the Court is satisfied that there are substantial grounds for believing that the defendant, if released on bail (whether subject to conditions or not) would&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  fail to surrender to custody, or</P>
    <P>(b)  commit an offence while on bail, or</P>
    <P>(c)  interfere with witnesses or otherwise obstruct the course of justice, whether in relation to himself or any other person.</P>
    <P>The proposed amendment would do no more than permit our judges to refuse bail on similar grounds to those on which bail can be refused by judges in the United Kingdom.  The position there is not unique.  It is a hallmark of many common law jurisdictions that bail can be refused in circumstances where there is a likelihood or probability that an accused person will commit offences if released.  In the Australian jurisdiction of New South Wales the Bail Act of 1978 permits, in section 32, a court to consider &ldquo;... the likelihood that a person will or will not commit an offence while at liberty on bail&rdquo; in arriving at a decision as to whether to grant or refuse bail.</P>
    <P>This proposed amendment to the Constitution seeks to do no more than provide the people of Ireland with the same type of reasonable protection as the peoples of other countries who have armed themselves in their battle against crime.  The amendment would bring our <Col N="245" /> laws into line with those in other civilised democratic nations and afford our people a similar measure of protection as those in other countries enjoy.</P>
    <P>The right to liberty as expressed in Article 40.4.1º of our Constitution is not absolute.  It is well recognised and beyond dispute that the right to liberty may and must be curtailed in the interests of the common good.  The Constitution recognises explicitly that the right to liberty can be proscribed by law. The expression &ldquo;by law&rdquo; clearly envisages that persons tried, convicted and sentenced by courts, established under the Constitution, may forfeit their right to liberty.  The Oireachtas and the Supreme Court have also explicitly recognised that there are circumstances in which a person may be deprived of their liberty prior to conviction.  Arrest and detention under section 30 of the Offences Against the State Act, 1939, and section 4 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1984, are examples of the deprivation of liberty by law in order to advance the common good by giving to the Garda the necessary power to question suspects.  Even the O'Callaghan case recognised that there were circumstances in which a court could and should properly and lawfully deprive a person of their liberty prior to trial and conviction.</P>
    <P>The likelihood that an accused person will abscond or interfere with witnesses are both accepted by the courts as factors which permit an accused person lawfully to be detained in custody prior to trial.  It is important to note that the Supreme Court did not say that these two factors were the sole and exclusive factors which could lead to the refusal of bail.  Mr. Justice Walsh, in his judgment in the O'Callaghan case expressly recognised that a belief that an accused would commit offences if left at liberty could, in certain circumstances and if authorised by the Oireachtas, lead to a refusal of bail.  He stated:</P>
    <P>In this country it would be quite contrary to the concept of personal liberty enshrined in the Constitution <Col N="246" /> that any person should be punished in respect of any matter upon which he has not been convicted or that in any circumstances he should be deprived of his liberty upon only the belief that he will commit offences if left at liberty, save in the most extraordinary circumstances carefully spelled out by the Oireachtas and then only to secure the preservation of public peace and order or the public safety and the preservation of the State in time of national emergency or in some situation akin to that.</P>
    <P>Many people are now of the view that the number of drug addicts who daily rob and thieve to feed their addiction constitute a threat to the fabric of society as great as has ever been faced in the history of the State.  It is necessary to take reasoned and cautious steps to protect the fabric of society and the quality of life of those who seek to live honest and decent lives.  The amendment which I propose is, I believe, such a step.  It is a step which has already been taken by other countries and strikes the correct balance between protecting the rights of individuals and safeguarding the common good.</P>
    <P>I want to spell out in great detail the changes which would occur if this amendment is approved by the people. Article 40.4 of the Constitution would then provide:</P>
    <P>1.  No citizen shall be deprived of his personal liberty save in accordance with law.</P>
    <P>2.  Any person charged with an indictable offence may be remanded in custody pending trial if, on the hearing of an application for bail, the judge is satisfied that there is a probability that the person will commit a class of criminal offence which is also an indictable offence if admitted to bail.</P>
    <P>3.  Any person remanded in custody pending trial by reason of a judge being satisfied that there is a probability that the person will commit a class of criminal offence which is also <Col N="247" /> an indictable offence if comitted to bail shall not be remanded in custody for that reason alone for any single period greater than 90 days.</P>
    <P>The category of persons directly affected by the change is expressly limited to persons charged with indictable or serious offences.  This amendment is aimed at persons who have been charged with serious criminal offences. It does not apply to summary or petty offences.  It does not mean that bail does not apply to those serious offences.  It involves only a small but important extension of the jurisdiction currently exercised by judges appointed under the Constitution.  If judges are satisfied by evidence of the fact that an accused person will interfere with witnesses or will not turn up for trial they are entitled to deny bail.  This amendment would add a third category to that list &mdash; a category which would require a judge to be satisfied by evidence in open court before it could result in a person being remanded in custody.</P>
    <P>To deny the people the opportunity to voice their view on this amendment is to say that we as a society wish our judges to release into the community persons whom they believe will commit serious criminal offences after they have been charged with one serious criminal offence.  To say this is to misunderstand the nature of the right to liberty guaranteed by the Constitution.  The right to liberty is not a permit to pillage and plunder, it is not a licence to rob and thieve.  It is a right which carries duties and responsibilities &mdash; a duty to obey the law and a responsibility to respect the constitutional rights of other citizens. Where a court is satisfied by evidence that a person who awaits trial on one serious criminal charge will, as a matter of probability, abuse his right to liberty by infringing the constitutional rights of other citizens I believe it is correct for the court to be empowered to take limited action to protect the constitutional rights of ordinary people by <Col N="248" /> remanding that person in custody for a specific limited period.</P>
    <P>The requirement that an accused person may be remanded on bail is necessitated by the delay which takes place between the arrest of a suspect on a criminal charge and the subsequent trial.  Some delay is inevitable &mdash; time will be needed to prepare necessary documents and to afford an accused person and his legal advisers an opportunity to consider the case being made against him.  Natural justice requires this.  What is wholly unnecessary is the scale of delay currently existing in respect of the trial of indictable offences in our courts.  Insufficient judges and courts combined with a dated and unnecessarily cumbersome pre-trial procedure have resulted in unwarranted, interminable and unacceptable delays.</P>
    <P>Members may well wish to reflect on the sad fact that in Dublin only three Circuit Court judges are permanently available to deal with indictable crime. Those three judges have the onerous task of dealing with all serious crime with the exception of murder and rape. Every indictable robbery and assault, every serious drugs offence must join the queue to be tried by one of those three judges.</P>
    <P>I submit it is a scandal that the criminal justice system in this city will, on average, take at least a year to process a case from arrest to trial.  The shortage of judges is a major factor but it is not the only one.  The antiquarian procedures provided for in the Criminal Justice Act, 1967, are a significant impediment to the smooth operation of justice.  It is indefensible, in the late 20th century, that every person who is to be tried for any offence on indictment has the right, if he chooses to exercise it, to call every witness on deposition.  This mind-numbing procedure involves the witness coming before a District Court judge and giving his evidence at a pre-trial hearing so that it can be written down in longhand by a District Court clerk.  It is legitimate for the people to ask whether this Government is serious <Col N="249" /> about crime when it tolerates the continuation of this procedure.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil has published the Criminal Procedure Bill, 1995, which provides for a fast track approach to specified crimes.  I am pleased to note that the Law Reform Commission in its report presented to the Attorney General on 17 August and published by the Government&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;by some strange coincidence, this morning, endorsed this approach by noting that one of the most effective methods of combating the commission of crimes while on bail would be the reduction of delay in cases coming for trial.  A factor which appears to have been ignored by many in this debate is the existence of many thousands of readily identifiable drug addicts who need to acquire large sums of money on a daily basis to feed their addiction.</P>
      <P>To release on bail without treatment a person with a severe drug addiction is to guarantee the commission of further offences.  It is no coincidence that the Law Reform Commission found that in excess of 25 per cent of robberies and muggings were committed by persons on bail.  These are the methods through which many drug addicts fund their addictions.  Any measure which would reduce the level of robberies and muggings ought to be welcomed.  Our proposal would permit a person charged with such an offence to be remanded in custody for up to 90 days should a court believe he would commit further offences if released.  A properly organised criminal justice system can provide for a trial within that period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The removal of criminals from our streets is a costly matter.  It takes political will and determination to put such a proposal in place.  The Fianna Fáil Party is committed to returning the streets of this country to the people.  We are determined to strike relentlessly against crime and its perpetrators.  This Bill is <Col N="250" /> designed to let the people voice their views and all I ask is that this House trusts them.</P>
    <P>I think it was the Yukon poet, Robert Service who wrote &ldquo;that a promise made is a debt unpaid&rdquo;.  The Minister for Justice last March quite correctly promised a referendum on bail laws. Clearly, in making that statement she recognised there was an urgent need for reform.  The report of the Law Reform Commission today does not validate the argument that there is now no need for a constitutional referendum on bail.  We have seen a continuing steady rise in serious crime committed by people who are out on bail.  That is supported by the statistics.</P>
    <P>The Criminal Justice Act, 1984, provided that an individual who committed an offence while on bail would receive a consecutive sentence if convicted. Unfortunately, it would appear that some courts interpreted section 11 of that 1984 Act contrary to the spirit of the legislation.  The courts are interpreting what the Legislature intended as a consecutive sentence to be a suspended consecutive sentence.</P>
    <P>A notion grew up also that the totality of offences should be taken into account so that it would be proportionate to the sentence.  This sent the signal that there was no need to worry if one committed an offence while on bail. Since one would go to jail, anyway, one might as well be hung for a sheep as for a lamb.  That certainly was the message sent down the line and the result is that in every year during the past four there has been a substantial increase in the number of people committing offences while on bail.  As long as that criminal legal regime pertains, as sure as night follows day, we will almost certainly see a continuing rise in crime committed by people who are out on bail.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that a person who is addicted to heroin is not only likely to commit a crime while on bail but is almost certain to.  The unfortunate individual has to feed what is a very serious habit.  We have to recognise that we must as a matter of humanity provide <Col N="251" /> treatment facilities for those people.  No criminal system should tolerate a situation where an individual who is drug free can be sent to Mountjoy Prison and come out an habitual addict.  Unfortunately, that possibility exists today.  In treating drug addicts and in doing what is the decent human thing we must protect society from a rising tide of criminality.</P>
    <P>When the judgment in the O'Callaghan case was handed down in 1966 few people would have believed that within 30 years law and order would have broken down in certain parts of the country to the extent that we have in excess of 100,000 indictable serious offences every year.  The statistics are quite frightening.  It is estimated that 80 per cent or more of crime committed in Dublin today is drug related and 1966 is light years away from the society which exists in 1995.</P>
    <P>We have to face up to the reality that if the problem is not arrested in all probability it will not only get worse in Dublin city &mdash; and recent statistics show that the numbers going to treatment clinics have gone through the roof &mdash; but will spread to every town and village. Something has to be done now. The <i>Garda Review</i> editorial states:</P>
    <P>The courts, the law enforcement agencies and the concerned public fully accept that these two fundamental issues&mdash;</P>
    <P>that is to say the reform of the ridiculous bail laws and the failure to proceed with the provision of essential prison accommodation</P>
    <P>&mdash;must be addressed as a matter of urgency if it is genuinely intended to address the crime problem before it is too late.</P>
    <P>The decision not to address these issues was a serious error of judgment for a number of reasons, not least of which was the disastrous signal it conveyed to the criminal fraternity and the inevitable consequences it will <Col N="252" /> continue to inflict on the law abiding community.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances we demand on behalf of the Gardaí and the people we serve, that the Government give immediate priority to these issues and signal their resolve to deal with thuggery and restore public peace and good order.</P>
    <P>Law abiding citizens are entitled to protection in their homes, at work and on the streets.  The Guardians of Peace are equally entitled to the full support of the Government in their endeavours to achieve these noble objectives.</P>
    <P>The concluding sentence is:</P>
    <P>Broken promises are not acceptable.</P>
    <P>When I introduced a Bill dealing with restrictions on the right to bail earlier this year the Minister for Justice said I was only tinkering with the problem.  It is ironic that the Law Reform Commission in Chapter VI of its report recommends many of the restrictions published in my Bill.  If we were tinkering with the problem, which we were not, then what the Minister said was required was a referendum.</P>
    <P>Here is the opportunity.  The Fifteenth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1995 which I am introducing on behalf of Fianna Fáil, contains the wording of a referendum and would undoubtedly play a major role in protecting people in their homes and streets and on the highways and byways of Ireland.  Those who are interested in upholding law and order and who truly care about reducing an intolerable level of criminality in our society will support the Bill.  Those who do not support the Bill and who said there was a need for a referendum can only be judged by the public as having broken a promise and as spouting so much hot air.  I am coming to the conclusion that this Government &mdash; the rainbow coalition &mdash; is forever amber.  It has a criminal justice <Col N="253" /> policy that is &ldquo;somewhere over the rainbow, way up high&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>We come from the same constituency and are aware of the problems.</P>
      <P>I wish to make a number of suggestions to the Minister.  In addition to seeking her support for this referendum Bill, she should introduce a change in the identity parade system.  Citizens are afraid to identify people because they must put their hand on the person's shoulder in order to point them out whereas in the American system the person looks through a one way glass to point out the offender.  Would the Minister have a serious look at that issue?  I have had conversations with a number of people who are afraid and have been threatened.  They fear that they will be punished later if they identify the criminal. I have also met some very courageous people who have, in spite of such warnings, identified criminals.  However, they should not have to endure that fear, particularly as they have probably gone through the trauma of being mugged and are obliged to attend the identity parade for that reason.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope the Minister will listen carefully to my other concern.  Parties such as Sinn Féin could easily win a great <Col N="254" /> deal of support in elections.  Their punishment beatings and other such activities in the North could start down here and I do not want to see that happen. However, the public are desperate and anybody who promises a solution will garner a great deal of support.  We should be cognisant of that prospect; we must recognise that it is a distinct possibility and must be seen to act.</P>
    <P>This week I spoke to a man who travelled to a certain part of the inner city on a business call.  While his car was parked and he was conducting his business the staff called in to tell him that it was being broken into in the grounds of the premises.  When the man went out to his car the people who were tearing the car apart set upon him, held a knife to his throat and tore his clothes searching for his wallet.  The man started to hyperventilate.  The manager of the premises had rung the gardaí but they had not arrived.  They knew the area well but by the time they reached the scene the incident was over.  The man was admitted to the Mater Hospital because he thought he was having a heart attack.  He told me he was absolutely terrified.  He will not get over that incident for a long time.</P>
    <P>These are thugs.  They do not deserve any quarter.  These people do not have to worry about the law.  There is no law or order for them.  They see what they want and they take it.  Anybody who gets in their way had better look out. The people who were supposed to be looking after this man's car had been warned that if they intervened they would never work in that place again because the intruders would get them. The security people were even afraid to go to this man's rescue.  This happened in our city.</P>
    <P>We know of the many tourists who have been mugged.  Within the last week a friend of mine visiting here from Chicago was mugged and had his personal effects taken, including a notebook with telephone numbers of people he wished to contact here.  This is happening every day and night.  These junkies &mdash; most of them are junkies &mdash; could <Col N="255" /> not care less.  They do not care about their families; they would rob their mothers, fathers, brothers and sisters. Does anyone think they will care about a member of the public?  There is no care or concern.  They do not care what they have to do to get their next fix.  A young lady being interviewed on television recently said that she needed over £200 per day to feed her drug habit, yet we let these people out on the street.</P>
    <P>We must take tough decisions and stop being afraid of newspaper columnists decrying our ideas as Victorian. We must be courageous because that is what the people want.  They will cheer for the Minister if she is seen to act and do something about these criminals.  We need boot camps.  They are being considered in Britain, even though a few years ago everybody would have been horrified at the idea.  People are afraid to speak out.  They are afraid of getting the reaction: &ldquo;There he goes again, the law and order man&rdquo;.  If some of the advice I have been offering over the years had been taken the problem might not be as bad as it is.</P>
    <P>I can give an example of the measures I sought.  I was the first Member of this House to ask that consecutive sentences be handed down for crimes committed when out on bail.  That was eventually accepted but the provision is for a maximum of two consecutive sentences. I would give the offender a consecutive sentence for every crime committed when out on bail.  We are pussyfooting with this issue.  I am not blaming the Minister because all Governments are to blame in this regard.</P>
    <P>I have called for parents to be made responsible for the actions of their children. When I made that call to the former Minister for Justice, Deputy Doherty, he was advised by his officials that people could not be held responsible for crimes committed by others.  I told the Minister that a person can be held responsible for his dog.  If a dog bites somebody the person can take an action against the owner even though one cannot communicate with a dog as <Col N="256" /> easily as one can communicate with a person.  Legislation is now proposed to make parents pay for the damage done by their children.</P>
    <P>There is a gut response from people when one proposes such measures at meetings but then the people are left waiting and nothing happens.  There are muggings and car thefts every day. Which one of us does not know somebody whose car was stolen?  How many of us have had our cars stolen and seen the damage done to them?  People hope they will not get the car back because it will be in such a state that it will cost a fortune to have it fixed.  They hope it will be burnt because the insurance company will pay.  That means everybody is paying.</P>
    <P>These young criminals have no respect for old people or young people. One hears awful stories about old people being beaten up in their homes and robbed.  The offenders are nothing but hooligans and blackguards.  Name calling will not achieve anything but that is what they are and they deserve no quarter.  We must take them on because they are winning.  They are running circles around the gardaí, making them look inept and a laughing stock.  One might say that one must protect our gardaí because they do a grand job. However, they cannot do a grand job if they are handcuffed and the gardaí are the people who are handcuffed, not the criminals.  Gangsters do not have law and have no respect for the law.  The gardaí must work within the law.  There are no shortcuts for them.  The law handcuffs the gardaí.</P>
    <P>It is time to conduct a relentless war on criminals.  The Minister will receive the support of this House and the people.  For God's sake, do it because the situation cannot continue as it is much longer.  Literally, we are in a constant battle to stay alive.  Not one of us goes home any night without the thought or fear that it is the night we are going to be attacked or burnt out of our homes.  I passionately appeal to the Minister to get tough.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome today's publication by the Law Reform Commission of its report on the law of bail and I am sure all Members will join with me in paying tribute to the work which members of the commission put into the report on a fundamental and complex aspect of our law.  To clarify a comment made by Deputy O'Donoghue, the date the report is published is solely a matter for the Law Reform Commission &mdash; it has nothing to do with me.  I have already begun the process of examining the report in detail with a view to submitting proposals to Government as quickly as possible.  This process will be facilitated by the fact that I have had work on this matter ongoing in my Department while awaiting the commission report.  My proposals to Government will reflect the fact &mdash; as I have stated publicly on a number of occasions &mdash; that I share the public concern that our bail laws are being abused.</P>
      <P>It is puzzling, to say the least, that on the day the Law Reform Commission publishes a report on the law of bail, Deputy O'Donoghue would commend to the House a Bill seeking to amend the Constitution without even one day's consideration of this substantial report. To suggest that the Government or the House should accept it without having time to consider what the Law Reform Commission report &mdash; which runs to about 200 pages and took over 18 months to produce &mdash; has to say is, at the least, naive and certainly unwise.  I know Deputy O'Donoghue to be neither naive nor unwise and that if he were on this side of the House, he would be doing exactly what I must do this evening and oppose this Bill with a view to bringing my own proposals to Government, after careful consideration of this report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no disagreement between Deputy O'Donoghue, myself and &mdash; I would have thought &mdash; all Members of the House about the seriousness of our crime problems.  While international studies show that our crime levels are relatively low, that is cold comfort to the victims of crime.  Both I and the Government regard tackling crime as a <Col N="258" /> key priority and we have taken, and will take, whatever steps are open to us to tackle these problems effectively.</P>
    <P>There are, of course, no easy answers in this area.  If there were, they would have been adopted long ago.  I see a former Minister for Justice on the Opposition back-benches.  If there were easy answers, why did he not adopt them? This is a point which is well understood by the former Ministers for Justice in this House, and there are a number still serving.  Where I would seriously disagree &mdash; and I suspect my predecessors would seriously disagree &mdash; with Deputy O'Donoghue and Deputy Briscoe is with the fantasy that crime started just before last Christmas when the Government changed.  Are we to believe that before I took office there were no unsolved crimes, no delays in the courts, no problems with pressure on prison accommodation and that our drugs problem is somehow linked to the fact that Deputy O'Donoghue's party is no longer in Government and my party is?</P>
    <P>The Deputy refers to crime problems as if they have only just arisen and does not acknowledge fully the steps I have taken to deal with them.  That is understandable: no Opposition Deputy would like to give praise or credit to a Minister. I will mention only some of what the Government and I have done so far. I have launched the most comprehensive package ever to deal with the drug trafficking problem and work is progressing satisfactorily to put the different elements in place, including the legislation.  This package was welcomed and supported by all sides of the House. I have taken a wide range of measures &mdash; of which the House will be aware &mdash; to improve the effectiveness of the Garda Síochána, the courts and the prison service.  For example, I am preparing the Courts and Court Officers Bill which will include a provision to increase the number of judges by 17.  It will also include a number of measures to improve efficiency and speed up trials. My priority has been and will continue to be to tilt the balance of the system in favour of the victim and against the perpetrators of crime.  That is particularly the case in relation to bail.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="259" /> I have to remind the Deputy that the decision to refer the question of bail to the Law Reform Commission was made by my predecessor, the Deputy's colleague, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, in early 1994.  To suggest that this Bill be proceeded with without considering the commission's report seems to imply that the decision to refer this matter to the commission was irrelevant and/or unnecessary.  I am not implying any criticism of my predecessor on that score &mdash; it is Deputy O'Donoghue who is doing that &mdash; but the reality is that it must seem contrary to Fianna Fáil's best judgment as the main Opposition party to proceed with this Bill before there is an opportunity to consider fully the commission report which is now available to the public and which they themselves sought.</P>
    <P>That is aside altogether from the considerable doubt there must be as to whether what the Deputy is proposing would be an appropriate or effective way of amending the Constitution.  In particular, there is no compelling case for believing that Deputy O'Donoghue has presented us with an amendment which would, in practice, have the effects he claims for it.  For example, on one interpretation of the wording he proposes, it would place no obligation whatsoever on the courts to take into account the possibility of the commission of further offences when considering whether a person be granted bail.</P>
    <P>The Law Reform Commission report does not contain a summary, presumably on the basis that it confines itself to an examination of the law and does not make recommendations; it was not asked to do so.  Few, if any, Members will have had the opportunity to read it fully and it might be helpful in those circumstances if I were to give an outline of the main features of the report.  In doing so I will make some comments of my own but the House will appreciate that, before I have an opportunity to <Col N="260" /> examine the report fully, any such comments are of necessity preliminary in nature.</P>
    <P>In its analysis of the law in this area, the commission mentions that &ldquo;by international standards, Ireland remands few persons in custody pending trial&rdquo;. Ireland is stated to be unusual among common law jurisdictions in having failed to introduce comprehensive bail legislation in recent decades.  The various judicial decisions in this area, particularly the landmark O'Callaghan judgment, are summarised.  Irish law is characterised as &ldquo;unusually restrictive&rdquo; in respect of matters which may constitute grounds for refusing bail.</P>
    <P>The report makes an especially interesting comment on the operation of section 11 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1984, which requires &mdash; or was intended to require &mdash; the imposition of consecutive sentences for offences committed while on bail.  Deputy O'Donoghue referred to this particular part of the report.  It suggests that, because of a number of judicial decisions involving this section, it might not be working as the Oireachtas expected.  In one case, the Court of Criminal Appeal held that, while sentences must be consecutive under section 11, the court, in the case of grave offences, should adjust the sentence downwards where not to do so would impose a manifestly unjust punishment on the accused.  This is known as the &ldquo;totality&rdquo; principle.  In other cases, it was held by the courts that the consecutive sentences under section 11 could be suspended.  It is not clear from the report what the effect of these cases has been in practice, in other words, how frequently courts use these judgments to avoid imposing consecutive sentences, but clearly this is a matter which needs to be examined further and corrective legislative action taken if necessary.</P>
    <P>In relation to other aspects of our existing laws the report contains some good and some bad news.  The traditional remedy for breach of bail &mdash; estreatment &mdash; remains in force but it is rarely enforced and, even when invoked <Col N="261" /> by the Director of Public Prosecutions, the courts are often reluctant to estreat all of the bail money, particularly where a financially hardpressed spouse is involved.  This clearly suggests that the law in this area is proving largely ineffective but, on a more positive note, the report points out that the provisions of the Criminal Justice Act, 1994, dealing with the confiscation of the proceeds of crime may partly address the phenomenon of career criminals using their time on bail to develop a financial fund.</P>
    <P>In assessing the extent of the problem of the commission of offences while on bail, the commission has regard primarily to two sets of statistics: Garda crime figures and international prison population trends.  One set of Garda statistics would suggest that in the years 1992 and 1993 9 per cent of all detected indictable offences were attributable to persons on bail.  Within this, there are wide variations for various types of offence but it is worth noting that the 1993 figures would be taken to suggest that 27 per cent of detected armed robberies were committed by persons on bail.  It is important to bear in mind that the figures used for detected offences include cases where convictions have not followed and are based on a Garda view that they have detected the offender in relation to a particular crime.  The commission emphasises the need for caution in using these statistics particularly in terms of assumptions that may or may not be valid in extrapolating from these figures the overall number of offences likely to have been committed by persons while on bail.</P>
    <P>The report finds that the number of persons remanded in custody prior to trial in Ireland is extremely low by international standards.  Indeed the figures included in the commission's report show that we have the lowest rates of pre-trial detention among Council of Europe countries.  This is both as a percentage of remand prisoners in the total prison population and in the rate of detention per 100,000 of the population. I can think of no plausible explanation <Col N="262" /> for these figures other than that they reflect the relative laxity in our bail laws.</P>
    <P>The report goes on to consider international studies which have been undertaken about the efficacy or otherwise of various methods of attempting to predict behaviour, for example, whether someone is likely to commit a serious offence if released.  Broadly speaking, the commission concludes that the results of these studies are discouraging.</P>
    <P>The report contains a very useful analysis of the law on bail in other countries, in particular the United States, Canada, England and Wales, Scotland and Australia.  For me, a key point which emerges from this analysis is that all the jurisdictions surveyed permit custodial remand, at least to some degree, in order to prevent the commission of further offences.  Sometimes this is only to prevent further serious or violent offences; sometimes it covers any further offences.  Usually this form of detention only applies when the offence with which the person is charged is a serious one.  I believe that one of the main questions we have to ask ourselves in considering what needs to be done about our bail laws is whether the nature and rate of crime in society is so different from that in the kinds of country I have mentioned that we alone should have no capacity, whatever the circumstances, to permit custodial remand for the purposes of preventing further offences.</P>
    <P>Another chapter of the report sets out what might be seen as the philosophies underlying the bail issue.  It looks at arguments for and against a change in Irish law to permit the pre-trial detention of an accused on the basis that he or she might commit offences if released.  Among the issues considered are whether the commission of offences while on bail warrants a departure from the normal deterrence-based operation of the criminal justice system.  The question of whether pre-trial detention constitutes a punishment is considered.  In relation to constitutional issues the report considers what principles or <Col N="263" /> rights would be infringed by pre-trial detention, for example, liberty, the principle that criminal behaviour must be defined by reference to behaviour rather than the condition or character of the accused, and the presumption of innocence.  The possible justifications for breaches of constitutional rights or principles are explored.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned to the House when we discussed another Private Members' Bill on bail some months ago, there is an absolutist view that no person should be held in custody prior to conviction, but however liberal our bail laws might be, the fact is that as things stand we do not have that absolutist situation in our law.  The courts may refuse bail to a person who is unlikely to turn up for trial or will attempt to pervert the course of justice.  I believe most people would support that approach as a minimum but that does involve the courts imprisoning someone who may or may not be guilty of a crime and doing so on the basis of a view of the likely behaviour of someone if he or she were released on bail.</P>
    <P>Essentially what is at issue is whether society should reserve the right to protect itself by providing for a situation where a person is deprived of his or her liberty awaiting trial because of a fear that the person involved will commit further offences if released.  It is a difficult question of balancing competing rights but I have already made it clear that my approach is to devise proposals that will tilt that balance towards the victims of crime.  It is, of course, the case that, with whatever changes might be made, it will be a matter for the courts to decide on the merits of a particular case.</P>
    <P>To return to the Law Reform Commission's report, its final chapter lists a number of possible measures under the heading &ldquo;Alternative Methods of Dealing with Bail Offending&rdquo;.  I will, of course, need some time to consider these but I think that it is fair to say that it would be to misread the report to suggest that these measures must be an <Col N="264" /> alternative to an amendment to the Constitution.  They could, in practice, be complementary to a change in the Constitution. I should mention too that many of these measures are not new suggestions and the commission holds out little hope in relation to their likely effectiveness.</P>
    <P>I hope that what I have had to say has done justice to the broad thrust of the commission's report but the House will appreciate that it is a lengthy and detailed document which deserves careful study by all of us.</P>
    <P>There are a couple of general points I should make at this stage.  As I mentioned earlier, a Courts and Court Officers Bill is being prepared and will be before the House this session.  An interdepartmental committee is looking at the impact on prison places of the decision to defer the Castlerea prison project and must report by the end of December 1995.</P>
    <P>While it is the case that the report does not consider in detail what specific approach might be taken to the actual wording of a possible amendment to the Constitution, clearly a report that represents what is probably the most detailed analysis ever carried out of our law on bail would form an important backdrop to the formulation of a constitutional amendment.  That is why for Deputy O'Donoghue to proceed with this Bill without having had a chance to examine the commission's report is, if I may say so, inappropriate and ill-advised. It is important that we get proposals in this area right and that is why, unlike the Deputy, I and the Government will fully consider what the Law Reform Commission had to say before finalising our approach to this matter. With all the attendant difficulties associated with amendments to our Constitution, it is essential, and it is my responsibility, that, in any proposals I put to the Government, I am satisfied they are fully thought through and will deal as effectively as possible with the heart of the matter, that is, the prevention as far as possible of crime committed by persons on bail.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="265" /> It should be clear to everyone that the task of devising an appropriate wording of a constitutional amendment is fraught with difficulty and one in relation to bail which carries with it its own complexities.  A key issue which obviously arises in assessing any form of wording is an assessment of its likely practical effect on the courts deciding whether to grant or refuse bail.</P>
    <P>Strictly speaking, there is no constitutional right to bail as such.  As the then Chief Justice, Cearbhaill Ó Dálaigh, said in the O'Callaghan decision:</P>
    <P>What is termed a right to bail is not a constitutional right but a recognition by the courts that a person presumed to be innocent shall not have his liberty interfered with unnecessarily pending his trial on a criminal charge.</P>
    <P>For all practical purposes this might be seen as a distinction without a difference because in reality the granting of bail is the means whereby the right to liberty is not interfered with unnecessarily.</P>
    <P>I mention this point in the context of formulating a wording of an amendment to the Constitution because we would have to assess what balance the court would decide on between the fundamental right to liberty enshrined in the Constitution and an amendment, one effect of which would be to allow the court, in considering whether to grant bail, to take into account the likelihood or probability of the commission of further offences.</P>
    <P>Any amendment will be balanced against already existing constitutional rights and it is in that context that the likely effect of Deputy O'Donoghue's suggested amendment has to be judged. On the face of it, that amendment would not require a court to do anything. So, if we accepted this Bill we would be asking a court to place on the scales on the one hand the fundamental right to liberty already enshrined in the <Col N="266" /> Constitution and on the other a provision of the Constitution which allows, but no more than that, a court to refuse bail in particular circumstances.</P>
    <P>I accept that there are complexities involved and in particular the point might not be met by simply substituting the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; for &ldquo;may&rdquo;, but I think that the manner in which this amendment seeks to address the issue could give rise to considerable difficulties in practice.  Not the least of these would be the likely impossibility of making an assessment of the impact of the amendment on other elements of our custodial &mdash; non-custodial system, such as prison places, the Probation and Welfare Service, post-prison care, the courts and judges.  We would have to have an exactitude so that we could make the necessary plans for the implications of passing such a referendum.</P>
    <P>Where an amendment is open to both a restrictive and very liberal interpretation there is no way of judging with confidence how the courts are likely to apply it in practice.</P>
    <P>This brings me to the related difficulty of the use of the concept of indictable offences.  While the descriptions &ldquo;indictable offences&rdquo; and &ldquo;non-indictable offences&rdquo; might be reasonable legal shorthand to distinguish as a rule of thumb between serious and minor offences, drawing that distinction in a constitutional amendment could give rise to considerable difficulty both as a matter of law and practice.  Most offences that are created now are triable either way, on indictment or summarily, and it is not clear how these would be categorised under the proposed wording. The distinction between indictable and non-indictable can exist for historical reasons rather than reflect current realities.  We have to be mindful too that there is a vast range of indictable offences and often what might technically be an indictable offence could represent a relatively less serious form of crime.</P>
    <P>I think that many of us would take the view that we are not interested in bringing about a fundamental change in <Col N="267" /> the bail regime for offenders who do not represent a significant threat to the community and, broadly speaking, we want to go after those where there is a substantial risk of the commission of serious offences.  I am not satisfied that Deputy O'Donoghue's amendment would achieve that.</P>
    <P>The second part of the proposed amendment is incidental to the first and I do not propose to dwell on it other than to say it is, at the very least, ambiguous in that it is not clear whether what is at issue is that there should be a limit of 90 days in total on the period to be spent in custody on remand, or that a court can make any number of remands into custody once, on each occasion, they do not specify a period greater than 90 days.</P>
    <P>There are two further difficulties with the proposed amendment that are worth mentioning.  First, the amendment seeks to change Article 40 of the Constitution. This no doubt arises because it is essentially the rights conferred by that Article that gave rise to the O'Callaghan decision, but what the amendment seeks to do is regulate the manner in which the courts deal with persons charged with offences.  Article 38 of the Constitution deals with the &ldquo;Trial of Offences&rdquo; and, in those circumstances, an amendment dealing with bail might more properly be made to that Article. Arguably, not only has Deputy O'Donoghue brought forward his amendment at the wrong time &mdash; certainly too early &mdash; but he is putting it in the wrong place.</P>
    <P>Second, the amendment may be open to the interpretation that the only grounds for refusing bail would relate to the possibility of the commission of further offences.  If that were to be the case it would actually exclude the present grounds for refusing bail, namely, the likelihood that the accused will not turn up for trial or will interfere with witnesses.  I appreciate that this would not be the Deputy's intention but what we have to concern ourselves with is the actual wording of the amendment he has put forward.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="268" /> I hope it will be clear from what I have said that to proceed with Deputy O'Donoghue's amendment would be both untimely and unsafe.  I appreciate the Deputy's objective in bringing forward this Bill and I believe this House is not seriously divided on the issue of reforming our bail laws.</P>
    <P>There is one general point which it might be helpful to make.  As I indicated earlier, the Law Reform Commission mentioned that we are unusual, in international terms, in having failed to introduce comprehensive bail legislation in recent decades.  I suspect &mdash; and there is a former Minister for Justice here who might be able to clarify the position &mdash; one of the reasons is that successive Governments could see no significant advantage in introducing bail legislation in the constitutional context of the O'Callaghan decision.</P>
    <P>My Department is considering whether some combination of constitutional and legislative change would be the most effective way to proceed.  Such an approach might prove beneficial in dealing with the type of difficulties which arise with the amendment in the Bill before us and may allow me to bring about much needed change more effectively than a single action approach.</P>
    <P>I regard tackling the problems of our bail laws as a matter of priority.  There will be no undue delay, now that we have the commission's report, before I submit my proposals to Government.  I would seriously suggest that Deputy O'Donoghue should withdraw the Bill and allow time for this report to be fully considered.</P>
    <P>I understand Deputy O'Donoghue's objective in bringing forward this legislation but, on consideration, I hope he will see the need for this report to be studied so that together we can ensure that any changes we bring about in our Constitution or laws will be effective in dealing with the heart of the matter, that is to reduce and, if possible, remove the possibility of offenders committing offences while out on bail.  As I said, I have perceived no great division in this House on that point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised and disappointed that a Government which came to power on the platform of openness and transparency could show such expediency in publishing this report today.</P>
      <P>We are concerned that the law does not protect innocent victims.  People are traumatised in their homes, businesses and on the streets.  They would welcome any move to change the balance of justice in their favour.  They become frustrated when further offences are committed by habitual offenders or by people who are allowed out on bail. People want the scales of justice rebalanced so that innocent people do not continue to feel helpless and unprotected and to become the victims of crime.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Donoghue's Bill acknowledges the revolving door syndrome in prisons in that people are coming out of prisons before their time and becoming involved in crime.  It also acknowledges that our bail laws are inadequate and that while we must protect civil liberties, we can go only so far.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Minister to consider the Garda Síochána's call over the past number of months for action to be taken on the bail laws.  It is demoralising for the gardaí if criminals, whom they have pursued and brought for prosecution, are allowed back on the streets because they must then apprehend them again.  They want to know what will happen in this regard.  This leads to a loss of confidence in and respect for the law <Col N="273" /> and for those whose duty it is to implement it.  The public are also frustrated about this situation.  The Bill is trying to address this issue, to give people hope and to bring back their respect for our laws.</P>
    <P>It is interesting that the report does not recommend a referendum on bail. The Minister publicly acknowledged the necessity for such a referendum.  She had difficulties with other members of the Government because she did not consult the king.  Deputy O'Donoghue has afforded the Minister the opportunity to gather support in her party and in the Government for a referendum on the bail laws.</P>
    <P>Is there a contradiction in the report because it states that stringent bail laws will add to the accommodation problem in prisons?  While we accept that a person is innocent until proven guilty, convictions are obtained in a majority of cases brought before the courts.  If, as the Law Reform Commission states, these convictions are made more quickly than before, there will be a greater demand for prison spaces.  On the one hand, the report states that people should be brought before the courts more quickly but, on the other, it points out that prison spaces cost money.  The report cannot have it both ways.  If people are brought before the courts more quickly than before, then more demands will be made on the prison services.  This means more money must be provided for additional judges and backup services.</P>
    <P>It is important that we consider the rights of the accused as well as the rights of victims and potential victims, but this should never override the rights of the innocent person.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>We can all say with absolute sincerity that we are concerned about any legislation which restricts or curtails public freedom and the liberty we enjoy in this democracy.  However, it has been acknowledged by our spokesman, Deputy O'Donoghue, the leader of our party and our members throughout the country that the level of criminal <Col N="274" /> activity has reached crisis point and warrants a serious response.</P>
      <P>I do not envy the Minister for Justice her task in tackling the crime problem. I hope she will get the support of her Government colleagues in the pursuit of her aspiration to deal effectively with crime.  I do not think it is singularly the responsibility of a particular Minister but, at the same time, it is the specific responsibility of that Minister to forcefully and effectively communicate the extent of the crisis that prevails and ensure that the necessary responses will be forthcoming.  We have not seen much evidence of that in the last 12 months.</P>
      <P>Criminal activity now poses a greater threat to society and individuals than the Northern Ireland troubles prior to the peace process.  Dublin has been under considerable threat for years. That threat has grown out of all proportion and people are now so afraid for their personal safety that they will not engage in the ordinary recreational activity of walking the streets of Dublin in the late evening for fear of assault or attack.  This is the horrific position in which people find themselves.  The threat which has been present in Dublin for years is now casting a shadow over the rest of the country, particularly rural Ireland.  People are moving out of the cities in stolen cars, engaging in crime and robbing small shops, factories, filling stations, pubs and homes.  Every few days we hear of loss of life; there have been three or four killings in the last fortnight.</P>
      <P>This is an unacceptable level of criminal activity and this House should support anybody who is pursuing an assault on these people.  Deputy O'Donoghue must be commended for recognising that the gloves must be taken off where these people are concerned.  The last thing we want to do is sacrifice, for this generation or future generations, the enjoyment that liberty brings.  However, we cannot tolerate a situation that threatens society as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Fifteenth Amendment of the Constitution (No. 2) Bill is before the <Col N="275" /> House at the moment.  The circumstances which obtain in that context differ from those which apply to the need for a referendum on bail.  In the latter case, there is a public demand for changes in the bail laws which includes a demand from the gardaí and others working at the coal-face of the crisis. There is also a public intention to overwhelmingly support any such change in the Constitution.  Finally, any such change would be for the common good. These three basic essential prerequisites to a referendum are all evident, acknowledged and recognised.  They can be observed by every Member who experiences contact with the general public.  In this circumstance, however, we are not getting a referendum.</P>
    <P>I accept the Law Reform Commission's report.  The former Minister for Justice was wise to recognise its importance.  She commissioned it because there are essential elements which should be available to Government when it makes a final decision. However, there is an urgency which cannot be ignored.  The Minister made the point that previous Ministers for Justice did not engage in serious reform of the criminal code and that is true. The circumstances which obtained when I was Minister for Justice were different from the unfortunate circumstances which confront the current Minister.</P>

      <P>When I entered the House, there were 66,000 people unemployed; today the figure is almost 300,000.  The social impact of unemployment on homes and the people of this country can only be measured in the holocaustal crime problem that obtains at the moment.  When I came into this House 18 years ago there were no drug related difficulties such as those we experience today where 80 per cent of all crime committed is as a result of the <Col N="276" /> use and abuse of drugs.  The current circumstances warrant serious responses which were not required in the past.</P>
      <P>The Minister will not accept the legislation proposed by Deputy O'Donoghue and the numbers will ensure that. If that is the case, she should, as a matter of extreme and grave urgency, take the necessary steps to ensure that what has to be achieved will be achieved.  One simple method in the immediate future would be to ensure sanction for the high security, 150 cell prison in Castlerea.  It is almost 8.30 p.m. but I could not let the Minister go without this reminder.</P>

It is a crazy situation where convicted criminals are given temporary release or released on bail and it takes in excess of a year for them to come to trial.

As a northsider like myself, the Minister is fully aware of the seriousness of crime, not alone on the north side of the city but on a citywide basis, and of the public perception and the public concern in this regard.</P>
      <P>The Minister has indicated in the past her desire to have a referendum on bail. Here is an opportunity for her to grasp the nettle.  She has indicated that there will be no undue delay.

      <P>In the meantime, little action of any kind was taken to proceed with the proposal until such time as a local committee was established and a vigorous and well focused campaign was put in place in the area aimed at getting ministerial approval and sanction for the erection of a school in that area.</P>
      <P>However, it was not until two years ago that the current Minister for Education, Deputy Bhreathnach, responding to representations by the local voluntary committee and local public representatives, sent two officials from her Department to the area to assess the situation on the ground.  They spoke with parent groups and the voluntary committee, assessed the situation and reported to the Minister.  Their recommendation was that there was a clear need for such a school in the area and that the school should be proceeded with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is to the credit of the Minister that she gave her approval for the school and <Col N="279" /> sanction was given more than a year ago.  This was an enormous relief to the parents and students who, as matters stand, are compelled to leave their community every day to travel by bus to attend a range of schools outside the parish.  The commencement of the building is eagerly awaited.  Of late, some concern is emerging that the project may not now be proceeding as planned.  For that reason I tabled this matter this evening.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to answer two simple questions to clarify the issue and put it beyond speculation or confusion. First, will the Minister tell the House the commencement date for the construction of that school?  Second, will the Minister tell the House if provision will be made in the 1996 budget to enable the project to proceed and be completed within the time set out when approval was granted?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Deenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Minister, I want to respond to this Adjournment Debate.  On the basis of this reply, I feel there is no basis or reason for the Deputy's concern in this matter.</P>
      <P>In 1994 approval was given by the Department of Education for the provision of a community college in the Glanmire-Riverstown area of Cork to cater for 750 pupils and the County Cork Vocational Education Committee was authorised to employ a design team to plan the school.  Architectural planning is proceeding and funds have been made available this year in respect of design fees.  The project is at stage three of the planning process at present, i.e. developed sketch scheme stage.  The stage three documents are currently being examined by the Department's technical staff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Further stages of planning to be completed by the vocational education committee's design team include detail <Col N="280" /> design, the preparation of a bill of quantities and the invitation of tenders. When the tenders have been examined, the question of placing the contract for the building work will then arise.</P>
    <P>At this stage, it is not possible to indicate when the project will proceed to construction as this will depend on the availability of funding when the planning process has been fully completed and has reached tender stage.  Accordingly, the question of allowing the project to proceed to construction can only be considered in the context of the capital allocation for post-primary building purposes in 1996.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that while the financial resources available to the Department of Education for building purposes are limited, the demand for new and replacement accommodation in the post-primary sector has been, and will continue to be, very high.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, the Minister for Education is conscious of the urgent need for post-primary accommodation in the Glanmire-Riverstown area and I assure the House and the Deputy that every effort is being made by the County Cork Vocational Education Committee and the Department of Education to have the planning of the college completed as quickly as possible with a view to inviting tenders as soon as the necessary funding is available.</P>
      <P>I want to add that a standard size physical education hall was offered in line with the planning of the school and this is most welcome.  An application for an enlarged area was recently made by the vocational education committee to the sports section in the Department and is currently being considered.  This is something which I would favour.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I must voice strong protest at the fact that the Minister for Education has not deemed it appropriate to come before the House tonight to respond to the Adjournment Debate on both local and national education issues. Given the number of phone calls which I received today from schools, principals, parents, teachers and national organisations representing the various partners in education, it is absolutely disgraceful that in relation to this specific issue the Minister did not see fit to come here herself or at least ask one of the Ministers of State at the Department of Education to come before the House to respond to this issue.  It makes a mockery of the Adjournment Debate process.  This Minister has a track record of ignoring the procedures of the House, of ignoring the valid attempts by Members to articulate local and national issues.  The Minister has a responsibility to show more respect for this House, its various processes and mechanisms and its Members.  I ask the Minister of State to convey my strong protest and opposition to the Minister.</P>
      <P>I tabled the motion tonight in a constructive spirit.  I am of the view that the Minister for Education should convene talks with all the partners in education immediately to prepare an agreed long term plan which would facilitate the organisation and delivery of inservice courses in a harmonious and smooth manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Inservice training is essential for meaningful curriculum reform.  To facilitate the introduction of new leaving certificate syllabi inservice courses must be properly organised for teachers. However, in the context of the present row it is clear that the necessary preparations were not made in advance of this school year and full consultations <Col N="282" /> did not take place with all the Departments involved.</P>
    <P>Parents, principals and school managers are angry and extremely frustrated with the Minister's dictatorial approach while teachers are angry at the inefficient and incompetent way this issue was handled.  Above all, these partners in education find it very difficult to understand the Minister's public denials of any major disruptions in the schools or of any knowledge of students being told to stay away from school tomorrow and Friday.  I have received confirmation from numerous school principals that children were sent home from school last week and will be sent home tomorrow, Friday and next week and that the figure of 10,000 mentioned by Declan Duffy is by no means an exaggeration.  Today I received confirmation from schools in Cork city which to all intents and purposes will be closed on Thursday and Friday.  If this is the case in every county then it is clear that the figure of 10,000 is an underestimation.</P>
    <P>The Minister's public statements have only served to annoy people more.  For example, the TUI has categorically stated that at no stage did it agree with the Minister on her arrangements for these inservice courses while the National Parents' Council has stated that this was &ldquo;a disaster waiting to happen&rdquo;. In a statement issued today the Parents Association for Vocational Schools and Community Colleges complained that parents are not being listened to by the Department of Education despite the promises contained in the White Paper.</P>
    <P>This morning Declan Duffy, the general secretary of the Secretariat of Secondary Schools, confirmed that &ldquo;many students will be left doing very little in schools for the two days&rdquo;.  It is important that we be honest about this. Thousands of students will be sent home tomorrow, the remainder in school will be supervised and essentially six normal teaching days will be lost as a result of the organisation of these inservice <Col N="283" /> courses.  The Minister should not so easily dismiss the concerns of principals and school managers who are vital to the successful organisation of the education system.  The Minister should avail of this opportunity to articulate her faith in the principals and managers of secondary schools and her confidence in their judgment and competence.  They know what is happening on the ground and should be listened to.  If the Minister had contacted principals, parents and teachers she would not have been so dismissive of their views.</P>
    <P>It is generally agreed that the industrial relations environment in education is very poor.  The Minister has contributed to this climate by her failure to adopt a hands on approach to industrial relations in the education world.  She cannot rule by circular alone.  She must talk with people and win their agreement. The principle of partnership articulated in the White Paper has in reality been ignored by the Minister in her day to day handling of education matters.  She will have to change her approach and attitude so as to ensure a more harmonious industrial relations climate in the education world.  In the context of the inservice training issue she should immediately convene talks with all the partners and prepare an agreed long term plan to facilitate the efficient organisation of inservice training.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;it was decided to delay the introduction of new courses until the conclusion of the Programme for Competitiveness and Work negotiations or to introduce them in 1995.  In going ahead with their introduction the Minister for Education took account of the best interests of students and responded to a widespread public desire for such courses.  Consultations were held with management, teachers and parents and there was general support for the introduction of the new courses.</P>
      <P>The revised leaving certificate courses or syllabi are in Irish, accounting, French, German, Spanish and Italian. The inservice programme for the teachers concerned has already commenced and will involve approximately 7,000 teachers.  These teachers have been divided into three blocks with approximately 2,300 teachers participating in each of three separate sessions. This represents approximately 11 per cent of the total post-primary teaching force at each session.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The inservice courses are organised at local level by education centres so as to minimise disruption and facilitate the wishes of the school authorities as far as possible.  While most schools have their inservice courses spread over different sessions, some schools wish &mdash; this is their choice &mdash; to have all or most of their courses on one occasion.  This is a matter for individual school authorities which should be satisfied that they can cater for pupils when making such a choice.  It is recognised that there will be difficult circumstances in some cases and substitution will be provided in such cases.  To date the Department of Education has received 60 applications from <Col N="285" /> schools and has provided substitution assistance in 45 cases.  Comprehensive substitution for the present inservice training would be very costly &mdash; at more than £1 million it would cost more than the training itself.  Full substitution for inservice courses would also carry major implications for future inservice training programmes and important and necessary programmes would have to be significantly reduced as a result of high expenditure on substitution.</P>
    <P>In the case of the present inservice training the Minister believes it is important to stress that on average one in ten teachers will be absent for a two day period in the case of each of the three separate sessions to which I referred.  She is satisfied that the ability of schools to stagger attendance by teachers, with the short duration of the courses and the availability of substitution in difficult cases will minimise the need to send pupils home.  She also wishes to say that there are wide ranging and ongoing consultations with all the partners in education.  In the case of the revised syllabi, the Minister established a special implementation group which included representatives of unions, management, parents and the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment.  This group met on a number of occasions &mdash; it met before the commencement of the new school year &mdash; to consider the implications of the introduction of the revised syllabi this September.  The matter of inservice training for teachers was also considered at some length by this group.</P>
    <P>Ongoing consultations take place on a regular basis with the partners in education through a number of other mechanisms and there is ample opportunity for all to convey their point of view and discuss matters of concern.  Issues such as inservice training will also feature in the ongoing and complex Programme for Competitiveness and Work negotiations which will take some time to complete.  The Minister does not believe that it would have been in the best interests of students to delay change <Col N="286" /> pending the conclusion of these negotiations.</P>
    <P>The Minister wishes me to say that the inservice training schedule for the revised leaving certificate courses was put in place following consultation with the various management, union and parental interests.  The schedule should not cause undue disruption to schools and, in any event, I have indicated that substitution is available where schools encounter particular difficulties.  The consultation with the partners is an ongoing and regular feature of the business of the Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you for allowing me to ventilate this subject for the second time on the Adjournment. We on this side of the House feel that the Adjournment debates are not being treated by some Ministers in the fashion in which they should be.  I pay due regard to the Minister of State, Deputy Gilmore, who has for the second time come to hear what I have to say in this regard.  It is unfair of other Ministers, particularly the Minister for Education, not to come but to send somebody who is not even from the same Department or party in her place to answer questions addressed to her.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will give some of the background to this.  I raised the issue of bottom mussel fishing cultivation in Carlingford Lough some time ago and asked that the Minister consider granting an oral hearing regarding what I forecast would be grave difficulties between conflicting interests.  I was aware at the time of a number of applications for foreshore licences and the right to cultivate mussels and use the shore and the bottom <Col N="287" /> of the sea in the vicinity to cultivate mussels.  I told the Minister the only way this matter would be sorted out amicably and with some compromise was to have an oral hearing.  To give the Minister his due he recognised that but rejected the idea on the basis that there had been an oral hearing some years ago and that it was not necessary to go to the bother of rehashing it again.  My words have been prophetic and the Minister of State and his Department will acknowledge that there have been some unseemly happenings in the area regarding this issue since I raised it here in May.  The Minister might acknowledge in retrospect that his Department could have gone about this issue in a better way because the anxieties and fears of local people are heightened and there is unease and some nastiness in the atmosphere in the Carlingford Lough area.</P>
    <P>Since I raised this issue matters have moved on slightly and the fishermen were told in no uncertain terms by the Garda Síochána, who I accept were doing what they saw as their duty, that they could not use a particular area of the foreshore, an area which they and their families before them had used for years, on the basis that an individual who had previously applied for a licence had received it.  I was asked by a number of the people involved what was the position and I told them to ask the Garda Síochána to produce the licence. They went back to the Garda and I understand a licence was not produced. Matters progressed, the people were again told they were breaking the law but were not shown a licence.</P>
    <P>I decided to try to establish whether there was a licence.  With that in mind I tabled two parliamentary questions on 4 July asking how many licences were extant in the Carlingford Lough area.  I was told there were five holders of different types of licence but only one relating to mussels, and that related to another group which previously had a licence.  The person who had allegedly received a licence was not listed as one <Col N="288" /> of the licensees, although the Garda Síochána said there was a licence.  It was out of sheer frustration that I tabled a parliamentary question at the time.  I assured the people who contacted me that the individual in question had not got a licence and showed them the reply the Minister had given me on 4 July.  On 9 August an application for an interlocutory injunction was taken out in the High Court by the individual who purported to have the licence.  He made certain representations by way of affidavit and otherwise in the High Court where he said that in connection with the application for the injunction he had been granted a foreshore licence by the Department of the Marine on 16 June 1995.</P>
    <P>I tabled this motion out of sheer frustration because on the one hand I was told by the Minister on 4 July that a licence had not issued to this person; yet on 9 August this person said that on 16 June he had been granted a licence by the Department.  Both stories cannot be correct.  Either the Minister's response was incorrect or what was said in the High Court was incorrect.  It transpired that what was given was a letter from the Department that it had agreed in principle to grant a licence but that the conditions of the licence had yet to be decided.  A licence, signed by the Minister, was not given by the Department until much later, well into August.  Perhaps the Minister of State will acknowledge this.  I accept I have to be careful about this, but in effect the application in the High Court for an injunction based on the supposed granting of a licence on 16 June was incorrect, as were representations made to my constituents by the Garda Síochána, in that there was no licence in existence, only a letter from the Department.</P>
    <P>This is a very important issue for my constituents because they were dragged through the High Court and had to go to the expense of submitting affidavits etc. in order to fight this.  However, leaving all that aside, I again implore the Minister of State and his Department to act in an even-handed manner.  There is <Col N="289" /> no doubt that this has been handled in a ham-fisted manner in that one applicant has been granted a licence while a number of other small mussel fishermen have still not received licences for areas where they feel they have succession or squatters rights to fish.  In May last I made certain statements about being careful.  I do not wish to be in any way alarmist but I implore the Minister of State and his Department to be even-handed in their treatment of this problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. Gilmore) Eamon Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. Gilmore)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have this opportunity to clear up any misunderstanding that may have arisen in respect of the response given to the House on 4 July 1995 in reply to parliamentary questions tabled by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>The discrepancy referred to in the Deputy's question arises from a statement made in certain correspondence from a firm of solicitors, a copy of which the Deputy kindly furnished to the Department.  The correspondence in question dated 10 August 1995 from a firm of solicitors acting on behalf of a then licensed shellfish operator, Alex McCarthy Shellfish, referred to &ldquo;a licence granted by the Department of the Marine on the 16th day of June 1995&rdquo;.  The Deputy raised a number of issues in Parliamentary Questions Nos. 153 and 154 and, in particular, details of the current holders of aquaculture and foreshore licences permitting bottom shellfish culture in a specified area of Carlingford Lough.  Alex McCarthy Shellfish was not one of the five licensees listed in the reply to the House.  As of 4 July 1995 no licences had been granted to that company.  The misunderstanding possibly arises due to the fact that on 16 June 1995 the Department of the Marine advised Mr. McCarthy by letter that ministerial approval had been granted to license his mussel cultivation project at Carlingford Lough and that the licences were being drawn up for issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="290" /> Discussions between the company and the Department regarding the terms of the licence and, specifically the area to be licensed, delayed acceptance of licence offers.  On 20 July 1995 the company confirmed acceptance to the Department of the map delineating the area approved for licensing and the licences were subsequently signed and issued on 3 August 1995.</P>
    <P>It may also be of assistance to the Deputy and the House if I explain the process in relation to licensing of aquaculture developments on State foreshore. From all relevant technical and scientific perspectives all aquaculture licensing proposals are assessed by the Department's Aquaculture Licence Vetting Committee, a multidisciplinary group comprised of technical and scientific experts from within the Department and a representative of the Central Fisheries Board.  Representations or objections on aqauculture development projects are invited through a public consultative process, which includes advertisement in the press, and consultation with the local authority as well as other relevant bodies such as the wildlife service of the Office of Public Works, Bord Fáilte, FORFÁS, the local regional fisheries board, the Department of the Environment and the Commissioners of Irish Lights.  The objective is to secure the broadest possible range of views on aquaculture development prior to decisions on licensing proposals.</P>
    <P>The position in relation to this case is that the company concerned applied to the Department in May 1994 for licences to cultivate mussels using bottom culture techniques in Carlingford Lough having undertaken a survey of the intended cultivation area.  The application was assessed by the Department's ALVC from all technical, scientific and other perspectives to determine the suitability of the development proposal. The committee recommended that the development proposal proceed to the public notice stage.  The proposal was advertised on 16 March 1995 in the <i>Irish Press</i> and on 18 March 1995 in the <i>Dundalk Democrat</i> and plans were <Col N="291" /> made available for public scrutiny at Carlingford Garda Station.  Objections were lodged with the Department from Carlingford Lough Shellfish Co-Operative Society Limited within the statutory 21 day period.  These objections were carefully considered by the ALVC which recommended in favour of licensing. Having regard to the recommendation of the ALVC and the outcome of the licensing assessment process, I approved the issue of an acquaculture and foreshore licence in this case.</P>
    <P>Prior to the decision being taken on licensing the applicant's proposal, the Department sought legal advice from the Attorney General's office as to the feasibility of licensing aquaculture operations in the area in question under the Fisheries and Foreshore Acts to an individual person or company having regard to the possible status of the area as a public fishery.  The Attorney General's office conveyed a positive legal opinion on the matter.  The notification of licence approvals by the Department <Col N="292" /> and the acceptance and subsequent issue of licences has been detailed in my earlier remarks.</P>
    <P>The House should be aware that an appeal has been lodged against the licensing decision in this case.  Section 54 of the Fisheries Act, 1980 provides that any person who is aggrieved by a ministerial decision for a licence may appeal such a decision through an arbitration process and the arbitrator may on such appeal confirm the decision with or without modification or reverse the decision.</P>
    <P>Solicitors acting on behalf of a group named as the North Commons Shellfish Group have served such a notice of appeal against the decision to grant a licence to the company concerned. Arrangements are being finalised to appoint an arbitrator in accordance with the provisions of section 44 of the Fisheries Act, 1980.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.5 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 28 September 1994.</P>

      <P>Since I last answered the Deputy in April of this year, the Work Programme of NESC has been developed in the light of the requests which I have made and the Council's own discussions since the nomination of a new Council in May.  The Council's work programme is now as follows:</P>
      <P>(1)  Phase II of the Council's work on output and employment: <i>Employment and Enterprise in the Irish Economy.</i> This comprises three studies:</P>
      <P>(i) Ireland's Investment Performance;</P>

      <P>(iii) Competitive Advantage and Clusters in the Irish Economy: A Study of Selected Manufacturing and Service Activities.</P>
      <P>Consultants' reports on these subjects will be received by the Council in December 1995, March 1996 and June 1996 and the Council will publish policy recommendations during 1996.</P>
      <P>(2) <i>Challenges for the European Union: Cohesion, Competitiveness and Enlargement.</i></P>
      <P>This is currently being undertaken by the Council and is set to be completed by the end of 1995.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="103" /> (3) <i>Socio-Demographic Trends: Implications for Social Policy.</i></P>

    <P>(4) <i>Economic and Social Strategy for the 21st Century.</i></P>
    <P>This will be the main item on the council's agenda during 1996.</P>
    <P>Having completed these projects, the Council will consider undertaking work on two further topics:</P>
    <P>(5) <i>The Island Economy.</i></P>
    <P>(6) <i>Developing the Consensus Approach to Policy-Making and Implementation.</i></P>
    <P>Further details of each of these projects are contained in the document on the Work Programme which I have had laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The most recent publication by the Council was <i>New Approaches to Rural Development</i> Report No. 97.  This report was completed by the Council in November 1994 and launched publicly in February 1995.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like to confirm that, as I promised the Deputy last April, I have conveyed to NESC his comments as regards the need for the implications for Ireland of Economic and Monetary Union to be fully examined.  I understand that the new Council has reformulated its approach to study number 2 which I have mentioned <i>Challenges for European Union: Cohesion Competitiveness and Enlargement</i> so as to ensure this matter is comprehensively dealt with.</P>

      <P>A number of meetings have been held and a draft report has now been prepared.</P>
      <P>Members of the Interdepartmental Co-ordinating Committee on Island Development will meet with representatives of Comhdháil Oileánn na hÉireann later this week as part of the ongoing consultative process involved in drawing up the report.  Comhdháil will have the opportunity to make a verbal presentation to the committee and to discuss with committee members further details of the key issues affecting the island communities that they represent.</P>
      <P>The committee's report shall be completed by the end of October and will then be presented to Government.</P>
      <P>I should add that, in my capacity as Chairperson of the Interdepartmental Co-ordinating Committee on Island Development I recently met Ms Wulf Mathies, the European Union's Commissioner for Regional Affairs.  The meeting was constructive and informative and discussions on island access and island development strategies took place which will be reflected in the report.</P>

      <P>The Government task force report which examined the conclusions and recommendations of the report <i>A Crusade for Suvival</i> was published in April 1994.  The task force <Col N="105" /> report made a large number of recommendations regarding policy issues affecting the west of Ireland.  The report's recommendations covered sectoral policy issues such as agricultural and rural development, manufacturing industry and tourism.  Institutional issues were also addressed.</P>
      <P>A key recommendation of the task force report was the establishment of the Western Development Partnership Board.  Membership of the board reflects the broad economic and social base of the regions.  The strategic focus of the board is to provide direction to the activities of the various public agencies and community based organisations involved in economic and social development throughout the region.</P>
      <P>The partnership board has undertaken an ambitious research programme in preparing an action plan for the region.  The action plan will be finalised by the end of October and will be presented to Government for consideration.</P>
      <P>It is clear that if the problems facing this region are to be tackled effectively, local communities must accept the challenge and identify a path that will sustain them.  Central Government must of course be supportive in assisting the development of a plan of action.  The importance of finding sustainable solutions based on a &ldquo;bottom-up&rdquo; approach coupled with a &ldquo;top-down&rdquo; commitment should not be underestimated. The Western Development Partnership Board's forthcoming action plan will be evidence of a co-ordinated approach between local representation and central Government.</P>

These have been allocated in full to county councils on as equitable a basis as possible.  The administration of the scheme is devolved to county councils and details of waiting lists in individual counties are not available in my Department.  The extent of such lists can be influenced by the different practices adopted in different counties and is not, necessarily, an objective measure of relative need.</P>

      <P>The disabled persons grant scheme is administered by local authorities and, consequently, information on the processing of individual applications by local authorities is not available in my Department.  However, a survey of the operation of the scheme, carried out by my Department in 1994, found that local authorities generally were providing a reasonably satisfactory service in terms of processing applications, the level of grant aid, and discharging payment claims.  Issues arising from the survey, including delays in processing applications in some areas, were taken up with the individual authorities concerned. I now intend to seek additional information from local authorities in regard to their activity under the scheme in the current year.</P>

      <P>National reports on the quality of waters are now to be published by the Environmental Protection Agency. Pending the publication by the agency later this year of a report for the period 1991 to 1994, the latest national overview is to be found in <i>Water Quality in Ireland, 1987-1990,</i> published by the Environmental Research Unit in 1992. That report reviewed data generated <Col N="108" /> mainly by local authorities and the ERU and, <i>inter alia</i>, gives details on the condition of 172 lakes.  A copy of this report is available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
      <P>Under section 65 of the Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1992, the Environmental Protection Agency is required to prepare programmes for monitoring the quality of the environment, including lakes.  To this end the agency has drawn up a draft lake water quality monitoring programme which will be discussed with local authorities and other relevant bodies prior to finalisation. It is envisaged that this monitoring programme will make use, <i>inter alia</i>, of remote sensing techniques which have already been employed by the Environmental Protection Agency to monitor the water quality of lakes.</P>

      <P>A submission has recently been received from Waterford Corporation regarding improvement works to non-national roads in their area, including the roads referred to in the question.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 58 and 82 together.  The replies given by my colleagues, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry and the Minister for Enterprise and Employment to Questions Nos. 20 and 172 on 20 June last explain that Government approval of the Forbairt investment in this plant was sought and granted on 15 December 1994 subject to a number of conditions, including conditions relating to necessary planning permission and environmental licences.  Such conditions are standard in Forbairt grant agreements. My Department was not involved in consultations in regard to this decision.  In this context, I should explain that I have no function in relation to individual applications for planning permission or environmental licences; these are entirely a matter for the planning authority, An Bord Pleanála and the Environmental Protection Agency.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 59, 114 and 116 together.  I propose to circulate in the Official Report a tabular statement listing water supply proposals from Dublin Corporation which are currently with my Department.</P>
      <P>My Department has commissioned a major study of water requirements in the Dublin region.  The objective of the study, which is being undertaken with Cohesion Fund assistance, is to provide the strategic framework for investment in, and management of, water services in the region over the next ten years. This will include an examination of the extent to which conservation and demand management measures generally can contribute to meeting the region's water demands.  The strategy study will be substantially completed by early 1996, pending which new major water supply proposals for the Dublin region are being held in abeyance by my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware of the difficulties in relation to water supply which are being experienced in Dublin.  These difficulties are already being addressed on a number of fronts, including a major expansion and refurbishment project at the Leixlip water treatment plant now in progress which will increase the plant's treatment capacity from 22 to 38 million <Col N="115" /> gallons per day at an estimated cost of some £17.5 million.  This improvement will particularly benefit Dublin's north-side; the increase in water supply achieved this summer already assisted problems in this area.  A major improvement of the Dún Laoghaire water system is being carried out at an estimated overall cost of some £30 million.  In addition, a refurbishment programme for Dublin Corporations's Vartry water treatment plant is intended to secure good quality supply from this plant.</P>
    <P>As regards waste water infrastructure, significant improvements have taken place in recent years through the connection of the Dún Laoghaire outfall to the Ringsend treatment plant.  A further stage of this scheme is now in progress which will link Dalkey and other areas of Dún Laoghaire to the Dún Laoghaire outfall.  The major requirements in relation to Dublin waste water are the provision of improved treatment of sewage at Ringsend and the provision of an environmentally sound alternative to marine disposal of sewage sludge.  Planning for these requirements has been progressing with Cohesion Fund assistance and is now well advanced.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 63 and 66 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware of concerns which have been expressed about the extent to which urban renewal benefits inner city communities.  I take the view that the economic and social benefits of urban renewal must benefit all of our urban populations, particularly those who are unemployed or disadvantaged.  There have been some successes in providing <Col N="118" /> local job opportunities, job placements resulting from community employment, and special training and development programmes in association with various urban renewal initiatives.  We can do more in this area by adopting more effective approaches to local employment and enterprise generation and through ensuring that local authorities work closely with bodies such as the enterprise boards and area based partnerships on the various urban renewal and local development initiatives which are under way.  It is my intention to explore every possible avenue of ensuring that urban renewal benefits as wide a cross-section of inner city populations as possible.</P>

      <P>I do not propose, at this stage, to provide for the use of speed limits of less than 30 mph which is the standard built-up area limit.  International experience indicates that such lower limits, applied in isolation, do not have any significant impact on vehicle speeds. Accordingly, where road authorities wish to restrict vehicles to a speed lower than 30 mph, they should first utilise appropriate traffic calming measures under section 38 of the Road Traffic Act, 1994.  The use of the lower speed limits can be further considered in the light of experience with the use of such measures.</P>

I should point out, of course, that tourism development, as a general rule, is subject to the normal planning permission requirements; in dealing with applications relating to such development, the planning authority is obliged to have regard to the proper planning and development of the area and, in effect, to take environmental issues into account.</P>

      <P>In line with Government commitments, I am currently preparing a national sustainable development strategy, which will address all areas of Government policy which impact on the environment.  The strategy will have the purpose of integrating national environmental and socio-economic objectives more fully to improve the quality of life, while conserving the natural resources upon which development ultimately depends.</P>
      <P>As part of the process of developing this strategy, I published last June <i>Moving Towards Sustainability</i>, a review of recent environmental policy and developments. This document identifies the extent to which environmental integration, which has been a policy of successive Governments, is already being pursued by economic sectors and relevant Government Departments.  It also illustrates the need for further policy development, which I am undertaking in the preparation of the national strategy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The objective of integrating environmental considerations into all relevant <Col N="123" /> policy areas also continues to be progressed through the formation of environmental units in Government Departments as well as in State agencies. In 1994, my Department established a green network of Government Departments as a focus and support for these units, and a forum for stimulating new initiatives.</P>
    <P>I am, in addition, giving priority to environmental integration at local government level.  I have published <i>Local Authorities and Sustainable Development &mdash; Guidelines on Local Agenda 21</i> to encourage local authorities to bring forward their own initiatives to integrate environmental considerations into their policies, plans and programmes in the interests of sustainable development regionally and locally.</P>

      <P>The recently completed third and final report of the Irish Sea Science Co-ordination Group proposes a set of studies and other measures that will help to fill important gaps in scientific knowledge of the Irish Sea and form the basis of a more structured, integrated and collaborative science programme. The report is the subject of consultations between relevant Irish and UK Departments and agencies, including my Department and the Department of Marine, with a view to identifying projects which might be undertaken on a co-ordinated basis or incorporated in the individual research programmes of the bodies concerned.</P>
      <P>Departments here and in the UK are also liaising on the preparation of a quality status report on the Irish Sea as part of a broader initiative involving the preparation of such assessments for the entire maritime area covered by the OSPAR Convention.  The convention area has been divided into five subregions for this purpose.  Ireland and the UK have been assigned responsibility for one of these (Region 111), known as the Celtic Seas which covers the Irish Sea and the other marine waters around our coasts, including the area to the west of Scotland.  Work is expected to commence on the Region 111 report early in 1996.  The question of a conference on the Irish Sea will be pursued in the context of these developments.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the practice of granting a wear and tear allowance in computing rental income assessable under Case V of Schedule D is a concessional one.  In the case of expenditure incurred on the purchase of furnishings, fixtures and fittings on or after 6 April, 1992, the following rates of wear and tear are granted: 15 per cent of the cost of the item on a straight line basis (years 1 to 6) and 10 per cent of the cost in year 7. Expenditure incurred on the purchase of furnishings, fixtures and fittings prior to 6 April 1992, is written-off as follows: 10 per cent of the cost of the item on a reducing balance basis each year.</P>
      <P>This practice has now been in operation for several years and claims for wear and tear are submitted on this basis for the majority of rental income cases.  In exceptional cases where the taxpayer has not made a claim on the above basis or where she-he has not given details of the expenditure incurred a deduction of one twelfth of the gross rental income (subject to a maximum of £200) is concessionally given to cover wear and tear.  There are no proposals to change this figure as the taxpayer already has the option, as outlined above, of claiming wear and tear allowances based on his-her expenditure.</P>

      <P>I assume that the Deputy is referring to <Col N="131" /> the benefits arising for qualifying disabled passengers under the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations, 1994.</P>
      <P>The Regulations govern the various motoring tax reliefs available to qualifying disabled drivers and passengers. Drivers or passengers who qualify on medical grounds and satisfy the other non-medical criteria associated with the scheme, are entitled to significant tax concessions on acquisition and necessary adaptation of a vehicle for their use.  The scheme focuses on those disabled persons whose physical disabilities cause them severe mobility problems.</P>
      <P>In order to qualify for the benefits arising under the scheme, including the free tax disc and repayment of excise duty on fuel, all vehicles must be specially constructed or adapted; in the case of the qualifying disabled passengers, the Regulations require that the VAT free cost of the vehicle adaptations must amount to at least 20 per cent of the pre-tax cost of the vehicle.</P>
      <P>I don't regard it as unreasonable to require a certain level of vehicle adaptation as a qualifying criteria for the scheme.  The tax concessions obtainable for qualifying individuals are substantial, full remission or repayment of VAT and Vehicle Registration Tax (VRT) up to a maximum of £12,500, relief from excise duty on fuel up to 600 gallons per annum and free car tax.  I am sensitive to the needs of the disabled community but given limited tax resources it will always be necessary to include criteria in the scheme to ensure that the benefit goes to those most in need.  I might add that the adaptation requirement was reduced from 30 per cent to its current level in the Finance Act, 1991.</P>

    <P>The Government's Programme for Renewal states that the method of taxing unemployment benefit would be restructured in order to improve the position of those most adversely affected.  This commitment is being met, in the first instance, by the income tax and PRSI improvements implemented this year aimed at reducing the tax and PRSI burden on the low paid generally. In addition, a number of targeted measures were introduced in the 1995 Finance Act.  Child dependent additions payable with Unemployment benefit are now exempt from income tax as is the first £10 per week of unemployment <Col N="133" /> benefit.  These changes came into effect on 6 April 1995.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="135" /> The operation and funding of the library service is a matter for the individual local authorities concerned. However, my Department operates a scheme to fund certain capital works in the library sector.  Over the last ten years, expenditure under this scheme has amounted to some £20 million.  This includes a once-off allocation of almost £2 million in 1994 for the replenishment of bookstock nationwide.  £3 million has been allocated for capital expenditure on library projects in 1995.</P>
    <P>While I regard this library service as an important one, it would not be appropriate for me to give directions to local authorities as to the priority which should be given to it, relative to other local services, in the allocation of staffing, financial and other resources.  Local authorities will have an opportunity to address such issues in preparing library development programmes under the Local Government Act, 1994.  My Department has recently issued guidelines to local authorities to assist them in the preparation of these programmes.</P>

      <P>Existing EU policy has been to stabilise the level of carbon dioxide emissions at their 1990 level by the year 2000 in the Union as a whole.  Within this policy, which acknowledges the need of some member states for ongoing growth in energy demand in line with economic development requirements, Ireland is committed to limiting the growth in its CO2 emissions to 20 per cent over their 1990 level by the year 2000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The EU position regarding limitation and reduction of CO2 emissions in the post 2000 period is being considered in <Col N="144" /> the context of wider international negotiations now under way, in accordance with the Berlin mandate, on the strengthening of the commitments of the Climate change Convention. Ireland's objectives for the limitation of CO2 emissions in the post 2000 period will be determined as part of these EU discussions.</P>
    <P>The EU and broader international negotiations now in progress on the strengthening of the Climate Convention commitments will take into account both the new report of the InterGovernmental panel on Climate Change and proposals by some parties to the Convention for CO2 reduction targets in the post 2000 period.</P>
    <P>Discussion of proposals for carbon/energy taxation are at present continuing at EU Council level.  Ireland is participating in these discussions on the basis of the commitment in the Programme for Government to contribute to the preparation of a pan-European taxation policy on carbon and fossil fuel inputs.</P>

      <P>I have no proposals to make specific resources available. However, information on general safety measures including road safety and cycling skills is disseminated to the schools by regional representatives of <Col N="147" /> the National Safety Council who have the primary responsibility in this area.</P>
      <P>I agree that the encouragement of safe cycling is an important matter for schools and this subject along with general safety education is dealt with under civics in the primary school curriculum. Teachers are encouraged to deal with this topic by both discussion and demonstration sessions, utilising visual-aids such as film strips and charts where appropriate.  Charts can be provided by the Department of the Environment and other interest groups.  Similarly in the case of second-level schools, such topics can be dealt with on the civics course, which is compulsory for all junior cycle pupils.</P>
      <P>A practical approach to road safety education often includes enlisting the help of the local garda with a view to stimulating interest in the rules of the road.  Additionally, project work can be carried out by the students to identify and account for local &ldquo;black spots&rdquo; and hazards.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 143 and 144 together.  My Department is very conscious of the need to have matters relating to the staffing of individual schools finalised well in advance of the reopening of schools after the summer holidays so as to ensure a smooth resumption of normal school activity.  To this end, applications for the allocation of additional part-time hours are processed and decisions conveyed to the schools concerned with the minimum of delay.</P>
      <P>In the current school year applications in relation to part-time hours had to be considered in the light of the Government's decision that increases in public expenditure, including those in the education sector, must be contained. Accordingly, it was not possible to finalise the part-time hours allocation for the school in question until later than would normally be the case.</P>
      <P>I should add that the authorities of the school in question have submitted an appeal for an increased allocation. My Department is considering the matter in the context of available resources and a decision will be conveyed to the school authorities as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>In relation to the salary of the teacher in question, the distribution among individual part-time teachers of the hours allocated by my Department is a matter for the school authorities.  My Department's funding is, of course, restricted to the level of part-time hours approved.</P>

      <P>The recreational facilities scheme assists voluntary community organisations in the provision of and improvements to recreational, leisure and community facilities.  Grants under this scheme are paid in instalments during construction or in full when projects are completed and when grantee organisations have met the specified conditions.</P>
      <P>In 1994 £4 million was provided for this scheme and £0.350 million of this allocation was required to meet payments on projects where grants were allocated in 1993 and in previous years and where claims for payment were expected to arise in 1994.  The balance of £3.650 million was available for allocation to new projects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over 1,400 applications were received under the scheme in March 1994 in response to the public advertisement which sought applications and which <Col N="155" /> specified the criteria for selection of projects.  In view of the large number of applications and the amount of work involved in assessing these applications in accordance with the criteria, it was not possible to make the final selection of projects until August 1994.  A total of 568 projects were assisted at an average grant of £6,000 approximately.</P>
    <P>As the allocations under the scheme were not made until August 1994 many organisations were not in a position to claim payment in 1994 and consequently, expenditure in 1994 from the £4 million provided amounted to £0.663 million.  Therefore, outstanding commitments at January 1995 amounted to £3.3 million in respect of projects approved in 1994.</P>
    <P>A feature of this scheme over the years has been that not all organisations claim the grant in the year of allocation and it is not always possible to accurately determine the number of projects which will claim grants in a particular year.  Accordingly, £2 million was provided for the scheme in the 1995 Estimates on the basis of the expected pattern of expenditure on these projects.</P>
    <P>The present position is that, in addition to the £2 million which will be expended in 1995, £1.3 million is already committed from the total 1996 allocation &mdash; which has yet to be decided in the context of the Estimates.  It is intended that further new projects will be selected later this year in accordance with the criteria adopted in 1994 and on the basis that expenditure arising on these new projects can be met in 1996 and in subsequent years.</P>

      <P>The legislation dealing with the censorship of publications is set out in the Censorship of Publications Acts, 1929 to 1967. The statutory position in relation to the issue of a permit for the importation of prohibited publications is set out in section 19 of the Censorship of Publications Act, 1946.</P>
      <P>The policy of successive Ministers for Justice has been to grant permits only in exceptional circumstances where the applicant has established that there is a specific justification for allowing him or her to import a particular publication.  A permit is then granted on condition that the said publication is for the personal use of the permit holder and will not be subsequently offered for sale.</P>
      <P>Since 1970, there have been 100 applications for permits under section 19 of the 1946 Act, 34 of which were granted, 59 were refused and seven of which were not followed up by the applicant. My Department's records indicate that in general where the application was refused, the applicant was informed that it was considered that the reasons advanced did not justify the issue of a permit.</P>
      <P>The legislation dealing with the censorship of video recordings is contained in the Video Recordings Acts, 1989 to 1992.  Section 16 (3) of the Video Recordings Act, 1989 provides that the Minister may, subject to certain conditions, grant a permit authorising a specified person to import a specified number of video recordings containing a specified video work in respect of which a prohibition order is in force. Only one application for such a permit has been received in my Department and a decision on this application is pending at the moment.</P>
      <P>The legislation dealing with the censorship of films is the Censorship of Films Acts, 1923 to 1992.  This legislation, which prohibits the screening in public of prohibited films, contains no provision for the Minister to grant a permit to import prohibited films.</P>

      <P>The free travel scheme provides passholders with free travel on all the main bus, train and ferry services in the State, including services provided by 46 private transport companies.</P>
      <P>Free travel is available on the ferry services between the Aran Islands and the mainland &mdash; Galway, Rossaveal and Doolin &mdash; between the islands of Sherkin and Cape Clear and the mainland &mdash; Baltimore and Schull &mdash; between Inish-boffin and Cleggan and between Arranmore and Burtonport.  Some of these ferry services are seasonal only.</P>
      <P>Whenever new bus, train and ferry services are introduced, they are included in the scheme provided suitable arrangements can be made with the transport company concerned.</P>

      <P>There are no official published figures available for job losses.  However, unofficial data available from the State agencies relating to grant aided companies shows that approximately 1,730 jobs were lost in the Ballyfermot, Dublin 10 area since 1988.  It should be noted, however, that IDA-Forbairt data shows that approximately 1,785 jobs were created in the area over the same period.  I also point out that the number of people on the live register has remained relatively constant in the area and official figures show that the numbers actually decreased from 4,003 to 3,871 between August 1992 and August 1995.</P>
      <P>Recognising the scale of the importance of the Dublin region and its large share of the national employment in the manufacturing and international service sectors, Forbairt recently established a regional office for Dublin.  As part of this development, Forbairt has appointed an area manager whose specific responsibility includes Ballyfermot.</P>
      <P>This office is currently engaged in developing a five year development strategy to address, in so far as it falls within Forbairt's remit, the employment creation needs of the region.  Local interest groups both community and business have been invited to participate in this process.</P>

      <P>Bovine disease levies are paid in respect of all bovine animals slaughtered or exported live from the State and on all milk received for processing.  The only herdowners, therefore, who do not pay levies are non-dairy herdowners who neither deliver animals for slaughter nor export them live from the State.  It is not possible to quantify the number of such herdowners.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 165, 167 and 168 together.  The monthly APT (reactors per thousand tests) on a Country basis for 1995 to date is shown in the following table.  The level of bovine tuberculosis in Ireland is low with over 99 per cent of the 7 million animals in the <Col N="164" /> national herd clear of the disease.  The remaining incidence is essentially residual infection.  Ireland's trading position is not dictated by the APT measure.  This country fully meets EU and third country trading requirements for exports of livestock and livestock products.  Discussions are currently taking place with the farming organisations on revised arrangements for the scheme for 1996 and these discussions include <i>inter alia</i> decentralisation of responsibility for aspects of the scheme.  The European Commission have been advised of the proposal and are favourably disposed to approaches which seek to increase efficiency in all aspects of disease eradication programmes.</P>

      <P>The brucellosis eradication programme has been successful in reducing the disease to a very low level and the country has an <Col N="165" /> officially brucellosis free status at present.  The disease incidence is almost negligible with over 99.9 per cent of herds being clear of the disease.  The fol <Col N="166" /> lowing table shows the number of herds restricted on a county basis for each month for 1995 to date.</P>

    <P>Over the past few months my officials and I have made strong representations to Commissioner Fischler and the Commission Services for the introduction of some mechanism to alleviate the situation. At the meeting of the Agriculture Council in June I secured a commitment from the Commission to introduce market management measures to alleviate the current difficulties in the market and, in light of the result of the measures, to consider whether further action is necessary, in particular, as regards the possibility of an upward adjustment in the level of the ewe premium and an acceleration of its payment. The Commission introduced a private storage aid scheme in Ireland in <Col N="168" /> July in fulfilment of this undertaking and the scheme provided additional support for the market.</P>
    <P>I raised the matter again at this week's meeting of the Agriculture Council, where I sought additional assistance for the Irish sheepmeat sector. The proposals which I put to the Commissioner included a top-up premium for member states with low prices and the extension of the rural world premium to non-disadvantaged areas in member states with low prices.  I intend to persist with my efforts to bring this matter to a successful conclusion.</P>

    <P>After a slowish start, I am delighted to say that the uptake of REPS has increased significantly.  By the end of this year I would anticipate that well over 8,000 farmers will have joined REPS.</P>

      <P>The Government has used, and continues to use, every opportunity at all appropriate international fora, in particular at the European Union level and the Paris Commission, as well as direct representations to the United Kingdom Government, to highlight its concerns about Sellafield and to object to THORP's commissioning.  The Ministerial Committee on Sellafield and the Irish Sea was set up by the Government to progress the commitments in the Government's policy agreement, <i>A Government of Renewal,</i> including the question of seeking arbitration under the Paris Convention in relation to THORP.  The committee is continuing to examine all possible avenues remaining open to the Government to remove the serious threat posed by the UK nuclear industry. This is the first comprehensive initiative taken by any Government to date to address the threats caused by Sellafield and other nuclear installations and it illustrates the Government's serious intent to pursue all realistic and effective courses of action to safeguard the Irish people.</P>

      <Quest>if he will outline the Government's policy regarding allegations of the passage of ships carrying nuclear weaponry through the Irish Sea.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>I share fully the Deputy's concerns in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My concerns with allegations of the movement of nuclear warheads through the Irish Sea are threefold.  The transport of such materials through the Irish Sea which is a narrow, semi-enclosed sea with densely populated areas in its environs, poses a serious threat to the safety of people living in these areas and to the marine environment generally. The extent and nature of the risks posed by such transport demand advance notification of the transiting of ships carrying nuclear warheads or other hazardous materials so that &ldquo;early warning&rdquo; systems can be put in place to deal with possible marine emergencies in the event of an accident or collision.  The <Col N="173" /> increasing traffic in the Irish Sea shipping lane is also a concern because of the increased possibility of accidents.</P>
    <P>It is a firm objective of Government policy to bring about a situation wherby it will no longer be possible for nuclear weapons and nuclear materials to be transported through the Irish Sea.  The Government is pursuing this objective through all available avenues.  It will be appreciated that these matters are regulated by international conventions and in order to achieve our objective we need to get the support of other Contracting Parties to those Conventions.</P>
    <P>On the specific matter of the transportation of nuclear weapons we have taken a very strong line.  We have written to the UK authorities informing them that the recent reports on the movement of nuclear weapons by the military through the Irish Sea are a matter of serious public concern in Ireland and that such movements present difficulties for the Irish Government.</P>
    <P>The initial response from the UK is that they no longer deploy nuclear weapons on board Her Majesty's ships but that such weapons may be transported by sea.  They further state that shipments do not take place outside UK territorial waters, that safety is of paramount importance wherever nuclear weapons are concerned and that it is long standing policy of UK Government neither to confirm nor deny the presence of nuclear weapons at particular times and locations.</P>
    <P>Warships, naval auxiliaries or other ships owned and operated by a State and used solely on that State's non-commercial service are normally exempt from international conventions regulating marine transport, maritime safety and protection of the marine environment.  However, contracting States to those conventions are asked to ensure that exempted ships act in a manner consistent, as far as is reasonable and practicable, with the international conventions.</P>
    <P>Under existing international law warships have a right of innocent passage <Col N="174" /> without notification through the territorial waters of any State.  Entry of foreign warships into Irish ports is a matter for the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Pending enactment of future international law it is Government policy to refuse entry if the vessel is carrying nuclear weapons or the visit is part of a naval exercise.</P>
    <P>As regards non-military nuclear materials, concerns of small island developing States and other coastal states world wide, with regard to the transportation of nuclear materials between Japan and the UK and France, led to the adoption in 1993 of the IMO Code on the Safe Carriage of Irradiated Nuclear Fuel, Plutonium and High Level Radioactive Wastes in Flasks on Board Ships (the INF Code).  The Code lays down standards for construction, equipment and operation of ships engaged in the carriage of irradiated nuclear fuel, plutonium and high level radioactive wastes.</P>
    <P>Ireland has consistently argued for the following additional requirements to be included in the INF Code:</P>
    <P>&mdash; reporting arrangements;</P>
    <P>&mdash; consultation with coastal states;</P>
    <P>&mdash; routeing restrictions/passage planning;</P>
    <P>&mdash; marine emergency response plans;</P>
    <P>&mdash; salvage arrangements in the event of an accident.</P>
    <P>A representative of my Department raised Ireland's concerns on the issue at the Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) of the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) meeting in London last week.  The Secretary General of the IMO and a number of countries at the MEPC have supported Ireland's view and as a result a special meeting under the aegis of the IMO is being set up to progress the expansion of the INF Code.</P>
    <P>On 13 September 1995 an EU Directive concerning reporting arrangements for vessels bound for or leaving Community ports and carrying dangerous or polluting goods (HAZMAT) came into <Col N="175" /> force.  Ireland has requested that the definition of &ldquo;Dangerous Goods&rdquo; be expanded to include substances coming under the INF Code.  The EU Commission has agreed to put Ireland's proposal on the agenda of the next Commission meeting and to submit a proposal for amending the Directive to incorporate the Code to Parliament and Council.</P>
    <P>The above steps represent our minimum requirements, given the prospect of continuing traffic on the high seas of radioactive materials.  As you are no doubt aware, this Government is opposed to the reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel and are seeking the closure of the Sellafield/Thorp plant and the halting of any future expansion there. An interdepartmental committee on the Irish Sea has been established in order to progress Government policy on Sellafield and the Irish Sea in line with the commitments given in the Government of Renewal policy document.</P>
