      <P>It is now our sad duty to reflect on the untimely passing of a dear parliamentary colleague, the late Deputy Johnny Fox.  The expression of sympathy will be moved by the Taoiseach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is my sad duty to move this vote of sympathy.  One cannot look at the seat that would normally be occupied by Johnny Fox without feeling a deep sense of personal loss.  I wish to express sympathy to Johnny's widow, Susan, his daughters, Mildred and Ruth, and his son, Christopher.</P>
      <P>Deputy Fox was a Member of the House from only November 1992, but in that short period he showed himself to be dedicated to the interests of his constituents. He died in the service of his constituents.  He was very much an Independent, very much his own man.  He had no fear of expressing his opinions whether, politically, they were correct or incorrect.  His deep honesty was his strongest characteristic and that came across to anyone who dealt with him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He also had great sympathy for the problems of other politicians.  He did not apply false standards to the work of <Col N="1686" /> his colleagues but understood their difficulties and dealt with them on that basis while holding steadfastly to his own ideals.</P>
    <P>He was an exceptionally successful politician.  To be elected as an Independent to this House requires enormous qualities of dedication, commitment and conviction.  It is virtually impossible to be elected to this House as an Independent in the face of the competition of organised party machines.  That Deputy Johnny Fox was elected to this House as an Independent and, undoubtedly, would have been re-elected many times, is a clear indication of the magnitude of the talent that we have lost.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fox was a member of Wicklow County Council since the 1980s and was chairman of that body for a while. He was a member of the Church of Ireland but played both Gaelic football and rugby.  In his own life he was able to bring together the two traditions on this island of which we talk so much in other contexts.  He frequently used references to traditions to explain the need for reconciliation in Northern Ireland. Johnny Fox was a living expression of the sort of reconciliation this country needs.  He lived reconciliation; he was reconciliation and that, in a sense, is probably why he was such a success in politics.  That is why he was elected as an Independent.  That is why he was held in such universal affection on all sides of this House.  People really did like Johnny Fox.  Anyone who had to deal with him, as I as a party Leader had to do, could not but like him.</P>
    <P>Nothing that can be said here can be of much consolation to his family on their loss, but the fact that Deputy Fox was held in such widespread respect and affection by those with whom he worked most closely must give some small consolation to them as they go through the next bitter empty days, months and, perhaps, even years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I join the Taoiseach in this expression of sympathy to the family of our colleague, Johnny Fox. Whether one is in Government or <Col N="1687" /> Opposition it is always sad to lose a colleague of a current Dáil.</P>
      <P>All our colleagues who passed away in recent times had much in common. Deputy Fox was a tremendous worker and represented my party as a county councillor.  We will remember him especially for his dedication and work as a party activist.  Unfortunately, in the last election he decided to run as an Independent.  On the night of the convention which I chaired I discussed the matter with him at length.  He reckoned, correctly, that the 1992 election campaign would be tight and tough but believed he would be elected to this House.  This he achieved and I do not think anyone on this side of the House ever begrudged him this.  I join the Taoiseach in extending our sympathy to his wife, Susan, his daughters, Mildred and Ruth, and son, Christopher.</P>
      <P>Like many other Members of this House, Deputy Fox worked extremely hard.  On St. Patrick's Day, when he could have been at home, he tried to do what so many other Members of this House should not do, be in four places at the one time.  Having earlier attended a number of parades he left his wife, Susan, at one function to attend a presentation at another.  In remembering him we should dwell on that point.</P>
      <P>Although he was only in the House a short time &mdash; I knew him long before he became a Member &mdash; Deputy Fox loved the cut and trust of politics and the fun that goes with it; he did not regard the House solely as a place of work.  He always tried to have time made available for the Independents and he was very successful.  He always managed to make a contribution and was never afraid, as the Taoiseach said, of being controversial.  On one occasion when everyone else was trying to avoid one he forced a vote on the issue being debated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to remember Deputy Fox in the way he will be remembered by his constituents in County Wicklow &mdash; as a hard working person with a tremendous interest in sport who did not consider <Col N="1688" /> this House solely as a place of work.  It is so sad that a person so young and here for such a short length of time has passed away.  Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam dílis.</P>

      <P>I add my words of sympathy to those of the Taoiseach and the leader of the Fianna Fáil Party, Deputy Ahern.  Those of us who got to know Deputy Fox knew that he took particular satisfaction in his election to Dáil Éireann without the help of the party system.  He enjoyed his time in politics and will be missed by the people of County Wicklow, whom he represented on Wicklow County Council for many years, and by his sporting colleagues &mdash; he was involved in sport up to the time of his tragic death.  He will be a great loss to his wife, Susan, and family.</P>
      <P>In particular I pay tribute to Deputy Fox on behalf of his constituency colleague, Deputy Kavanagh, who is unable to be present because of the meeting of the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body.  With their constituency colleagues, they worked well together in the interests of County Wicklow.  He will be a loss to this House as he was a friend to everybody.  He had strong convictions on many controversial issues and did not shy away from expressing them.  We will miss him.</P>
      <P>On behalf of the Labour Parliamentary Party, I extend our special sympathy to his wife, Susan, and children. They shall miss a good husband, father and colleague.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I join the other party leaders in extending my sympathy to the widow and family of the late Deputy Fox.  I got to know him first during the campaign to stop the building of the interpretative centre at Luggala.  He impressed me then as a man who was not only independent-minded but courageous because, at an early stage, he took a point of view which may not have been the view held by the majority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1689" /> Deputy Fox impressed me subsequently when he became a Member of this House.  It is hard to believe that he was here for a little over two years. Most Members felt that they knew him fairly well.  He spoke to everyone in a quiet but sincere and decent way.  On the social agenda he held views that I would not share but he advanced them in a fair-minded way.  Although he used strong language I do not think that he ever intended to offend anyone.  He was a decent person who held strong views.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fox did not make long speeches in this House.  The greatest tribute I could pay to him is not to speak for too long.  He will be sadly missed. For ten years we were happy not to lose any serving Member of the Dáil but now we have lost two in the past few months.  When we heard of his death late on Friday night it came as a great shock.  He was so young and active and advanced the cause of his constituents and the views he strongly held on a wide range of issues.  He will be sadly missed.</P>
    <P>With those of us who are unable to find offices in Leinster House Deputy Fox had an office in Kildare House.  Perhaps as a consequence we got to know him somewhat better.  On our way to the House for votes we met the various protest groups and in the many chats I had with him he always seemed to be in good humour and a person who enjoyed being a Member of this House.  To his wife, Susan, and his three children I extend my sympathy and that of the Progressive Democrats.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Proinsias De Rossa)</NameTxt>
      <P>Like every other Member of this House, I was shocked when I heard of the death of Deputy Fox whom I met for the first time when he became a Member in 1992.  He was a member of the Technical Group which was formed after the last election.  He was an extremely likeable and kind person who held strong views some of which I did not share.  They were deeply held and he pursued them honourably and actively. <Col N="1690" /> There is little else that a public representative can do in serving his constituents. On behalf of the Democratic Left, I convey our sympathy to his wife and three children and the community he served.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Ms McManus)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is hard to believe that we will not see Deputy Fox again in this House.  He was happiest outdoors working on his farm. He loved the Wicklow mountains and the people who lived on and near them and they certainly loved him.  This was never more evident than when the crowds came to Delgany Church from every part of the county and beyond to mourn his death.</P>
      <P>Deputy Fox held simple but strong beliefs which may not have been to everyone's liking.  It is appropriate that his final resting place is at the foot of the Sugar Loaf.  His epitaph could be taken from the psalms &ldquo;His foundation is upon the holy hills&rdquo; as he loved the mountains and the rural communities he represented.  That is where he will be best remembered.  I extend my deepest sympathy to his wife, Susan, and three children, Mildred, Christopher and Ruth.  They have lost a dear father and we, in County Wicklow, have lost a dear friend.  May he rest in peace.</P>

      <P>It is a great privilege to join the Taoiseach, my party leader, the Tánaiste, and other colleagues in paying this brief tribute to the late Deputy Fox. I was present at the meeting of his passing. With our colleague, Deputy Kavanagh, who, as the Tánaiste said, would like to be present this morning, we attended a number of parades on St. Patrick's Day together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To use a cliché Deputy Fox was a larger than life character and a man of the people.  The sense of shock and total loss felt by the people of Wicklow has to be witnessed to be fully appreciated. Deputy Fox will be remembered with great fondness in the years ahead when perhaps many of us will have been forgotten. As other Members said, he was <Col N="1691" /> involved in the political and the sporting world and there were no sporting, political or religious divides known to Deputy Fox.  To his wife Susan and his lovely family I offer, on behalf of my constituents, my most sincere sympathies.  Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam dílis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GodfreyTimmins" hpid="Mr. Timmins Mr. Timmins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
      <P>With deep regret I wish to be associated with this vote of sympathy on the death of Deputy Johnny Fox to his wife Susan and family.  No words of mine could pay an adequate tribute to Deputy Johnny Fox for the work he did on behalf of the people of Wicklow.  He was a tireless worker, nothing was too much trouble for him as far as their interests were concerned and above all, Deputy Fox was a man without malice.  Irrespective of how deep discussions with him may have been, when everything was said and done, and because of his great capacity for unity, Deputy Fox was always among friends.</P>
      <P>Before entering politics he was involved in every facet of local life in his own area.  As one who knew him for a considerable number of years I believe Longfellow must have had people like Deputy Fox in mind when he wrote about footprints on the sands of time. Judging by the deep sorrow and sadness we felt on learning of the news of Deputy Fox's death, we can certainly appreciate how Susan, his children and his sisters must have felt.  In his passing his wife and family have lost a great provider and the people of Wicklow have lost an outstanding public representative. Those of us whose lives he touched have lost a true and valued friend.  May he rest in peace.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I join other Members of the House in extending deepest sympathy to the late Deputy Fox's wife, Susan, and his children, Mildred, Ruth and Christopher. <Col N="1692" /> When I remember Deputy Fox the words that come to mind are courtesy at all times.  Regardless of how fraught the debate might become, he would always extend courtesy to those with whom he may not have agreed.  To that extent he has left a legacy in this House and far beyond on how one should &mdash; even in controversy and conflict &mdash; maintain dignity and courtsey when dealing with people.</P>
    <P>I did not always agree with Deputy Fox's political views but his death has affected me more than the death of others because he was a true friend. One aspect of friendship is that even though friends do not always agree, they can engage in conversation and argue point while keeping the friendship intact.  One could always depend on Deputy Fox in one's hour of need.</P>
    <P>I wish to pay tribute to Deputy Fox's work on behalf of the group of which we were both a member.  He always spoke out and was not afraid of convention. He put across his points as an Independent and gained enormous respect. He will be a sad loss, particularly to his family but to the country also because he epitomised an independent way of thinking that is refreshing in an often staid political climate.

      <P>On behalf of Deputy Blaney, who would dearly like to be here but cannot because of the meeting of the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body, on behalf of Deputy Tom Foxe and myself I wish to express our personal sadness and sincere regret at the untimely death of our Independent colleague, the late Deputy Johnny Fox.  I join the other Members who spoke here today and convey our sympathy to his widow, Susan and his family.</P>
      <P>In the short time we knew him, Deputy Fox was a most likeable, gentlemanly and courteous colleague who worked extremely hard on behalf of his constitutents and who always had the courage of his convictions even when that meant standing alone in this House. He was a credit to this House.  Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam.</P>

We have been asked to take this Bill to the end of Committee Stage during Wednesday, Thursday and Friday of this week.  We agree to process the Bill because I am aware of the importance of getting it through, but I would ask the Taoiseach to ensure, with the exception of the Finance and Social Welfare Bills, there will be a break between Second Stage and Committee Stage of the Bills, I know that is not easy in the case of the two Bills to which I have referred but it is unreasonable to ask us to deal with both Stages this week.</P>

If the Government makes an issue of it we can be very unreasonable.  I asked the Tánaiste last week for a detailed statement on the mechanism for dealing with equality payments, which we support, whether they will be made from the local loans funds and if that means a direct sale of the local loans find book, whether a loan will be raised by the Housing Agency, whether it will mean additional Exchequer borrowing or whether it will mean supply spending.

      <P>I agree with the points raised by Deputy Ahern on the Social Welfare Bill.  Will the Government agree as a matter of principle that there will always be a gap between Second Stage and Committee Stage of Bills? This is the second occasion in recent times whereby all Stages of Bills have been taken in the one week, and that is unsatisfactory.  Experience has shown that when that is done, we always end up with faulty legislation.  Does the Government intend bringing forward legislation later this year to provide for an amendment to the sanitary services Act to prevent local authorities disconnecting service from those who do not pay service charges?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course it is desirable there be a gap between Second Stage and Committee Stage of Bills.  We were willing to take Second Stage of the Social Welfare Bill last week but it was not possible because the principal Opposition spokesperson was not available. That would have allowed us to start Committee Stage this week. Second Stage will be completed at the set time.  The Select Committee on Social Affairs will have the ability to set its own time to meet and discuss the Bill.  If it wants to allow a gap between Second and Committee Stages, that is a matter for the committee, not the Government.  The only requirement is that the legislation be passed by 6 April, <Col N="1699" /> which is the statutory deadline to allow the increases to come into effect and have statutory authority.  On the other question raised by the Deputy, there are commitments in the Government programme on that matter which will be fulfilled.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am confident this motion reflects the views of all our people.  This April, with negotiations on renewal and extension of the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons Treaty, 1970, taking place, Ireland has an <Col N="1703" /> opportunity to make a bold and radical statement and devise a new system for global denuclearisation.  It is appropriate that Ireland takes the opportunity as it did in the past and our aim must be nothing less than a nuclear free world.</P>
      <P>Twenty-five years ago, following the very important role played by a former Fianna Fáil Minister for Foreign Affairs, the late Mr. Frank Aiken, the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons Treaty was signed.  By his strong advocacy of this international treaty at the United Nations in New York. Frank Aiken helped make our modern world a little more safe and more likely that we would have a world to hand on to our children and our children's children. This treaty was not a seven day wonder but the product of a campaign begun in 1958 with the publication of his disengagement plan for world peace and the assumption of a policy independent of the main powers which won the confidence and support of most of the small nations of the time.</P>
      <P>It was a unique and farseeing contribution, coming as it did before the Berlin Wall, the Cuban missile crisis and at a time when the superpowers were locked in the Cold War confrontation. It was frighteningly clear to all that the life of the world was ebbing away to the ticking of the nuclear clock.  Aiken's policy on nuclear non-proliferation has been a continuous fundamental of Irish foreign policy since that time.  Under the terms of the treaty on non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, those states who held nuclear weapons agreed to get rid of their nuclear weapons while those states without such weapons agreed to give up the right to manufacture or acquire nuclear weapons.  The five states officially recognised by the treaty as holding nuclear weapons were China, France, the United Kingdom, the USSR and the USA and 167 countries are signatories to the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons Treaty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For 25 years the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons Treaty has served as the most widely supported arms control <Col N="1704" /> measure in history.  It has unquestionably served as a global norm of non-proliferation against the possibility of nuclear holocaust.  Hold out states have to assume the burden that that status entails and constantly explain their reasons for staying outside the treaty. We have seen the success of the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons Treaty: there are five acknowledged nuclear weapon states, the same as when the treaty was open for signature, a tribute to the treaty's moral weight to command worldwide non-proliferation of these weapons.  Each of these five countries is a signatory to the agreement meaning that all five nuclear powers are committed to the cessation of the nuclear arms race and to nuclear disarmament.</P>
    <P>As well, in the spirit of the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons Treaty, there has been a number of bilateral agreements and unilateral declarations such as the SALT and STAR talks between the USA and USSR and the abandonment by South Africa of its existing nuclear weapons programme. Super powers such as Russia and the United States have made strong commitments and have taken action to dramatically reduce their nuclear arsenal.  Now, 50 years after Hiroshima, the nuclear clock has been turned back from the final and irrevocable midnight darkness of the nuclear destruction.</P>
    <P>We live in a world that has seen the fall of the Berlin Wall and the Cold War has been consigned to the history books but does this mean that we can afford to be complacent that the battle to rid the world of these disastrous contrivances is over?  Sadly, this is far from being the case.</P>
    <P>The Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons Treaty was intended only as an interim agreement while nuclear disarmament took place, with signatory states agreeing to review the treaty every five years.  It is now a quarter of a century since the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons Treaty was signed.  As Fianna Fáil spokesman for Foreign <Col N="1705" /> Affairs I take the opportunity to participate in building on the work Frank Aiken helped initiate.  The Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons Treaty Review and Extension Conference will be held in New York in April-May this year.  With this conference imminent, the international community has an opportunity to do something positive. We have an opportunity to build a nuclear free world for the 21st century and ensure greater protection for all our people against a nuclear nightmare.</P>
    <P>At the conference, Government representatives will be asked to extend the treaty indefinitely or for an additional period or periods subject to the consideration of all the signatories.  Those states with nuclear weapons are calling for the NPT to be extended indefinitely because, they argue, the agreement provides an effective block to nuclear proliferation. However, to do so alone would be to lose a valuable opportunity for the world and its people.  Our target should be far more ambitious as outlined in the motion.</P>
    <P>Many non-nuclear states, together with Greenpeace, believe that an indefinite extension of the NPT would make permanent an agreement which has only begun to free the world from the nuclear threat.  We live in a different world from that of Frank Aiken and his contemporaries.  In some ways it is no less dangerous but because of incidents surrounding places such as Chernobyl, Three Mile Island, Windscale-Sellafield, we should be wiser and more chastened. We owe a great deal to the moral obligations which the NPT has imposed on the world community but we must acknowledge the major problems which remain.  Some countries in regions of major proliferation concern, such as the Middle East and South-East Asia, still remain outside the NPT.  A number of signatory states are guilty of non-compliance with NPT obligations.</P>
    <P>There is also the risk of illegal access to nuclear materials arising from the break-up of the former Soviet Union and the transportation of nuclear <Col N="1706" /> materials across vast distances for storage and disposal.  The German customs officials seized nuclear materials which were stolen and smuggled from the former USSR.  While we welcome these seizures we are forced to inquire how much material has been successfully smuggled and in whose hands it ended up.  It is not unreasonable to say that border and customs patrols are only successful in detecting about 5 per cent or 10 per cent of contraband and such items are less lethal than nuclear materials.  It is fair to assume, although frightening to do so, that nuclear materials have been successfully smuggled from the former states of the USSR.  It is equally frightening to think that, rather than having five nuclear powers, the world is subject to the Moscow Mafia having control of and moving nuclear material around the world.</P>
    <P>Effective action on the elimination of the nuclear threat against humanity is now more urgent then ever.  If anything, rather than express satisfaction with the <i>status quo</i> we should try to build on the protection offered by the NPT.  Political uncertainties threaten to place nuclear arsenals in hands for which they were never meant.  Despite the treaty we are all well aware that nations other than the original five nuclear powers have acquired the means to build and have built nuclear weaponry.  We are all too well aware that those countries which hold nuclear weapons have developed their arsenals to achieve far greater destruction than they were capable of in 1970.</P>
    <P>The proposals made by Frank Aiken during the 1960s represented a radical departure as the smaller countries of the world forced a moral imperative on the great nuclear powers of the day.  The challenge before us is to initiate a radical procedure which will lead not only to the disengagement and destruction of all nuclear weaponry but also to an agreement which will stop further construction of nuclear power plants and phase out all such existing facilities. Some will say that is too radical and pie in the sky but we have seen in recent <Col N="1707" /> years that the nuclear power industry and plants are neither safe, instanced by Chernobyl, economic or commercially viable, evidenced by the privatisation policies in the UK.  The nuclear industry there could not be privatised because decommissioning had not been costed and taken into account in calculating the cost of nuclear power.  Decommissioning is a huge element in many plants.  On the west coast of the UK many of the plants which pose a major threat to us are old and need decommissioning. The cost of decommissioning is such it proves nuclear power is not commercially viable and it is not unreasonable to say we should phase out existing facilities and stop further construction of nuclear power plants.</P>
    <P>Many non-aligned countries like Ireland, longstanding advocates of the abolition of nuclear weapons, have sought to use the opportunity presented by the forthcoming negotiations to increase the pressure for accelerated nuclear disarmament.  An indefinite extension rather than institutionalising what has been achieved will be seen as forfeiting what small leverage they have over states with nuclear weapons.  The international community should extend the treaty on the basis of clear, quantifiable and verifiable commitments being made and genuine and achievable goals being established towards nuclear non-proliferation and elimination.  The treaty should be extended for five year periods with a set of stated goals pronounced at the beginning of each period. A simple review process by official mandarins in their gilded halls is not the radical step which is required.  It is not what the people want.  They have been educated and learned the lessons of Chernobyl and Three Mile Island.  They want to see the next major step to nuclear disarmament brought forward.</P>
    <P>Negotiations must be put in train to devise a new system for global denuclearisation which should include (1) halting all nuclear weapons production, modernisation and deployment; (2) agreement on a schedule to achieve zero <Col N="1708" /> nuclear weapons; (3) agreement on implementation of a complete ban on the separation, production and use of all plutonium and highly enriched uranium; (4) the establishment of an effective agency to monitor and control all weapons using nuclear materials; (5) the establishment of a register in which the location of all weapons and nuclear materials could be recorded and monitored; (6) agreement on the implementation of a total nuclear test ban treaty and (7) an end to the promotion of nuclear energy by the International Atomic Energy Agency.  The scientific community must recognise that humanity does not want the production of nuclear material.  To produce it for reasons of national wealth and security should simply be regarded as grandiose, foolish and dangerous.</P>
    <P>It is hardly extreme to claim that the whole of the nuclear industry is suspect. Any procedure which, by accident or misuse, can create an impact such as that of Chernobyl must be taken seriously for the dangerous threat it represents. There must be no further international promotion of an industry which can create a Sellafield or Chernobyl; rather, there must be effective international monitoring of these nuclear stations and the phasing out of those in existence.  No longer is national security an adequate shield behind which to hide in the face of the type of international catastrophe to which these materials can lead.  No state should be allowed to resist the moral pressure exerted by the international community in this respect.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned Chernobyl a number of times because its lessons are too important ever to be forgotten.  We have seen the children of the area whose horrendous injuries and continuing suffering resulted from that incident.  The community of Skerries in north Country Dublin, in my constituency, have welcomed children from that area over a number of years, as have the people of the Cork region, in addition to their being looked after in various hospitals here.  It is a very salutary lesson to us all <Col N="1709" /> that minor steps are not sufficient; we must be radical, like a former Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Frank Aiken, in his time.</P>
    <P>The forthcoming Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty Conference to be held in New York from 17 April to 12 May next will afford the world an opportunity of taking a great leap forward from the nightmare of nuclear destruction.  A new treaty must be drawn up to provide effective international monitoring and no country should be allowed to stand in the way of independent international monitoring of its nuclear industry.  There must be an end to the creation of nuclear materials and a treaty drawn up to provide for a test ban.  Why test for something one is committed to dismantle or dispose of?</P>
    <P>I mentioned independent international monitoring.  In this respect I am well aware that successive Governments here have endeavoured &mdash; as I did when Minister for Energy &mdash; to persuade member states of the European Union, the EC as it was then, to agree to a system of independent international monitoring. The very strong nuclear lobby of the British and French at the time, and to a lesser extent the Germans, had their faces firmly set against allowing any inspectorate or monitoring outside their nuclear industries on their territories. That attitude can no longer be accepted by the international community, that type of &ldquo;little state&rdquo; approach, when the danger of a nuclear holocaust arising from an accident at one of these nuclear plants crosses all frontiers.</P>
    <P>The promotion of this dangerous, nuclear industry, the transport of dangerous materials and the continued use of nuclear power must cease.  It is reasonable to ask why the Irish people should be subjected to the dangers from ships carrying nuclear waste through neighbouring waters for reprocessing and disposal.  People want protection from this menace and our Government must seek that protection for our people, for all peoples worldwide, particularly at international fora such as <Col N="1710" /> that in New York.  Why should this island be subjected to the threat posed us from reprocessing and dumping at Sellafield, in caverns beneath the sea, or to the equal threat posed by the movement of shipping in the narrow Irish sea?  Why should we be subjected to such threat because of the British Government's commitment to the expansion of Sellafield, the fact that they made a decision, poured in money for that purpose, stating they must continue to use it despite tha fact that, from the date of their original decisions, world attitudes to nuclear processing had changed?  Why should we, on this side of the Irish Sea, be subjected to that threat?  Should we not shout about that threat at every international forum, clearly indicating how we feel about it?</P>
    <P>It is my firm belief that only from neutral countries such as ours, whose interests have not become entangled in the proliferation of nuclear materials, can such proposals emanate.  A former Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Frank Aiken said:</P>
    <P>I am neither pro-British nor pro-American, anti-British or anti-American foreign policy.  I am just pro-Irish and anti-nuclear suicide, pro-effective and reliably financed measures for peacekeeping forces in which the small states have a critically important role to play, pro the peaceful settlement of disputes within and between small states, anti-small states becoming the battle ground between great powers for the extension of their military power and influence or economic domination....</P>
    <P>Ireland, in its neutrality, possesses an integrity and honesty which allows it to seek such changes within the international community as it is well recognised that our only self-interest is that of being able to live and prosper in peace alongside our neighbours.  Our neutrality is a positive feature of our foreign <Col N="1711" /> policy, affording us a unique, independent voice and a high moral position.  As spokesman for my party on Foreign Affairs, I should like to place a marker that this conscientious declaration of our neutrality has always been the policy of this State.  In these challenging times I see every reason for Irish, European Union and international interests being best served by the continuation of such a policy.</P>
    <P>While recognising that all treaties represent a compromise, moral pressure must be exerted to ensure the safety of this globe for ourselves and our children. Ireland is in a unique position to provide the leadership for that moral pressure.  At the root of my proposal is seeking the renewal of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty at five-yearly intervals, specifying firm goals and objectives, to ensure that we achieve global denuclearisation.  I believe the European Union intends to approach this treaty on the basis of joint action. However, I must remind the House that, through a former Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Frank Aiken, Ireland took an independent, forthright stand on this issue once before and should do so at this time.  Effective action to halt and reverse the nuclear threat, based on a set of established goals, is more urgent than ever.</P>
    <P>I call on the Government to grasp the opportunity presented by this forthcoming conference to ensure our world is rendered safe and that every possible effort is undertaken to ensure that the nuclear genie is confined to its bottle.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge the Government amendment in the name of the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs to the positive motion tabled in my name on behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party.  In its six items listed they have covered many of the seven in my motion but endorsing the approach called for in the Government's amendment, in support of the indefinite extension of the treaty, does not represent the radical step or stance that we, as an independent, non-nuclear, neutral member state within <Col N="1712" /> the European Union, should be taking. Instead we should take a positive, radical approach as suggested in my motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this important debate and to congratulate Deputy Ray Burke on having tabled the motion.  It is 25 years since the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons Treaty was signed. The then Fianna Fáil Minister for Foreign Affairs, the late Frank Aiken, took the initiative and put forward a resolution calling for the negotiation of a treaty on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons.  What emerged is now known as NPT.  Ours was the first State to ratify the treaty when it was signed in 1968.  Since then 167 nations signed the treaty.  The NPT is still an important part of global security helping to curtail the spread of nuclear weapons.  Soon, a conference in New York will decide how long the NPT will be extended.  It is important that the treaty be strengthened where necessary and fine-tuned to today's changed circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most important part of the motion is where it states the treaty should only be extended for five year periods with a set of stated goals pronounced at the beginning of each period. It is vital that Ireland presses for such changes.  Ireland has a long history of supporting international efforts to eliminate nuclear arms.  Our policy should be based on an extension of the NPT for additional fixed periods of five years.  After each five year period a review conference could be held.  This year's conference could consider the mechanism and conditions under which this could be done.  Greenpeace has rightly stated that this could be done by linking further extensions to progress towards achieving other crucial non-proliferation measures.  The parties could then decide to call a halt, if it was considered that inadequate progress had been made.  Satisfactory progress would ensure the further automatic extension of the treaty.  In this way Governments anxious to extend the <Col N="1713" /> NPT would be encouraged to drop those measures in a timely way and the task of those anxious to increase the effectiveness of the entire non-proliferation regime would be made considerably easier.  An indefinite or very long extension would considerably reduce the prospect of the evolution of an effective non-proliferation regime.</P>
    <P>I gather that approximately 20 countries indicated their opposition to an indefinite and unconditional extension of the NPT.  Some of those countries are Colombia, Egypt, Indonesia, Iran, Mexico, Nigeria, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Zimbabwe.  As Greenpeace rightly points out, the April conference should not be between North and South, but between nuclear and non-nuclear states. Ireland should take a lead in his area as it did before and push for significant changes in the NPT.</P>
    <P>Ireland has always supported the case for nuclear disarmament.  It is important that we continue to argue that case within the European Union and the UN.  The European Union, the world's biggest economic power, has an enormous capacity to influence world affairs. Using that power and wielding that influence for a saner and more equitable system must be part of its foreign policy. We must use our influence with our partners in Europe to strengthen the treaty and, in doing so, prove that a small nation within the European Union has a significant influence on important matters such as this.  We must also bring to the United Nations radical proposals to tackle nuclear weapons and address the risk from nuclear power plants.  We have a good and honourable history within the United Nations and have been seen to represent smaller nations. I ask the Tánaiste to ensure that following the April conference that will remain the position and we will be seen to take a lead in this matter.  We live under the shadow of an accident-prone power plant at Sellafield.</P>
    <P>The Irish people, for good reason, do not trust the British nuclear industry. BNFL's safety record leaves much to be desired.  In the 1957 fire at Windscale, <Col N="1714" /> now known as Sellafield, as much as 20,000 cories of iodine and 20 cories of polonium-210 were released into the atmosphere.</P>
    <P>The public remembers the arguments of the world nuclear industry when it assured us, in advance of the Chernobyl disaster, that the use of nuclear energy was safe.  The efforts of groups working with the children of Chernobyl have brought home to us the stark consequences of the radiation emitted when things went wrong at that power station. Now the proponents of nuclear energy and BNFL seek to distance themselves from the Chernobyl disaster putting all the blame on the lack of Russian safety standards.  All accidents at nuclear plants have been due ultimately to human error.  No advances in technology can eliminate the imperfections of a human component.  The lethal potential of nuclear energy, of its raw material and its by-products means that one mistake in its handling can have horrific consequences.</P>
    <P>BNFL's safety record does not inspire confidence in those of us who are most exposed to such horrific potential less than 100 miles from the Sellafield plant. One need only look at the support given to candidates who campaigned on this issue in the last European elections to know how the public feel about it and their fear of the threat from Sellafield, the new THORP plant and nuclear power plants in general.  The United Nations and the European Union must take account of the real threat to life.</P>
    <P>Ireland enjoys none of the benefits of nuclear power and even if we did, they would not justify the risks to which we have been exposed.  Our concerns are shared by the Government of the Isle of Man and by groups opposing nuclear processing in Cumbria.  Many international authorities say THORP is a legacy of the post-war nuclear culture and have questioned the economics of plutonium reprocessing put forward by BNFL.</P>
    <P>Many of my colleagues in the European Parliament, including Niall Andrews, Jim Fitzsimons and the Green <Col N="1715" /> Party MEPs, have raised concerns regarding Sellafield.  We are aware of the efforts of the European Commission and the European Parliament to ensure that one nuclear power plant in Slovakia meets the EU public health and safety standards.  The Commission has sent experts to analyse the plant and the European Parliament has held a public hearing into the matter.  The Commission does not appear to have the same attitude to the Sellafield and THORP nuclear plants and the concerns of the Irish people.  Why has the Commission not sent in outside experts to analyse the safety and public health aspects of those operations?  An independent analysis must be carried out on the THORP and Sellafield plants.  The European Commission must be mindful of people's fears regarding nuclear power.  The fears of Irish people and others around the world concerning nuclear energy is not based on hysteria, but on facts.  Few could fail to be moved by the death of Evgenya Nesterenko, the eight year old Belarussian girl who died recently in the Mercy Hospital in Cork.  She was a victim of the grotesque after effects of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster suffering from advanced osteoporosis and blood disorders and although she lived a tragically short and painful life, she was one of the lucky ones.  Her death far away from home was preceded by expert medical attention and loving care from Adi Roche and members of the Chernobyl children's project.  She left behind in Belarus hundreds of children and adults trying to cope with the appalling after effects of a disaster in a country simply unable to cope.  While the living of Belarus and, indeed, the unborn, are most acutely affected by radiation exposure, we are faced with the chilling fact that Chernobyl's deadly pall was cast across Europe and may have reached our shores.  Although the Chernobyl disaster occurred nine years ago its full effects are still not known.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, many terrorist groups and leaders of some countries are eager <Col N="1716" /> to get their hands on nuclear and chemical weapons.  Last weekend we had the horrific example of a group using sarin to deadly effect in a tube station in Tokyo in Japan.  The use of sarin, described as the poor man's atomic bomb, has brought home to all of us the effects which would accrue if nuclear materials were to get into the wrong hands.  There has been a good deal of smuggling of nuclear materials from the former USSR.  Happily much of it was detected in Germany, but how much nuclear materials were smuggled out undetected and are in the wrong hands at present?  The incident in Japan last weekend is a small example.</P>
    <P>The idea of somebody getting their hands on nuclear energy, power or weapons is horrific.  It could result in huge destruction in any city if released. Obviously those who did it &mdash; I understand there were some arrests yesterday and this morning &mdash; are extremists of the worst kind.  They do not really care about the destruction they caused.  It is important for all of us to ensure that this treaty reflects the concern of the public regarding weapons and that the problem is tackled in a proper fashion.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs has organised meetings throughout the country at which we have debated foreign policy.  Those meetings have been extremely important and have given people an opportunity to discuss Ireland's role within the United Nations and the European Union.  It is important that Ireland is seen to have a role and an influence.  This is an ideal opportunity for us to show that a small country such as ours can have a significant influence on such an important matter.</P>
    <P>I ask the Tánaiste to support the motion and to acknowledge that we need goals and objectives when the treaty is discussed in April.  It is important to have goals to ensure we are proceeding in the right direction and that they are monitored every five years.  Otherwise we will not be able to tackle the changing circumstances in which we find ourselves.  It was all right <Col N="1717" /> to do that some years ago because we had two superpowers and the number of countries with nuclear weapons was limited.  The number of countries with nuclear weapons is growing and if we do no set goals and objectives we will not see a nuclear free world which is our goal.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann, in recognising the important role played by the late Mr. Frank Aiken TD, the then Minister for Foreign Affairs, in initiating the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) over 25 years ago, </P>
      <P>&mdash; endorses the approach of the Government in support of the indefinite extension of the Treaty at the NPT Review and Extension Conference in April;</P>
      <P>&mdash; endorses also the objective of the Government to secure five-yearly reviews of the implementation of the Treaty;</P>
      <P>&mdash; believes that international negotiations should be intensified with a view to:</P>
      <P> (1) achieving agreement on the elimination of all nuclear weapons,</P>
      <P>(2) agreement, in this context, on the steps needed to bring about an end to the production, modernisation and deployment of nuclear weapons,</P>
      <P>(3) agreement on a treaty banning the production and use of plutonium and highly enriched uranium for weapons purposes,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(4) the establishment of effective arrangements to monitor and <Col N="1718" /> control all weapons-usable materials and to increase transparency with regard to nuclear weapons and materials,</P>
    <P>(5) the early conclusion and implementation of a total test ban,</P>
    <P>(6) the strengthening of the safeguards system of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), with particular reference to the Agency's ability to detect undeclared nuclear activities.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I commend Deputy Burke and his colleagues for affording the House an opportunity to discuss this important topic at a timely juncture prior to the NPT Conference which will take place in New York from 17 April to 12 May. This is the outstanding event of the disarmament calendar and one of the key disarmament meetings of recent years. The initial 25 year span of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty comes to an end this year.  The New York Conference will decide the future duration of the Treaty, the most widely accepted arms control measure in history &mdash; a treaty which has 172 States parties, almost as many countries as subscribed to the United Nations Charter.</P>
    <P>The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty is a complex document, like the issue of nuclear non-proliferation itself. Before dealing with the questions that will arise at the NPT conference I would like to set out in clear and simple terms the main objectives of the Government which guide our approach to the forthcoming conference and to discussions and negotiations at the UN and in the European Union.</P>
    <P>First, we want to see the complete abolition of nuclear weapons.  This is based on the belief that the nature of the weapons and the scale of destruction and suffering that their use brings can have no place in an international society <Col N="1719" /> based on principles of morality and justice. Fifty years ago the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki witnessed the horrible beginnings of the nuclear age.  In this anniversary year there can be no equivocation about the single most important aim of Ireland's disarmament policy &mdash; an end to nuclear weapons.</P>
    <P>Second, we want to ensure that those who possess nuclear weapons and nuclear weapons technology &mdash; the so-called nuclear weapons States &mdash; do not pass on such weapons or such technology to non-nuclear weapons countries. For 25 years the Non-Proliferation Treaty, and the monitoring and control arrangements associated with it, have helped to achieve that aim.  When an international agreement enjoys the levels of endorsement and success now enjoyed by the Non-Proliferation Treaty, it is much wiser to seek to secure its future rather than call it into question. There is no reason to believe that if a question mark were to be placed over the future of the NPT, the international community would readily arrive at a superior agreement which commanded the same support.</P>
    <P>Third, we want to see an end to testing nuclear weapons.  We have welcomed the moratoria on nuclear testing announced by France, Russia, the UK and the US.  We hope that these States will continue their ban, and we call on China to join them.  However, these are unilateral measures subject to the vagaries of internal politics in the States concerned and to competitive pressures. That is why it is essential to secure the early conclusion of a treaty &mdash; a binding international agreement &mdash; which will comprehensively ban all nuclear tests for all time.</P>
    <P>Fourth, we want an end to the production and stockpiling of materials, in particular plutonium, for use in the manufacture of nuclear weapons.  In this connection the Government is supporting proposals at the UN for the negotiation of a treaty which would ban the production of plutonium for weapons purposes.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1720" /> The text of the Government amendment is designed to meet these key objectives of Irish foreign policy.</P>
    <P>Ireland is justly proud of its historic association with the NPT.  It is appropriate that the House should recognise the important role played by a former Foreign Minister, the late Mr. Frank Aiken, in initiating the treaty, who was the first to raise the issue of nuclear non-proliferation at the United Nations in 1958. He drew attention to the dangers to world peace involved in the proliferation of nuclear weapons and proposed an international agreement to prevent the spread of such weapons.  The proposal met strong resistance, not only from the major powers but from many smaller states.  Mr. Aiken pursued the initiative, working to build broader support for it.  Support for Ireland's approach grew steadily from 1959 until Resolution 1665, known as &ldquo;the Irish Resolution&rdquo; was adopted unanimously by the United Nations General Assembly on 4 December 1961.</P>
    <P>The &ldquo;Irish Resolution&rdquo; called for the conclusion of an international agreement containing provisions under which the nuclear states would undertake to maintain control of their nuclear weapons and refrain from transmitting the information necessary for their manufacture to states not possessing such weapons.  The agreement would also contain provisions under which non-nuclear weapons states would undertake not to manufacture or otherwise acquire control of such weapons.</P>
    <P>The &ldquo;Irish Resolution&rdquo; contained the essence of the Non-Proliferation Treaty. The elaboration of the treaty took seven years of negotiations before it was concluded and opened for signature.  This was because of the great difficulty of arriving at an acceptable balance of mutual responsibilities and obligations of both nuclear and non-nuclear powers. Essentially, the treaty which emerged from the negotiations is based on a <i>quid pro quo</i> between the nuclear powers and the non-nuclear weapon states. Under it  <Col N="1721" />&mdash; the nuclear weapon states agree not to transfer nuclear weapons to any recipient, or give assistance or encouragement to induce non-nuclear weapon states to acquire such weapons, and they recognises the latter's right to the peaceful benefits of nuclear energy.  &mdash; the non-nuclear weapon states undertake not to seek or receive nuclear weapons, and to conclude safeguards agreements with the International Atomic Energy Agency to prevent diversion of nuclear material from peaceful uses.</P>
    <P>The question of the duration of the NPT was an issue in the original negotiations. A number of developed industrial countries with the potential to make their own nuclear weapons argued, and argued successfully, against a treaty of indefinite duration, <i>inter alia,</i> because they were unwilling to foreclose the nuclear weapons option for themselves. Thus the treaty was concluded for an initial period of 25 years. However, the option of its indefinite extension at the end of that period was clearly written into the text.  We must be aware of the possibility that some of those states who now oppose the indefinite extension of the NPT do so because they too are unwilling to foreclose forever the option of developing nuclear weapons themselves.  Ireland could not endorse such a position.  It would be inconsistent with our proud record on nuclear non-proliferation if we were to accommodate, even unwittingly, such designs.</P>
    <P>Today, the political and ideological basis of the Cold War period in which the NPT was negotiated have all but vanished.  The threat of nuclear conflict between the major powers no longer overshadows our daily lives.  The nuclear arms race between the United States and the Russian Federation has halted, we hope permanently.  As the recent entry into force of the first Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, START I, clearly signals, a reversal of the Cold War build-up of nuclear weapons is at <Col N="1722" /> last under way.  Yet a glance at developments in Russia and in the former Yugoslavia is enough to dispel any complacent view that, even in Europe, a new and secure world order has already taken the place of the &ldquo;hard and bitter peace&rdquo; of the Cold War period.</P>
    <P>Some of the new challenges that have arisen since the end of the Cold War are specific to the nuclear field.  The dissolution of central control in the former Soviet Union has created a pressing need to put in place adequate systems of accountancy and control of nuclear materials in many newly independent states.  It has also created a risk that expertise in nuclear weapons technology might be purchased by determined proliferators.  Outside Europe, an end to the proxy wars of the Cold War period has brought major positive developments in Southern Africa, Afghanistan, Cambodia, and the Middle East.  Yet even as these welcome developments occurred, the illegal nuclear activities of two parties to the Non-Proliferation Treaty posed a most serious challenge to the international nuclear non-proliferation regime.  Confidence in the compliance of states with their obligations under the NPT and in the adequacy of the system of IAEA safeguards was shaken by reports of noncompliance by Iraq and North Korea.</P>
    <P>While these challenges were vigorously addressed, and are being contained, it remains imperative that the safeguards system of the IAEA be further strengthened, with particular reference to the agency's ability to detect undeclared nuclear activities. This is the background to the final element of the Government's amendment.</P>
    <P>The last NPT Review Conference in Geneva in August 1990 took place against a backdrop of dramatic improvement in international relations, an improvement which, for the first time, ushered in a realistic prospect of serious reductions in the numbers of nuclear weapons held by the nuclear weapons states.  Nevertheless, as the <Col N="1723" /> then Minister for Foreign Affairs Deputy Gerard Collins, noted, the arguments which had made the negotiation of the Non-Proliferation Treaty a priority 20 years earlier had lost none of their relevance.  He spoke of the fearsome prospect of possible increases in the numbers of nuclear weapon states and he looked forward to the 1995 conference as an opportunity for Ireland to renew our commitment to the NPT for an indefinite period.  An indefinite extension by consensus would, he said, provide the best basis for carrying this important treaty into the 21st century.  I agree fully.  Even if the conference cannot reach consensus on this outcome, as seems plain in the light of the preparatory process, the Government maintains a strong belief that the optimum outcome would be for the NPT to be indefinitely extended.  This view is shared by all 52 states of Europe represented in the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe, OSCE; by the members of the European Union including our neutral partners Austria, Finland and Sweden; by countries such as New Zealand and Australia which have traditionally shared Ireland's approach to nuclear disarmament; and by many in the developing world.</P>
    <P>Since the 1990 Review Conference, the NPT has received a major new lease of life thanks to some highly significant accessions.  These include the two remaining nuclear powers.  France and China.  All the states of the former Soviet Union except Russia have acceded as non-nuclear weapon states, among them Ukraine, previously the third largest nuclear power in the world.  Some former so-called threshold states, such as Argentina and South Africa have changed course and joined the treaty as non-nuclear weapons states.  In doing so, South Africa became the first country in the world unilaterally and voluntarily to give up an existing nuclear weapons programme.</P>
    <P>France's accession means that for the first time all EU member states will be full participants at an NPT Conference. <Col N="1724" /> It has also meant that the EU is in a position to pursue a stronger policy on nuclear non-proliferation than heretofore.</P>
    <P>The Maastricht Treaty, Title V of which establishes a Common Foreign and Security Policy of the EU, entered into force in November 1993 at a point when the preparatory process for the crucial NPT Review and Extension Conference was already under way.  In the circumstances, it was natural that the European Council in Corfu in June 1994 should define the EU position on the outstanding issue of the 1995 conference and decide to make achievement of that position the subject of a Joint Action. Ireland was pleased that the subject of the first EU Joint Action in the disarmament field was the NPT, and it was gratifying that the substance of the Joint Action &mdash; promotion of the indefinite and unconditional extension of the treaty &mdash; corresponded with the position it had articulated four years earlier. Since Corfu, the European Union has been very active in pursuing the universality of the treaty, in trying to secure the widest possible participation in the preparatory committee for the conference and in promoting support for the indefinite extension of the treaty at the conference.</P>
    <P>The considerable success of the NPT in containing the spread of nuclear weapons in the past 25 years should, in the view of the Government, be reinforced and copperfastened by permanently securing the treaty in place at the centre of the international non-proliferation regime.  Opponents of the indefinite extension of the treaty seem to assume that what the treaty has achieved on the non-proliferation front has been secured once and for all.  This is much too sanguine a view.  The Government sees any uncertainty about the future life of the treaty as dangerous.  States could be tempted to pursue policies, in anticipation of the ending of the Treaty, that could reverse the gains and lead again to nuclear weapons' proliferation.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil motion advocates a series of short extensions of the NPT, <Col N="1725" /> each conditional on fulfilment of a set of stated goals in the field of nuclear disarmament. The idea underlying this approach seems to be that the best way to secure nuclear disarmament is to make the continuation of the NPT from one short extension to the next conditional upon the performance of the nuclear weapon states measured against a set of specific nuclear disarmament goals.</P>
    <P>I agree absolutely on the need to make progress on nuclear disarmament &mdash; it is the first priority of our disarmament policy.  However, the approach advocated in the Fianna Fáil Motion is highly risky.  It turns nuclear non-proliferation into a bargaining chip.  It makes the Non-Proliferation Treaty, and its associated safeguards regime, dependent on the successful completion of other disarmament negotiations.  It is gambling with one of the most successful arms control measures in history. The Government is firmly convinced that far from being the best way to advance nuclear disarmament a series of short, conditional extensions would, on the contrary, threaten progress in this vital area.  It would undermine the creditbility of the NPT, weaken its effectiveness, tempt non-nuclear states to anticipate the ending of the treaty and, by virtue of its effect on the attitude of the nuclear weapon states, freeze ongoing efforts to achieve nuclear disarmament. However genuine and sincerely held the beliefs of those who are advocating a series of short conditional extensions of the treaty, I ask the House to reflect soberly on the all too likely repercussions of this course.</P>
    <P>I would like to turn to the question of nuclear disarmament as provided for in Article VI of the treaty.  The accession of the two remaining nuclear powers, France and China, means that for the first time we approach an NPT Conference with all five declared nuclear weapon states legally bound under this Article: &ldquo;to pursue negotiations in good faith on effective measures relating to the cessation of the nuclear arms race at <Col N="1726" /> an early date and to nuclear disarmament, and on a treaty on general and complete disarmament under effective international control&rdquo;.  I have already noted that the nuclear arms race between the US and the former Soviet Union has halted.  Their enormous nuclear arsenals stand to be significantly reduced under the START I Treaty which entered into force last December and under START II, ratification of which is in hand.  Thus, in the case of the two states which have the largest nuclear arsenals, the fulfilment of commitments assumed under Article VI of the NPT has at last begun to yield measurable results.  Dramatic improvements in international relations at the close of the 1980s and in the first years of the 1990s provided the impetus for these developments.</P>
    <P>Today, the difficulty as well as the imperative of sustaining confidence in relations between the US and the Russian Federation has become more obvious.  Ratification of START II and, beyond it, agreement to reduce US and Russian nuclear arsenals still further, depend on confidence in the peaceful intentions of others no less than on confidence directly between Russia and the United States.  The knowledge that the further spread of nuclear weapons had been permanently arrested would give the US and Russian Federation the confidence to reduce their nuclear arsenals further.  This more than anything would create an effective inducement for the other declared nuclear weapons states &mdash; France, the UK and China &mdash; to begin to scale back their nuclear arsenals.  Any outcome of the NPT Conference which creates uncertainty about the peaceful intentions of others would be bound to damage confidence and thereby place in jeopardy the ongoing but still fragile movement towards nuclear disarmament.  This is the Government's essential objection to proposals for short extensions of the treaty.</P>
    <P>I want to state categorically that the Government's support for the indefinite <Col N="1727" /> extension of the NPT must not be construed as acquiescence in the permanent retention of nuclear weapons by the nuclear weapon states and any suggestion to that effect is unworthy and untrue.  On the contrary, the profound attachment of the people of Ireland and of successive Governments to the NPT owes a great deal to the fact that the treaty enshrines a good faith commitment to nuclear disarmament as well as obligations in respect of nuclear non-proliferation. It has, in Article VI, an unequivocal nuclear disarmament focus in addition to the more specific non-proliferation obligations set out in other articles.</P>
    <P>The Government's motion considers five-yearly reviews of the implementation of the NPT as providing the opportunity to hold all states parties to full compliance with the obligations to which they have subscribed in the treaty.  In the Government's view these reviews must be informed by a keen awareness that it is in the NPT &mdash; and in the NPT alone &mdash; that all five declared nuclear weapon states have undertaken a legal obligation to pursue nuclear disarmament in good faith; that this undertaking is of the greatest importance to all non-nuclear weapon states; that it is, therefore, not only legitimate but also right and proper that non-nuclear weapon states should press the nuclear weapon states to expedite action on disarmament pursuant to Article VI; and that reviews can and should serve to inject momentum into negotiations in other fora on measures conducive to nuclear disarmament, measures such as the six listed in the Government motion before us.</P>
    <P>Ireland remains totally committed to nuclear non-proliferation, but we want to go further.  That is why we so strongly advocate progress in the other areas currently under negotiation &mdash; principally the negotiations on a separate treaty to ban all nuclear testing for all time; and the proposals for the negotiation of a treaty banning plutonium production for weapons purposes.  The <Col N="1728" /> achievement of these aims would, be made harder rather than easier by any gambling with the future of the NPT.</P>
    <P>The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty is one of the great achivements of the post-war world and one of the high points of Irish foreign policy.  Its negotiation combined a vision of a denuclearised world with a knowledge of the difficult measures that must be taken to achieve that end.</P>
    <P>International politics has changed immeasurably since the treaty was concluded, but the aims of the NPT remain valid &mdash; to stop the spread of nuclear weapons and to eliminate them entirely from the face of the earth.  We live in a safer world because of the NPT.  We cannot put it in jeopardy.  The Fianna Fáil motion would do just that and I commend the Government amendment to the House.</P>

      <P>I express appreciation to our spokesperson, Deputy Burke, on tabling this motion on behalf of our party.  I am glad the Minister for Foreign Affairs is in the House to hear our genuine views.  This is a new and radical approach by the Fianna Fáil Party, having consulted widely on the matter.  In the past we have not had an opportunity to discuss these issues, especially before a United Nations meeting.  It is important we put our position clearly to the House today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In putting forward this comprehensive motion on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, we are conscious of the historic opportunity that awaits the NPT Extension Review Conference in New York next month to charter a new beginning for mankind, a new millennium free from the threat of nuclear weapons and nuclear power.  We are also conscious of the unique role that Ireland can play as a strong independent <Col N="1729" /> voice in bringing this about.  In proposing this motion, Fianna Fáil wishes to acknowledge, in particular, the role of the late Frank Aiken who, as Minister for Foreign Affairs, first raised the nuclear non-proliferation issue at the UN in 1958.  The Tánaiste stated that our approach would meet strong resistance not only from the major powers, but also from many smaller states.  I would remind him that the late Frank Aiken also met strong resistance, not only from the major powers but from smaller states when he put forward his proposal on this issue some time ago.</P>
    <P>At that time the late Frank Aiken had two objectives, namely, to halt the proliferation of a category of weapons of fearful destructive capacity and to promote nuclear disarmament.  In our motion we recognise the profound attachment of our party through the involvement of the late Frank Aiken, to the NPT.  There has been great change in regard to the NPT since it was first negotiated in the 1960s in an atmosphere of superpower tension and nuclear arms build-up.  Also, there is now peace between the superpowers. By 1990 the NPT had 141 States parties and had become a widely supported arms control measure.  It has now more than 165 States parties and, as nuclear conflict between the major powers no longer threatens our daily lives, we have an enormous responsibility on our shoulders to make a real and substantial breakthrough at the 1995 Review and Extension Conference.</P>
    <P>After 25 years the NPT comes up for extension at a point when the nuclear arms race between the United States and the former Soviet Union has come to a halt and their enormous nuclear arsenals stand to be significantly reduced under the START I and START II Treaties.  It must, nevertheless, be said that nuclear modernisation programmes continue in both countries and it is significant that the nuclear programmes of other nuclear weapons states &mdash; Britain, France and China &mdash; remain untouched by existing arms control <Col N="1730" /> treaties.  Deputy Burke, correctly, referred to the seizure in Germany of nuclear materials stolen and smuggled from the former USSR.  Many questions remain unanswered about the control of nuclear materials following the breakup of the former Soviet Union.  We do not know who holds those potentially dangerous weapons or where they are located.  That is an important point to be addressed during this debate.</P>
    <P>This brings me to the central issue of the conference in accordance with Article X.2.  It will have to decide whether the treaty shall continue in force indefinitely or be extended for an additional period or periods.  This decision will be taken by a majority of the parties to the treaty.  The Government's position is that Ireland, like the European Union, should support the extension of the treaty indefinitely.  This has been the position of successive Governments as far back as 1990.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil Party has decided it is time to adopt a new policy, having consulted widely with non governmental organisations such as Greenpeace. What we believe is required is a new system of global denuclearisation. The Tánaiste stated this is a risky strategy. When the late Frank Aiken put forward his proposals, they were also risky, novel and radical.  Our proposals are targeted, we want to see results and we believe the time is right following the break-up of the former Soviet Union. They are put forward along the lines of stated goals in the field of nuclear disarmament and advocate a common sense approach.  There is no doubt in my mind that the Irish people would be delighted and warmly applaud the Government if, in this crucial nuclear debate, it showed leadership and took a strong stance at EU and UN levels. Many arguments have been put forward about the position of the EU and other countries, but in the past Ireland proudly stood alone in this regard.  Having regard to the new opportunities which exist, the Fianna Fáil motion is realistic and deserves the support of the Government parties.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1731" /> Many non-alilgned countries which, like Ireland, are long-standing advocates of the complete abolition of nuclear weapons have sought to use the leverage that the issue of the extension on the treaty provides to increase the pressure for accelerated disarmament. Why not?  Even before my appointment as Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs I was a strong lobbyist through international fora for a comprehensive test ban treaty.  Such a treaty would realise a major unfulfilled aspiration of the NPT.  That is something we want to see expedited &mdash; and which we think will be &mdash; by advocating our approach.</P>
    <P>We should be showing our solidarity with the non-aligned nuclear weapons states to press the nuclear weapons states to negotiate and conclude a comprehensive test ban.  This would provide adequate security assurances to non-nuclear weapons states in return for having foregone the nuclear weapons option to pursue negotiations on the reduction of nuclear weapons with a view to their ultimate elimination.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil Party believes it is time for the Government to stand by the proud tradition that we as a nation have represented on the question of nuclear power and nuclear weapons.  The time is now right for the Government to take up a position.  The treaty should only be extended for five-year periods with a set of stated goals pronounced at the beginning of each period.</P>
    <P>The adoption and entry into force of the NPT has significantly encouraged horizontal proliferation in several countries. However, there are inherent contradictions and fundamental weaknesses in the treaty.  Nuclear weapons continue to be produced and nuclear modernisation continues.  Nuclear energy is promoted, thus contaminating the environment and threatening present and future generations.  The nuclear industry has failed to manage industrial waste.</P>
    <P>We have seen the safety risks and accidents at Sellafield and Chernobyl. <Col N="1732" /> By supporting this motion the Government could demonstrate and express firmly on behalf of the people, its clear and outright opposition to the Sellafield and THORP monstrosities.  By supporting this motion the Minister for Foreign Affairs has a unique opportunity, in the run up to the 1996 Intergovernmental Conference and the debate on a common defence policy for the European Union, to demonstrate clearly and unequivocally where we stand on the issue of nuclear weapons and power. The time is right to put down a market, to draw a line in the sand, on the question of nuclear power.  It would spell out our outright rejection of the nuclear option in advance of the upcoming critical debate on how Europe's security policy framework should develop.  It is quite alarming to observe the Tánaiste, since the formation of the rainbow Government, in a phased and co-ordinated way over the last number of weeks, making statements which suggest slowly moving this country closer to a European military alliance.  We have heard that we should join the Partnership of Peace.  Will the next step be membership of NATO?</P>
    <P>I wonder what the rank and file of Labour Party members think of this policy. It is clear that the Fine Gael Party is committed to burying, once and for all.  Ireland's traditionally neutral role. This side of the House can only hope that the Democratic Left will call a halt to the covert efforts of this rainbow Government to radically alter our valued foreign policy.  As a nation we will have to play our role in regard to security and the development of a security policy for Europe but we are putting down a market that we will not tolerate any nuclear involvement in that debate. We are saying that we, as a small independent nation with a proud tradition in foreign policy, will be a voice against nuclear weapons.  I appreciate that this is a debate on the NPT but it is relevant to the debate on defence and security of Europe.  We as a party have a particular position and as a party wish to express it today.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1733" /> I call on the Government to support this Fianna Fáil motion which attempts, in a realistic manner, to chart a new and effective non-proliferation course towards a nuclear free 21st century.  If the Government chooses to do so, I am convinced it will have the overwhelming support of the people.  I listened carefully to the Tánaiste who advanced strong arguments mainly based on what we have done in the past.  I appreciate that since 1990 we have taken a particular position, and that is accepted.  Across party lines people have expressed appreciation of the work done by the Minister for Foreign Affairs at the time, Deputy Frank Aitken, in bringing forward the NPT.</P>
    <P>The climate is now right to be brave, to show leadership and to do something different.  The arguments suggesting that we should have an indefinite extension are all very fine.  However, having consulted many non-governmental organisations, especially Greenpeace, we see this as an obvious opportunity for a Government which leads a country totally opposed to nuclear power and weapons to take a particular stance.  This is a comprehensive motion, not just a one line statement.  We are asking the Government parties to seriously consider voting for it tonight.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion and congratulate Deputy Ray Burke on bringing it forward.  This matter transcends party politics.  It is an area where Ireland has traditionally played a leading role among the nations at a time when it might not have been expected of Ireland, when it was not seen quite so frequently on the international stage. That is something about which we can be proud.  The issue of nuclear power is close to the hearts of all our people. Irish people are very concerned about the proliferation of nuclear energy and weapons and would support this motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are sincerely held concerns in Ireland about the extent, control and monitoring of nuclear energy.  It is a <Col N="1734" /> highly technical subject and consequently it is not difficult for technologists to bamboozle us with scientific terms and tell us that there is no threat. One of the problems is that nuclear energy cannot be seen or felt.  People are, therefore, fearful of nuclear energy and it is right that people should be concerned but, again and again, technologists have given assurances that while the levels of nuclear energy have increased and are measurable and quantifiable they are not, neverthless, a threat to the health and lives of our citizens. In this area more than in any other we are depending on scientists and technologists to protect us.</P>
    <P>We on the east coast are particularly vulnerable because of Britain's policy of locating nuclear sites along its north western coast. Britain still pursues this policy along its coast on the other side of the Irish Sea.  As a consequence we have been exposed to a series of dangers over which we have no control. There are regular low level radioactive discharges into the Irish Sea.  If someone suggested this 12 to 14 years ago it would have been argued that they were letting their imagination run riot but we now know that despite the assurances this is the reality and that the discharges can be measured.  Occasionally there are accidental higher level radioactive discharges and, notwithstanding the exchange of information and co-operation, there have been considerable delays in reporting them.  This is totally unacceptable.</P>
    <P>The transportation of products for reprocessing through the Irish Sea is the source of considerable concern both for Members of this House and throughout the community.  It is also at the back of everyone's mind that a serious accident could occur as a result of human error, which would have horrific consquences. While we have all seen the horror movies which portray doomsday we have also seen the horrific effect of the accident at Chernobyl on little children in particular who were made so welcome <Col N="1735" /> here.  This brought home to us the dangers associated with nuclear power.</P>
    <P>Both north and south of the River Liffey but particularly in my constituency of Dublin North-East, many families spend a great deal of their recreational time on stands and beaches which they believe are slowly being contaminated.  They were once clean and safe.  There is widespread concern about the high incidence of cancer, including leukaemia, and the number of miscarriages and abnormal births.</P>
    <P>We have often discussed crime which has been the subject of many studies, investigations and research.  It took the specialists a long time to realise something which was obvious to many people, that crime had a great impact throughout the community.  Along the east coast, on the north side of Dublin in particular, there is concern about the impact and effect of nuclear energy on local communities.  This is a difficult matter to deal with.  The simplest solution is to ensure the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and nuclear energy production plants and to limit their use to essential medical treatments.</P>
    <P>We are not nuclear scientists and find it difficult, as public representatives, to handle or understand these issues but we have access to the scientific evidence relating to the threat posed to public health by emissions from Sellafield and THORP.  In a report issued in 1993 a group of Oxford scientists, led by Dr. Peter Taylor, argued that the new plant would cause 200 deaths from cancer and 10,000 skin cancers thoughout Europe in its first ten years of operation.  This argument was based on scientific knowledge. There is also considerable medical opinion which suggests there is a link between proximity to the plant and the clusters of leukaemia cases both in the United Kingdom and Ireland.  About four years ago Dr. Irene Hillery completed research in the Dundalk area which showed a high level of miscarriages subsequent to a leak from Sellafield. Irish concerns are, therefore, reinforced by informed research.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1736" /> We are told repeatedly that the radioactive discharges are well below acceptable levels.  What level is considered acceptable to the community?  I think one will find that they would like to see the level at zero although I accept it is necessary to use such energy in controlled medical treatments.  There is need for a comprehensive review of the monitoring system, strong independent research, assurance and an action plan to phase out nuclear plants in the interests of mankind.</P>
    <P>Given public concern about nuclear energy I strongly support the proposals put forward by my party's spokesperson on Foreign Affairs, Deputy Burke, who contends that the treaty should only be extended for five year periods with a set of stated goals pronounced at the beginning of each period.  We strongly support his call for global denuclearisation, including halting all nuclear weapons production, the modernisation and deployment of nuclear weapons, agreement on a schedule to achieve zero nuclear weapons and implementation of a complete ban on the separation, production and use of all plutonium and highly enriched uranium and establisment of an effective agency to monitor and control all weapons usable nuclear materials.</P>
    <P>We strongly support Deputy Burke's motion.  It will strike a chord with the people who want to see us take action in this area.  They know we have difficulties with Britain in this regard and that Britain has persisted in proceeding with its nuclear policy, notwithstanding the great dangers not only to its population but to ours particularly on the east coast.  I ask the House to strongly support this motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch" hpid="Kathleen Lynch Kathleen Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Kathleen Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I have sympathy with Deputy Burke's motion because, as Deputy Woods has just said, when one comes face to face with the reality of nuclear destruction, it is easy to campaign on the need to eliminate nuclear power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some years ago we were fortunate to have had the Secretary of CND Ireland, Adi Roche, living in Cork.  Having heard about the Chernobyl accident she <Col N="1737" /> travelled there and discovered the horrors of that region.  Since then we have accommodated a great number of children and their carers from Chernobyl in Cork city and throughout the country. Approximately one month ago one of the children who came here for treatment as a result of the Chernobyi accident died.  She was a young child, just starting out in life but had spent the majority of her childhood in hospital. Her parents and uncle travelled to Ireland to take her small body back home to an area so contaminated, the people living there know that their quality of life and chances of survival are extremely limited.</P>
    <P>That is the reality of nuclear power. We have not used our advances in technology to benefit mankind but to virtually destroy entire areas.  I speak not only about human beings but also vegetation and all other life forms.  I am a little puzzled, therefore, by the motion coming from the sources that it does although I do not dismiss it on that account.  It is an excellent motion and one which we should take on board.</P>

      <Quest>the date on which a matter (details supplied) in County Wexford was first referred to the Attorney General by the Circuit Court; the reason for the time lapse; the reason four letters seeking resolution of the matter to successive Attorneys General on behalf of the party affected have to date received no substantive reply; if the business mentioned will be swiftly completed; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[4993/95]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy to inform <Col N="1738" /> the Deputy that this case has at last been dealt with in a positive manner and a number of associated cases are also being dealt with.  This is a direct result of Deputy Byrne's representations and the Dáil question, and is testimony to the effectiveness of the parliamentary question system in tackling the problem of delays in public administration.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware from the letter dated 6 March 1995 which he received from the Attorney General, it is not the practice of his office to furnish details of the progress of applications for waiver in escheated estate cases such as this, particularly when there is a solicitor on record for the applicants.  It should be noted that the utmost care and consideration must always be taken in dealing with escheated estates to ensure that when waivers are granted, no subsequent case can be brought against the State.  I assure the Deputy that steps have been taken in the Department of Finance to ensure that such a delay will not arise again.</P>
      <P>The case which is the subject of the Deputy's question was brought to the attention of the Attorney General by letter dated 4 February 1993 from a firm of solicitors informing him of the existence of the proceedings, which comprised an application to the Circuit Court by the solicitors' clients under the Trustee Acts for the directions of the court as to the disposal of certain funds. The court had given those directions on 22 July 1992.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the same day that the solicitors' letter was received namely, 9 February 1993 the Attorney General's office referred the matter to the Chief State Solicitor's office for investigation.  The Chief State Solicitor's office then entered into correspondence with the solicitors for the purpose of obtaining necessary information about the trust, which involved interests in property dating back to the 1890s.  The trustees have been unable to trace any persons who would be entitled to a part of the trust and, therefore, the court held that the State was legally entitled to that part as ultimate intestate successor by virtue of <Col N="1739" /> section 73 (2) of the Succession Act, 1965.  The Attorney General's function in the matter when he was notified of the court's order of 22 July 1992 was confined to investigating the claims and making a recommendation to the Minister for Finance as to whether the Minister should waive, in whole or in part, the entitlement of the State in favour of the parties who were entitled to the remainder of the trust property.</P>
    <P>The information which was needed before the Attorney General could make a recommendation to the Minister for Finance took time to obtain because of the complexity of the case and all the necessary information was not finally obtained from the solicitors until 21 January 1994.  On 10 March 1994 the Chief State Solicitor's office submitted the papers to the Attorney General for his recommendations.  These were given by him and were conveyed to the Department of Finance by the Chief State Solicitor on 20 May 1994.  At the same time, the solicitors were informed of that fact. The Attorney General had no further function in the matter after that.  The Chief State Solicitor's office on 19 March 1995 conveyed the final waiver to the solicitors for the applicants.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased with the response and I sincerely hope this business is concluded.  Given the disturbing laxity in the way the Attorney General's office conducts its business, will the Taoiseach promise to end a practice whereby one is refused the name of the official dealing with a matter on the grounds that, as the Government's legal adviser, the Attorney General's advice is only for the Government?  Will the Taoiseach accept that is the general excuse offered for stonewalling on routine matters such as this?  It is ridiculous and underlines the unresolved conflict between the Attorney General's responsibility to the Government and his responsibility to the public?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's question is based on a misapprehension.  The <Col N="1740" /> delay in the case was not in the Attorney Generals office.  As I outlined at some length, the delay was in the Department of Finance.  The Attorney General's recommendations were conveyed quite promptly to the Department of Finance in May 1994, but the Department did not come to a decision to act on it until 10 March 1995.  That was due to misfiling of the case.  As a result of the Deputy's question, not only has this case been dealt with effectively but cetain policy questions that were holding up 17 other cases were also brought to light and are being dealt with.  It is in that context I express my appreciation of the value of Deputy Byrne's question, but he is mistaken in directing criticism at the Attorney Generals office in this case because it is not warranted.</P>

      <P>I undertook on 14 February to consider the suggestion of Deputy Harney to invite community representatives from Northern Ireland to accompany Ministers on visits abroad for St. Patrick's Day.  There would have been considerable difficulty in arranging for the inclusion of balanced representation at the various events.  In the circumstances I did not proceed with the suggestion, although I appreciate the Deputy's constructive spirit in putting it forward.</P>

      <P>If I were to bring representatives of political parties with me I would have to start by inviting Deputy Harney, Deputy Ahern and others to come.  The same applies to all Ministers. The next step presumably would be to invite representatives from the Unionist and Nationalist parties in Northern Ireland and the delegation would be cumbersome.  There is value in what the Deputy said if we can find appropriate events and occasions to include Northern representatives.  I welcome, in particular, the fact that all the parties in Northern Ireland were invited to the dinner in the White House which I attended.  I was very pleased that not only were Nationalist parties represented but the Alliance Party in the person of its leader, Dr. John Alderdice and the Ulster Democratic Party in the person of its representatives, including Mr. Gary McMichael.  That is good and something I would encourage.</P>

      <P>The Deputy's question of 14 February referred to representatives of both communities in Northern Ireland.  I think in that sense it means political representatives as elections are the means of creating the fact of representation.  There would <Col N="1742" /> have been practical difficulties in pursuing the proposal which was made without notice by the Deputy at Question Time.  Rather than simply saying that I would not consider it, I undertook to consider it which I did.  I came across practical difficulties in the Deputy's proposal to include them on all ministerial trips abroad, but there are other forms of occasion which we should be looking at constantly where it would be possible to include community representatives of one kind or another from Northern Ireland in activities sponsored by the Government abroad.  I will ask my colleagues to look at this in a constructive spirit.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach referred to the attendance of Dr. Alderdice and Gary McMichael at the White House festivities.

The fact that I did not find it practical at the end of the day does not mean I have done nothing about it.  I considered it carefully but found it to be impractical. However, I took the step of contacting the Minister for Tourism and Trade who was also attending functions in the United States and he decided to invite Lord Rathcavan, chairman of the Northern Ireland Tourist Board, to take part.  That was not possible but Mr. Henderson, its chief executive took part.  That was a direct practical result of the exchange which the Deputy and I had on 14 February.</P>

I intend to visit the Irish War Memorial Park at Islandbridge on 15 April &mdash; the 50th anniversary of the liberation of Bergen-Belsen concentration camp by Allied troops &mdash; for a ceremony in honour of all those Irish people who died in the Second World War. When the arrangements for the visit are put in place in consultation with the Office of Public Works and the War Memorial Committee, I will be very happy to consider who might appropriately be invited.  I will, of course, invite representatives of the British Legion and survivors of Belsen concentration camp and other concentration camps who now live in Ireland.</P>
      <P>I also propose to visit the Irish Jewish Museum on 27 April on Holocaust Remembrance Day.  The necessary arrangements are being made in consultation with the committee of the museum.</P>
      <P>I propose to include reference to the 50th anniversary of the end of the Second World War and those who died in its course in the proclamation to be read by me at the opening of the national day of commemoration on 9 July.</P>

      <P>I am pleased with the Taoiseach's response.  Is the Government involved in arranging the ceremony at the Irish War Memorial Park or is the Taoiseach attending it as head of Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am arranging it and am visiting the Irish War Memorial Park as head of Government, the details of which are being arranged by the Office of Public Works.  I wish to pay tribute to those who died in the Second World War.  I feel very strongly that this <Col N="1745" /> involved the combined sacrifice of people from both traditions on both parts of this island.  The defeat of Nazi tyranny was one of the great achievements of the 20th century and many Irish people played a major part in it. It is important that we remember this anniversary and we can share a sense of pride in complete harmony with those of the Unionist tradition on this island.</P>
      <P>I hope my visit to the Irish War Memorial Park will show people of the Unionist tradition that we appreciate the sacrifices that many in the Nationalist tradition shared with them in this great achievement, namely the ending of the Second World War and the Fascist tyranny on the continent of Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased by what the Taoiseach said but I am still somewhat confused.  I accept he is visiting it to pay his tribute but will a ceremony he held there which others can attend? Will people be invited to attend and if so, will it be organised by his Department?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is being organised by my Department in conjunction with the Office of Public Works.  The details, which will probably be very simple, have not been worked out in great depth.  It will be basically a visit and some remarks will be made.  I had occasion to pay tribute at the forum to my constituency colleague, who was then Minister of State at the Department of Finance, for the way the Office of Public Works maintains the Garden of Remembrance, one of the most beautiful in the country.  It is appropriate from every point of view that the existence of the garden should be brought to the attention of the public not just for its intrinsic beauty but, more importantly, for the magnificent achievement it commemorates &mdash; an achievement which brings together people from all traditions on this island. I hope this gesture on our part will be seen in a positive light north of the Border by people who might feel we do not appreciate as fully as we really do the value of their tradition and sacrifice.</P>

      <P>I have, on a number of occasions, since my appointment as Taoiseach, stated my views on the equal rights and legitimacy of the two main traditions on this island and the need to achieve agreement and reconciliation between them.</P>
      <P>While the Government has no plans to mark the bi-centenary of the founding of the Orange Order, we would, of course, give very careful consideration to any proposals the Orange Order might wish to make.</P>
      <P>I am not aware that any official commemoration of the anniversaries of the Ancient Order of Hibernians has taken place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Given the significance of the Orange Order to the Unionist community and that it has branches in Donegal and Monaghan, will the Taoiseach consider meeting representatives of the Orange Order to explore what the Government might do to commemorate the bi-centenary?  I accept what he said about the Ancient Order of Hibernians. We are trying to achieve parity of esteem and peace and reconciliation on this island.  It may be an opportunity, even though a postage stamp one, to commemorate the Orange Order in that way and show respect for the other tradition on this island.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As I am sure the Deputy is aware, Young Fine Gael has made suggestions in this regard.  I am aware of the views which have been expressed that this should be done.  It is important to maintain parity of esteem. The Ancient Order of Hibernians and the Orange Order are more or less equivalent.  Both have a significant religious content to their work and <Col N="1747" /> arose in particular historical circumstances. I am willing to look in a reasonably open-minded way at any suggestions made.  It is important that the suggestions should come from the Orange Order concerned rather than from others who are seeking to make a point by referring to them.  The Orange Orders are the ones who might appropriately say what they would like and it would be for the Government to consider what it could do, if anything, in response.  I would prefer to pass the question back to the Orange Order and ask it to say what it is interested in doing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 5 to 12, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>My visit to the US from 14 March to 21 March had four main objectives: to get to know the President, others in the US Administration and the Congressional leadership; to achieve the maximum US backing for the peace process, including the Framework Document; to promote Ireland's economic interests by the development of US-Ireland commercial investment and tourism links and to maintain the closest possible contact with Irish-America and with the wider American audience with a view to maintaining and enhancing all that is best in the Irish-American relationship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My objectives were achieved through my meetings with President Clinton initially at a lunch hosted by Speaker Gingrich, at a working meeting with the President where he was accompanied by Vice-President Gore, Secretary of State Mr. Christopher and National Security Adviser Mr. Tony Lake and at a St. Patrick's evening function which the <Col N="1749" /> President and Mrs. Clinton were kind enough to host in honour of my wife and me.</P>
    <P>In addition, I had a meeting with the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. The lunch which the Speaker of the House attended involved the attendance of many other speakers of Congress and, through these two events and the good offices of Senator Kennedy.  I met almost one-third of the members of the Senate.  Among those I met at these functions were the majority and minority leaders in both Houses of the Congress. I was particularly gratified that on all occasions the attendance was balanced as between Republicans and Democrats.</P>
    <P>At all my meetings with the President, members of his Administration and members of Congress, I availed of the opportunity to bring them fully up-to-date on the peace process and to thank President Clinton and his colleagues for their contribution to what has been achieved.  The continuing support of the President and in a bipartisan way of the US Congress is an important element in the process as it goes forward. It is my intention to ensure that the US role will be maintained and as necessary, enhanced, as we move towards achieveing lasting peace and reconciliation.</P>
    <P>The objective of promoting our economic interests was achieved through meetings with the Ireland-US Council for Commerce and Industry in New York at which I had an opportunity to address about 250 people involved in Irish-American commercial relations; the Ireland-America Economic Advisory Board whose meeting in Washington on 17 March I chaired.  The meeting was attended by the chief executive officers or chairmen of 14 leading US corporations and heard particularly interesting reports on the development of tourism and the IFSC in Dublin.  On the agricultural side, opportunities for co operation between the University of Missouri and agricultural research institutes in Ireland were explored. <Col N="1750" /> While Ireland and the US are competitors in world agricultural markets, I see major opportunities for co-operation and indeed for learning in areas such as information technology as applied to price forecasting, genetics and the improved presentation and preservation of food.  I had a meeting with Senator George Mitchell who has been entrusted by President Clinton with the organisation of the forthcoming White House conference on trade and investment in Ireland.  Our meeting focused on specific ways in which Irish companies might benefit from partnership and other networking relationships with US companies.  Furthermore, I had a meeting with the EU ambassador to the US on bilateral EU/US economic relationships.</P>
    <P>The objective of maintaining contact with Irish-America and the wider American community was achieved through meeting 400 representatives of Irish-American organisations in New York; attending and speaking at the Irish America magazine top 100 function attended by about 300 people; attending functions in Chicago organised in my honour by the Gaelic Park committee on the south-side of the city and by the Irish American Heritage Center on the north-side of Chicago.</P>
    <P>I also had a briefing with Irish-American media representatives.  I gave numerous radio and television interviews, including on ABC coast to coast and CNN international stations.  I spoke at the St. Patrick's Day lunch of the National Press Club, which was broadcast coast to coast.  I briefed major US papers, including the <i>New York Times, Wall Street Journal, Boston Globe</i> and the <i>St. Louis Post Dispatch.</i></P>
    <P>Dealing with specific points raised in questions, the party which accompanied me consisted of my wife, the secretary of my Department, my special adviser, the second secretary of the Department of Foreign Affairs, the Government Press Secretary, my private secretary and a security officer.</P>
    <P>I met and spoke briefly with Mr. Gary McMichael of the UDP at the White <Col N="1751" /> House function hosted in honour of my wife and me on St. Patrick's Day.</P>
    <P>In informal contacts with the US Administration in advance of my visit, it was made clear on my behalf that invitations to the White House were entirely a matter for the US authorities and that I would have no difficulty with the President of Sinn Féin being included.  As Deputies will be aware, I have met him on many occasions since becoming Taoiseach.  As far as fundraising in the US by Sinn Féin was concerned. I made it clear that this was also a decision for the US authorities who were, of course, aware that there are no obstacles to Sinn Féin fundraising in this jurisdiction or indeed Britain.</P>
    <P>Overall, I am satisfied that the visit achieved the objectives which I set and will contribute, as similar visits by my predecessors have done to the achievement of our political, economic, social and cultural objectives.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Taoiseach on his extensive visit.  It will be a lesson to him not to be so cynical about visits by a Taoiseach and Ministers to St. Patrick's Day parades abroad.  What steps did the Taoiseach take when in the United States to get political dialogue going again, particularly since he stated that his second objective was to move forward on the Framework Document?  I assume there was total support from all sides in the United States for that document and that the objective was reiterated in the course of his visit.  Some weeks after its publication, what initiatives did the Taoiseach suggest to the United States President, and other political leaders? What initiatives did he achieve in moving forward discussions on the Framework Document?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In practice moves to get discussions going on the Framework Document will take place in Ireland or in Britain, that is where the primary focus will be, because that is where the people who need to talk to one another <Col N="1752" /> live.  In the United States I availed of the opportunity to explain the underlying philosophy of the Framework Document, a document which is quite complex in its elaboration but quite simple in its purpose which is to enable two communities with radically different loyalties to share the same piece of ground while each feels that their respective loyalty remains respected by the institutions under which they live. That is quite simple or easy to explain to American audiences and has application not just to the conflict in Northern Ireland but to conflicts worldwide, such as those in Bosnia, Estonia and Romania. Any number of places in which the United States has interests have problems which could be solved by the method we are seeking to solve the problem in Northern Ireland.  I was very happy to have the opportunity of explaining the Framework Document to a wider audience.</P>
      <P>To revert to Deputy Ahern's specific question, as far as talks between the parties are concerned, the real work has to begin.  I am satisfied that the influence of all the activity in the United States over the past week will have been entirely good in bringing the respective positions of the parties who are not talking to one another as fully as they ought &mdash; because of the remaining difficulties about the decommissioning of arms &mdash; closer together and brought closer the day that that will no longer be a problem or road-block in discussion.  Certainly my contacts with President Clinton, and my media comments on all of that, were designed to get both sides, not just one, to make movement on this very important question of arms, the subject of a subsequent question.  In summary, the real work of getting talks going has to begin here at home; it is not something someone else can do for us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the American authorities consult the Irish Government before Mr. Adams's visa was issued for fund raising?  Is the Taoiseach concerned at the extent of the coverage Mr. <Col N="1753" /> Adams's visit received?  Given that such emphasis is placed on the democratic mandate, that the difference in votes between the Alliance and Sinn Féin parties at the last Westminister election was 1 per cent, whereas the disparity of the media coverage was much greater, would the Taoiseach agree that the arms issue was the reason so much United States' coverage was given to the leader of Sinn Féin?  Did the Taoiseach avail of the opportunity while in the United States to speak to the leader of Sinn Féin privately on this issue?  Was the Taoiseach aware that British Minister. Mr. Ancram, was meeting the UDP and PUP this morning and was his Government consulted about that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first part of the question is &ldquo;yes&rdquo;, we were consulted.  On the question of pressing Mr. Adams privately as well as publicly on the question of decommissioning of arms while I was in the United States, the answer to that is also &ldquo;yes&rdquo;; that is an important question. However, it is not the only item on the agenda.  In everything I said I made it clear that there are at least four areas where movement forward is necessary, this is one of them and this movement is required on the part of Sinn Féin as well as by the British Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as the last part of the Deputy's question, the meeting with Loyalist political parties at British Government ministerial level, is concerned, I understand the reason that meeting was taking place is that they have moved forward their position on the decommissioning of arms to a more advanced stage than that taken by Sinn Féin to date.  The loyalists have met the requirements being sought by the British Government in terms of willingness to discuss the issue and this is positive. On the ceasefire, the decision taken by the IRA to introduce a ceasefire at end of August last year was a very difficult and courageous one and led to a loyalist ceasefire in October last.  I am hoping that on this occasion, if the loyalists take a more advanced position on the <Col N="1754" /> decommissioning of arms, in turn, that may lead to some movement on the other side.  The important point is that, while the process may seem painfully slow, we are all moving in the same direction at present and that is good.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Last year the previous Government was berated because of its involvement in the granting of a visa to Mr. Adams to visit the United States at that time by some people from the Taoiseach's side of the House.  Would the Taoiseach accept that that decision was a correct one in order to push the peace process ahead?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I would unambiguously accept that, it was the correct decision.  When speaking in the White House, in praising President Clinton for his role in that decision.  I made it clear there were others, including myself, who had doubts about it at the time, but it was the right decision; I readily concede that point.  I wish to express my appreciation of and gratitude to Deputy Dermot Ahern for his work as chairperson of the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Taoiseach's acknowledgement of the change from his position of last year, when he was critical of that decision.  Will he outline what he perceives to be the substantive differences on the decommissioning of arms by loyalists and republicans because I do not perceive the subtleties &mdash; I do not want to make an issue of it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is the first time I have heard anybody say they understand the subtleties involved.  The British Government would do better not to engage in any political games.  Having set out their position, with which I do not disagree &mdash; that the decommissioning of arms in a certain way has to be on the agenda &mdash; to engage in political games about it <Col N="1755" /> will not help.  I have never heard of any substantive difference.</P>
    <P>While accepting what the Taoiseach said about the difficulties with regard to Strand I and understanding the inappropriate timing of Strand III, would the Taoiseach agree that the contents of the Framework Document primarily are about Strand II, which is his initiative or call?  It is on that aspect I should like him to reply.  Several weeks after its publication and the Taoiseach's good work in the United States, including his ongoing contacts, and those of the Tánaiste, with the British Government, would he agree that inaction on Strand II could be unhelpful?  Would be agree there is a clear opportunity afforded the Irish Government, in developing talks on the Framework Document &mdash; within the context of what has already been substantially agreed under Strand II &mdash; to move the process forward, thus removing the logjam created under Strand I?  Does the Taoiseach see the benefit of so doing?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do, undoubtedly.  In practical terms, there would be no difficulty in arranging a meeting tomorrow morning with the Alliance Party, the SDLP or Sinn Féin; the difficulty is to get meaningful discussions going with the Unionists and that is a practical fact. It is important to issue invitations only when one knows they will be accepted, and not get ourselves into circumstances in which there would be stand-offs, when the contacts continuing at a lower level might be adversely affected by public disgreement.</P>
      <P>I am continuing to explore informal contacts with a view to finding when it would be most appropriate to make more formal contacts to discuss Strand II.  I agree with Deputy Ahern that Strand II is where the Government has a legitimate right to enter into discussion with the parties in Northern Ireland. Strand I was a different matter.  In that context, I will be happy to have discussions with all the parties in Northern Ireland, but the timing is a matter for political judgement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree that the significant difference in the approach to arms between the former loyalist paramilitaries and Sinn Féin is that the loyalists have agreed to deal with what they call &ldquo;illegal arms&rdquo; and that Sinn Féin is still talking about the arms legally held by the British Army and the RUC?  Will the Taoiseach agree with my concern that the visit of Mr. Adams to the United States received far more coverage here and abroad than the Taoiseach's visit and is he concerned about that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know how publicity is measured.  Perhaps one visitor might have got more publicity than the other in the United States print media, but on television the position was the reverse.  That does not concern me.  The important matter is that we are making progress at the highest and lowest levels in moving the process forward and we should not be too worried about media coverage.  I endorse what Deputy Harney said about the importance of the mandate of Dr. John Alderdice's Alliance Party.  That was acknowledged at the White House as was the mandate of Mr. John Hume.  I will not get into the semantics of the nuances in the difference between the loyalist and Sinn Féin position on arms.  There is a movement on both sides.  Even today I am aware of significant productive movement on this issue and I believe it will bear fruit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To answer Deputies Ahern and Harney on the arms question, the important thing we are seeking is not any particular form of words, but a sense that the people sitting at the table are serious about dealing with this issue soon; that they are not there to talk about it while gaining concessions on other issues and at the end of the agenda to apologise and say they do not have a mandate to do anything about it.  They must be willing to engage seriously in discussions on this issue.  What is in question is a judgement on people's seriousness about this issue.  If people say they cannot deal with the question of arms, one must <Col N="1757" /> question to some degree what they are able to deal with.  If this issue cannot be dealt with, we must all worry because the amount of arms available is substantial. It is not just a question of what might satisfy the British.  The representatives of the communities who have been the victims of violence must be satisfied on this issue.  They are the people whose sensitivities need to be taken into account.  The people of Greysteel want to know that the arms used there are out of commission just as the people of the Shankill want to know that semtex is also out of commission. We are not talking about simply military logistics, but about the feelings of people and the need to show symbolically and clearly that not only is the violence over but that the instruments of violence are no longer relevant to political dialogue, that they and the potential of their use are removed from dialogue and that the dialogue will take place &ldquo;on a level playing field&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I do not disagree with what the Taoiseach stated.  On the decomissioning of arms, I understand that the talks with the loyalists will start and decommissioning of arms is on the agenda, and that in upcoming talks with Sinn Féin the decommissioning of arms is also on the agenda.  Had the Taoiseach an opportunity to speak with Mr. Gary McMichael to ascertain his views on a possible timeframe for moving forward on the Framework Document? Did he indicate his support or otherwise for that process?</P>

      <P>Unfortunately my conversation with Mr. Gary McMichael in the White House was very short and it was not possible to have a substantive discussion &mdash; I met him on a receiving line.

      <P>I accept that perhaps all the parties in Northern Ireland would not want to sit at the table.  Based on the position achieved by the end of <Col N="1758" /> 1992 and recent statements made by the parties before and after the publication of the Framework Document that they would not be afraid to restate their positions, will the Taoiseach use this House today to invite those parties to consider continuing the peace process and using the Framework Document as a basis for discussion?  I accept that invitations may be issued only once, but now that the Framework Document has been published and recent visits to the United States have successfully moved the process forward and ministerial talks have been announced with loyalists and are about to be announced with republicans, perhaps it would be an appropriate time for the Taoiseach to seek the good offices of the parties in Northern Ireland to move the process back to at least the level of bilateral discussions with the Irish Government, the Taoiseach or the Tánaiste rather than waiting any longer.</P>

I do not want to issue formal invitations for the reasons I have already given at great length.  I am maintaining informal contact with them and, from my knowledge. I understand some of them will come forward with other ideas in the near future.  We should be willing to talk to them on their ground as well as asking them to talk to us on ours.</P>

      <P>On media coverage I am surprised at the Taoiseach's comment, because it concerns me that the Taoiseach and those who are a voice for moderation in Northern Ireland, like Dr. John Alderdice and Mr. John Hume, received so little media coverage. That also surprised and disappointed many people in Northern Ireland.  Will the Taoiseach agree that the most powerful way to move the process forward is to deal seriously with the arms issue and not talk about it as if it is just one other issue?  If we are to get the Unionists involved and expect them <Col N="1759" /> to trust those who waged a campaign against their community the arms issue must become the number one priority. The IRA was the arms aggressor and it must be involved in the process first. Does the Taoiseach agree with that and what steps does he intend to take to ensure that this matter is not just seen as an additional item, but one which is fundamental if we are to become involved in all-party talks?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>On the second part of the Deputy's question, everything I have been doing in the United States and in previous contacts with the parties involved has been designed to sort out the arms issue to ensure it is no longer a block on other issues.  I have been involved daily in trying to move forward on that.  As Deputy Ahern pointed out, the position has inched forward and is close to resolution.  We should not worry too much about media coverage. It is ephemeral.  Very often people forget what television programme they saw yesterday.  The important thing is that one is making substantial progress on things of lasting importance.</P>

      <P>On the question of arms decommissioning I welcome what the Tánaiste said yesterday, in reply to me, that it was one of a myriad of issues which had to be addressed and addressed quickly.  That is the right approach being adopted by the Government. In relation to contact with the Unionist community will the Taoiseach accept, because of the euphoria engendered by the visits to America by himself and others, that there has been a sidelining or a marginalising of some of the smaller Unionist representatives &mdash; the PUP and the UDP &mdash; who have taken a major step towards resolving this problem?  Will the Taoiseach accept the need for the Irish Government to put the hand out to such parties to show they are not being marginalised by the wave of euphoria?</P>

      <P>I have put the hand <Col N="1760" /> out to them and will continue to do so. The arms issue is not just one of a hundred issues; it is one of the three or four most important issues and holds the key to movement on a number of other questions.  We should not diminish its important.  It is a significant issue but not the only one.  There is also prisoner release, policing and the absence of substantive talks between the parties.  I identified those as the four main points in response to questions in the United States and I would hold to that view.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13 and 14 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I attended the United Nations World Summit on Social Development in Copenhagen on 12 March 1995.  The purpose of the summit was to agree on a co-ordinated approach to three key issues for the developed and developing world &mdash; poverty, unemployment and social exclusion.  This was the first time that a majority of the world's heads of <Col N="1761" /> state or government have come together for this purpose.</P>
    <P>We agreed at the summit on a declaration and programme of action which I have had laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas in its existing, unconsolidated form, with a copy of my address to the summit.  The consolidated text will be presented as soon as it becomes available.</P>
    <P>The declaration and programme of Action are designed to spell out the political commitment which the member countries of the United Nations have made to the goal of promoting social development and social integration.  The terms of the declaration are necessarily general in character.  They comprise ten commitments covering the need to develop an environment to enable people to achieve social development, the eradication of absolute poverty, the promotion of full employment, the protection of human rights, the achievement of full equality and equity between women and men, the pursuit of equitable access to the highest attainable standards of social services, the acceleration of the development of Africa and the least developed countries, the inclusion of social development goals in structural adjustment programmes, the allocation of appropriate resources to social development and the improvement of international co-operation for social development, especially through the United Nations.</P>
    <P>These commitments, and the supporting principles and suggested actions are, to a very considerable degree, already reflected in public policy in Ireland.  I stressed, in my address to the summit, our commitment to achieving the UN target of 0.7 per cent of GNP in overseas development aid and the progress we are making towards that objective.  I also stressed our support for the &ldquo;20/20&rdquo; formula for investing in social development, whereby 20 per cent of developed countries' ODA and 20 per cent of developing countries' national budgets would be allocated to basic social programmes. In addition, I expressed <Col N="1762" /> strong support for bringing a fresh mind to debt issues, including debt cancellation, and for taking action on multilateral debt, including through the possible sale of IMF gold reserves.  There was some progress on the debt issue at the summit.</P>
    <P>At national level, the objectives set out in the declaration are already central to this Government's programme and the Programme for Competitiveness and Work.  The declaration and programme require each member country to produce, by 1996, a statement of strategy in support of the achievement of the goals of the summit.  I will be taking steps to have such a statement prepared for Ireland.  It will, of course, be for individual Ministers and Departments to pursue the relevant aspects of the declaration.  In particular, my colleague the Minister for Social Welfare has indicated his intention to bring forward proposals to ensure that our commitments in relation to the elimination of absolute poverty and the reduction in inequalities is reflected in the ongoing development of public policy.</P>
    <P>It will be my intention to lay before the House, in due course, the statement of measures which will be compiled to indicate Ireland's compliance with the terms of the declaration.</P>
    <P>As well as participating in the main business of the summit, I availed of the opportunity to hold bilateral meetings with the Presidents of Uganda and Latvia, the Prime Ministers of Spain, Denmark, Iceland and Luxembourg and the President of the European Commission. I also met representatives of Irish NGOs attending the summit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Government support the cancellation of the debt of some of the poorest countries?  I understand from newspaper reports that some of these issues went to formal votes.  The Taoiseach reiterated the UN target of 0.7 per cent of GNP in ODA &mdash; a point I made at the World Bank several times. In the last few years Ireland has worked hard to find the extra funds with little benefit.  Last year, the previous year and <Col N="1763" /> again this year the Government put substantial funds into ODA.  Has the Taoiseach any idea when Ireland will reach its target of 0.7 per cent?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Ireland supports the cancellation of debt.  To be fair, we do not have any debt to cancel so we are not exactly in a position of making a noble gesture.  We have always been urging others to cancel the debt owed to them by the Third World.  I would not make too much of our position on this issue.  As far as the target of 0.7 per cent is concerned we have made exemplary progress in the last three years.  I do not think any country in Europe, with the possible exception of Denmark, has done as much to increase overseas development aid as we have done in the last three years.  Instead of saying what I except we will be doing in the year 2005, 2010, or some other similarly meaningless statement, it is more appropriate to say I hope that we will be able to further increase our provision next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Taoiseach that it is always difficult, based on budgetary constraints, to achieve the target.  As I was involved with the NGOs, the World Bank and some of the funding agencies I suggest we are quite good at paying over our resources, in so far as we can, but other countries are very good at using those resources for various contracts which we have not achieved.  I was involved in the process but did not complete it.  I ask the Taoiseach, or the relevant person with responsibility for ODA in the Department of Foreign Affairs, to follow up that matter because many of the other countries who speak about their contribution to ODA are the beneficiaries of very substantial contracts.  This is an issue worth following up.  Following the summit how will global poverty be effectively tackled?  Is there a clear line of attack by the large countries or are there continuous disagreements at the World Bank?  Like the Copenhagen summit is there still much disagreement, <Col N="1764" /> a lot of talking by the big boys and little action?</P>

      <P>One of the good characteristics of Irish aid is that it is not driven to an overwhelming extent by Irish commercial interests.  Much of the so called overseas development aid of other countries is just an extended version of their own trade and exports policy. Substantial contracts are given to Irish companies in the context of some of our overseas development assistance. This is done in a way consistent with the overall objectives of the assistance.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is aware of how UN conferences work.  For example, the former US President, Mr. Bush, would not sign a declaration on.  I think biodiversity but it went ahead, and when President Clinton came into office he signed it.  These declarations become part of the official thinking in the world and while they do not yield results the following day or year they gradually become absorbed into public policy.</P>
      <P>I raised two issues with President Clinton &mdash; Northern Ireland and the need for the United States to maintain its financial contributions to the UN and UN peacekeeping.  It is very important that the largest democracy in the world should continue to support the multilateral system for dealing with disputes and should not retreat into any form of economic or social isolation.</P>

      <P>The advent of the peace process has transformed international perceptions of Ireland as a holiday destination and has enabled my Department and its Northern counterpart to encourage Bord Fáilte and the Northern Ireland Tourist Board to work closer together in selling the island abroad. This year the two industries, north and south of the Border, supported by the two tourist boards, have collaborated together in selling the island of Ireland abroad in four principal markets, namely, the US, Britain, France and Germany.  It is a welcome step and one which is long overdue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The development of closer working <Col N="1766" /> relationships between Ministers, Departments and tourism agencies, North and South, will be my objective. By co-operating and pooling our resources, we can help to increase our impact in the marketplace and thereby deliver substantial growth to the tourism industry.</P>
    <P>My immediate objective is to see that substantial benefits derive from our current co-operative efforts.  Success in exploiting our common strengths will help us to undertake more fundamental assessments of our tourism relationships and see what structures are most appropriate for future growth and development. An evolutionary approach, such as I have described, will provide a sound basis for joint work in the future.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will, of course, be aware that the recent Framework Agreement proposes a North-South body, comprising elected representatives from, and accountable to, a Northern Ireland Assembly and the Irish Parliament.  It is envisaged that this will deal with matters designated by the two Governments in the first instance in agreement with the relevant political parties.  While tourism is not specifically mentioned in the framework agreement, the illustrative executive functions identified therein, such as marketing and promotion activities abroad, clearly could comprehend the activity currently undertaken by the two tourist boards.  That, however, would be a matter for discussion and possible agreement with the various parties at the appropriate time. The Deputy will also be aware that the lead role in proposals in the framework agreement lies with the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, I and my Department plan to continue working with our Northern colleagues at an operational level to improve the prospects for tourism development on the island as a whole.</P>

Last week in New York, where there were a number of public functions I invited Mr. Ian Henderson, the chief executive of the Northern Ireland Tourist Board, to be a member of our group.

      <P>My Department's projections, which were arrived at after careful analysis, lead us to believe that the dividend from the peace process will be approximately £100 million per year, £80 million of which will be generated in Northern Ireland and £20 million of which will be generated in the South. Today Baroness Denton announced new tourist figures for Northern Ireland in terms of northern tourists visiting the <Col N="1768" /> South and southern tourists visiting the North.  Last year 400,000 visitors from the Republic visited Northern Ireland and 125,000 of these were holiday visitors. She went on to say that there were 15,000 more holiday visitors between September and December of last year than was expected and that this was as a direct result of the ceasefire.  Thousands of day visitors also availed of the opportunity to visit Northern Ireland which had been assumed to be off limits for the past 25 years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 27 and 37 together.</P>
      <P>Ireland's reputation as an important tourist destination has been achieved by hard work and excellent marketing over a considerable number of years and I would of course be concerned at developments, such as an unbalanced reporting of crimes against tourists in Ireland, which might damage that reputation.</P>
      <P>In this regard, I am pleased to report that over the past year or so there has been a very significant decline in the level of negative publicity, both at home and abroad, arising from such crimes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen" hpid="Mr. Killeen Mr. Killeen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister have a means of monitoring and countering bad publicity either within his Department or through Bord Fáilte?  I am sure he is aware that some of the publicity is unfair and highlights fairly minor and unusual incidents.  Does he agree it is necessary for his Department to have in place a means of monitoring such publicity inside and outside the country and, more importantly, a means of counteracting it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume Deputy Killeen agrees that everybody wishes crime was not committed against visitors or <Col N="1771" /> citizens.  The decline in media coverage on the domestic front is welcome and the level of coverage of crime against visitors to Ireland in the international media has been negligible, if not non-existent, in the past year or so.</P>
      <P>Since taking office I met the Minister for Justice &mdash; the person responsible for the problem of crime &mdash; on a number of occasions.  Measures taken by the Garda, Bord Fáilte and other interests to address the problem of crime against tourists include regular liaision meetings between the Garda authorities, Bord Fáilte and other tourism interests, deployment of additional Garda patrols in areas of high tourism interest, the establishment of a Garda office in O'Connell Street in March 1990 which acts as a centre for advising tourists on safety measures, the distribution of safety leaflets in three languages and city maps produced by the Garda for tourists and an increased level of foreign language training for gardaí.  Special provision was made in the Criminal Evidence Act, 1992, to enable tourist victims make an immediate statement before a district justice, eliminating the necessity to attend a subsequent trial. Action against illegal traffic wardens has been taken by the Garda and a business watch scheme was set up in Talbot Street, which we hope to extend to Grafton Street and Mary Street in 1995. Further measures will be taken by the Garda, Bord Fáilte and the tourism industry in 1995 to propagate the &ldquo;stay safe&rdquo; message.  Deputy Killeen will be aware that in April 1994 the Dublin Tourist Victims' Support Service was set up to provide assistance and emotional and practical support for the victims of crimes against tourists.  Last year my predecessor allocated £5,000 to that service, the figure was doubled this year to enable it to carry out its work more effectively.</P>

      <Quest>the measures, if any, which are being taken to ensure that tourist fare seat capacity will be provided to meet national tourism targets and the requirements of the ethnic travel industry from the United States in view of the Aer Lingus decision to increase the quota of business class seating on the transatlantic airbus fleet and the loss of Tower Air charters.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 28, 39, 43 and 187 together.</P>
      <P>I am concerned that there should be adequate access capacity on transatlantic routes into Ireland to amply cater for prospective tourists.</P>
      <P>The main existing scheduled carriers &mdash; Aer Lingus and Delta &mdash; provide a good service from three gateways.  I am convinced that further services would earn a good return for both carriers and the tourism industry here.  There are already indications that there may be some pressure this year on available capacity on direct flights to Ireland from the US and my Department and Bord Fáilte are in contact with Aer Lingus to encourage it to provide for additional demand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government and the commercial sector, as partners, have invested significant levels of marketing spend in the US under the US marketing initiative last year and again under the overseas tourism marketing initiative this year.  The <Col N="1773" /> aim is to increase US vacation visitors by 45,000 this year on top of the 40,000 extra visitors who arrived last year.</P>
    <P>There will always be some US holidaymakers who fly to Ireland through the UK, where gateways other than Boston and New York &mdash; which are used by Aer Lingus &mdash; are involved. For this reason, I launched last week in New York the British Airways holiday programme for the US.  This programme, in conjunction with Bord Fáilte and CIE Tours, will be aimed at holidaymakers from North America who fly from 19 cities served in the US by British Airways or a further 53 cities under the British Airways-USAir code-sharing pact.  The target is to realise up to 10,000 extra US visitors to Ireland from this programme alone each year for the next three years, but the potential is there for even greater growth.</P>
    <P>The advent of additional carriers on the North Atlantic &mdash; especially from new US gateways &mdash; would greatly support the ambitious tourism targets we have set.  For this reason, I have proposed that access will be an important element of the tourism part of President Clinton's Washington conference on trade and investment in May next.  Our counterparts in Northern Ireland have made access a similar priority for the conference.  My aim will be to persuade new carriers to serve Ireland.</P>
    <P>I will be discussing with my colleague, the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, what measures we might need to take to attract such new carriers here as well as what more Aer Lingus can do to meet tourism needs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen" hpid="Mr. Killeen Mr. Killeen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister pursue specifically the provision of extra tourist fare seats during the summer peak season when many business class seats are taken up by tourists on Aer Lingus services? American agents have complained that tourist fare seats are not available on some flights.  For the remainder of the year, during the November to March off season period, growth has been non-existent in the past three or four years or, perhaps, longer, <Col N="1774" /> and at that time there is substantial capacity.  Will the Minister ensure that marketing initiatives are put in place to fill the seats during that part of the year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the OTMI programme we are spending $5 million in direct consumer advertising in the US this year.  I will take careful note of the point the Deputy has raised.  In respect of the off peak months, a number of initiatives are being taken by the Department to bring about a situation where 75 per cent of our visitors would visit Ireland at that time.  This is not something that can be done overnight, but the Deputy's point is valid, and we are concerned about it.</P>
      <P>The estimated total capacity for US-Ireland direct flights for 1995 is slightly over 500,000 and the estimate of all US arrivals is 559,000, half of whom will arrive indirectly to Ireland, mostly from London.  In that context the British Airways initiative announced last week means that they have distributed 1.5 million brochures marketing Ireland in an intensive and aggressive way to 32,000 travel agents and 750,000 consumers. The estimate of 10,000 may well be conservative and we may well exceed it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen" hpid="Mr. Killeen Mr. Killeen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the difficulties about the British Airways holiday programme is that most of the back-tracking from London is into Dublin.  Will the Minister take initiatives to ensure that people who come on British Airways flights have access to Cork, Shannon, Knock and the regional airports to ensure better regional distribution of tourism?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a matter I will take up in the context of the discussions I will be having regarding access in general to this country both at the Washington conference on trade and investment and in my contacts with the Northern Ireland Tourist Board and the Minister for Transport and Communications.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan, Limerick East) Michael Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): I am glad to have this opportunity to respond to the issues raised by Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn.</P>
      <P>In July 1994, the medical technical staff of the Blood Transfusion Service Board put a proposal to the chief executive officer to the effect that the premises of the BTSB be inspected by inspectors in that area to ensure that the BTSB was complying with EU guidelines on good manufacturing practice. These guidelines are applicable to pharmaceutical manufacturing and are for the purpose of ensuring the highest possible standards.</P>
      <P>In August 1994 the board of the BTSB agreed that the British Medicines Control Agency, supported by the National Drugs Advisory Board, should carry out the inspection.  Between 6 and 8 February 1995, an inspector from the British Medicines Control Agency, accompanied by an inspector from the National Drugs Advisory Board, inspected the BTSB to see if the BTSB was complying with EU guidelines on good manufacturing practice.  On 13 February 1995, the British Medicines Control Agency forwarded a report of its findings to the BTSB.  The board was very concerned about the contents of the report and took immediate steps to rectify the deficiencies identified.  When this report was brought to the attention of my Department I requested and received a detailed response from the BTSB on the matters identified in the report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been assured that many of the matters identified have already been <Col N="1776" /> rectified, and the board has given me a firm commitment that the outstanding matters will be rectified at the earliest possible date.  The board has also assured me that the future management and medical practices of the BTSB will reach and, where possible, exceed international standards for blood transfusions. To underpin this commitment, the board has advised me of its intention to have its premises inspected at regular intervals to ensure that the board is complying with EU guidelines on good manufacturing practice.</P>
    <P>Since coming into office I have been concerned to ensure that the BTSB would work in the most effective and efficient manner.  The Government has already agreed to fund a major consultancy project at the BTSB.  This project, which is now under way, involves a wide-ranging and fundamental review of the overall management of the BTSB.  I am committed to ensuring that the highest standards apply to all activities of the Blood Transfusion Service Board which is an important, crucial service without our health service.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister explain why it was not until August 1994, when the board agreed to accept the proposal put to it in July 1994, that the Blood Transfusion Service Board procedures were investigated, having regard to the fact that it had been given the hugely important task by the Minister's predecessor in February 1994 of establishing the National Screening Programme Centre, and had a role in the screening, testing and investigative process in relation to Anti D and the hepatitis C infection?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> A number of outside agencies have been examining the work of the Blood Transfusion Service Board in recent months and years.  The report of the expert group under Dr. Miriam Hederman-O'Brien, which examined the difficulties that arose when a number of women contracted hepatitis C, is now to hand.  The <Col N="1777" /> Deputy, as a Minister in the Government which commissioned that report, will be aware of the circumstances which gave rise to that.  The second investigation is being carried out by Bain and Company, an English consultancy group with particular expertise in haematology which has carried out similar work for the blood transfusion services in the United Kingdom.  It is now examining the procedures and the efficacy of the Blood Transfusion Services Board and has been doing so for the past three or four weeks.  A third project was an inspection of Pelican House and its operations which concentrated on the laboratory area.  This was commissioned by the board on the advice of its own medical and technical staff.  The inspection was carried out by an inspector of the British Medicines Control Agency and an inspector of our own National Drugs Advisory Board between 6 and 8 February.  It was their report that was sent to the board of the BTSB and which appeared, in an expurgated form, in <i>The Cork Examiner</i> this morning.</P>
      <P>I am not in a position to say why nothing was done sooner.  I was not Minister at the time and there was a different Government in office. However, I am taking the difficulties of the Blood Transfusion Service Board extremely seriously.  Mr. Joe Holloway was appointed last year as chairman of the Blood Transfusion Service Board and I am in regular contact with him to ensure that the service provided by the board complies with best international practice.  To put things in context, let me say that the whole question of blood transfusion services internationally are a matter of concern in health services, that we must ensure we comply with best international practice so that the confidence of the voluntary donors who have done so much over the years by donating blood can be maintained.  The confidence of the recipients must also be maintained and I intend to make sure that it is.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned, too, to maintain the confidence of both donors and recipients.  It is for that reason that I raised the Matter. There are many women who have hepatitis C as a result of receiving contaminated Anti D serum, who are anxious to know how that contamination happened and to see standards in place to ensure, in so far as possible, that this can never happen again.  In relation to the report in the newspaper today was there a lack of security and could the product have been interfered with?  Is there a possibility of contamination?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I confirm that the report in <i>The Cork Examiner</i>, in so far as it quotes directly from the report on the inspection carried out by the British Medicines Control Agency, is accurate.  It points to a number of inadequacies which are in the process of being put right by the Blood Transfusion Service Board under the direction of its chairman.  I am informed that there is 24 hour round the clock security at Pelican House but that security within sections needs to be improved as one can gain unsecured access from one area to another.  That is a cause of concern.</P>
      <P>On the issue of contamination, we should not confuse the events which led to the establishment of the Dr. Miriam Hederman O'Brien specialist group following incidents in 1977 with this two day inspection carried out between 6-8 February this year.  An item in the report in <i>The Cork Examiner</i> was carried in the headlines to the effect that blood bags were stored in unhygienic conditions.  I am informed there was no possibility of contamination, that blood bags were contained in sealed containers. It is not acceptable that they were stored in such conditions; it is not an acceptable practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not acceptable that people were allowed to penetrate security provided on a 24 hour basis, especially in a premises <Col N="1779" /> where the highest international standards have to be maintained.  What do the 24 hour security measures entail? Will the Minister outline the critical and major failures identified during the inspection in terms of proper manufacturing practice and indicate if the blood bags were stored in fridges?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The normal 24 hour security measures that one would expect at a premises were taken.  As a former Minister for Justice, the Deputy will be aware of the security measures to which I refer.  There was no question of security being breached. Best international practice would dictate that in a premises where blood products are dealt with employees and visitors should not be able to gain easy access from one area to another.  That is the security problem identified in the report and being remedied at present.</P>
      <P>On the question of what the inspector of the British Medicines Control Agency and the inspector of the National Drugs Advisory Board discovered, it is all contained in the report in <i>The Cork Examiner.</i> The report runs to about three pages and each paragraph points to a particular issue.  As might be envisaged, this was not a spot inspection by an outside agency; it was requested by the Blood Transfusion Service Board to carry it out.  The board is now implementing the recommendations contained in its report.</P>
      <P>I understand that the British Medicines Control Agency has carried out similar inspections in the United Kingdom where it has identified similar difficulties.  It also intends to inspect the premises in Cork shortly.  I presume by the time its inspectors reach Cork everything will be shipshape.  A series of issues arise and others will arise as soon as I am in a position, in accordance with legal advice, to publish the Dr. Miriam Hederman-O'Brien report.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I find it extraordinary that these defects were identified during an inspection <Col N="1780" /> requested by the board.  One would have thought that it would have put whatever was wrong right in advance of the inspection.  I find it even more extraordinary that the normal international standards were not being adhered to in Dublin.  This may be the case in Cork also.  Who sets the standards for the BTSB in relation to storage, record keeping, security and laboratories?  Was the attention of the Department drawn to any administrative weaknesses in the organisation some time ago?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> At the risk of making a political point the Deputy's party was in Government for the past seven years during which there was a number of Fianna Fáil Ministers for Health.  If she was amazed at the report she can imagine my amazement when I discovered a number of things when I entered the Department of Health.  However, we can discuss those issues another day.</P>
      <P>On the question of best practice, there are EU guidelines on good manufacturing practice.  The inspection was requested to ensure that these guidelines were being complied with.  As well as licensing medicines the National Drugs Advisory Board also license blood products.  That is the reason one of its inspectors was present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like the Deputy, I was surprised that the inspectors issued such a critical report following an inspection requested by the board.  The sequence of events is as I outlined.  The suggestion was made in July 1994; the board agreed to comply with it in August 1994 and made arrangements to have the inspection carried out between 6 and 8 February 1995.  In the context of what Bain and Company is doing in the blood transfusion service at present it is a small job.  I expect it to present more all-embracing recommendations.  I would like to take those two jobs of work with the Dr. Miriam Hederman-O'Brien report which is now available.  I will give the House as much information as possible in due course about all these matters when it will have an opportunity to <Col N="1781" /> discuss the efficacy or otherwise of the Blood Transfusion Service Board in greater detail.</P>

Rather than having all these reports, the Dr. Miriam Hederman-O'Brien report, the report of the Blood Transfusion Service Board and this particular report, leaked to the press &mdash; I make a political point &mdash; in the interests of openness, transparency and accountability will the Minister publish the relevant parts of these reports to allay public concern?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Proinsias De Rossa)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I am very glad, as Minister for Social Welfare in this multi-party Government, of the opportunity to introduce my first Bill in this House.</P>
      <P>As a backbencher, I thought I new a great deal about the social welfare system, how it works and the multiplicity of schemes and services but since taking office, and having dealt with the budget and now the Social Welfare Bill, I readily admit that I have learnt more about social welfare in a short period, and the learning curve is continuing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The primary purpose of the Bill is to give legislative effect to the improvements in social welfare schemes and services announced in last month's budget. These include: the payment six weeks earlier than usual of increases in weekly rates of payment; a 35 per cent increase in child benefit &mdash; the biggest ever; significant PRSI reliefs for both employees and employers which will help them to stimulate business, create more jobs and ensure the low paid have more take home pay; the introduction of a new adoptive benefit scheme, and the extension of the carer's allowance to those on occupational pensions.  In addition, as is <Col N="1922" /> customary, the opportunity is being taken in this Bill to provide for a number of adjustments and amendments to the social welfare code.</P>
    <P>The resources provided by the Government this year for social welfare improvements are the largest ever on an annual basis in the history of the State. They amount to £212 million compared to the £157 million provided last year. That is a 35 per cent increase.</P>
    <P>That £212 million injection of extra spending breaks another barrier by pushing total social welfare spending for 1995 beyond the £4,000 million barrier for the first time since the foundation of the State.  That means we will spend this year over £11 million each day of the year.</P>
    <P>This Bill is truly a radical measure. Not only is it the largest ever annual provision for social welfare in the history of the State but, more importantly it is a targeted social welfare budget which focuses specifically on child poverty while avoiding deepening poverty and unemployment traps.</P>
    <P>Even within the spectrum of persons in receipt of social welfare supports, there are inequalities of need and disadvantage. Therefore, it is not enough to adopt a piecemeal and <i>ad hoc</i> approach towards the different categories of disadvantage.</P>
    <P>It is important, first, to raise the floor of benefits and support measures for all social welfare recipients but, in addition, to focus additional supports on the categories at greatest risk of poverty, that is the long term unemployed, women and children.  This is the strategy we have set in train.</P>
    <P>I referred to the need to target additional resources on women and children as part of an anti-poverty strategy and I will deal with that in more detail later.  I want now to put on record that this Government has taken the initiative to resolve the long-standing injustice concerning the non-payment of arrears due to more than 70,000 women under the 1979 Equal Treatment Directive.  It is indicative of my strength of commitment and that of the Government that <Col N="1923" /> we will deliver substantially, 75 per cent this year and fully by 1997, on the arrears due.</P>
    <P>The payment of these arrears will consist of increases for adult and child dependants and unemployment assistance and they will also receive the transitional payments as provide for in the recent High Court decision.  In addition, compensation will be payable based on the increase in the consumer price index from the date of entitlement in December 1984 onwards to the date on which payments are made.</P>
    <P>The total cost of these arrangements is estimated at some £260 million of which up to £200 million will be paid by the end of 1995.  The remaining payments, estimated at £60 million, will be paid from January 1996 onwards over as short a period as possible and will end no later than mid 1997.  All of the married women involved will receive payments on account by September next at an overall cost estimated at £110 million. Further payments on account will be made up to the end of December this year at a cost of £90 million.</P>
    <P>A special unit is being set up in my Department to process the payments in question.  All the women who have previously received payments under the European Communities (Social Welfare) Regulations, 1992 (S.I. No. 152 of 1992) will be notified of the arrangements for the payment of arrears and an extensive advertising campaign will also be undertaken over the coming weeks. In addition, a special telephone inquiry unit will be set up in the Department to deal with inquiries from the married women concerned.</P>
    <P>It has been decided that the costs involved in making these long overdue payments should be met through the sale of part of the assets of the Local Loans Fund.  The Local Loans Fund is a statutory fund under the control of the Minister for Finance.  It was set up to make loans to local authorities.  The money available for lending by the fund was borrowed by the Exchequer and advanced to the fund.  Prior to 1987, the <Col N="1924" /> principal purpose for which the authorities borrowed from the fund was to enable them to provide mortgage finance to house purchasers.  With the setting up of the Housing Finance Agency in 1986, the fund ceased to lend money to the authorities for this purpose; the Housing Finance Agency took over that role.</P>
    <P>The Local Loans Fund is in effect the mechanism through which local authorities funded mortgages to householders prior to 1987.  It is estimated that the fund comprises about £490 million of outstanding debt in respect of mortgages granted prior to that date. The intention is to securitise a portion of the fund by selling on the debt and using the yield to fund the equality payments this year.</P>
    <P>I want to make it absolutely clear because a number of politicians have tried, perhaps out of ignorance, to mislead the public on the way this will operate, that the proposed sale of the debt will not affect the mortgage contracts between mortgagees and their local authority.  Mortgage payments will continue to be made in the usual way without change to the local authority for the duration of the mortgage.</P>
    <P>Before discussing the main provisions, I would like to address the greatest social challenge facing this Government &mdash; unemployment, in particular, long term unemployment.  This is timely in the context of the publication two weeks ago of the Interim Report of the Task Force on Long-Term Unemployment which was established following the NESF report entitled &ldquo;Ending Long-Term Unemployment&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I welcome the task force report and its emphasis on the setting up of a new localised employment service to assist the long term unemployed and other target groups to return to the active labour market.  We still have a very serious long term unemployment problem with more than 135,000 of our people without a job for over 12 months &mdash; a substantial number of them have been out of work for much longer than 12 <Col N="1925" /> months.  Setting up a localised employment service is one of the Government's responses to this very pressing problem. It is essential that the long term unemployed and other marginalised groups can gain access to sustainable employment on a par with other job seekers and that they are afforded the opportunity to compete on equal terms for job vacancies.</P>
    <P>The reality is that many of the long term unemployed are simply not ready to return to work without a series of interventions in areas such as counselling, guidance, training and work experience.  They also fail to hear about job vacancies as most have drifted out of the circles where such information is available, as confirmed by the INOU study launched earlier this week by my colleague, Deputy Bernard Durkan, Minister of State.</P>
    <P>The new Local Employment Service is designed to address these types of problems.  It is based on the fact that each individual on the live register has his or her own specific needs and requirements and his or her own skills and experience to offer an employer. We have to identify the problems and needs and find a way of addressing them so that the individual recovers the enthusiasm and confidence to return to work and at the same time build on a replenish skills and experience that may be dormant so that the person's skills fit the needs of the labour market.  This is not an easy task, but the system we are now putting in place will result in more job vacancies being filled by the long term unemployed.</P>
    <P>In developing the Local Employment Service, my Department will utilise the experience we have gained since we introduced our Employment Support Service in July 1993.  This service grew out of a recognition that passive income maintenance support on its own was simply not enough.  It needed to be supported by a strong, flexible, pro-active approach which would increase the number of job outlets and enterprise opportunities available to the unemployed; increase the number of options <Col N="1926" /> for training and further education; and facilitate the unemployed to make the most of the new opportunities available to them to regain a foothold in the labour market.</P>
    <P>My Department has now in place a range of options and programmes designed to achieve these objectives and at the same time be more flexible and more responsible to the individual's needs and circumstances.  Among the options we have to offer are: second chance education schemes for people at second and third level in which more than 6,500 people are participating, flexible arrangements to allow unemployed people to take up voluntary community work or a part-time job, a PRSI exemption scheme for employers who take on new employees from the live register with more than 2,500 people currently receiving exemption, and finally, the back to work allowance.  Since it was introduced in September 1993, 5,600 people most of whom were long term unemployed have left the live register and returned to work.  The majority of recipients are engaged in self-employment projects in a wide, diverse and innovative range of measures.  The success of this programme proves that significant numbers of the long term unemployed still have a strong motivation to return to work given the right type of support and advice.</P>
    <P>We are, therefore, building on the Department's strong regional and local structure to deliver the range of services to the unemployed.  We have established a special team of officials, called jobs facilitators, for this purpose.  These officials have already built up valuable contracts with the unemployed, employers, voluntary and community groups and other statutory agencies at local level as they explore the full range of options available to the unemployed.</P>
    <P>My Department will co-operate to the fullest extent with the proposed new Local Employment Service.  We are in a unique position to do so for two reasons.  First, we have a strong regional and local organisational structure with a network of more than 200 offices <Col N="1927" /> nationwide all of which have ongoing and regular contacts with the unemployed, employers, voluntary and community groups.  Second, our experience to date of the operation of our Employment Support Service has given us a unique and valuable insight into the problems faced by the unemployed and their families.</P>
    <P>The essence of the new service is that it will bring existing services together in an integrated, focused and more effective manner which will greatly benefit the unemployed and others.  No longer will it be necessary for an unemployed person to approach a number of different agencies for assistance.  With the new service, there will be a single source of information and support in one place where people can get access to the service they need to tackle their problems. My Department will play an active and full part in its implementation.</P>
    <P>Sections 1 and 2 of the Bill contain the usual provisions relating to short title, construction and definitions.  The general increase, six weeks earlier than usual, in the weekly personal and adult dependant rates of social insurance and social assistance payments from early to mid June 1995 is provided for in sections 3 and 4.  Section 3 also provides for a further additional increase of £1.80 in the weekly adult dependant rate payable where the dependant is under age 66 in the case of old age &mdash; contributory &mdash; pension and retirement pension.  In addition, the age at which the higher personal rate of invalidity pension is payable will be reduced from 66 to 65.</P>
    <P>The substantial increase in child benefit announced in the budget is given legislative effect in section 5 which provides for an increase of £7 in the monthly rate of child benefit with effect from next September.  From that date, the monthly rate of child benefit will be £27 for each of the first two children and £32 for each subsequent child.  In addition, child benefit will be extended to 18 year olds who are in full-time education or are physically or mentally disabled and to 18 year olds on FÁS <Col N="1928" /> courses who do not receive training allowances.</P>
    <P>The opportunity is also being taken in this section to extend existing provisions whereby child benefit is payable to a qualified parent while serving abroad as a member of the Defence Forces or Civil Service to enable payment to be made to a qualified parent outside of the State while his or her spouse or partner is serving abroad as a member of the Defence Forces or the Civil Service.</P>
    <P>I have already spoken at length in this House about the philosophy behind this unprecedented increase in child benefit, the cornerstone of the social welfare budget provisions.  By focusing on child benefit, we are doing two things.  First, child benefit is recognised as one of the most effective ways of targeting proverty because those most at risk tend to be large families.  Second, given the nature of child benefit as a universal payment which is not taxed or withdrawn if employment is taken up, it does not act as a poverty trap, an unemployment trap or a disincentive to work.  This is why it makes eminent sense to channel as much income support for families as possible through the child benefit system.</P>
    <P>I would remind Deputies that this improvement in child benefit is just the first step in the Government's plans for major restructuring of the child income support system for the future.  Having got the basic child benefit payment structure right, the foundation is laid for the development of the child benefit supplement which is the essential element in our plans for a basic income for children.  The child benefit supplement will be payable in addition to child benefit to all families whose income is below a certain level irrespective of the source of the income for example social welfare, employment or a combination of the two.  The new supplement will incorporate both the child dependant allowances paid to people on social welfare and the family income supplement paid to people at work on low pay.</P>
    <P>The implications of the new child <Col N="1929" /> benefit supplement are under consideration in my Department.  At the same time, as announced by the Minister for Finance in his Budget Statement, the Expert Working Group on the Integration of Tax and Social Welfare is also being asked to consider this proposal and to advise on the best overall strategy. It is best placed to do this given the important work it has already done in this area.  I look forward to getting its views in due course.</P>
    <P>The shift of income and resources towards those most in need is only one of the priorties of this Government.  We are also committed to the stimulation of enterprise and job creation and to rewarding work in all its various forms. The social welfare system cannot be seen in isolation from that task.  It has an increasingly pro-active role to play in facilitating employment, experiments with employment and enterprise of all kinds.  It must have regard to the labour market as it is today and how it will develop in the future.</P>
    <P>The overall tax reforms announced in this year's budget are the most significant to have been introduced in many years.  The PRSI changes are innovative and will, for the first time in a number of years, ease the burden on low paid workers in particular.  The necessary legislative changes affecting PRSI are contained in sections 6 &mdash; 10 and will come into effect on 6 April 1995.</P>
    <P>Section 6 provides for a number of significant changes to the PRSI system affecting both employees and employers, as follows: the introduction of a new &ldquo;PRSI free allowance&rdquo; whereby employees insured at Class A will not be liable for PRSI in respect of the first £50 of weekly earnings; an increase in the ceiling up to which PRSI contributions are payable by employees from £20,900 to £21,500 per annum, and an increase from £173 to £231 in the amount of weekly earnings below which the reduced rate employer's contribution of 9 per cent applies.</P>
    <P>Section 7 deals with self-employed people.  It provides for an increase in the <Col N="1930" /> income ceiling up to which PRSI contributions are payable from £20,900 to £21,500 per annum.  It also provides for an exemption from payment of PRSI contributions in respect of the first £520 of self-employed income and for a reduction from £250 to £230 in the minimum social insurance contribution payable by the self-employed.</P>
    <P>Section 8 provides for an exemption from payment of optional contributions in respect of the first £520 of annual reckonable income under the scheme of optional social insurance for share fishermen.</P>
    <P>Section 9 provides for a reduction from £250 to £230 in the annual rate of voluntary contributions payable by voluntary contributors who were formerly self-employed contributors.</P>
    <P>Provision for regulatory powers to cater for an on-going employers' PRSI exemption scheme is contained in section 10.  Employers who take on additional employees who constitute a net increase in their workforce above that applying on a specified date will not have to pay the employer element of PRSI contributions in respect of such employees for a full two year period.</P>
    <P>As announced in the budget, the regulatory powers contained in section 10 will allow me to extend exemption under the scheme to employers who take on a young person under the age of 23 into a new job where this job is the person's first employment.  This will be a real incentive for employers to recruit young people into newly created jobs.  It should also benefit our many small to medium size enterprises.</P>
    <P>For the first time ever, a new adoptive benefit is being introduced in the social welfare code for people who qualify for adoptive leave under the provisions of the Adoptive Leave Act.  The qualifying contribution conditions and the rates of payment will be the same as those currently applying in the case of maternity benefit.  From next June, a recipient will get between £75.70 and £162.80 a week depending on earnings.  The new adoptive benefit will last for a period of ten weeks in the case of persons who qualify <Col N="1931" /> for adoptive leave.  Section 11 makes regulatory provision for the introduction of the new adoptive benefit scheme and it was my intention to use those powers as soon as the Adoptive Leave Bill was enacted.  However, as that legislation has now passed all Stages in both Houses of the Oireachtas and has only very recently been signed into law by the President, I will take the opportunity by way of an amendment on Committee Stage to provide for the details of the new scheme in this Bill.</P>
    <P>I announced at budget time that I was pleased to be able to continue the trend of previous years in progressively improving the carer's allowance.  This year's improvements have two distinct elements which are provided for in section 12.  First, the scheme is being extended to include carers of incapacitated pensioners over 66 who are not in receipt of a social welfare pension, for example, those getting an occupational pension.  It is only fair that those on social welfare pensions and those on occupational pensions should be treated equally as regards access to the carer's allowance.  Many of those who will benefit will be public service pensioners on relatively low pensions.  Second, the means test for the carer's allowance is being significantly eased through an increase from £100 to £150 a week in the amount to be disregarded in respect of working spouses and the application of the disregard to income from all sources.  Regulatory power is being taken in this section to provide for those changes.</P>
    <P>Section 13 amends the provisions relating to maternity benefit arising from the changes introduced by way of the Maternity Protection Act, 1994.  The net effect is to link entitlement to maternity benefit to entitlement to leave.  This section also provides for the payment of a benefit to fathers who are awarded leave following the death of the mother within 14 weeks of the child's birth in accordance with the provisions of the Maternity Protection Act, 1994.  This benefit is equivalent to <Col N="1932" /> maternity benefit, having the same contribution conditions and weekly rates of payment.</P>
    <P>Section 14 provides for an amendment of the definition of qualified child under which increases for dependent children will be payable to recipients of long term social welfare payments up to age 22, as compared with age 21 at present, for those in full-time education.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware of the rules governing the payment of the adult dependant allowance where the adult dependant has earnings in excess of £60 a week.  These rules have been criticised in recent years because the full allowance is lost as soon as weekly earnings exceed the £60 limit.  This has given rise to distortions in certain industries where extra working or overtime is not availed of &mdash; and in some cases, pay increases are foregone &mdash; because of the impact on the spouse's adult dependant allowance. With a view to resolving these difficulties, I propose to bring in new arrangements early next year in which I will provide a rate of adult dependant allowance related to earnings.  It may be necessary for administrative reasons to introduce the new arrangements on a phased basis for different schemes.</P>
    <P>Section 15 provides for giving regulatory powers to the Minister to enable an adult dependant allowance to be paid in respect of a spouse or partner who has weekly income in excess of a prescribed amount.  It is my intention that the adult dependant allowance payable in these circumstances will be tapered by reference to the level of the spouse's or partner's income.  In addition, child dependant allowances in respect of qualified children will continue to be payable at half rate.</P>
    <P>The details of the new arrangements are being worked out and I propose to make the necessary regulations later this year with a view to implementing them from early next year.  My objective is to ensure a higher level of earnings before the full adult dependant allowance is withdrawn from the spouse &mdash; a significant contribution to removing one of the poverty traps which currently <Col N="1933" /> keep people out of employment or on very low pay.</P>
    <P>Section 16 contains a number of provisions on the rates and calculation of means of unemployment assistance. They include an increase from £10 to £25 in the minimum weekly rate of unemployment assistance payable to single people with means assessed solely on the basis of parental income; the payment of unemployment assistance at the long term rate in the case of a claimant who was previously in receipt of lone parent's allowance, and standardising the provisions applied to married and cohabiting couples on the halving of means where the spouse or partner is not an adult dependant.</P>
    <P>Sections 17 to 23 inclusive contain a number of miscellaneous amendments to the existing legislation affecting a number of schemes, as follows.  Section 17 provides that a person cannot requalify for unemployment benefit on the basis of optional contributions.  Under the optional scheme of social insurance for share-fishermen, optional contributions provide entitlement to unemployment benefit for 13 weeks in any one calendar year.</P>
    <P>Arising from the integration last year of the former social employment scheme and Teamwork into the new scheme of community employment, it is necessary to replace references in the legislation which are now obsolete. Section 18 is designed to achieve that.</P>
    <P>Section 19 provides that the insurance record of a self-employed contributor can only be used for the purposes of qualifying for old age (contributory) pension or survivor's pension where self-employment contributions for which the person was liable have been paid in respect of at least one contribution year before the date of death or reaching age 66.</P>
    <P>Section 20 contains a number of amendments in relation to orphans pensions. The definition of orphan is amended to include a child where one of the parents has abandoned or failed or refused to provide for him/her and the other parent is unknown or has <Col N="1934" /> effectively abandoned him/her.  This section also increases from £2 to £6 the initial means disregard applied in the case of orphan's (non-contributory) pension.</P>
    <P>Section 21 provides that supplementary welfare allowance paid to a person while awaiting determination of a claim for a social security payment from another member state may be recovered from the amount payable by the other State.</P>
    <P>Section 22 gives the Minister for Social Welfare power to make regulations designed to standardise the provisions governing payment of benefit or assistance to people who are absent from the State or are undergoing penal servitude, imprisonment or detention in legal custody.</P>
    <P>Section 23 provides for a number of minor changes to the provisions for means assessment in the case of social assistance payments.  They include disregarding, in certain circumstances, the capital value of property where the property is not used for a limited period, for example, through illness; deleting absolete references to weekly redundancy payments and extending to carer's allowance existing provisions whereby an increase in a non-social welfare pension which has already been assessed as means cannot result in a reduction in the social welfare payment which would be greater than the increase in the non-social welfare payment.</P>
    <P>Sections 24 and 25 provide for technical amendments to the Health Contributions Act, 1979 and to the Youth Employment Agency Act, 1981 respectively. Those Acts govern the administration of the two levies involved &mdash; the health contribution and the employment and training levy.</P>
    <P>The effects of the changes provided for in those sections are an increase from £173 to £178 in the weekly earnings threshold below which employees are exempt from payment of the two <Col N="1935" /> levies involved; an increase in the corresponding income level for the self-employed from £9,000 to £9,250; payments made to a spouse under maintenance agreements to be exempt from liability for the two levies, and all recipients of survivor's pension and lone parent's allowance to be exempt from liability for the two levies.  That is an outline of what the Bill contains.</P>
    <P>At the United Nations World Summit on Poverty held in Copenhagen recently, the Irish Government agreed a programme of action which is geared not only to eliminating abject poverty in the developing world but to the substantial reduction of overall poverty and inequalities everywhere.</P>
    <P>This new commitment requires us to develop in Ireland a coherent and targeted anti-poverty strategy by placing poverty and inequality issues firmly at the heart of national policy-making with the aim of developing a more inclusive and just society.</P>
    <P>This means that, as a Government and society, we must have as objectives four freedoms:&mdash; freedom from want based on an adequate income for all our citizens; freedom from unemployment with as a priority the elimination of long term unemployment; freedom from ignorance with emphasis on the ending of educational disadvantage, and freedom from ghettoisation by emphasising the regeneration of disadvantaged communities.</P>
    <P>I propose to bring forward proposals, following consultations with my colleagues in Government, to mainstream anti-poverty policy so that all Government Departments and agencies target poverty and social inclusion in their policy-making and include the people affected in that policy-making and its implementation.  I am currently in the process of forming a co-ordinating group to do some preliminary planning in this regard.  This group will include representatives from the Combat Poverty Agency, officials from my Department and my special adviser.</P>
    <P>The various components of this first <Col N="1936" /> social welfare budget brought in by the new Government clearly set out to address that commitment through a strategy not only of tackling poverty and employment traps but of treating those individual citizens who may be in receipt of social welfare payments with dignity and respect.  Above all, it seeks to empower those individuals and their children who may be on the cutting edge of poverty.</P>
    <P>The social welfare budget is firmly focused on developing equity in both senses of that word &mdash; giving people equality of treatment and of opportunity but also giving them a stake in our society.  It is essential to remember that society is composed of all its citizens, not just those who are well off.</P>
    <P>The Social Welfare Bill before the House is set in the overall context of a determined attack on child poverty.  It is the first of three Bills which I will bring before the House before the summer recess.  The other two Bills will deal with modifications necessary to the social welfare code in advance of the holding of the referendum on divorce and the introduction of a uniform lone parent's allowance scheme which will, primarily, abolish the humiliating obligation of proving desertion by a spouse in order to qualify for State support for the family.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House and look forward to a constructive debate from Members on the measures.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>We must debate the Committee Stage of this Bill on Friday yet I only received a copy of it and a brief for the Select Committee on Social Affairs at 3 o'clock this afternoon.  I will put a number of amendments to the Bill and hope we will have an opportunity next Tuesday to have a proper debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill should have been one we could all welcome.  However, the opportunity presented to redress the inadequacies of the provisions for general increases in the budget was not availed of.  The 2.5 per cent increase will not keep pace with inflation.  It is the lowest increase in 30 years.  The poorest of the <Col N="1937" /> poor will see a sharp decline in the value of their payments.  I am appalled by this since the Government has an opportunity to increase the support systems for the less well off to an adequate level.</P>
    <P>After the budget débâcle I would have thought the 2.5 per cent insult delivered to the old and infirm would have been addressed.  I can only assume it is a deliberately missed opportunity. The disgrace is that the Bill could have had a relatively unhindered passage through the Dáil.  I call on the Minister to address this matter on Committee Stage and will put down a number of amendments to that effect.</P>
    <P>What is the nature of the general 2.5 per cent increase?  With the international financial markets in turmoil, the Economic and Social Research Institute recently predicting an inflation rate of up to 3 per cent and house prices increasing, this 2.5 per cent increase, which will not even keep pace with the projected rate of inflation, can be viewed only as a studied insult to the poorest in society.  What happened to the unprecedented opportunity to address the problems of the marginalised, those living on a shoestring, endeavouring to make ends meet, unable to provide the necessities of life, dependent on moneylenders, on the charity of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, local credit unions and the like who had hoped to be brought along on the tide of the good economic position? It is appalling that they have been not alone left there but have had to take a step backwards.</P>
    <P>The Minister informs us that the Bill provides for increases from early to mid-June in the rates of social welfare payments announced in the budget and a number of other improvements to be effected in social welfare schemes, which are to be welcomed.  In addition, the Bill provides for the introduction of an adoptive benefit scheme, which is also welcome, as is the extension of the carer's allowance to the carers of incapacitated people aged 66 and over not in receipt of a social welfare payment. That is to be particularly welcomed <Col N="1938" /> because many families nationwide keep elderly relatives in their homes at tremendous inconvenience to themselves out of natural love and affection for them.  Such people render society a tremendous service, while helping the Exchequer in a major way; we all know the average cost of maintaining a patient in hospital and therefore, I strongly support the improvement in the carer's allowance.  Anything that can be done for those in our society who undertake that type of service should be done because they are to be lauded and helped in every way possible.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for changes in the rates of PRSI contributions payable by employers, employees, the self-employed and for certain other miscellaneous amendments.  The Bill also provides for amendments to the Health Contributions Act, 1979 and the Youth Employment Agency Act, 1981, which increases the earnings threshold below which employees and the self-employed are exempt from liability for health contributions and the employment and training levy.  While all those changes are welcome, the underlying problem is that, in Part II of the Bill, there is provision for an increase of 2.5 per cent in the weekly personal and adult dependant rates of social insurance but social assistance payments remains the same. At a time of major opportunity to provide real increases in the standard of living of those most deprived in our society it is beyond belief that they should be treated in such a cavalier manner.</P>
    <P>I have already said I do not know how old age pensioners on the non-contributory pension can survive in any degree of comfort on a weekly income of £61 per week and to be offered an addition of £1.50 per week is really an insult.  Has the Government chosen to ignore or forget the improvements in our economy and the dramatic opportunity they presented?  I hoped, like many elderly, infirm and marginalised in our society, that this budget would have afforded them some relief, but, when not provided in the budget, the hope was that <Col N="1939" /> this Bill would have provided that missed opportunity.  Unfortunately, the matter was not tackled and such people must survive on their present payments.</P>
    <P>Some Government spokespersons suggested that, while Opposition Members seek increases, they do not specify from where the money will come.  In this most recent budget money was provided and concessions given in various other sectors which could easily have been targeted at those marginalised in our society.  There appears to be an underlying theme in the budget and this Bill, that the middle class must be kept happy and comfortable at all costs, this new electoral advantage of the middle class who supported some of the parties in this multi-party Government on the last occasion being assumed to continue in the future, too bad for the less well-off in our society.</P>
    <P>The expectation of the provisions of this Bill to redress social deprivation and disadvantage was extremely high, higher still because of the composition of the present Government, described as the left wing majority, which test the Government has failed dismally.  There had been great expectations of the Minister for Social Welfare.  Deputy De Rossa, in the run-up to the last budget, as he had spoken so eloquently about the deprived and the poor, the hope being that, given the opportunity, at least they might have expected to receive something above the going rate; unfortunately, that was not the case. This unfortunate sector must continue the humiliating experience of being unable to provide the necessities of life for themselves, of having to depend on moneylenders, of approaching a community welfare officer when their funds run out, literally begging for sufficient to keep them going for the remainder of the week.  It is an extremely upsetting and humiliating experience, having to live on less than an adequate amount which, when something unexpected occurs &mdash; even the purchase of a pair of shoes for one of the children &mdash; throws their whole domestic budget out of gear, <Col N="1940" /> when they must publicly cry for help to a community welfare officer, seeking additional assistance, very frequently being fobbed off, ultimately depending on parasites like moneylenders.</P>
    <P>The provisions of any Bill affecting the lives of more than one million Irish people, with over 40 per cent of the community in receipt of a variety of social welfare payments, obviously are important.  Therefore, a very high proportion of them will suffer as the Government failed to grasp the opportunity to adequately support them. When one examines what is being offered recipients of specific benefits, one can ascertain just how much they have to live on.  The personal rate of disability benefit has been increased by £1.50, there was a similar increase in the carer's allowance and an additional £1 a week for the orphan's non-contributory pension.  Let me take the example of a husband and wife with say, five children trying to make ends meet on approximately £160 a week which compares very unfavourably with the earnings of, say, a special adviser or programme manager at £800 per week.  I honestly do not know how such couples survive.  Is it any wonder so many of them are put to the pin of their collar to survive?</P>
    <P>I might say that I am not engaging merely in what a Member in Opposition must do, that is point out the shortcomings and failures of the Government of the day.  The Conference of Religious of Ireland studied how different groups have fared under the Bill and found that people on social welfare gained least of all, that employed single people gained dramatically, that those in the income range of £15,000 to £20,000 per year gained substantially over the last year while couples in the income range of £25,000 to £30,000 per year gained most dramatically.  It goes on to state that the benefits of the 1995 budget were not concentrated on eliminating poverty.  I concur with that view.  This budget was about looking after the middle classes.</P>
    <P>The Conference of Religious of Ireland went on to highlight the fact <Col N="1941" /> that budget calculations omit the benefits which flow from the implementation of commitments for 1995 in the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i> It echoes our views in stating that the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> must be taken into consideration to gain an accurate picture of how people will benefit in 1995.  For example, the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> offers a 2.5 per cent increase in wages, and with unemployed people gaining nothing from the programme the gap between them and everyone else will widen substantially more in the course of 1995.  That is the agenda to which this Left-dominated Government is committed.</P>
    <P>In order to really appreciate the derisory nature of the 1995 social welfare increases, to put this critical part of the Social Welfare Bill into perspective, it is no harm to remind the House that not alone the middle class but a number of reasonably well off organisations did quite well this year, and that the banks did extremely well.  The reduction in corporation profits tax from 40 per cent to 38 per cent will benefit the banking fraternity substantially.  Since the budget, one of the groups, Allied Irish Banks, posted a profit of £431 million. We can expect the Bank of Ireland to post a similar net profit.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>There are also the Trustee Savings Bank and the National Irish Bank.  In case there might be an occasion when the banks would not enjoy such profits, the budget was used to abolish the bank levy.  The Government sent the message to the banks that it did not want them squeezed at any time, that in case they did not make profits at any time to meet the bank levy that levy was being abolished.  Whatever about the deprived and those who must go hungry for part of the week the Government is concerned about the banks and will look after them.  That <Col N="1942" /> makes one think.  I noticed that some media comment referred to that aspect. In an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> Vincent Browne estimated that the benefit of that measure to the banks would amount to £40 million per annum.  He suggested that that money could have financed an additional 2.5 per cent increase in all social welfare allowances bringing the overall increase up to a barely respectable 5 per cent.</P>
      <P>Mr. Browne went on to say that the disgrace of this budget does not attach only to Ruairí Quinn and the Labour Party, that it also represents a defeat for whatever survives of the just society element of Fine Gael, that represents a humiliation for the Democratic Left and thus a defeat for the marginalised and the impoverised.</P>
      <P>It was important that money was found for equality payments.  The Government set a ceiling of 6 per cent on expenditure and with the additional £140 million that target cannot be met. While the £140 million is important for the women concerned, I consider it would have been better spent in improving the 2.5 per cent social welfare increases across the board.  We must remember that the local loans fund was of benefit to local authority tenants who wished to purchase their houses but that fund has been reduced.</P>

      <P>The Department of Social Welfare has pilfered that fund.  It claims that there is a massive improvement in social welfare expenditure, but moneys are being transferred from the Department of the Environment to the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
      <P>I repeat what the former Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Woods, said when he reminded us recently that all the previous Fianna Fáil-led Governments had exceeded, in current terms the priority rates recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare in 1986 and had achieved over 90 per cent of the main rates for all payments.  Deputy Woods stated that in this budget the commission's main rates were to be achieved as promised by the previous Fianna Fáil-Labour Government, but that promise was reneged on.  Those rates for all benefits could easily have been achieved this year.  I remind the House that under the Fianna Fáil-led Governments of the past eight years the social welfare increases were substantial, dramatic in some years amounting to 11 per cent with 3 per cent being the lowest increase.  That proves that Fianna Fáil as a political party does more for the poor.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>It proves its record in seeking to alleviate the problems of the poor in so far as budgetary and financial conditions allow.  There is no doubt that if it were in office this year when the economy and finances are in such a flush state, the poor could have expected to have done substantially better. Why did the poor not do better on this occasion and why was this Bill not availed of to redress some of the greatest difficulties, anomalies and traps? Was no one around the Cabinet table prepared to speak up for them?  It is all very well to speak up when one has an audience and a compliant media to carry what must now be seen as insincere drivel in relation to the poor.  When it counted behind the Cabinet door <Col N="1944" /> when there was not a great audience and something substantial could have been done for those trying to eke out enough to keep them in shoes, clothes and food, the Minister let them down.</P>
      <P>The Conference of Religious of Ireland remarked that given the good budgetary situation this year it is regrettable that the poor have been asked to wait.  Hopefully, the turmoil in the financial markets will not cause difficulties, but we do not know what the future has in store for this economy.  That is why it is galling to ask poor people to wait for an increase because when the opportunity exists they should be the first in the queue to be looked after.  The conference reminded us of all the Commission on Social Welfare estimated that a minimally adequate standard of living for a single person is £67 per week, but people could not live very weell on that amount, not could a couple live very well on £107 per week.  The conference and we in Fianna Fáil ask why a large number of social welfare dependants is on rates 10 per cent below that target at present?  Together with organisations, such as the Irish National Organisation of the Unemployed and the Conference of Religious of Ireland, we in Fianna Fáil ask why the Social Welfare Bill, 1995 was not availed of to redress the neglect shown in the 1995 budget.  Yet again it is those who can least afford it who end up having their noses rubbed in it.</P>
      <P>There are thousands on the edge of survival who depend on social welfare. There is no use in saying, as the Taoiseach said, that people should get out of their beds, push themselves out of their homes and find work.  The reality is that many thousands of people in receipt of social welfare either cannot work because they are too old, infirm or disabled or cannot get work.  This year more than ever the Government, because of the prudent work of previous Governments, should have made a difference to those people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The contents of the Bill could have and should have made a difference to those people.  It would have been nice <Col N="1945" /> for them to see light at the end of the tunnel or some ray of hope on the horizon. There has been no attempt by the Government to make any advance towards adequate levels of social welfare payments.  The opportunity presented by this Bill has been missed. It is my intention to oppose it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarClohessy" hpid="Mr. Clohessy Mr. Clohessy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clohessy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome much of what is contained in this Bill, though there are parts with which I am disappointed. There will always be those who will be for or against any such a Bill.  At this time of the year, it must occur to the Minister for Social Welfare and the Minister for Enterprise and Employment that it would be a tremendous asset to the country if the number of people in receipt of payments such as dole, unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance was reduced.</P>
      <P>During the past ten years 65 per cent of the outdoor staff of each county council have left employment but, due almost entirely to a ban on the recruitment of outdoor staff, have not been replaced.  I can see as I am sure does the Minister when he travels through the country &mdash; he travels on most of the major roads &mdash; that the country roads are in a deplorable state, to such a degree that cars are being destroyed with minor accidents occurring.  This is due mainly to the lack of outdoor staff to maintain on county roads.  It would be right that a Democratic Left Minister should examine the position with a view to lifting the embargo.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill provides for increases from early to mid-June in the rates of social welfare payments announced in the budget and for a number of other improvements in social welfare schemes.  It also provides for the introduction of an adoptive benefit scheme and an extension of the carers allowance scheme, to carers of incapacitated persons age 66 or over who are not in receipt of a social welfare payment.  It provides for changes in the rates of PRSI contributions payable by <Col N="1946" /> employers, employees and the self-employed and for certain other miscellaneous amendments.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides for amendments to the Health Contributions Act, 1979, and the Youth Employment Agency Act, 1981, which increased the earnings threshold below which employees and the self-employed are exempt from liability for health contributions and the employment and training levy.</P>
    <P>This Bill sets out to give legal effect to a whole package of social welfare measures which were announced on budget day.  The estimated cost of all the provisions in the Bill is approximately £215 million and will bring spending this year on social welfare to in excess of £4,000 million.</P>
    <P>Social welfare is a major achievement of modern societies.  In this they are usually strongly supported by public opinion.  A recent European study highlighted the almost unanimous support for a high level of social protection.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats believes that social welfare recipients should be given the best protection this society can afford.  Social welfare is a major component of social cohesion and solidarity. Social welfare and social protection systems are faced with growing pressures owing to a number of factors: the evolution of the labour market and, in particular, rising unemployment; demographic trends and, in particular, the aging population; changes in family structure particularly increases in single parent families; the growing instance of poverty and social exclusion resulting from these trends and a massive increase in demand for a whole range of social services, including a comprehensive welfare service and health care system.</P>
    <P>At the same time lower rates of economic activity, budget deficits and compelling claims of public expenditure have raised the question, can we continue to afford to pay the social welfare bill and, if so, for how long more?</P>
    <P>Another vital social welfare issue is the payment of the equality money due <Col N="1947" /> to thousands of women throughout the country.  My party welcomes the payment of this money which is the absolute legal entitlement of those concerned. However, the way in which the Government and the Minister propose to fund up to £200 million of these back payments this year is open to many serious questions.  There is undoubtedly an element of funny money about the proposal to provide £150 million of the money by a proposed sale of some of the local loans fund.</P>
    <P>Not only is it ironic to have the Leader of Democratic Left signing on for the privatising of a State asset which the local loans fund is, but a number of major questions still have not been answered.  Is this sale from the local loans fund going to be made to the banks or to the building societies or is it going to be sold to the National Treasury Management Agency.</P>
    <P>This Government move, which was not announced in the budget, raises more questions than it answers. Another worrying feature is that it significantly pushes up the overall Government spending for this year, to nearly 8 per cent, and clearly that will damage the standing of this country in the eyes of our European partners, especially at a time when there is already so much difficulty in the international financial markets.  While I welcome the payment of these long overdue moneys to those concerned the way the Government is going about it needs to be properly explained and raises a whole range of questions that have not been addressed to date.</P>
    <P>Today 1.3 million of our population are wholly maintained on social welfare payments.  This leads to poverty and marginalisation.  Many people experience poverty and social exclusion on an ongoing basis.  Social exclusion does not only mean insufficient income, it even goes beyond participation in working life.  It manifests itself in areas such as housing, education, health and access to other services such as legal aid.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1948" /> What will this Bill do for the 1.3 million of our population who are totally dependent on social welfare payments? My answer is very little.  As a result of this Bill, and the budget, the Government will be known as the Government of the 2.5 per cent.  Sections 3 to 5 provide for an increase of 2.5 per cent in the weekly personal adult dependant rate of social insurance and social assistance payments.</P>
    <P>An additional increase of 30p per day in the weekly adult dependant rate is payable where the adult dependant is under 66 years in the case of old age contributory pensions and retirement pensions.  These are the lowest increases for many years and are most disappointing, in particular, when they are introduced by a Minister who is a member of Democratic Left.  I wonder what the Minister would say about the Bill if he was on this side of the House.  When he was in Opposition, the Minister was suspended from the House on many occasions because of his opposition to a series of social welfare issues.  He had the opportunity to put much of that right today, yet he came into the House with a Bill which in effect is more of the same.</P>
    <P>All of its provisions are not to be cast aside.  I welcome, in particular, the provisions in section 16 under which social welfare assistance will be payable at the long term rate in the case of a claimant who was previously in receipt of the lone parent's allowance.  This section will also increase from £10 to £25 the minimum weekly rate of unemployment assistance payable to single people whose means are assessed solely on the basis of parental income.  It will also standardise the provisions which apply to married and co-habitating couples on the halving of means where the spouse or partner is not an adult dependant.</P>
    <P>From my experience, one of the reasons young people leave home is that they are unable to obtain unemployment assistance because of the assessment of benefit and privilege against them as a result of their parents' income.  This has a very costly effect on <Col N="1949" /> social welfare expenditure in that young people subsequently leave home and qualify for full unemployment assistance and possibly a rent allowance under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.  It is the subsequent payment of the rent allowance that is the huge disincentive to taking up full-time employment.  It is not an exaggeration to say that it is common for a rent allowance of up to £50 per week to be paid to single people in certain large urban areas where accommodation is scarce and, when available, is very expensive. It is not uncommon, therefore, for single people to be in receipt of payments of up to £110 per week in unemployment assistance, supplementary welfare allowance and rent allowance.</P>
    <P>Given the PRSI and tax systems, a single person would have to receive a starting pay well in excess of £170 per week if he was to have the same take home pay he receives by way of rent allowance and unemployment assistance. Very few employers are in a position to pay a wage of £170 per week to people starting out in employment. These disincentives to employment have not been addressed.  Apart from the debate on the Estimates, this will be the only debate on social welfare.  This is simply not good enough given that the Department of Social Welfare spends more than £4,000 million a year.</P>
    <P>The aim of our social policy should be to assist individuals to take care of themselves and, as far as possible, to perform a useful role in society.  Vulnerable people at risk can only achieve that goal through new and innovative combinations of work and welfare.  Nothing in the Bill and none of the utterances by the Minister or his Department give an indication of future social policy.  The central implication of the rise in demand for social services and the need to combat the exclusion of weaker groups is that income maintenance can no longer be the only objective of social policy. There is a growing consensus that all citizens should have a guarantee of resources.  Social welfare policies now have to take on the more ambitious <Col N="1950" /> objectives of helping people to find a place in society.  The main, but not the only, way of doing this is through paid work, and that is why employment and social policies should be more closely linked.</P>
    <P>Consideration must be given to more generalised mainstream policies aimed at integration and which include (1) better adaptation of social programmes to avoid poverty and unemployment traps; (2) unemployment compensation linked to training, job creation and incentives to work; (3) more equal opportunities and further measures to take account of women's skill and needs in the labour market and society generally; (4) more flexible pension arrangements to enable variable retirement age and a combination of retirement and working income; (5) further measures to integrate disabled people into the mainstream of society.  Much more needs to be done at every level, including the provision of better education and training, equal opportunities for men and women and further social protection in our housing and health services.</P>
    <P>The greatest challenge facing the welfare state in the short term is the serious financial difficulties brought about by the demographic changes which will occur.  It is well known that in the coming decades there will be a considerable shift in the demographic structure of our population and that an increasing number of older people will have to rely on the support of a shrinking number of people in the working age group.  By the year 2020 the ratio of people aged 66 or older to those in the working age may increase by approximately 50 per cent. There will be no easy options in the face of this fundamental change and available resources will have to be shared between the active and the inactive, between the old and the young.  Governments will have to make difficult choices, some of which will involve conflict in the distributions between the generations and we may have to promote private social security provision.  It may even be necessary to extend the length of people's working lives rather than <Col N="1951" /> shorten them.  However, this in itself will not be sufficient to increase the rate of employment.  The Select Committee on Social Affairs should spent more time discussing matters relating to social welfare and the implications of social policy, than has been the case up to now.</P>
    <P>Section 5 provides for an increase of £7 in the monthly rate of child benefit. From September next the monthly rate of child benefit will be £27 for each of the first two children and £32 for each subsequent child.  In addition, child benefit is being extended to 18 year olds who are in full-time education or physically or mentally disabled.  It will also extend the existing provisions whereby child benefit is payable to a qualified parent while serving abroad as a member of the Defence Forces or Civil Service so as to enable payment to be made to a qualified parent outside the State while his or her spouse or partner is serving abroad as a member of the Defence Forces or Civil Service.  I welcome the improvements in child benefit and support the view that the system of child dependant allowances in the social welfare system creates inequities between families on social welfare and those supported by low paid employment. The best way to remove those inequities is to promote the development of the child benefit system at the highest possible rates with a view to eliminating child dependant allowances and eventually incorporating a much improved child benefit system within the overall tax system.  This would entail the elimination of both child additions to the income tax exemption limits and the family income supplement.</P>
    <P>The system of child income support should be integrated in such a way that it reduces the potential for unemployment and poverty traps.  This, allied to the maintenance of the real value of social welfare benefits in general, would represent a socially responsible attempt to combine the overriding concern to promote employment growth with an effective strategy to secure the income position of the disadvantaged.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1952" /> Part III, sections 6 to 10, provides for changes in the payment of social insurance contributions which include an exemption from payment of PRSI contributions in respect of the first £50 of weekly earnings in the case of employees paying the full rate of PRSI and in respect of the first £520 of annual income and the case of the self-employed and other optional contributors under the social insurance scheme. There is provision for an increase in the income threshold below which the reduced rate of employers' PRSI contribution of 9 per cent applies and a further provision for an ongoing employers PRSI exemption scheme.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats' priority is to increase sustainable employment and to reduce unemployment.  From studying all the key characteristics of the labour market, we believe reducing the cost of employing people would make the most direct contribution to reducing unemployment.</P>
    <P>The structure of the PRSI system means it is regressive, increasing the costs of low paid more than high paid labour.  This follows from a contribution of a flat rate of PRSI with a ceiling beyond which no reductions are made. The PRSI reduction envisaged will do little to promote employment or eliminate the unemployment traps.  Very few workers earn up to £170 or £180 per week, the limit one can earn to benefit from these provisions which will not make the transition from unemployment to low paid work any easier. Unemployed people will still perceive low paid employment as a risk because it involves a reassessment of other means-tested benefits, such as rent allowances and medical cards.</P>
    <P>Section 10 provides for regulatory powers for an ongoing employers' PRSI exemption scheme.  Employers who take on additional employees who constitute a net increase in their workforce above that applying on a specified date will not have to pay the employer's element of PRSI contributions in respect of such employees for a two year period.  This is an acknowledgement that the Minister <Col N="1953" /> and his Department believe that the rates of PRSI applicable to employers is a major disincentive to employment and I fail to understand why this unusual tax has not been abolished.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provisions of section 10, but it does not go far enough.  It could have been used in a more imaginative way to improve greatly the chances of creating more sustainable jobs.  The provisions relating to adoptive benefit, carer's allowance and maternity benefit are welcome.  There is nothing, however to provide vigorous remedial action to help those who feel socially excluded and marginalised.</P>
    <P>As politicians, we have a duty to produce a long term strategy to limit poverty and social exclusion and promote full social integration.  This means there must be a major change in social welfare policies, education and training and it is regrettable this Bill does not deal with any of those issues.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>While Deputy Walsh had some wonderful ideas, like his colleagues, he <Col N="1954" /> continues to lament the 2.5 per cent increase in social welfare payments. Fianna Fáil never implemented an increase of 10 per cent or 12 per cent for old age pensioners.  Is that not what we should talk about?  It is pointless talking about a 3 per cent or 4 per cent increase.  Fianna Fáil is making a meal out of a mere £60.</P>
    <P>There are many worth-while provisions in the budget, but Fianna Fáil has continued to lament that the 2.5 per cent increase should have been 3 per cent, ignoring the fact that payments will be brought forward by six weeks.  I hope in two years' time when speaking on the budget I will compliment the Minister on bringing forward the payments to 1 April.  Every year people complain that the taxes are introduced from midnight on budget day, but the increases are awarded from July.  We have brought forward payments to mid-June and I hope they will be made in May next year.  By the time we face the next general election &mdash; when Fianna Fáil will have a major problem, on hands &mdash; I hope we will be giving payments on 1 April.  Fianna Fáil should acknowledge this as a major step forward and stop &ldquo;olagóning&rdquo; about the 2.5 per cent increase.  If we could have given a 10 per cent increase to social welfare recipients then we would have something worthwhile about which to talk.  However, there are constraints on all Minister at budget time.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil should stop talking about how good it was in the past.  If the previous Fianna Fáil-Labour and Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Governments had done half the work it considers this Government should have done in the past two months, the country would be in a much better position. We are even being blamed about the state of the roads.  We are in office only two months whereas the previous Government was in office for seven years, and neglected the roads.  Governments should adopt certain standards when they take up Opposition and should not talk about a complete breakdown of law and order.  The previous <Col N="1955" /> Minister had hardly left his seat on this side of the House and taken up his seat on the other side when he discovered a number of shortcomings.</P>
    <P>Deputy Walsh referred to media experts.  I wonder if those experts have all the answers.  We now have experts writing on the difficulties in the financial markets.  Why do those people stay in jobs in which they have to churn out words day after day to produce articles when they could become millionaires overnight?  They appear to have all the expertise on managing finances and regarding what Ministers should or should not do.  Fianna Fáil must live up to its promises or the record will show it did not, but media articles are forgotten very quickly.  Nothing is forgotten as quickly as the daily newspaper.  It is usually thrown in the bin and more up-to-date news is produced the following day. Perhaps Ministers and others who are interested in certain topics keep files on articles written by journalists.  Many journalists perceive themselves as being divinely inspired; one can almost see the Holy Ghost hovering over them as they write their articles but what do they prove at the end of the day?  Most people quickly forget about what journalists write.  In any case, they will never have to act on their words.  Now that Fianna Fáil is in Opposition I appeal to it not to pretend it has all the answers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> There should be a time of mourning and time allowed to slide out gracefully.  In, say, 12 months' time it might be more inspired, but it certainly could not have all the answers yet.  So many Bills are being produced that one would feel like taking drastic action to put a stop to it. Fianna Fáil have all the answers. However, this Social Welfare Bill is a reasonable effort at solving the problems. It has introduced changes which I <Col N="1956" /> welcome and we should not harp on the aspects of it that are not up to the standard we would like.</P>
      <P>This is the first of three budgets.  It is unfair to expect the Government to solve every problem in its first budget because it cannot be done.  I welcome bringing forward the date of payment and I have no doubt that in the next two budgets they will again be brought forward and increases given in social welfare to help those who are badly off. Widows in particular need a bigger boost than the miserly allowance they get at the moment.  Those who depend on a widow's pension certainly live in no great luxury.</P>
      <P>The Minister should consider bringing in a uniform rate of pay.  Why was it decided that there should be a different rate of pay for the different categories? It causes confusion and, I am sure, much work, assessing what people in the different categories should get.  It is time we brought in a standard rate because I can see no point in having a difference of £1 or £2 between categories.  This may mean spending extra money because payments would have to be brought up rather than down, but it would save money in the long run.</P>
      <P>The Government set out to encourage people to work and employers to give work.  Under section 10 of the Bill employers who take on additional employees and create a net increase in employment are exempted from having to pay employers' PRSI for a full two years.  This is a major advance and should be emphasised more than the minor and silly criticisms of this Bill.  If we can get employers to take on employees we will play a major role in helping the unemployed.  There is much sympathy for the unemployed.  We had to do something about the problem, and encouraging employers to take on new workers, particularly young people under 23 years of age, is a major step.  It breaks the cycle whereby people with no experience cannot get a job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Adoptive benefit, introduced this year, is welcome because an adoptive parent has the same difficulties as a <Col N="1957" /> natural parent.  It recognises the role played by adoptive parents, and I compliment the Minister on introducing it.</P>
    <P>The carer's allowance has been the bane of everyone's life for many years. We had many tussles with the former Minister, Dr. Woods.  I am glad it has been advanced bit by bit and that this year £150 will be disregarded.  That is a major advance because people who look after the elderly and the sick do a marvellous job, not just from a humanitarian point of view but from the point of view of saving the country, the Government and particularly the Minister for Health money by taking people out of hospital beds.  Previously the eligibility conditions were so strict that nobody could qualify.  The conditions are more reasonable now.  If £150 is disregarded it gives people on lower incomes a chance to benefit from one of the best schemes ever introduced.  I know of a case where a person who, because her husband's salary was taken into account, did not qualify for the carer's allowance even though she was doing a major job in looking after two people who really should have been in an institution.  Any advance that can be made in regard to the carer's allowance must be welcomed.</P>
    <P>There is a difficulty in regard to those who look after old people but do not live in the same house.  I have a constituent, an old woman of 75 years, who is very seriously ill and whose neighbour has been looking after her for years and is with her all the time.  Without the care of the neighbour the woman would be in hospital but, because her neighbour does not live in the same house, she cannot get the carer's allowance.  This neighbour will probably get an allowance for home care but that is only a pittance for a woman who is giving so much of her time towards looking after a seriously ill person.</P>
    <P>I would like to see allowances made in genuine cases such as that.  However, care must be taken because otherwise one half of the country would claim to be minding the other half.  They might not live within an ass's roar of the <Col N="1958" /> people they were supposed to be minding but they would claim to be there all day if it came to getting an allowance. However, genuine cases can be verified by local doctors.  Perhaps in next year's budget there might be a change to cater for them.</P>
    <P>We should do everything possible to encourage people on social welfare to go back to work.  Last week I spoke to a constituent who is wondering why he went back to work only to pay a massive amount of tax because his benefit had accumulated; instead of having a tax free allowance of £61 he was given only £35.  The system of counting benefits for tax purposes means that to pay the tax owed people get a much smaller tax allowance and finish up paying more tax just because they went back to work. The constituent I referred to was living at home with his parents which meant that they were deprived of any benefit. When this man went back to work he ended up paying so much tax on what he earned that he was in despair.  If a person on lone parent's allowance returns to work in the middle of the tax year she is taxed on the lone parent's allowance and on what she earns even though she receives only one of these payments at any one time and has not exceeded her tax free allowance when receiving either payment.</P>
    <P>We must do everything to guarantee that people who return to work will be rewarded.  Young people know that if they remain at home their parents will be deprived of allowances and they will lose their medical cards and other benefits they would get if they were unemployed. The budget embraced the concept of encouraging people to return to work.  I would like to see the red tape cut and the tax free allowances slashed by Fianna Fáil in the past restored to ensure that if people return to work they will be rewarded and not punished.</P>
    <P>I welcome the increase from £10 to £25 in the minimum weekly rate of unemployment assistance payable to single people with means assessed solely on the basis of parental income.  It is crazy that a person living at home can <Col N="1959" /> be deprived of unemployment assistance in this way.  In one case I dealt with, the value put on board and lodgings was £39 with the result that the person concerned was left with nothing. There is an anomaly in that if this person leaves home to live in a flat he will receive the full rate of unemployment assistance plus a rent allowance.  This point has been made time and again.  I hope the decision to increase the minimum weekly rate from £10 to £25 marks the first of three steps to bring this farce to an end.  Why should parents have to see their children leave home in order to abuse the system?  If the system is so convoluted it should be changed.  It is time we dealt with this matter and perhaps the Minister will do so in the next two budgets.</P>
    <P>A person may receive the carer's allowance even if not living with the incapacitated person.  This system is open to abuse.  As a person will not have to prove desertion I am concerned that under the provisions relating to desertion people will receive payment on making a claim.  Deputies regularly deal with women deserted by their parents and who are trying to secure maintenance; this can entail much trauma and making inquiries in England and elsewhere. In overcoming this problem I hope the Minister has not gone too far whereby it will be easy to claim that one has been deserted and receive payment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>When introducing the Bill the Minister said that when he was on the Opposition benches he thought he knew a great deal about the social welfare system but since taking office he has discovered that the matter is much more complex and extensive than he thought and he is continuing to learn.  I do not claim to be an expert on social welfare but most of us in this House knew the value of the local loans fund. I welcome that the Minister has dealt in this Chamber with a matter being discussed openly and extensively in the media.  Many people do not realise that <Col N="1960" /> the value of this fund is of the order of £490 million in respect of outstanding debt in relation to mortgages granted prior to 1987.  I accept what Deputy Clohessy said that many questions remain unanswered.  Unfortunately, the question of repossession appears all too frequently on the agenda of the local authority of which I am a member.  Due to unemployment or emigation many people invariably have to vacate their houses and after a period the local authority has to take steps to protect its security.</P>
      <P>It is the Minister's intention to securitise a portion of this fund but he has not told us who the bidders are and what discount he is prepared to offer.  Will there be a tendering process? What will this mean for the customers of local authorities which take a sympathetic attitude towards customers who are in default because of hardship or change family circumstances?  Now that the task master will change, from the local loans funds as operated by the Department of the Environment to an unnamed institution, be it a financial institution, the Housing Finance Agency or the debt management agency, will it be as sympathetic or place greater demands on local authorities to collect funds at an accelerated rate?</P>
      <P>With many others I will look for considerably more detail from the Minister on who will be affected to allow us form a view on this matter.  If we feel his efforts are well intentioned and will not exacerbate the position of local authority customers who are not the most sought after clientele by financial institutions, be they banks or building societies which market their mortgage packages aggressively, we will not place any obstructions in his way.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare on issuing the information update published by the Department, although some of the photographs are out of focus.</P>

      <P>The so-called beneficiaries of the budget were not pleased with its provisions.  We welcome the widening of the tax bands and the increase in personal allowances.  There is not anything new in that but it must be stated that the &ldquo;giveaways&rdquo; in the region of £200 million to £240 million in <Col N="1964" /> the budget do not mean that the taxpayers will pay £200 million less in income tax this year as against last year. When pay increases, rising employment and higher prices are taken into account, this increases the tax take. Even allowing for increased public expenditure, as indicated &mdash; unfortunately all those indications in the budget are now gone because we were told then it was 6 per cent but it has now gone up to 8 per cent, allowing for the increased inflationary effects of the equality payments &mdash; more could have been done his year than in previous years.  That would have increased public confidence and consumer spending and Exchequer revenue returns would have been enhanced.</P>
      <P>Despite income tax concessions the budget has been received by the general public as a damp squib.  Following its delivery and the ritual examination of its detail in the media it is forgotten about by the tax paying public.  The Minister for Finance stated that the annual budget is about establishing priorities.  He said it reflects choices and affirms values.  He continued:</P>
      <P>The budget is an indication of the type of society that we want for ourselves over the next 12 months and beyond.  It will demonstrate a commitment to the social fabric of our community &mdash; one of the most valuable assets which we have.</P>
      <P>I welcome the emphasis in the budget on rewarding work but I question its intended purpose to strengthen social solidarity.  All the economic commentators tell us that this country is enjoying sustained economic growth, falling unemployment and will continue to prosper for the foreseeable future. This was not achieved overnight but by prudent management of the economy over the past number of years.</P>

    <P>The fruits of this labour are not being distributed in any equitable way when large financial institutions gain more from measures in this budget than the 14 per cent of our population who are over 65 years of age.  Added to that <Col N="1965" /> number of elderly are the single unemployed and childless unemployed couples.  The 2.5 per cent increase in social welfare payments is described by the Conference of Religious of Ireland as miserly and uncaring.  While the spin doctors are trying to equate and justify the level of increase to the rate of inflation, I question that rate and its method of calculation for an old age pensioner living in a rural area whose food is purchased from shops other than national supermarket chains and who invariably must depend on a private hackney service because of the total absence of a public transport system. Unfortunately, many old age pensioners who have free travel passes can never use them.</P>
    <P>Because of its social welfare provisions this will be remembered as the anti-senior citizen budget, giving the smallest increase in social welfare for approximately 30 years.  Those people who have contributed a lifetime of work and service to this State are the forgotten sector of society.  Minister Quinn said that the budget reflects choices and affirms values but in regard to social welfare Fianna Fáil rejects the choices made and does not subscribe to the values as indicated in the social solidarity portion of the budget.</P>
    <P>Last year, Fianna Fáil provided £4 million for the housing aid for the elderly scheme which ensured that the huge backlog that had built up in this area was tackled.  This sum was the usual provision plus an additional £2 million from the tax amnesty.  It would not have been asking a lot if the same had been provided this year.  Instead, a 100 per cent reduction in this worthwhile scheme, on top of the derisory level of social welfare increase, should send out a clear signal to people over the age of 65 &mdash; representing 14 per cent of our population &mdash; that this Government has made choices but the elderly do not feature; to any appreciable extent, in those choices.</P>
    <P>The phasing out of the bank levy over three years and the reduction of corporaction profits tax to 38 per cent seems <Col N="1966" /> perverse compared to the level of social welfare increase.  I heard the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, stating that the removal of the bank levy was Exchequer neutral but it will improve their cash flow thereby leaving money in their hands for longer periods.  If the Government is in the business of removing levies, why will it not remove the 2 per cent levy on all insurance products that the elderly must pay as an extra source of taxation, namely, house, car and public liability insurance?  This would involve only a small sum of money and it would be an indication to those over 65 that this is a caring Government.  It would also ensure that the maximum amount of money is left with those people who have made this country what it is today.</P>
    <P>To put matters in perspective, the benefits that will accrue to the banks as a result of the removal of the bank levy and the reduction in corporation profits tax, estimated at £40 million, could have financed a substantial additional increase in social welfare allowances. The choices made, the values affirmed and the priorities established by the Government do not take into account the old, widows and the majority of unemployed without children.  Those dependent on social welfare will be left further behind as sophisticated lobby groups seem to make further progress in their demands.</P>
    <P>Deputy Clohessy referred to the Carers' Association.  In its pre-budget submission that association estimated there are 100,000 carers, of whom 30,000 are full-time.  Approximately 4,500 qualify for carer's allowance and only 50 per cent of that number obtain the full allowance.  In its pre-budget submission the Carers' Association made certain requests.  Carers are deserving of much greater recognition.  I realise the number of people eligible for such benefits will only gradually increase, but I ask the Minister to give very careful consideration to this matter as our elderly population increases.  He should heed the concerns of the Carers' Association and other groups representing people <Col N="1967" /> who work on a 24-hour basis looking after the elderly living at home.  Were it not for their work the task of looking after these people would fall to the State.  There is great social solidarity, particularly in rural Ireland where there is not a sufficient number of long stay beds, and it is very important everything possible is done to ensure carers who work in the home on a full-time basis are adequately compensated.</P>
    <P>Deputy Browne referred to people who may not wish to work in the home on a full-time basis.  There is also the question of sons or daughters who are not living at home but live on the same farm in their own house, or in the neighbourhood. At present such people who are looking after elderly relatives are not entitled to a carer's allowance. There are many such people and one cannot deny they give full-time care to their parents or elderly relatives.  These people are entitled to recognition for the valuable work they do, thereby ensuring those they care for are not a burden on the State.</P>
    <P>One of the requests of the Carers' Association relates to the respite home care project in the Eastern Health Board region, launched in 1994.  The association has asked for £35,000 per annum over a three year period to assist more than 150 carers and their families. It also called for an increase in the respite fund to £2 million to help meet the increasing demand nationally for respite care.  I fully support the association's request for a home care assistance service and its comments on the preservation of secondary benefits.</P>
    <P>The widow's contributory pension, now called survivor's contributory pension, will be increased from £64.50 to £66.10.  This is based on a contribution record similar to retirement and old age contributory pension, yet the latter payment amounts to £6.70 more a week. The widow's pension should be adjusted upwards to take account of the record of contribution and ensure equality of treatment.  Under the old age pension regime there is a disregard of £6 when <Col N="1968" /> assessing means.  This disregard has remained unchanged for nearly 20 years.  The old age pension was then in the order of £18 to £20 per week and, accordingly, a disregard of other income amounted to nearly 30 per cent.  The disregard should be adjusted upwards to at least £20 or to a level equivalent to present day values.</P>
    <P>For people on unemployment assistance, particularly long term small holders assistance, a disregard should be introduced to give an incentive to people to improve their small farms.  At present the more improvements people make to their small holdings, the more they are penalised.  There is no worthwhile reason for many small farmers to improve farm productivity since it jeopardises the guaranteed weekly social welfare payment.  A large number of small holders in the 40 to 50 year age group as a result of the present system have no incentive to expand their holdings. This matter should be examined with a view to improving the system for social welfare recipients and also, in the long term, for the State.</P>
    <P>I welcome the announcement by the Minister for Finance that the change in covenants for the funding of education fees will not apply to those providing income support to people who need full time care.  While not directly related to social welfare, the proposed increase in the deposit interest retention tax, DIRT, from 10 to 15 per cent on special savings accounts should not be applied to senior citizens.  Extra income in the hands of this ever increasing group of people would benefit the State because the more income they have the less dependent they become on State services and social welfare entitlements.  I had intended to comment on other issues and I hope I will have the opportunity to do so on Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Laoighis-Offaly):</i> Most contributions in today's debate have been constructive.  Given the speed with which Governments have changed in the past two years, the scope is lessened for unthought-out contributions, <Col N="1969" /> and people making requests today realise they may have to deliver on them in the future.  I listened with interest to the contributions of Deputies Joe Walsh and Hughes.  It is clear the people are not being fooled by those who play tricks with mirrors, as some Fianna Fáil Deputies are trying to do. In previous years &mdash; virtually every party in the House was in Government during this time &mdash; social welfare increases were set at levels of 2.5 per cent, 3 per cent, 4 per cent and 5 per cent, but the payment date was put back from April to May, and June to July. What would be the point in giving a 20 per cent increase and not making it payable for 24 months?  It would be better for the Government to give a 2 or 2.5 per cent increase and make it payable immediately than to give an extra 0.5 per cent and not make it payable until the end of the year.</P>
      <P>Many people remember the period when Deputy McCreevy was Minister for Social Welfare &mdash; that is not easily forgotten in my constituency.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Laoighis-Offaly):</i> Many of the changes made by him were reversed in the past two years, but we are still working hard to remove the last vestiges of his influence on the social welfare system, particularly the attacks on the social insurance system.  Deputy Hughes said, maybe unintentionally, he rejects the values of social solidarity displayed in the budget.  Those values, which are in marked contrast to those which prevailed only a few short years ago, particularly in the 1989-92 Government period, are to be upheld.  All the contibutions on this matter are tempered by the fact that all parties have participated in Government in recent years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the fact that this Bill provides for the highest ever level of increase in social welfare spending, an increase of £212 million compared with last year's increase of £157 million.  The sense of satisfaction with such an <Col N="1970" /> increase is almost a double edged sword as it would be preferable if we did not have to allocate more than £4 billion to social welfare but, unfortunately, a substantial proportion of the population is dependent on social welfare.  The Government has tried to target the increase on the areas of greatest need. Whenever we prioritise we can be accused of having less concern for those items that do not receive immediate attention.  The Department is to be complimented on prioritising the needs of families with children in this year's budget.</P>
    <P>Reports by bodies such as the ESRI, university academics and the Combat Poverty Agency have stressed the needs of families with children and I am delighted that measures have been taken that are child centred and assist families with children.  Studies of family income show that greatest demand on family incomes is when there are children at home and the demands lessen as the children grow up and leave home. I am delighted the £7 increase in child benefit will come into effect this year and that the Minister resisted the temptation to grant the third and subsequent children lesser increases.  It is appreciated that without distinction to the number in the family the increase in child benefit is £7 per child.  This payment is directed at mothers.  It has been suggested that this benefit should be taxable but to look at it in those terms is to look at the financial needs of families in a very narrow focus.  Studies show that this direct payment to mothers goes to the children for whom it is intended and this should be borne in mind.</P>
    <P>The back-to-school clothing allowance and the books allowance are being increased.  Members know the burden that back-to-school costs impose on families and this is another example of the pro-child focus in this year's social welfare provisions.  The payment of child dependant allowances for those in full time education up to age 22 is a great encouragement to the children of those on social welfare to continue their education.  That trend will be reinforced <Col N="1971" /> by this year's extended provision.  I accept that the provision is constrained by the money available but I ask the Minister to consider the possibility of extending this provision to those on short term benefits.  In regard to unemployment assistance the distinction between long term and short term is clear, however, disability benefit, which can continue for a number of years is counted as a short term payment and I ask that this be examined.</P>
    <P>The increase to £25 in the minimum payment of unemployment assistance to young people living at home is pro-family. Deputy Browne spoke at length about the pernicious effects of the present system under which young people are driven from the family home and forced to live in subsidised accommodation in order to claim a minimum amount of unemployment assistance.  I share his concern that the value of board and lodgings at home can be arbitrarily varied from one family to the next and this needs to be examined.</P>
    <P>The provision of adoptive benefit, equivalent to maternity benefit as promised in the Adoptive Leave Act is welcome as is the extension of maternity benefit to the new category of women covered under the maternity leave legislation. The range of options shows that the Bill is focused very much on the needs of children.  I make no apologies for complimenting the Minister on prioritising the needs of families with children.  All social welfare claimants will benefit from attention in successive years to certain categories of claimants. I accept that the categories who are not prioritised may complain but at the end of a period everybody will be better off. That is better than pretending everybody will benefit from across the board increases which are held back until the end of the year.</P>
    <P>The measures to help employment build on those introduced last year and in previous years.  I particularly welcome the exemption of PRSI charges on the first £50 weekly earnings of PAYE <Col N="1972" /> workers and the first £520 annual earnings of the self-employed.  Coupled with measures to give PRSI relief to those on low incomes last year, it represents a significant incentive to employers to employ more people.  It can be the deciding factor in helping a person choose the option of work when it presents itself.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision for the introduction of an ongoing PRSI exemption scheme to encourage employers to take young people off the live register.  Those regulations should be targeted at encouraging employers to employ the long term unemployed.  These measures, coupled with the very successful back to work allowance scheme, will continue to make a difference to those on low incomes this year and encourage employers to take a person off the live register when a vacancy occurs.  People have been wondering why the unemployed have not benefited even though the economy is so good.  Many employers preferred to give jobs to those who left school recently or were recently unemployed.  The measures in the Bill to promote employment will encourage employers to think of employing the long term unemployed. This will be aided by the strategy outlined in the report published recently by the Office of the Tánaiste on tackling long term unemployment.  The measures will complement each other.</P>
    <P>In common with other Deputies I welcome the improvements in the provisions for the carer's allowance.  The increase in the income disregard is significant and I am glad that people caring for pensioners who are not in receipt of social welfare pensions will be able to avail of the scheme this year.  In my constituency, many pensioners in receipt of a pension from the ESB were cared for by their wives but they could not apply for this scheme.  They appreciate the fact that this year they will be able to do so.  The Minister should look at other areas, for example, the extension of secondary benefits such as free travel, free TV licence and rental allowance to pensioners not in receipt of a social welfare <Col N="1973" /> pension.  It would be appreciated by pensioners who fall into that category.  I recently brought the case of a person in receipt of a small public service pension to the attention of the Department.  As it is not a social welfare pension the person cannot avail of the secondary benefits. The Minister broke the mould by extending the carer's allowance provision this year and I encourage him to consider extending secondary benefits to all pensioners.</P>
    <P>I brought the position in my constituency regarding seasonal workers in Bord na Móna to the attention of the previous Minister.  The Department of Social Welfare appreciated that they were in a category of their own and allowed a local arrangement to exist in the midlands as regards the assessment of means for unemployment purposes. That was confirmed to me last February by the previous Minister, Deputy Woods.  He stated in writing that the earnings which such workers gain in the short summer period during which they can avail of employment in Bord na Móna will not be held against them in assessing their entitlement to unemployment assistance.  As a result of a challenge through the appeals office, which is independent, the local arrangement in the midlands had to be terminated.</P>
    <P>I stress that the way the social welfare regulations for the assessment of unemployment assistance applied to Bord na Móna workers is unique and has been demonstrated to be a disincentive to them taking up employment in the following year.  I have been hammering at this issue for the past few months and hope that some relief can be given to these workers before the season commences this year.  If the weather picks up that is likely to start quite quickly.  I know people who are considering whether to take up employment this year because of the heavy handed treatment they received over the past few months.  Families with three and four children were told they must survive on £40 or £50 a week over the winter and single people living with elderly parents <Col N="1974" /> were told they were not entitled to anything. That is not what the social welfare system was designed to do.  I know the Minister had a chance to consider the implications of this problem recently and I hope he will come back to us on it very soon.  It is a serious disincentive to work.</P>
    <P>In the constituency of Laois-Offaly there is no employment exchange run by the Department of Social Welfare. They are agency offices run by people who do a very fine job but it means that social welfare recipients do not have the same access to the system as those in my neighbouring constituency of Westmeath. An office is run by the Department in Athlone and if social welfare recipients have queries they can be dealt with there and then.  I ask the Minister to consider providing an office in Laois-Offaly.</P>
    <P>I support the Bill which is pro-child, pro-family, and pro-employment.  The level of response in my area shows that the recipients of these increases very much value them and I look forward to the Minister continuing his good work for many years to come.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>I have always paid close attention to the area of social welfare because it deals with the most vulnerable sector of the community. Despite the growing influences in modern society and the on going rapid development of technology, unfortunately there is little or no evidence that profound social inequality is being eliminated.</P>
      <P>This unfortunate observation is not only applicable to this country, poverty is a daily reality for a high percentage of citizens in countries with the most developed economies in the world. There are many reasons for this serious flaw in the operation of modern industrialised societies.  These include inadequate access to education and training opportunities; uneven industrial development in a country and the failure of integrated planning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regardless of such factors it remains a fundamental reality of society that the <Col N="1975" /> social welfare system provides the core economic support for a large percentage of the population.  While those affected by unemployment figure prominently in any consideration of social welfare a number of other groups have an almost total financial dependence on the system. These include old age pensioners, widows, single parents, deserted spouses and those unable to work through physical or mental disability or ill-health.</P>
    <P>As successive Governments strive to deal effectively with the grave problem of social deprivation and poverty, our social welfare positions have the crucial role of providing some degree of financial protection for the most vulnerable sectors.</P>
    <P>The quality of any Social Welfare Bill must be assessed under two main headings. First, within the overall economic realities of the day, one must ascertain whether its provisions deal with social inequality in the short term.  For example, is specific focus placed on those with most urgent needs in order to really improve their standards of living? Second, we must ascertain whether the overall thrust of the Bill indicates that the Government is addressing the equally important need for a longer-term reshaping of the social welfare system, where possible, allowing people to progress from a position of dependency and subsistence to one of independence and financial well-being.</P>
    <P>Being as generous as possible, the best that could be said is that the overall quality of this Bill is extremely uneven. It contains some welcome improvements in social welfare provisions, a few substantial both in terms of real improvement and widespread relevance, the £7 increase in the child benefit immediately coming to mind in this regard, and, to a much lesser degree, the mild reform of PRSI regulations being acknowledged as constituting a step in the right direction.  It also contains some improvements in the carer's allowance, the adoptive benefit scheme, maternity benefit and a widening of the definition of a qualifying <Col N="1976" /> child.  However, the improvements generally are quite modest in real terms. While the range of areas addressed appears relatively impressive at first glance, a more detailed assessment results in a much more reserved judgment on the substance of the recommended changes.</P>
    <P>The unease is greatly magnified when one comes to the core issue of social insurance and assistance payments, which undoubtedly form the back-bone of our social welfare system.  The general restriction of increases over a range of benefits under the general headings of social insurance and social assistance to 2.5 per cent has shocked most impartial observers.  While certain commentators have rather cynically questioned the relevance of changes of the order of £1 or less, the stark reality is that every penny, never mind each pound, matters when one lives in poverty, since those most deprived financially are acutely aware of every increase, no matter how small, in the general cost of living.  That inflation is predicted to exceed 2.5 per cent over the coming year is of great importance to those without any resources on which to fall back other than their social welfare payments.</P>
    <P>I make no apology for reiterating in the strongest possible terms my dismay that the Minister saw fit to increase social welfare insurance and assistance payments by 2.5 per cent only at a time when he and his Government colleagues inherited the healthiest national accounts for a generation.  The steady climb of the national finances from the brink of disaster in 1987 to a position of excellence within the European Union in 1994 was by no means easy or painless; it involved a great deal of sacrifice and deprivation on the part of many. While almost all sectors of the community contributed to the economic fight-back, as usual, the most vulnerable sectors felt the effect of cutbacks most acutely despite successive Governments having either matched or exceeded the prevailing rate of inflation when increasing social welfare payments in annual budgets.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1977" /> There had been a sense of expectation that the social welfare provisions this year would mark a real increase in the standard of living of those most in need.  That a long term advocate of social justice and equality was in a position to deliver rendered that expectation even more promising for the most cynical of observers.  Therefore, it was simply unbelievable that the Minister for Finance, in presenting his budget, demonstrated clearly that his Cabinet colleague, the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa, was quite happy to settle for a 2.5 per cent increase in social insurance and assistance payments. What added insult to injury was the Minister's response to justifiable criticism of his paltry increase.  Rather than accepting that a major mistake had been made and that he would attempt to recover the position to some degree, he has not shown the slightest element of remorse for his penny-pinching.  He appears to have restorted to what would appear to be the most consistent, remaining policy of his political strategy, to heap blame and insult on the Fianna Fáil Party.  While he might be forgiven for having been surprised by the turn of events in Irish political life over the past four or five months, as were all of us, it is about time he realised that he carries responsibility for decisions on social welfare matters.  If he does not accept such responsibility, he may no longer be in that position by the time he wakes up to that reality.</P>
    <P>While social insurance and assistance payments do not dominate the provisions of this Bill, it is important to consider some longer-term provisions.  With the exception of child benefit and changes in PRSI contributions, the Minister's proposals provide little or no insight into his vision of the future of his Department.</P>
    <P>Particularly relevant to debates such as this is the lack of comprehensive information on the issues being discussed. This Bill deals with an expenditure of approximately £4 billion over the coming year, that is £4,000 million, or in <Col N="1978" /> excess of £10 million each day.  Furthermore, social welfare expenditure without doubt is at the top of the league in terms of importance, being the main safety valve in our society for dealing with marked social inequality and profound poverty.  Yet, the main documentation supplied consists of a summary memorandum of six pages.  Does anybody seriously think that Members of this House, with their almost nonexistent research facilities, can properly assess the likely impact of the Bill without having much comprehensive information? At the very least, I would urge that major financial Bills, such as this should be accompanied by detailed supporting documentation clearly addressing two key information needs: first, the need for a clear description of the Minister's precise objectives and, second, the need for financial costs or anticipated impact of each of its provisions to be clearly stated.  Ideally, such documentation should contain an assessment of the effectiveness of the preceding year's provisions in meeting their targets and objectives.  The value of such information would be twofold, one would immediately be able to evaluate the objectives and priorities of the Minister and could then assess if the proposed provisions had a realistic chance of dealing properly with those objectives.</P>
    <P>I welcome certain aspects of the Bill, but I am disappointed with its core provisions. I appeal to the Minister to acknowledge the error of his ways.  His actions have not been consistent with his long held and eloquently proclaimed views on social justice and poverty and he should move rapidly and effectively to make amends for the serious deficiencies in this Bill.  Furthermore, it is in everybody's interest that the Minister focuses his energies on becoming more effective in his dealings with his Cabinet colleagues.  An ability to occasionally pull something out of the hat at the Cabinet table is not a substitute for extracting fair and just treatment for those most deprived in our society.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1979" /> There are many other aspects of the Bill to which I could refer and I am sure I will have an opportunity to do so on Committee Stage.  However, one aspect of it is appalling, I have had a number of representations from people on reduced disability payments.  A man &mdash; with a wife and a number of children &mdash; who has been in receipt of social welfare benefit will be advised that his payments must be reduced after 18 months because his contributions have run out. As a result he must call to the community welfare officer weekly and collect a sum in excess of £40 or £50 per week up to the shortfall.  I appeal to the Minister of State to convey to her colleague that this is an unacceptable position. The function of the community welfare service is to provide supplementary and emergency services, not to pay weekly sums of money to social welfare recipients because of the social welfare system administered at national level.</P>
    <P>I refer to this matter because three people have made representations about it to me.  The gentlemen in question must call to the community welfare officer weekly and wait for two hours to collect their money.  It is a crazy system whereby people's social welfare benefit is reduced and the shortfall must be collected under another scheme.  The money is coming out of the same Department and paid by the taxpayer. This matter must be addressed quickly as the present position is unacceptable. It is degrading for a man having worked all his life becomes ill and finds himself out of work through no fault of his own, to have to go through this system.</P>

      <P>Deputy Wallace described the changes in social welfare as &ldquo;quite modest&rdquo;.  I do not know what he means as £212 million has been allocated this year compared with £157 million last year, an increase of 35 per cent. The Deputy also used the phrase &ldquo;core economic support&rdquo;.  While I appreciate one point made by the Deputy that we would all have liked a higher increase than 2.5 per cent for old age pensioners, <Col N="1980" /> the Minister is determined to introduce three budgets and I would prefer to analyse our performance in 1997 on that basis.</P>

      <P>I did not interrupt the Deputy.  I allowed him the privilege of talking uninterrupted and I ask him to afford me the same courtesy.  There are many positive aspects to the Bill and I will refer to some of them.  I remember Deputy Allen being thrown out of the House for seeking information from the previous Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Woods, on equal treatment for workers.  It is interesting to note that one of the most positive measures taken by the Government as soon as it came to power was that it dealt with a specific issue which had been hovering around for the past few years, that of the 70,000 Irish women deprived of their entitlements. The secretive approach to this matter in the past which obliged people to go to court to get their entitlements must be analysed in conjunction with the upfront approach of this Administration. More than £200 million will be spent this year on equality payments and the balance will be paid in January 1996, 100 per cent of those payments will be made.  The Government gave a commitment that it would make those payments and it is proceeding to do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said the main barometer for stimulating the alleviation of poverty in large families is an increase in child benefit.  I do not believe that in the history of the State there has been as significant an increase in child benefit as that of £7 per month.  It will result in child benefit of £27 per month for the first two children and £32 per month for <Col N="1981" /> each subsequent child.  That positive measure will result in a significant increase in income for many women. Deputies are inclined to adopt an almost <i>a la carte</i> approach to Bills of this nature.  That is an understandable approach by Opposition Deputies who cannot find a great deal wrong with social welfare legislation, but they consider the positive aspects in this Bill.</P>
    <P>When I worked with the former notional manpower service, AnCO, I was critical that many people were selected to participate in FAS-type courses simply to reduce the numbers on the live register, I welcome the move to consider them as people with certain skills and knowledge and they should not be paraded to do work they do not wish or have the necessary skills to do. A positive feature in the Bill is that we are prepared to identify the 135,000 people who have been unemployed for more than 12 months, ascertain the skills and knowledge and, if possible, place them on training or other courses.</P>
    <P>The Department of Social Welfare has focused on another area recently and Deputies from towns will be familiar with it.  In areas such as Newcastle West, Rathkeale and others many socially deprived people have a tendency to fall back on moneylenders who still operate and offer cash to borrowers. People who borrow money from them often run into difficulties later, resulting in them borrowing money from them and paying prohibitive interest rates.  In recent times the Department of Social Welfare, in conjunction with the credit unions, have tried to steer borrowers from moneylenders. I wish them well in their efforts and I would like if moneylenders ceased to operate.  I am sure many Deputies have had visits from constituents who experience difficulty in paying their ESB and other bills as their social welfare income does not cover their outgoings. Many are caught in an almost permanent poverty trap as a result of borrowing money from moneylenders who approach them with what appears to be soft money.  Such people usually <Col N="1982" /> borrow money for special occasions, such as confirmations and communions, when they are extra vulnerable.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to examine the free telephone scheme.  Of the various schemes operated by the Department of Social Welfare the regulations governing the free telephone scheme are particularly rigid.  I would like a human dimension to be brought to bear in respect of some of the free schemes. For example, I am aware of a woman with multiple sclerosis whose husband is unemployed.  They live in a rural area and wish to avail of the free telephone allowance.  Unless they satisfy certain criteria with regard to age etc, they are not eligible.  I would like if certain cases could be examined on their merits.  They did not conform to the rules and regulations for such schemes but they could be considered on their merits.</P>

      <P>In this debate I would like to refer to various statements made over the years.  According to statistics one of the Trident submarines coming into service in 1995 at a cost of £5 million per day for 20 years has the capacity to destroy all major cities in the <Col N="1985" /> northern hemisphere.  The weapons on board are useless as a protection for the nation launching them.  Their use would cause such destruction and produce such high levels of radiation in our environment that much of the planet would become uninhabitable.</P>
      <P>Bombs kill before they even explode, according to Bishop Eamon Casey in a statement made in reference to the amount of the world's wealth absorbed by arms on the occasion of the joint statement of the Catholic Bishops of Ireland on war and peace in the nuclear age. Sometimes we forget the good deeds of Bishop Casey.  Every gun that is made, every warship launched, signifies a test from those who are hungry and are not fed and from those who are cold and not clothed, according to the late American President, Dwight Eisenhower.  According to a United Nations survey, the world can either continue to pursue the arms race or, more consciously and with deliberate speed, forward a more sustainable international economic and political order; it cannot do both.</P>
      <P>Earlier I described the Fianna Fáil motion as a good one although I disagreed with a small element of it.  I was surprised, being aware of the position of power in which Fianna Fáil has been for many years, it did not do something more positive.  Had it been more positive I would have held Fianna Fáil in much higher esteem because this is a subject close to my heart.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unfortunately, I am unhappy with the amendment.  The Government, of which I am a part, tabled an amendment, with which I cannot agree, to a motion which is good, perhaps ill timed.  However, I am restricted by the Whip, as are all others, but it would be wrong of me not to say that.  I was puzzled when I saw Deputy Burke's motion.  My first instinct was to refer him to the Programme for Government.  I was even more puzzled when I saw the amendment because I felt that not alone had Deputy Burke not read the Programme for Government but most definitely neither had whoever compiled the <Col N="1986" /> amendment.  The Programme for Government clearly states that in view of the fact that the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons Treaty comes up for review in 1995 the Government will be seeking a five yearly review of the treaty and a halt to the production of fissile materials.  Therefore, I do not understand the amendment and I am in a difficult position.</P>
    <P>I commenced with statements which are relevant to the obscene waste of the world's wealth on nuclear energy.  Many people are hungry and cold, many regions do not have water, and many people are badly treated by other human beings.</P>
    <P>This year marks the 25th anniversary of a fundamentally flawed treaty.  The Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons Treaty was rooted in the mistaken belief that one could control the genie.  Democratic Left is not in the illusion business. While we recognise the fundamental flaws in the treaty we also recognise a simple and unpalatable fact.  The treaty, flawed as it is, is the only thing that stands between us and nuclear annihilation. It is also clear that its implementation must be reviewed.  This is why the Government is pressing &mdash; I take this from the Programme for Government &mdash; for five yearly reviews of the treaty, not merely a five year audit.</P>
    <P>The treaty must not only be reviewed but must ultimately be replaced.  We must get away from the belief enshrined in the treaty that nuclear weapons are somehow acceptable in certain hands but not in others.  I accept that I would prefer President Clinton to have control of nuclear weapons rather than Saddam Hussein but I would rather that neither had.  What guarantees have we that the nuclear states will use their powers responsibly?  Russia, one of the nuclear states permitted to hold nuclear weapons under the treaty, is scarcely an example of stability and I shudder to think of the use to which nuclear weapons would have been put in Chechnya or the Ukraine.</P>
    <P>The so-called great powers, the nuclear states, recognised by the treaty <Col N="1987" /> have over the years abused their nuclear capacity.  Since 1970 they have conducted over 580 nuclear tests.  These tests were conducted in the context of what can only be described as nuclear colonism.  Nuclear devices have been exploded not on mainland France but in the French overseas possessions in the South Pacific.  Thousands of people have been dispossessed of their environmental heritage by nuclear tests.  Islands in the South Pacific, used as a nuclear playground by both the United States and France, have been reduced to environmental wastelands.  People have been forced to leave their homes.  Two generations on they are still living in nuclear exile.  They are the forgotten victims of nuclear madness.  They do not fall into the neat categories of nuclear states or non-nuclear states.  They have no say in the use of their land for test purposes.  The colonised rarely have a say in the action of the colonisers.  There is a perverted logic to these tests. Nuclear bombs kill, yet thousands of acres of land, whole islands and thousands of people have been sacrificed in the obscence desire to cause destruction.</P>
    <P>The Government will be pressing for the early conclusion and implementation of a total test ban.  Democratic Left welcomes this commitment.  The issue of nuclear test victims should be placed on the international agenda.  I would like to see Ireland take a lead in the demand for proper compensation, not peppercorns.</P>
    <P>This year marks the 25th anniverary of the treaty.  We also commemorate the 50th anniversary of the nuclear destruction of the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.  The genie was let out of the bottle for the first time and thousands of people still bear the scars.  Every person who knows the history of Nagasaki carries the scars and realises the dramatic effect, the trauma and the destruction of a nuclear bomb.  Any person who reads about it will never forget it.  In 1970 China, France, Russia, the UK and the USA committed themselves to nuclear <Col N="1988" /> disarmament, while the non-nuclear states gave up the right to manufacture or acquire nuclear weapons.  Twenty-five years later, the nuclear states are busy modernising their arsenals of death and many non-nuclear states are known to possess nuclear weapons.</P>
    <P>Nuclear weapons are now thought to be held by countries as diverse as Pakistan, Iraq, Iran and South Africa and may be in the possession of various terrorist groups.  In this context, I welcome South Africa's commitment to abandon its nuclear programme.  Unfortunately, other countries are unlikely to follow President Mandela's lead unless forced to do so by very stiff sanctions.</P>
    <P>Since 1970 more than 75,000 nuclear weapons have been redeployed and more than 580 nuclear tests have been conducted, devastating communities and their environments.  The number of weapons held may have been reduced but they are now far more deadly than the bombs which fell on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.  We have the capacity to destroy the planet and the people who live on it.  We continue to say that the deterrent is necessary.  This can hardly be classified as non-proliferation.</P>
    <P>The nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty was flawed in its inception and has failed in its implementation.  The authors of the Treaty believed that once developed the deadly technology could be controlled.  Once again politicians displayed an object ignorance of human nature.  The technology to manufacture nuclear weapons is relatively simple and the main problem in the past was obtaining the necessary materials. However, following the break-up of the USSR in recent years a thriving black market trade in these materials has sprung up.  The time has come for the international community to reject the false assumption that some countries are fit to hold nuclear weapons while others are not.  No country, no matter how responsible its Government, should be allowed to hold weapons of mass destruction.  Unless agreement is achieved on the total elimination not just of nuclear weapons but of chemical <Col N="1989" /> and biological weapons, we will all face Armageddon sooner or later.  Some day someone will decide to press the button.</P>
    <P>At the heart of the treaty was simply <i>quid pro quo</i>&mdash; non-nuclear states had to give up the right to manufacture or acquire nuclear weapons in return for access to commercial nuclear technology. That seemed like a fair trade off at the time but it was before Three Mile Island and Chernobyl and before we knew that a nuclear plant in England could affect the health of school children in Donegal.  The review of the treaty must address the so-called peaceful use of nuclear technology as well as its military use.</P>
    <P>The THORP nuclear reprocessing facility at Sellafield brings the nuclear threat very close to home.  THORP, which has the capacity to produce any amount of weapon grade material, is less than 100 miles from this House. This death factory which produces leathal materials which can be used in nuclear war heads to rain destruction on civilians a few thousand miles away is on our doorstep.  Yet for years we witnessed a cop-out as Fianna Fáil in Government wrung their hands and failed to act.</P>
    <P>For the first time an Irish Government is committed without reserve to work towards the closure of Sellafield. Unlike Fianna Fáil, it is fully committed to making maximum use of the Paris Convention framework.  Democratic Left has long argued that the EURATOM Treaties must be amended and updated to take account of the concerns of non-nuclear jurisidictions which share land or maritime borders with nuclear countries.  This is now Government policy.  Unless we address the issue of this so-called peaceful use of nuclear engery in tandem with its military use we will continue to face an unprecedented threat.  In this regard I support the efforts of organisations such as Greenpeace and CND in having the issue of nuclear energy placed firmly on the agenda of the April Review Conference. I hope the Government will take their concerns on board.</P>

      <P>Nineteen-ninety-five is a crucial year for the Non-Proliferation Treaty whose initial 25 year span has come to an end.  Speakers on both sides of the House have drawn attention to the fact that it is also the 50th anniversary year of the dropping of the atomic bomb on Hiroshima.  Less than a month ago President Robinson, on her State visit to Japan, went to Hiroshima.  I understand the experience impressed itself indelibly on the minds of all the Irish party and left a single stark message: never again.  Fifty years later, the horrific consequences of nuclear attack live on in the bodies of men and women not yet born in August 1945.  The nature, though not the scale, of the physical devastation caused by the bomb is there for all to see in a single ruined civic building which speaks volumes.  The President and those accompanying her saw the exhibits in the peace museum relating to the bombing, including the pathetic fragments of clothing which are all that remain of one child who died.  We are all impressed by the way the people of Japan and especially of Hiroshima have managed to distil from their horrendous experience a positive residue which is reflected in Japan's approach to nuclear weapons issued today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The resonance which the issue of nuclear weapons naturally evokes in Japan is echoed in the feelings of the Irish people.  The Japanese officials whom the Irish party met were aware of the role played by the late Frank Aiken at the United Nations in raising the issue of nuclear non-proliferation in 1958 and tenaciously pursuing it until the unanimous adoption of the Irish Resolution by the UN General Assembly in 1961.  At the Peace Memorial Museum in Hiroshima, the President handed over a presentation text of the Irish resolution, worked in calligraphy on vellum.  It was clear that securing the future of the Non-Proliferation Treaty, <Col N="1991" /> which that resolution initiated, is a major objective which is shared not only by the Japanese and Irish Governments but also by a large number of other Governments.  All are convinced that this objective will best be served by indefinite and unconditional extension of the treaty at next month's conference.</P>
    <P>This is also the position of the Government of Argentina where the President is spending the first days of her state visit to three South American countries.  Argentina, a former &ldquo;threshold State&rdquo; which had attempted to develop an independent nuclear weapons capability while under military rule, acceded to the Non-Proliferation Treaty on 10 February.  This is a most significant and timely step which confirms that country's strong commitment in recent years to contribute towards international non-proliferation efforts.</P>
    <P>Though not yet parties to the NPT, it is worth noting that Chile and Brazil are, like Argentina, parties to the 1969 Treaty of Tlatelolco, the first treaty which set out to establish a nuclear weapons free zone in a large inhabited region of the world.  The Treaty of Tlatelolco is now in force for 29 Latin American and Caribbean states which have thereby undertaken not to test, use, manufacture, produce or acquire nuclear weapons.</P>
    <P>We hope that the African region will soon conclude an agreement establishing a nuclear-weapon-free zone on that Continent also.  South Africa's renunciation of its nuclear weapons programme cleared the way to this most important and heartening process.  Like Argentina, South Africa changed course and joined the NPT as a non-nuclear weapon state.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister of State tell the House why South Africa is not going for indefinite renewal but is taking the line we are taking?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal with that point later.  In referring at some length <Col N="1992" /> to Japan, Argentina and South Africa in relation to the NPT, I want to bring home to the House through recent events, that the treaty remains as relevent an instrument today as in the 1960s.</P>
      <P>The Government sincerely believes that the NPT is of central importance and that universal accessation to the treaty and full compliance with its provisions remain an urgent international priority.  The Government remains convinced, as an earlier Government was at the time of the 1990 Review Conference, that the 1995 conference should be approached as an opportunity for Ireland, which has been intimately associated with the NPT from the outset, to renew our commitment to the treaty for an indefinite period of time. It is for this reason that we are working with our EU partners, in the framework of a joint action pursuant to Title V of the Maastricht Treaty, to promote the indefinite and unconditional extension of the treaty at next month's conference. We want the treaty to emerge from the conference with its credibility further enhanced and its future permanently assured.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The world no longer lives with the daily fear of nuclear conflict between the superpowers as it did when the NPT was negotiated and for almost two decades afterwards.  The norm of non-proliferation established by the NPT has taken root and so we are surprised that in the 1960s it was feared that as many as 25 states might acquire nuclear weapons &mdash; perhaps even including some countries which are today among the strongest supporters of the NPT and of nuclear disarmament.  We would do well to reflect that some emerging industrial nations may today, for rather similar reasons which include reasons of national prestige, be reluctant to forego forever the operation of developing nuclear weapons for themselves.  Any NPT extension decision which leaves some uncertainty about the future of the treaty will raise doubts of this nature about the intentions of states with respect to nuclear weapons.  Such <Col N="1993" /> doubts are contagious and can easily breed actions very detrimental to international peace and security.  A voidance of this prospect is a powerful argument in favour of indefinite extension of the Treaty.</P>
    <P>A total of 172 states are today legally bound by the non-proliferation obligations enshrined in the NPT.  That is a very significant achievement, one that under no circumstances must be endangered, Nevertheless, a great deal remains to be done to make the world safe from nuclear weapons and indeed from nuclear materials.  Some important countries in regions of proliferation concern, such as the Middle East and South Asia, remain outside the Treaty; their position poses real dilemmas for neighbouring countries who have taken on the obligations of the treaty.</P>
    <P>Ireland's concerns about the plutonium generated by civil nuclear activities are compounded as large amounts of weapons-grade plutonium come on stream from the dismantlement of nuclear arsenals, welcome as that process is.  A permanent NPT would improve the climate for international efforts to address these new challenges. An uncertain treaty would seriously aggravate the difficulty of strengthening the international non-proliferation regime which has been built around the treaty and the safeguards system of the International Atomic Energy Agency.</P>
    <P>The extension of the treaty for short periods conditional on progress elsewhere, as proposed in the Fianna Fáil motion, would create deep uncertainty about the future of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and the safeguards regime.  It would put at risk the gains which have been made since Frank Aiken first raised the issue of non-proliferation at the United Nations.  It would jeopardise the prospects for further progress on non-proliferation and nuclear disarmament.  These risks posed by the Fianna Fáil approach far too great to be entertained.  This view is shared by many countries &mdash; by all 52 states of Europe represented in the <Col N="1994" /> Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), by the members of the European Union including our neutral partners Austria, Finland and Sweden, by countries such as New Zealand and Australia which have traditionally shared Ireland's approach to nuclear disarmament, and by many in the developing world.</P>
    <P>The approach outlined in the Government motion preserves the essence of Frank Aiken's achievement on nuclear non-proliferation while providing for further steps to bring an end to nuclear weapons.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this important debate.  Like the Tánaiste I commend the timely initiative taken by Deputy Burke in drawing the attention of the House to this important issue which will arise at next month's nuclear non-proliferation treaty and Extension Conference in New York.</P>
      <P>It is clear from the many contributions today that nuclear non-proliferation and nuclear disarmament engender strong feelings on all sides of the House.  I have no doubt this debate reflects a real and lively interest among the people on issues of nuclear weapons and nuclear powers.  I, too, pay tribute to the important role played by the late Frank Aiken in initiating the debate on nuclear non-proliferation at the United Nations and on building the necessary consensus in the General Assembly to start the negotiations which led to the Treaty.  The Government amendment retains this element of the Fianna Fáil motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Tánaiste explained the Government's objection to the proposals for short extensions of the NPT as well as its strong belief that the optimum outcome of the conference would be for the NPT to be indefinitely extended.  The Government amendment, therefore, endorses the approach of the Government in supporting the indefinite extension of the treaty at the NPT Review and Extension Conference in April.  The <Col N="1995" /> amendment also endorses the Government's objective to secure five yearly reviews of the implementation of the treaty.  The Government considers that those reviews will provide an opportunity to hold all states' parties to full compliance with their obligations under the treaty.  In particular, the reviews should serve to inject momentum into negotiations in other fora or measures conducive to nuclear disarmament.</P>
    <P>The Government strongly advocates progress on other nuclear disarmament issues.  Its amendment states that Dáil Éireann believes international negotiations should be intensified with a view to progress in several specific areas and I was pleased that Deputy Burke found most of them acceptable.  In regard to achieving agreement on the elimination of all nuclear weapons, I have no doubt we will get the support of the House for intensified efforts to achieve agreement on the objective of zero nuclear weapons.  Achieving an agreed formula on the steps needed to bring about an end to the production, modernisation and deployment of nuclear weapons is comprehensive and practical and reflects the commitment of successive Governments to the complete elimination of the use and threat of nuclear weapons.  The Government is working in the UN to achieve that objective.  It believes there should be agreement on a treaty banning the production and use of plutonium and highly enriched uranium for weapons purposes. This debate highlighted the concern about the excessive quantities of such dangerous materials in the world. There is consensus in the UN General Assembly on a resolution calling for negotiations on a non-discriminatory, multilateral, international and, effectively, verifiable Treaty for this purpose.</P>
    <P>The Government is also concerned about the large stockpiles of plutonium in the world.  International negotiations should be intensified with a view to the establishment of effective arrangements <Col N="1996" /> to monitor and control all weapons-usable materials and to increase transparency with regard to nuclear weapons and materials.  Long standing concerns about the safe handling and storage of plutonium generated by civil nuclear activities have become more pressing as huge amounts of weapon-grade plutonium come on stream from dismantling nuclear weapons.  There should also be an early conclusion and implementation of a total test ban.  Since the General Assembly resolution of December 1993 in which the entire international community, for the first time, supported multilateral negotiations for such a treaty, a comprehensive test ban treaty has been the main focus of attention in the conference on disarmament.  There has been a noticeable quickening of place in negotiations at the 1995 session.  I understand the Government expects work to conclude soon with the adoption of a treaty which will comprehensively ban nuclear explosions for all time, which will command widespread support from the international community.</P>

      <P>I compliment Deputy Burke on putting down this timely motion.  The nuclear non-proliferation regime must be strengthened to face the challenges of the coming decades.  Cold War circumstances no longer apply and cold war methods are no longer relevant. If the treaty on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons is to play an important role, creative new approaches are required.  As extension of the treaty comes under consideration by states' parties there are some points I would like to make.</P>
      <P>The NPT provides for the collective review of the treaty's operation every five years.  Four review conferences have been held to date and they have been difficult, even acrimonious, affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1997" /> The conference next month includes the fifth review as well as the extension decision.  This conjunction provides a special opportunity to review the review process itself.  The longer the treaty is extended for, the more critical it is that the review process inspires confidence, since it is the only mechanism for monitoring compliance with the treaty's promissory provisions.  One reform flows from looking at the review process as a five year cycle rather than intermittent events.  The cycle would begin with parties to the treaty setting general compliance targets for the coming five years. This would be followed by a five year good faith effort to attain those targets through specific measures and actions. The cycle would end through evaluation of the match between expectation and performance.  At the end of each cycle, each review conference should allocate time both to look back at the previous five year period and forward to the next five year period.  In this way each review can be maximally useful to the next review and progress towards the long term objectives of the treaty could be tracked more systematically through the years.  If the foregoing suggestion is considered practical, then it makes sense to implement it next month.</P>
    <P>The second half of the review would be devoted to identifying targets for the period 1995 to 2000 so that the review conference in that year will be able to make a sound evaluation.  Perhaps, with the same behavioural and compliance demands of all, truly universal adherence to NPT could be achieved by the year 2000.  As a parliamentarian I cannot comprehend how any state purporting to support non-proliferation can justify further acquisition of nuclear weapons.  Certainly, it is in the interests of all states to forestall a new nuclear arms race should international relations deteriorate.  If some nuclear powers are not ready to stop production immediately, it is entirely reasonable to establish the target of ending all acquisition by at least the year 2000.  Once the option of producing more weapons has been ruled out, all future reductions <Col N="1998" /> would be irreversible, thereby enforcing a downward trend in the number of nuclear weapons towards zero.</P>
    <P>Periodic monitoring alone is not enough to command confidence.  Objectives alone are not enough, but together they can inspire confidence and build support for a lengthy extension of NPT. There are any number of nuclear arms control measures which would complement the NPT.  Some have or will soon enter into force, such as, START I and START II.  Others are championed by non-nuclear weapons states but lack sufficient support among the nuclear weapons states to be right for action.</P>
    <P>Given the reluctance of most of the nuclear weapons states to say anything about nuclear arms controls beyond fissile cut-off and possible START III negotiations, it is important for the non-nuclear weapons states to be clear about which of the many measures they champion must be resolved as part of the decision to extend the treaty and which can be taken up within the framework of the NPT after 1995.  Failure to be clear and unified on this point puts at risk achievements of a positive result in April.</P>
    <P>A list of demands that is too long can be easily rejected as unreasonable by the nuclear weapons states allowing them to avoid having to make any specific concessions.  The polarisation already evident in the substantive decisions at the four preparatory committee meetings would just become further entrenched.  The result would be a decision on extension adopted against the will of a large majority.  Regardless of who won the vote, this would undermine the legitimacy of NPT.  A short list, on the other hand, would command respect and require a thoughtful response.  It would depolarise the extension decision and serve to strengthen the non-proliferation regime as a whole. A non-proliferation regime that has not effectively ended nuclear arms competition by prohibiting all acquisition of nuclear weapons cannot claim to have <Col N="1999" /> established an inter-nation norm against proliferation.</P>
    <P>As negotiated, the NPT aspired to end acquisition in two dimensions, vertically and horizontally.  In the horizontal dimension those states which had not acquired nuclear weapons prior to 1 January 1976 were to renounce acquisition forthwith.  In the vertical dimension negotiations would bring to an end the nuclear arms race between the nuclear powers.  To be effective, measures negotiated would have to preclude the resumption of a nuclear arms race, that is, they would have to rule out any future acquisition of nuclear weapons.</P>
    <P>It is upsetting to recall that Britain, France and China appear intent on continuing to produce nuclear weapons for the years to come.  They have repeatedly asserted their intentions to conclude and sign a comprehensive test ban.  They are also on record as favouring negotiation of fissile material cut-off but, even as Russian and American nuclear weapons are being dismantled, these three countries are building up their forces to new heights.  While the pace of acquisition has eased somewhat, production of hundreds of warheads is planned over the next several years. There is a strong expectation that they will join in the downward trend when the superpower arsenals come within the range of their own, but there are no firm commitments.  Also, they seem to be counting on the process of super power reductions to be a protracted affair, leaving them out of the picture for decades.  Although production in the United States and Russia has or will soon end, their interest in a test ban and cut-off seems to be driven more by preventing horizontal proliferation than capping vertical proliferation.  It is widely appreciated, even among those who make the weapons, that the good old days are well and truly over.  There have already been massive cuts in personnel and equipment expenditures at both the weapons factories and in the laboratories.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2000" /> After 25 years the nuclear weapons states parties to the NPT, whether or not they have production plans, are still unwilling to renounce the prerogative of acquiring more nuclear weapons by some future date.  Under these conditions continuation of the NPT indefinitely would render meaningless the phrase &ldquo;at an early date&rdquo;.  To many non-nuclear weapons states which renounced acquisition 25 years ago, this is unacceptable.</P>
    <P>The countries that use the principle of stable deterrent state that it is only an interim measure until full nuclear disarmament is achieved.  Ireland as an independent state which used its neutrality to good effect during the Second World War can become a central player in nuclear disarmament, and I urge the Minister for Foreign Affairs to maximise that to the full.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Progressive Democrats' parliamentary party considered this motion briefly today and is not very happy with it.  It appears far too broad and, if passed, would have serious consequences that may not have been intended by Deputy Burke.  It seems entirely antinuclear in respect of all aspects of nuclear activity.  The Government amendment, although similar in outline to the motion, appears more balanced and sensible.</P>
      <P>The motion is an attempted catch-all motion which over-reaches itself and, as a result, is flawed.  The present treaty is open-ended but is due for review and renewal next month.  It would seem very unwise to extend it for five years only on the basis that it could then expire. What is needed is the renegotiation of the treaty specifically with a new set of stated goals and new obligations on all member states of the United Nations, not just the known nuclear club.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The statement, that &ldquo;Dáil Éireann believes that negotiations must be put in train to devise a new system for global denuclearisation&rdquo; is meaningless in practice as it is far too wide.  Nuclearisation at present extends not just to weaponry but to energy production, to fuel <Col N="2001" /> reprocessing and to nuclear medicine. To abolish all of these on an equal basis is far too sweeping and would have appalling consequences.  Even if the proposer of the motion denies that he intended all of these consequences he should draft the motion more carefully.</P>
    <P>I wish to make the following comment on the paragraphs in the motion. On paragraph (1) this would be commendable if the International Atomic Energy Agency were given these powers under the terms of a new treaty. Under the existing treaty it cannot be done and this is aspirational.</P>
    <P>On paragraph (2) this would require a new treaty but if such is agreed it would seem that ideally an obligation such as this should be undertaken by all member states of the United Nations as a condition of their membership. However, it is worth bearing in mind that nowadays the production of nuclear weapons may not be confined to countries only.  Technology has advanced to a stage where private or terrorist sources may be in a position to produce nuclear weapons so greater powers are needed for the International Atomic Energy Agency.</P>
    <P>On paragraph (3) the production of non weapon grade plutonium should be clearly differentiated from weapon grade.  There are throughout the world fast breeder reactors which require plutonium. It seems to be unrealistic to prevent all reprocessing, even for obviously peaceful purposes.</P>
    <P>On paragraph (4) there is an existing agency, the IAEA set up in 1957 by the UN General Assembly as an autonomous intergovernmental organisation to perform these functions.  It can be argued that it does not have sufficient powers but it can be given new teeth so that it can make more effective arrangements to monitor and control weapon grade material.  However, universal monitoring may well prove impossible particularly in respect of submarines and highly mobile ships or aircraft.</P>
    <P>On paragraph (5) this is probably <Col N="2002" /> unrealistic however worthy its objectives. At present it is thought that countries such as Pakistan, India, Israel, South Africa, Brazil and some others have a nuclear weapon capability but the existing treaty does not enable that they have to be monitored.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (6) should be reworded to make it clear that it is the testing of weapons which is banned not research and development in the production of electricity or in nuclear medicine.</P>
    <P>On paragraph (7) this in effect brings an end to the IAEA and would run counter to the wishes of the General Assembly which set it up.  It seems curious to advocate this because Ireland is a governor of the International Atomic Energy Agency and our ambassador to Austria is on the permanent committee of the agency.  Ireland should have a strong voice in halting the use of nuclear energy for military purposes and it can exercise that voice best within the agency.</P>
    <P>Both we and the international community generally should push for further research and development into nuclear fusion under the Jet Programme of the European Union.  In suggesting total denuclearisation as set out in this motion it seems that we would be acting against the terms of our Constitution under Article 29.4.3º of which we ratified the EURATOM Treaty and are bound by its terms.  EURATOM of which we are a member through our membership of the European Union is committed to the peaceful use of nuclear energy, research, the pooling of information and the training of scientists and technicians.</P>
    <P>To suggest that the IAEA should stop the promotion of nuclear energy is in defiance of its mandate given to it by the United Nations.  That mandate states <i>inter alia</i> that the agency's objectives are: to accelerate and enlarge the contribution of atomic energy to peace, health and prosperity throughout the world; to ensure as far as it is able that the assistance provided by it or at its request or under its supervision or control is not used in such a way as to <Col N="2003" /> further any military purpose; to foster research and development of the peaceful uses of nuclear energy; to safeguard against the diversion of nuclear materials to military purposes; to establish and adopt health and safety standards regulating nuclear energy.</P>
    <P>An end to the promotion of nuclear energy by the International Atomic Energy Agency would mark the end of the agency and the end of the only world agency monitoring the nuclear industry worldwide.</P>
    <P>Ireland is a member of not just the IAEA but also of the OECD Nuclear Energy Agency and the various subgroups of both as well as a party to other international conventions.  Our monitoring internationally is carried out for the most part by the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland, formerly known as the Nuclear Energy Board, and it also monitors the position domestically.</P>
    <P>The most pressing need is for international regulation of the nuclear industry generally, especially and initially within the European Union, so that even the peaceful activities of one member state will not cause enormous damage in another.  For us to turn our back on nuclear energy generally would be unreal and hypocritical.  Nuclear power and nuclear medicine have been of inestimable value to the world and provided they are not abused and are carefully regulated and monitored, they should not be harmful.  If nuclear fusion as opposed to fission can be developed to the stage that it becomes commercially feasible, it will be of incalculable benefit because it will provide unlimited power and energy without the associated dangers of radiation.  I am very glad that some Irish institutions, particularly Professor Wrixson's Institute in UCC, are helping with the development of software for the fusion research programme in Britain and Italy under the auspices of the European Union.  If this can be brought to a successful conclusion in the next 15 to 20 years, the world will truly be transformed by the <Col N="2004" /> use of that nuclear fusion.  We should seek to develop this to the greatest extent possible and at the same time to work to try to phase out all nuclear weapons based on fission.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>Ireland has long held a strategic position, both politically and geographically, as a post colonial neutral state far closer to countries with a similar history in the southern hemisphere than to the western imperial powers.  The late Frank Aiken when Minister for Foreign Affairs recognised Ireland's potential to champion the path to world peace when he helped to initiate the NPT.  I take my hat off to his memory and to my constituency colleague, Deputy Burke, for tabling this timely motion.</P>
      <P>In 1968 when Ireland became the first signatory of the treaty this Government was no more than a twinkle in the Taoiseach, Deputy Bruton's, eye.  Does the Government think its predecessor in 1968 thought the best option for non-proliferation was to row in behind the United States, the United Kingdom, Russia, France and China?  The Government in 1968 thought more of neutrality, independence and its responsibility to represent the concerns of non-nuclear nations than the present rainbow coalition.  It is incredible to think that the Government is reluctant to support the position of over 20 non-nuclear states calling for five yearly fixed period reviews of the non-proliferation treaty in the face of intimidation from the main nuclear powers.  Those of us in the Green movement and elsewhere who took hope from Ireland's long history of supporting international efforts to achieve the prohibition and elimination of weapons of mass destruction, including nuclear weapons, are now deeply suspicious of the Government's intent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In June 1994 I applauded the support given by Ireland to the World Health Organisation's move to outlaw all nuclear weapons.  On 18 November 1994 Ireland was again asked to stand up and be counted in a sensational vote at the <Col N="2005" /> United Nations General Assembly disarmament committee where a resolution was passed to ask the International Court of Justice for an advisory opinion on the question &ldquo;Is the threat of use of nuclear weapons in any circumstances permitted under international law?&rdquo; In all, 77 states voted for the resolution.  Incredibily, Ireland, a non-nuclear and neutral country, abstained causing great confusion and dismay regarding its voting patterns at the United Nations and other international fora.</P>
    <P>While the non-proliferation treaty has kept the issue of non-proliferation alive during the past 25 years we should not fall into the Fianna Fáil trap of thinking it has been an unqualified success.  It appears that the Tánaiste also thinks the treaty should continue indefinitely.  Let us consider the facts.  Since the treaty came into force more than 75,000 nuclear warheads have been deployed, over 580 nuclear tests have been conducted and the production of new nuclear weapon systems has continued. Moreover the nuclear weapons programmes of Britain, France and China remain untouched by existing arms control treaties.</P>
    <P>Instead of rowing in behind the nuclear powers in supporting an indefinite extension of the treaty, I urge the Government to tackle the contradictions and weaknesses within it.  Our awareness of the health risks from radiation is at a far higher level now than it was in the 1960s, yet the treaty promises the benefits of &ldquo;peaceful&rdquo; applications of nuclear explosions to all &mdash; benefits that did not exist then and are environmentally indefensible in 1995.</P>
    <P>Of particular relevance to Ireland, the treaty does not define a nuclear weapon. All the components of a nuclear weapon, including the fissile core, can be acquired and there will have been no violation of the treaty until they are assembled.  In the case of Ireland, the nuclear plants on the west coast of Britain are often described &mdash; rightly &mdash; as time bombs.  The question for the Government is: when is a time bomb <Col N="2006" /> not a weapon?  The answer appears to be when it is a civil nuclear installation. This generation, and future generations, are being badly served by a Government which accepts the arguments from the pro-nuclear lobbyists who create false demarcation lines between civil and military use of nuclear power. Unfortunately, Deputy O'Malley seems to be joining that lobby now.</P>
    <P>The total plutonium &mdash; civil and military &mdash; produced since 1945 is approximately 1,300 tonnes.  At most, approximately five kilograms of plutonium in metal form are needed to make a nuclear weapon.  The THORP reprocessing plant will separate approximately 2,000 kilograms of plutonium a year.  Even using the best technological safeguards, more than 140 kilograms of plutonium worldwide go missing each year.</P>
    <P>In supporting the Fianna Fáil motion, I urge the Government to again look at its willingness to accept the pro-nuclear arguments of our EU neighbours.  We are a neutral country and the contradictions in this treaty demonstrate clearly why it is important for us to remain so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Ms Burton)</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one absolute guiding principle behind Government policy on the issue before the House &mdash; Ireland is fundamentally opposed to the possession by any state of nuclear weapons.  We want their elimination by common agreement and their complete elimination by every State. Hence our original involvement in non-proliferation treaty and our active role now in its renewal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Frankly, I am amazed at the position taken up by Fianna Fáil on this matter. It is really inconceivable that, if it was in office, Fianna Fáil would pursue a policy such as the one it presents in this resolution.  There can be no comparison between the visionary and realistic approach of Frank Aiken 30 years ago which commanded the respect and support of the world, and this ill-thought <Col N="2007" /> out and risky idea of limited and conditional extensions of the NPT contained in the Fianna Fáil motion.  I am sorry to see the Opposition adopt a policy so at odds with its past achievements in this area and so contrary to the basic objectives of Ireland's disarmament policy.</P>
    <P>I want now to deal with some of the points made in the debate, and indeed outside the House, on this issue.  It is alleged that the indefinite extension of the NPT amounts to acquiescence in the retention of nuclear weapons of the nuclear-weapons states.  I categorically reject this allegation.  Do those who make such allegations believe that the founders of the NPT, including Frank Aiken, thought that the NPT would promote nuclear weapons or that the nuclear weapons states should be allowed to retain their weapons of mass destruction?  Of course not.  I repeat that in the NPT all five declared nuclear-weapons states have undertaken a legal obligation to pursue nuclear disarmament in good faith.  We intend to hold the nuclear-weapons states to that pledge and it will be easier to do this if the future of the NPT is secured.</P>
    <P>It is also suggested that Ireland has been pressurised by the members of the European Union into supporting a joint action on the indefinite extension of the Treaty.  I would point out that when the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the day, Gerard Collins, first enunciated our policy of indefinite extension at the Review Conference in 1990, the European Union had no common policy on the non-proliferation treaty for the simple reason that France was not then a member of the NPT.  It is turning history and logic on its head to suggest that Ireland has been browbeaten by its European partners into a policy of indefinite extension.  On the contrary, the Government was pleased that the Union last year adopted a joint action that corresponded with the position Ireland had articulated in 1990.</P>
    <P>It has been said that the Government's position on the NPT is at odds with our position of military neutrality. <Col N="2008" /> I do not for one minute suppose that anyone could take this allegation seriously.  One of the great values of the NPT is that it is supported by a wide spectrum of countries &mdash; states that are military allied, states that possess nuclear weapons, states that oppose nuclear weapons, states that are non-aligned and states that are neutral such as Sweden, Finland, Austria and Ireland.  It is this broad constituency, legally committed to non-proliferation and to nuclear disarmament, that gives the NPT its strength and holds out a real hope of a denuclearised world.  Our position on the NPT is in the finest traditions of Irish foreign policy and to suggest otherwise is to traduce the memory and efforts of those who worked to bring it about.</P>
    <P>It is intimated that Ireland's position represents a minority view in the lead up to the NPT conference next month. In fact, a large number of countries support an indefinite extension of the treaty.  This includes all 52 members of the Organisation for Security and co-operation in Europe; countries with which Ireland shares a strong anti-nuclear weapons stance such as Austria, Sweden, Finland, New Zealand and Australia and many in the developing world.  This widespread support represents a strong conviction about the value of the NPT and the need to secure its future.</P>
    <P>It has also been suggested that Ireland's policy somehow lacks a moral perspective.  Again, nothing could be further from the truth.  Ireland believes that nuclear weapons have no place in an international society founded on the principles of morality and justice.  That is why we want to see these weapons eliminated but we must begin with certain facts.</P>
    <P>Some states possess nuclear weapons and see them as essential to their security. Others want to possess them for reasons of security and national prestige. The technology is there and is available.  We disagree fundamentally with the position of these states.  The question faced by Governments such as <Col N="2009" /> ours is how we translate our opposition to nuclear weapons into concrete steps to secure their elimination.  How do we persuade those who possess nuclear weapons to give them up and how do we convince those who want to develop such weapons not to do so?  The NPT is one part of this process but it was never intended, and is not intended, to be the end of the process.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste made clear this morning that just as the Government continues to attach importance to the non-proliferation obligations which the NPT imposes on the parties, the Government remain's deeply attached to the good faith commitment to nuclear disarmament contained in Article VI of the treaty.  The Government shares the view of successive Irish Governments that the use of strategic nuclear weapons would have catastrophic consequences because of their indiscriminate character and devastating effects; that the use of tactical nuclear weapons would entail the danger of escalation and could quickly lead to the use of strategic nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction and that, consequently, every effort should be made to achieve the complete abolition of nuclear weapons.  The Government continues to work for and lend support to sound proposals to this end including, in particular, a comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty and a treaty to ban the production of plutonium for weapons purposes.</P>
    <P>I emphasise that the indefinite extension of the NPT is not incompatible with further progress on nuclear disarmament.  On the contrary, the Government believes that, by enhancing confidence, a secure NPT would enhance the prospects of the further steps that are so urgently needed.  An insecure NPT, subject to the vagaries of negotiations every five years and to progress in negotiations elsewhere, would undermine confidence; it would put at risk the gains so painfully made over the past 25 years <Col N="2010" /> and it would also put at risk the possibility of further progress on nuclear disarmament.</P>
    <P>A number of speakers referred to Sellafield and the risks and problems it poses.  Members are no doubt aware that the policy of successive Irish Governments has been to press for the closure of Sellafield.  It is my wish &mdash; and that of the Government &mdash; that all discharges of radioactive waste from Sellafield, marine and atmospheric, planned and unplanned, be prevented and eliminated. Past incidents at Sellafield which resulted in uncontrolled radioactive discharges have heightened the concern on this side of the Irish Sea about safety standards at Sellafield.</P>
    <P>The Government is also opposed to commissioning the THORP plant which represents an additional and unnecessary risk to the health and safety of the Irish population.  When THORP was originally given the go-ahead in 1977, nuclear power was still generally believed to have a prosperous future and reprocessing was thought to be a key factor in the uranium fuel cycle. Today, the arguments for reprocessing are not convincing.  The anticipated expansion of nuclear power has not materialised and the plutonium and uranium recovered from spent fuel are no longer required for reasons of economy or security of supply.  Indeed they are adding unnecessarily to the huge stockpile of nuclear materials worldwide which are considered by some countries to be a major security and political problem.</P>
    <P>The Government's policy agreement &mdash;<i>A Government of Renewal</i>&mdash; sets out the Government's proposals to tackle the problems of Sellafield and other aspects of the UK nuclear industry, particularly the threat of pollution and its effect on the health and safety of the public, the shipment of radioactive materials and ageing nuclear reactors. My colleague, Deputy Stagg, Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications, in conjunction with the Minister for the Environment and the Minister of State at the <Col N="2011" /> Department of the Marine, is setting up a task force comprising officials of the three Departments and other relevant Departments, to develop a concerted strategy for implementing the Government's proposals on Sellafield.  This will be the first comprehensive initiative taken by any Government to tackle the problems of Sellafield.</P>
    <P>We are a neutral and anti-nuclear State.  Together with other similar states, we have the task of persuading the nuclear powers to co-operate in practical steps towards nuclear disarmament. This remains a major challenge. Some non-aligned countries feel they might gain leverage over the nuclear weapon states by withholding agreement to indefinite extension of the NPT in favour of a short extension or series of extensions linked to achievement of certain long-standing objectives in the field of nuclear disarmament.  I can only repeat what the Tánaiste said this morning in setting out the Government's resistance to a series of short conditional extensions.  Far from being the best way to progress towards nuclear disarmament, and far from exerting leverage, a series of short conditional extensions would undermine the credibility of the NPT; weaken its effectiveness; tempt non-nuclear weapon states to anticipate the ending of the Treaty; and by virtue of its effect on the attitude of the nuclear weapon states, freeze ongoing efforts towards nuclear disarmament. For these reasons I reject the Fianna Fáil motion.</P>

      <P>I compliment our party spokesperson, Deputy Ray Burke, on putting down this timely motion.  I am surprised at the way the Government has addressed this matter as I would have thought that if ever a motion came before this House on <Col N="2012" /> which there would be all-party agreement, this is it.  This motion signals to a certain extent our independence as a nation and our role in leading in this area, as we did in the days of Frank Aiken.  I speak as a person who succeeded Frank Aiken in the constituency. As a member of Fianna Fáil, Frank Aiken was a most enterprising Minister and the way he addressed this issue is testimony to his career although the nation has not properly recognised his contribution.  However, the Government and Deputy Burke, extolled the work he did in this area.</P>
      <P>Rather than the Government accepting in a piecemeal way what has happened in recent years, rather than, as I read in an article yesterday, siding with the big guns, it should take this motion on board.  As a small nation which down the years indicated its independence and neutrality on these issues, we should have sent a signal to other countries by accepting the motion.  I find it difficult to understand why it cannot be accepted.</P>
      <P>If the Government accepts that this Treaty should be reviewed every five years it will speed up the process of doing away with nuclear weapons.  The attitude of countries such as Britain and France to this whole issue is counter to the Treaty.  We should not blandly accept the anodyne statements of the bigger nations that they want a world rid of nuclear weapons.  Given our independent history, particularly at the UN, if we back this motion many nations will sit up and take notice.</P>
      <P>I represent a constituency that has been the subject of much comment down the years in terms of difficulties from nuclear reprocessing at Sellafield. I am not saying that we in Louth suffer most from this problem; I accept that all those living on the east coast are affected by Sellafield.  One only has to look at the recent incident at Douneray where a number of workers were badly injured as a result of leakages to realise the problems that can arise.  On the east coast in particular people live in the shadow of Sellafield.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2013" /> About two years ago Deputies Keogh, Sean Ryan and I took it upon ourselves to travel to Sellafield and I was astounded at the magnitude of THORP.  The people in Sellafield did a good PR job but accepted that representatives from the east coast would be opposed to THORP.  Having taken us on a tour of the plant they asked us whether we accepted that they had the best of technology.  I replied that my visit there convinced me more than ever that the commissioning of THORP would get the green light.  The man to whom I spoke was not convinced, but I did not believe that the British Government, the Japanese Government and other governments who, through their contracts, contributed to THORP would refuse to commission it.  I was proved right a couple of weeks later when a debate took place on the matter in the House of Commons &mdash; I was present that day as it marked the signing of the Joint Declaration.  On the following day when I put down a Private Notice question on the matter I described the cavalier attitude adopted by the British Government to a so-called friendly neighbour.</P>
    <P>I attended a meeting recently in my home town at which it was suggested that this Government &mdash; and previous Government of which my party was a partner &mdash; was involved in a cosy relationship with Britain in regard to Sellafield.  I do not accept that is the case.  I outlined at that meeting this Government's intentions on THORP, as set out in the Programme for Government. Unfortunately its attitude is no different from that of previous Governments. A number of people in Louth, one of whom is a first cousin and next door neighbour of mine, had the courage to take an action against BNFL and Ireland.  That case will, I hope, be decided within the next two or three weeks.  When Fianna Fáil was in power I found it extremely difficult &mdash; I still do &mdash; to understand why the State would not take a case on this issue.  I accept there are arguments against taking a case against BNFL.  I accept what the <Col N="2014" /> then Minister from my party said, that if you take a case against the advice of your officials it may be lost.  He said that in that event we would never be able to challenge Sellafield and it would be better to wait until the proper evidence is available.</P>
    <P>The reality is that four people from County Louth have taken a case against BNFL and against all odds they were able to convince some eminent senior counsel that people on the east coast of Ireland had a case against BNFL.  Even BNFL was surprised at the way in which these people addressed the case.  I wish them the best of luck and I ask the Government &mdash; I asked the previous Attorney General &mdash; to back these people who have gone to the trouble of taking a case &mdash; I have no doubt it will end up in the European Court &mdash; by giving them an assurance about their costs, as the four people have put their livelihoods at stake, and assist in other ways. These four litigants have had to engage experts from America without any assistance from the State.  In fact the State is one of the defendants.</P>
    <P>I exhort the Government to respond positively to the request from the Stop Thorp Alliance Dundalk, STAD, group which is promoting this case.  I ask the Government to assist these courageous people in their action.  At the meeting I attended people did not understand why it was left to four individuals to take the case.  I accept that legal advisers tend to be cautious but, unfortunately, we are subject to an abomination 60 miles from us.  If we decide to wait until we get proper evidence it may be too late.</P>
    <P>I ask this Government to put what it said on this matter in its policy document, <i>A Government of Renewal,</i> into effect and take action against BNFL. The previous Government did not close its mind to assisting these people and neither is this Government's mind closed to assisting them.</P>

      <P>The Irish Government could take the initiative in regard to the transport of nuclear waste to Sellafield and other areas.  There will have to be an international law to prevent movement of nuclear waste.  I have heard and I accept the argument that the contracts may disappear and that Sellafield would be no longer economic.  What I saw when I visited THORP does not suggest that the contracts will dry up because a massive amount of money has been invested in this project.  I do not think hard-headed business people would invest that amount of money without being certain there would be sufficient contracts to make it viable.  Perhaps, as we have seen in the problem between Canada and Spain on the question of fisheries, there will have to be international pressure applied to prevent the transport of nuclear waste to Sellafield.</P>
      <P>It is strange that the Government would not send a signal to all people on this island that it will get tough with the nuclear industry.  By tabling an amendment to Deputy Burke's motion the Government is signalling that it is prepared to go along with the big nuclear powers, but that is not good enough.</P>

I pay tribute to my colleague, Deputy Ray Burke, on his timely introduction of this motion following in the spirit of the late Mr. Frank Aiken in seeking a new departure, a more independent approach to this issue and trying to accelerate the denuclearisation process.  The kernel of the motion tonight is to put forward specified goals and targets for each five year period.  I am disappointed that we could not have unanimity on the motion and the Government, which includes Democratic Left and the Labour Party, would have had much in common with the principles outlined by Deputy Burke.  Rather than allow the House divide on the issue, the Government should have acknowledged the superior content of the motion, accepted the spirit of Deputy Burke's contribution and <Col N="2016" /> the principle of endeavouring to accelerate the denuclearisation process.  I understand Deputy Lynch indicated she has difficulties with the Government motion and she should follow through and vote for our motion.  She would be welcome in our lobbies.</P>

      <P>I wish to pay tribute to Adi Roche from Cork for the outstanding work she has done in assisting the children from Chernobyl and in creating public awareness of the horrors of nuclear power.  I take the opportunity also to ask the Minister for Defence, Deputy Coveney, to seek an urgent meeting with the British Minister for Defence on unofficial dumping off the Irish coast of thousands of bombs and containers of nerve gas.  It has come to the attention of Deputy McDaid and me that the British Ministry of Defence has officially admitted, as late as last February, to Councillor Oliver MacMullen from the Moyle District Council that it dumped nerve gas off the Donegal coast and off the Irish coast in the 1950s.  I understand that such an unofficial dump exists off the Cork coast in a line between Cork and France near the Continental Shelf.  We are not sure if it was dumped off the Continental Shelf or inside it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a matter of grave importance on which the Minister for Defence and the Government should seek immediate clarification and a clear statement detailing the quantities of nerve gas dumped, where the dumps are located and a fully inventory of the materials dumped.  We are talking about lethal substances.  A total of 70,000 aircraft bombs were dumped by the British Government of our coasts.  Three ships which dumped there were identified. These people are of the view that there are more such unofficial dumps around the coast in particular along the Cork coast.  I am anxious that the matter be investigated.  We are talking about mustard gas, sarin which was used in the Iraqi war and the Indo-China war and <Col N="2017" /> anthrax which is lethal.  The Government should seek an urgent meeting with the British Minister for Defence to pursue the matter further and allay public concern.</P>

      <P>I commend Deputy Burke for bringing this motion forward. I concur with the sentiments expressed by Deputy Martin.  It is not just a kneejerk reaction to state this, because three weeks ago I put down a parliamentary question to the Minister for the Marine asking for further information on the dumping by the British Ministry of Defence after the last world war.</P>
      <P>In the tragedy in Tokyo the nerve gas used was sarin.  I have quite reliable information that out of the ten ships off the Donegal coast, two contained that nerve gas.  For the first time, the British Ministry of Defence has admitted dumping hundreds of thousands of tonnes in five dumps off the coast of Ireland.  As Deputy Martin stated it has come to our knowledge that there is some dumping of chemicals for use in war off the Cork coast.  I know that 3,500 tonnes of artillery shells containing mustard gas and tabun were dumped by the British in sealed containers 40 miles off Malin Head.</P>
      <P>Nuclear warfare seems to be the flavour of the month.  We must ask the Minister for the Marine to seek information from the British Ministry of Defence and the Marine on these lethal gases which have been dumped off our coast.</P>

      <P>I thank Members who supported the principle of the Fianna Fáil motion in my name.  I thank my party colleagues who spoke so movingly on the issue and my constituency colleague, Deputy Sargent.  I thank Kathleen Lynch for her support on the issue.  I regret that the Government showed itself to be complacent.  The word &ldquo;craven&rdquo; was used to describe its attitude.  It is regretted that the Government is not prepared to reflect the deeply held views of the people in the matter. They are totally opposed to nuclear <Col N="2018" /> power, nuclear weapons and reprocessing. They fear the situation that prevails on the coastline in the UK, the ships ploughing the Irish Sea and nuclear weapons generally.</P>
      <P>Unlike Frank Aiken who, in his time, was prepared to take a stance which did not have the support of many states, our Government unfortunately shows itself to be craven in the matter.  The Tánaiste, in dismissing the motion and asking for support for his amendment, stated that when Frank Aiken made his proposal he was the first to raise the issue of nuclear non-proliferation at the United Nations in 1958.  He stated the proposal met strong resistance not only from the major powers but from many smaller states as well.  That is what Frank Aiken faced.  The NPT has served the world well.  It has been the cornerstone of our policy but now we want a new way forward with five year renewals and stated goals and objectives as listed in the motion before us.</P>
      <P>The Tánaiste accused us of having a risky approach but his is a complacent one.  Our approach reflects the view of a neutral nation.  We have a policy of positive neutrality and we want to reflect that in our stance on the renewal of NPT.  We are asking the Government to fight for renewal but with stated goals and targets on a five year basis.  That is not risky.  It is sound and sensible in a time, 25 years after the treaty was signed, when we no longer have the Cold War which existed at the time of the signing of the treaty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Frank Aiken was radical in his approach.  The Tánaiste spoke about the world being safer due to the NPT.  It is safer because of the radical approach taken by Frank Aiken rather than the approach taken by the Government. The Minister of State, Deputy Burton's speech was naive.  She spoke of South Africa which voluntarily gave up its nuclear policy and has not gone along with the big guns.  It refused to go along with the indefinite extension of the NPT.  In the EU with big powers like the United Kingdom and France, Ireland is afraid to speak up.  We like to go with <Col N="2019" /> cap in hand and accept EU funds but not to raise our voice or rock any boats.</P>
    <P>As regards my good friend, Kathleen Lynch of the Democratic Left, she spoke movingly about the death of children from nuclear contamination, the destruction of areas and praised the motion as being an excellent one.  I thank her for that.  She went further and said she could not agree with the Government amendment but found herself in a difficult position.  She then went on to say that Democratic Left is not in the business of creating illusions and we must all face Armageddon.  That speech has about as much value as a £3 note and if she wants to come into the House and make nice flowery speeches she should follow them up by going through the lobbies.  That is the only way forward.</P>

      <P>As far as the Progressive Democrats is concerned.  Deputy O'Malley made his usual pro-nuclear speech on the generation of electricity and so on.  I want to be fair to Fine Gael, Labour and Democratic Left on this issue.  Having listened to Deputy O'Malley this evening, without doubt this is the most pro-nuclear party in this House with a view which reflects the view of nobody else except themselves.  Even though the nuclear generation of electricity is no longer commercially viable worldwide, the Progressive Democrats sticks with it.  They will stick with big business at all times.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for this opportunity to raise the implications for Irish industry and employment of the present difficulties our economy is experiencing as a result of the difference in exchange rates between the Irish pound and sterling and the devaluation of the Irish pound within the ERM.  The Minister for Finance's contribution over the last 96 hours to this issue has raised considerable problems from the point of view of our economy.  He has spoken about two very different policy priorities.  He indicated a desire on the part of the Irish Government to keep the Irish pound within the ERM and in touch, however much at a distance, with ERM currencies. He indicated that it was also Government policy to maintain a certain relationship with sterling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problem with enunciating two differing policy objectives is that we have no control over the relationship of sterling to the ERM and, therefore, the Irish pound in so far as it is loosely attached to the ERM four fast track currencies, is being dragged in two directions. I do not believe Ireland must make an irrevocable decision now one <Col N="2023" /> way or another on the question of economic and monetary union and, because we favour European Monetary Union, must commit ourselves to the ERM regardless of the consequences.</P>
    <P>The ERM which Ireland joined was a basket of currencies including the lira and the pound sterling.  It was a balanced basket of currencies because the pound sterling was a party to the arrangement.  It reflected economic realities in Ireland.  The time has come for the Government to admit that in large measure our economy is integrated to a significant extent with the UK economy.  If one goes into a tobacconists or a supermarket and looks around at the products on offer one finds that Ireland, simply in terms of products, has much more in common with the United Kingdom in many respects than with any other country in the European Union.</P>
    <P>In addition, to a significant extent, Ireland forms a joint labour market with Britain.  Trends in wages and employment in Britain have a direct effect on trends in wages and employment here. Irish producers are in direct competition with English producers.  Irish industry is directly affected by the value of the IR£ <i>vis-á-vis</i> sterling in a way it is not affected directly by any relationship with any other currency.</P>
    <P>The time has come for us to admit we have an economic relationship with the sterling area which cannot be ignored. Irish people who are either employed in, direct or own exporting enterprises to the United Kingdom are in cut-throat competition with English companies who are their natural competitors.  The time has come for us to admit also that we cannot ignore the pound-punt exchange rate and say it is simply a matter on which Irish industry will have to endure the pain if it goes significantly wrong so far as Irish exporters are concerned.</P>
    <P>You cannot say to an Irish company: &ldquo;look to your cost structures and try to make economies&rdquo; and hope that things will go right.  As a country we must offer <Col N="2024" /> Irish industry and Irish exporters and, in particular, employment intensive Irish exporters more moral encouragement than merely asking them to look to their own cost structures if things become difficult. In that respect, I emphasise the problems which arise from the different tax wedges on employment in the United Kingdom and here.</P>
    <P>A company which is producing a competing product in Drogheda with one in Newry faces a radically different tax regime.  It is simply not good enough for the Minister for Finance to say that Irish companies must look to their cost structures to enable them to survive the difficulties with the sterling exchange rate.  I am not suggesting &mdash; and I want to make it clear &mdash; that Ireland should withdraw from the ERM but what I am suggesting is that the Government must reflect the basic economic realities which Irish industry faces and with which Irish employment has to contend. In the past 96 hours the Minister for Finance has shown no appreciation of the real conditions of Irish industry and Irish business in the remarks he has made on the subject of our relationship with the pound sterling.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. J. Higgins) Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. J. Higgins)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. J. Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>By way of rebuttal of what Deputy McDowell has said, the Minister for Finance has been consistent in his capable and competent handling of the currency crisis.  I can understand the concerns of exporters arising from the situation in the foreign exchange markets.  However, I would point out that while undoubtedly the IR£ has appreciated recently against sterling, that appreciation has not been very large and it should be providing offsetting benefits for some firms, in terms of lower import costs.  The IR£ has depreciated against the Deutsche Mark and other ERM currencies, a factor which should generally be of advantage to exporters to EU member states other than the UK, while its value against the US dollar has remained well within the range of normal experience.  Overall, that is on a trade-weighted basis, the <Col N="2025" /> value of the IR£ has fallen marginally because of the recent currency fluctuations.</P>
      <P>As regards exchange rate policy, the Minister for Finance said in his statement of 19 March, and has repeated since, that his immediate concern is that the IR£ should trade more comfortably within the ERM band; and he acknowledged the implications of this for the IR£'s rate against sterling.  Last night, as soon as it became apparent that a remark of his in the European Parliament yesterday afternoon had been quoted out of context, he issued a statement reiterating what he said over the weekend.</P>
      <P>As stable exchange rate, flowing from our participation in the zone of stability which the ERM represents, has helped to underpin the policy approach within which low inflation has been achieved in recent years.  This low inflation is central to our longer-term strategy, based on moderate wage development, and continuing improvement in the public finances, to strengthen our employment performance.</P>
      <P>As regards the impact of recent currency movements on exports, the Minister for Finance met representatives of IBEC this morning at their request to discuss the situation in the currency markets.  There was a very useful discussion in which the IBEC representatives expressed their concerns about the impact of currency market developments on the competitiveness of those sectors which are in competition with UK-based producers.  The Minister has asked his officials to maintain close contact with IBEC on these issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the concerns in some quarters about the impact of a higher exchange rate against sterling are appreciated, it is necessary to put recent developments in a proper perspective.  Over recent years the Irish economy has achieved very strong economic growth and increased employment against a background of low inflation, a balance of payments surplus and firm control of the public finances.  This greatly <Col N="2026" /> improved growth and employment performance has been achieved at a time of significant appreciation of the IR£ against sterling.  While I accept that the further appreciation of one to one-and-a-half pence of the IR£ against sterling in recent weeks is of concern to firms competing with UK based producers, I do not consider that it should pose a significant immediate threat to jobs or exports having regard to the fundamental strengths of the Irish economy.</P>
    <P>The Government has a role in helping to make the economic environment as conducive as possible to economic activity generally, including exporting. The present climate is characterised by low inflation, sound public finances, a very high level of investment under the National Development Plan and moderate wage developments under the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i> The prospects for 1995 and the medium term are for continued strong economic growth building on our strong performance in 1994.  Real GDP is projected to grow by over 6 per cent in 1995.  Substantial increases in investment and private consumption underpin this outlook, as well as a continued strong export performance.  Despite this strong growth, inflation is expected to remain subdued.</P>
    <P>The recent budget contained measures, including improvements in income tax, PRSI and corporation tax, which are aimed at improving the economic climate further.  These measures were, in part, specifically aimed at helping those indigenous Irish firms with traditional markets in the UK.  The improvements in income tax and employee PRSI will underpin the moderate wage developments enshrined in the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i> The employer PRSI measure is of special importance to firms in the export sector: the increase in the income threshold below which the lower 9 per cent rate of employer PRSI applies will support some 170,000 existing jobs and will help to reduce labour costs in employment intensive sectors which are <Col N="2027" /> particularly dependent on the UK market. The income tax improvements in the 1995 budget will cost the Exchequer some £111 million in 1995 while the PRSI concessions in the budget will cost some £93 million.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom buíochas a ghlacadh leat as ucht deis a thabhairt dom an tábhar tábhachtach seo a ardú sa Dáil.  Is ocht seachtain atá i gceist anseo agus tá na daoine seo gan fáil ar a gcuid tithe ar feadh an ama sin.</P>
      <P>For the past two months the plight of the people of the south Galway-north Clare area has made headlines. However, at times the ongoing human tragedy behind the headlines has not been so obvious.  Last January's floods have forced approximately 20 families in the south Galway-north Clare area to leave their homes.  These people still do not know when their homes will be sufficiently dried out to permit them to return.  Even worse is the fear that having dried out their houses, undertaken expensive repairs and moved back they will find themselves in the same situation next year.  This is perhaps the most horrendous aspect of this huge tragedy.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister for the Environment to examine this problem as a matter of urgency.  As nobody can guarantee that these houses will not be flooded for an extended period next year.  I ask the Minister to consider providing immediate financial aid to these families to enable them purchase alternative sites and build new houses in areas which are not likely to be flooded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to nail a rumour which has been circulating in Galway, and other areas.  I can state categorically that none of the houses affected was the subject of section 4 resolutions passed by Galway County Council.  I can also state that some of the houses which were worst affected this year had never been subject to serious flooding in the past. <Col N="2028" /> However, this flooding could occur again.  The Department of the Environment should give each of the families £50,000 to relocate on the basis that the existing houses would become the property of the State and any insurance compensation due to the householder would also be signed over to it.  I make this suggestion for the simple reason that at present many of these people do not know what compensation they will get. They have been told that the floods will have to have subsided before the insurance companies can finalise their assessments.  Given that the State would own the houses and would receive any insurance compensation forthcoming, the net cost of such a scheme would be relatively small.  It would be a small amount considering the ongoing human tragedy involved.</P>
    <P>These people have had to move in with neighbours and relatives or rent rooms in boarding houses.  Obviously, this has been very traumatic and difficult for them.  It is not acceptable that they should have to face this problem on an annual basis.  I hope the Minister will give my suggestion favourable consideration. This would be tangible evidence that the visits paid by Government Ministers to the Gort area of south Galway were not for media consumption but rather were undertaken out of a real concern for the unfortunate people who have been affected by this tragedy.  I look forward to an immediate and positive response from the Minister. I believe in the old adage that actions speak louder than words.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Ms McManus)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue. I am glad to have the opportunity of explaining to the House my position on the housing aspects of this problem.  At the outset.  I wish to express my sympathy to those households who have been affected by the recent flooding.</P>
      <P>The provision of alternative housing accommodation for households in need of it is a matter, in the first instance, for the local authority, in this case Galway County Council.  Local authorities can, by way of their normal housing programmes, provide housing for the temporary or permanent accommodation of households in need of rehousing, including instances where houses may have become uninhabitable because of the flooding.  Local authorities can fund this from the capital allocation for their house building programmes.  Additionally, if households become homeless for any reason, including flooding, the local authority has full power to provide accommodation or to assist with finding temporary accommodation and may recoup from my Department 90 per cent of any expenditure incurred.</P>
      <P>My Department has already notified each local authority of its authorised housing construction programme for 1995.  The location of accommodation to be provided by local authorities and the needs to be catered for are matters to be decided by the authorities and such needs could, of course, include any arising from the flooding.  No specific additional funding has been made available to me, over and above that already provided for in the 1995 local authority housing programme, to enable authorities to provide additional housing accommodation necessitated by the recent flooding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Neither are there special funds available to me to provide assistance to households who have to leave their homes due to the flooding to obtain temporary alternative accommodation. Householders with normal buildings and contents insurance should be <Col N="2030" /> entitled to claim the cost of the necessary alternative accommodation from their insurer.  A health board may also assist by way of a rent allowance or otherwise under the supplementary welfare allowances scheme.  This assistance may be available to households who would not normally be eligible for assistance under that scheme if they have a particularly urgent need.  It is also open to the health boards to provide assistance to elderly householders through the Task Force on Special Housing Aid for the Elderly to remedy damage to the householders' living conditions. In this connection, I should say that the original provision of £2 million for the task force in 1995 has been increased to £3 million.</P>
    <P>My colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Jim Higgins, travelled to Brussels earlier this month to put Ireland's case for a share of the special funds to assist victims of flooding in the EU.  As a result, the Commission has added Ireland to the list of countries to benefit under this package of humanitarian aid.  The Commission has indicated that the aid to be allocated to Ireland will be channelled through the Red Cross Society as in other member states affected.  As the Deputy may be aware, the society distributed the EU funding of approximately £160,000 made available in response to incidents of flooding in Ireland in 1993.</P>

I also thank the Minister for coming to the House and for the action she has taken in regard to remedial education <Col N="2031" /> during her time in office.  The 1992 Programme for Government undertook to appoint 500 extra remedial teachers and in 1993, 86 extra remedial teachers were appointed to primary schools while last year a further 100 remedial teachers were appointed.  Last year in my constituency of East Galway four extra remedial posts were allocated to 17 primary schools.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to consider the appointment of a remedial teacher to the schools to which I referred.  She appointed a resource teacher who is based in Mountbellew and who also covers the school in Moylough.  This appointment has been welcomed and will be of benefit to the six local schools. I appeal to the Minister to appoint a remedial teacher to Mountbellew, Moylough, Cooloo and Briarfield national schools so that the pupils can receive a basic primary education.  It was originally proposed to appoint a remedial teacher for three of the schools but it was felt that the proposal would have a better chance of succeeding if there were four schools involved.  Briarfield national school was, therefore, added, giving an enrolment of more than 400 pupils in four schools.  The Minister said she will announce the appointment of an additional 55 remedial teachers in 1995, bringing the total up to 1,188.  I appeal to her to include the four schools to which I referred in her allocation of remedial teachers.  This proposal has the support of the boards of management of the schools involved, local parents' committees, public representatives and, more importantly, the primary inspectorate.</P>
      <P>The Minister will probably say that a remedial teacher will be eventually appointed to the four schools, but I hope the teacher is appointed in 1995. This is an urgent matter and I am sure Deputy Connaughton will support the points I made.</P>

      <P>I thank my colleague, Deputy Kitt, for his generosity in sharing time with me.  I stress the <Col N="2032" /> importance of assigning a remedial teacher to the Mountbellew, Moylough, Cooloo and Briarfield national schools. I thank the Minister for the importance she places on helping children with learning difficulties.  Her remedial teaching initiative will repay the State a thousandfold in many diverse ways.  It will also send a positive signal to hard pressed parents who desperately wish their children to have the best opportunities in life and will show that the State is willing to help.  Schools that already have the services of a remedial teacher report great progress.</P>
      <P>My neighbours in Mountbellew, Moylough, Cooloo and Briarfield are sincere in their efforts to have a remedial teacher assigned to those schools.  Will the Minister ensure that such a teacher is made available in the near future?  I thank her for appointing a resource teacher who covers Mountbellew and Moylough schools.  This has alleviated the concerns of many parents in the area.  I hope we get a similar response to the appointment of a remedial teacher.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Ms Bhreathneach)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Kitt for giving me the opportunity to outline my Department's position on the appointment of remedial teachers.</P>
      <P>As has been indicated to the House in the past, remedial education at primary level is a matter in the first instance for the ordinary class teachers.  The majority of pupils with remedial needs would, therefore, be helped within the scope of the normal teaching service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, it is acknowledged that remedial teachers constitute the main additional resource for addressing the problem of underachievement in primary schools.  Substantial additional resources have been allocated to this area in recent years.  In 1994, an additional 100 remedial teachers were appointed to primary schools and 350 schools, with approximately 34,000 pupils, benefited from this allocation. This brought the total number of remedial teachers in place to 1,133.  Of the 3,209 ordinary national schools <Col N="2033" /> throughout the country, approximately 2,061 now have the services of a remedial teacher, either on a full-time or on a shared basis.</P>
    <P>I recently announced my intention to appoint an additional 55 remedial teachers in the current year.  Decisions on the allocation of these posts will be made shortly following the collection and analysis of information from schools by the Department's primary inspectorate.  The posts will then be allocated on the basis of priority of need, as indicated by the information collected.</P>
    <P>Of the 237 ordinary national schools in County Galway, 121 now have the services of a remedial teacher, either on a full-time or shared basis.  This includes 26 schools allocated a remedial service in the current school year as part of the recent distribution of posts.  This means that 67 per cent of pupils attending ordinary national schools in County Galway currently enjoy a remedial service.</P>
    <P>I assure the Deputies that the needs of Mountbellew, Moylough, Cooloo and Briarfield national schools will be considered in the context of the allocation of remedial posts in 1995.  I thank them for acknowledging the appointment of a resource teacher to their area, a post to which they were entitled.  I am glad the children are benefiting as a result.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Minister's attendance in the House.  I seem to have required his presence here on many occasions recently and I appreciate the courtesy he has shown me and the House by making himself available to reply as the issues involved are important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's untimely intervention in the negotiations at the ESB is extremely dangerous and unwise.  Following the bitter strike at the ESB in 1991, I understood the company, the trade unions and the Department were committed to building better relations and a better culture in the ESB.  That process was working well and had led to <Col N="2034" /> talks on costs savings.  I understand the Minister's decision to intervene directly has jeopardised that good environment which was painstakingly rebuilt following the 1991 strike.</P>
    <P>The Minister's letter to the chairman of the ESB was unwise and, without being unduly political, it raises doubts about Fine Gael's commitment to social partnership.  It is a disturbing development particularly as it follows the Government's decision to intervene directly in the management-union relations at TEAM Aer Lingus.</P>
    <P>It appears a tension has developed between the partners in Government in regard to the Minister's approach to semi-State companies, particularly the ESB and TEAM Aer Lingus.  I look forward to having an opportunity at some stage of hearing from the Labour Party and Democratic Left members of the Government about the Minister's approach to State companies and whether he is committed to the principle of social partnership and the social structure we built for negotiations.</P>
    <P>The important talks about cost savings at the ESB were ongoing on a tripartite basis and a steering committee consisting of representatives of the company, the trade unions and the Department met once a week to consider how to progress negotiations.  If the Minister reflects on the matter he may consider it would have been more appropriate to have worked through that forum rather than submitting a letter on the matter directly to the chairman.  I hope his decision will not result in permanent damage.  The Minister should reassess his position before meeting the unions tomorrow.</P>
    <P>In regard to restructuring the ESB, the Minister has demanded that full savings be realised within two years, that there shall be no price increase until after that time and full acceptance of a reduction of approximately 2,900 in the workforce.  If he reconsiders those demands I am sure he will accept that <Col N="2035" /> they are unworkable in the present circumstances. They are certainly unworkable outside the social consensus structure we have built in the ESB.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister reconsider the position before it is too late?  The trade unions were guaranteed that those changes would be introduced over an acceptable time frame, but I understand that guarantee is being reneged on.  I will be particularly interested to hear what the Minister says about that.</P>
    <P>I accept the need for change at the ESB, but the scale is enormous.  I do not believe it is realistic or workable to try to cram them into the two year period that the Minister has now indicated.  I am not in a position to verify the figures but I understand that 2,900 redundancies would cost an average of £80,000, a total of £0.25 billion, in redundancy payments. Where will we find £0.25 billion in two years?  Is it more off balancesheet funds like the local loans fund? Can we sell a few more local authority houses or generating stations?  Speaking of generating stations, will the Minister square the circle which says on the one hand that we have to reduce staff by 2,900 and pay them £0.25 billion in two years, not over a longer period as we can afford it and, on the other hand, according to a letter from the chairman of the ESB, we will have serious problems from 1997 unless we set about increasing generating capacity?  Will that Are we to let go 2,900 people, pay them £0.25 billion and then have the ESB increase generating capacity?  Will that mean taking on additional people or can generating capacity be increased without people?  Perhaps when the Minister is talking to the unions tomorrow he can clarify that matter with them because I have some difficulty in doing it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Lowry)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to put the record straight in relation to the unfounded statements by Deputy Brennan who takes me to task for intervening at a time when delicate negotiations are <Col N="2036" /> underway between ESB management and unions.  He suggests my actions are at odds with the Government's policy of social partnership.  Nothing could be further from the truth.</P>
      <P>My letter to the ESB chairman was clear and concise and was intended to set out the policy which I expect the board and management to follow in the negotiations.  These negotiations must be concluded on the basis of achieving savings within a speedy time-scale.  I would not be serving the interests of the consumer or the requirements of the national economy if I shirked from making my views known.  It is important that these negotiations take place in an atmosphere of realism and that all parties are aware of the urgency attaching to achieving economies in the ESB.</P>
      <P>The Government attaches the utmost importance to the objective of social partnership in both the private and public sector.  Enlightened economic and social policy recognises the contribution which a co-operative approach between management and unions can make to economic growth and social progress in a modern economy.  However, the fruits of social partnership must emerge quickly if the present cost imposition on consumers and the wider economy is to be eliminated.</P>
      <P>The meeting tomorrow is at my invitation. I look forward to meeting the ESB group of unions, under the auspices of the ICTU so that they can put their views directly to me.  Equally, it will be useful for them to hear my views at first hand.  I am confident that this meeting will allay any fears about a departure from the spirit of social partnership.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The ESB is the oldest of our State enterprises and has played a pivotal role in national development over the last seventy years.  This Government wishes to ensure that the ESB continues to make a major contribution to economic development.  However, as acknowledged in the policy agreement between the three parties in Government, managed change must occur in State companies. External developments, such as <Col N="2037" /> technological change, the lessons to be learned from best practice performance in other countries and developments in EU law, mean that our State enterprises must continue to adapt if they are to respond to the needs of their customers and our economy.</P>
    <P>Many of the businesses which rely on the ESB for electricity are barely able to survive and maintain employment in fiercely competitive markets.  My job is to see that every effort is made to minimise the price of electricity to give those hard-pressed businesses a better chance in the market-place thereby preserving existing jobs and facilitating the creation of new jobs in the wider economy.  I could not justify a price increase without being satisfied that every effort has been exhausted to avoid an increase by enhancing efficiency within ESB.</P>
    <P>The Government has taken two major strategic initiatives to enable the ESB to achieve the necessary efficiency and cost improvements to maximise the benefit to consumers and to position itself for the coming liberalised European electricity market.  Firstly, a comprehensive cost and competitiveness review, involving ESB management, unions and officials of my Department was initiated early last year.  The review, with the assistance of the consultants McKinseys, has examined all aspects of the ESB's operations to determine how its performance can match best international practice.  McKinsey's conclusions have been widely reported as indicating scope for annual savings of £120 million part of which is due to 2,900 jobs which are surplus to requirements.</P>
    <P>In parallel with the cost and competitiveness review I am proceeding with a major strategic restructuring of the electricity industry approved by the previous Government in May 1993.  This will stimulate efficiency, build on the achievements of the CCR and create a market which will respond effectively to the wide variety of consumer needs. Restructuring is also essential in the context of moves towards liberalisation of the European energy market.  The <Col N="2038" /> CCR and the new regulatory arrangements are mutually reinforcing.  They are designed to achieve efficiency and cost effectiveness in the generation and supply of electricity in the State.</P>
    <P>It is worth reiterating the objectives of the CCR and the climate in which it is taking place.  The review has examined how ESB costs compare with best international practice and will recommend any necessary improvements in current ESB practices.  It is a major initiative, intended to build on the strengths of the ESB, and to bring about change in a spirit of co-operation and trust.  The need for this type of response was identified in the Culliton and Moriarty reports, which focus on the importance of minimising costs within the economy to support industrial growth and job creation.  Furthermore, the co-operative approach to this review accords with the Government's philosophy of social partnership and consensus. The willingness of the ESB and its trade unions to work closely together in this way exemplifies an organisation which is prepared to treat change as an opportunity rather than a threat.  I am confident that the review will strengthen the ESB's competitiveness and give it a significant advantage in advance of the completion of the Internal Market in electricity.</P>
    <P>The <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> gave central focus to the growth of employment and the competitiveness on which it must rest.  The semi-State sector, of which the ESB is a valued part, will play a crucial role in achieving competitive advantage. Indeed I would like to quote what I regard as a key sentence in the programme in its reference to State companies: &ldquo;The most significant contribution which the State enterprises can make to national economic and social development is the delivery of services which are efficient, effective and able to complete in the markets they serve.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The sense of urgency expressed in my letter to the ESB chairman is consistent with turning around the ESB to make <Col N="2039" /> a positive contribution to our country's competitiveness.</P>
    <P>The future of the ESB rests in the hands of its management and employees.  The CCR provides a unique opportunity for management and staff, with the support of a Government, to address difficult issues without the sort of confrontation which has jeopardised <Col N="2040" /> solutions in other places.  My letter to the chairman of the ESB maintains the Government's support for the process but underlines the necessity for tangible early progress now that the opportunity for substantial savings has been identified in the ESB.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.30 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 23 March 1995.</P>

      <P>Bord Fáilte is undertaking a number of marketing initiatives in Northern Ireland this year with a view to promoting further tourism from North to South.  The Northern Ireland market, like that in the South, offers potential for short breaks in the shoulder and off-seasons.  Bord Fáilte will be publishing separate editions of <Col N="1788" /> the <i>Discover Ireland</i> brochure for distribution in the North and is undertaking its largest ever television advertising campaign in the North, supported by radio, press and outdoor advertising.</P>
      <P>I am glad to say that Northern Ireland is also gaining substantially from visitors from the South.  This type of visitor movement is of value in much more than economic terms.  It helps to break down barriers and misunderstandings which have persisted for too long.</P>
      <P>Last November my Department and its Northern counterpart agreed a programme of special marketing measures, involving the promotion of tourism in the 12 northern counties, namely the six counties in Northern Ireland and the six southern Border counties.  The key objective of these agreed initiatives is to encourage more people to holiday in the 12 northern counties, which have been most affected by the troubles of the last 25 years.</P>

      <P>Irish exports to Tanzania came to £3.9 million in 1993 and given that country's current state of development it would not be realistic to expect that merchandise trade will show significant growth in the immediate future. However, a number of Irish companies in the services sector are currently pursuing opportunities presented by internationally-funded aid projects.  While these contracts are awarded on the commercial merits, I have no doubt that, all things being equal, the goodwill generated by Ireland's aid programme in Tanzania does stand to the credit of Irish companies when tendering for such business.  For example, ESB International recently succeeded in securing two World Bank funded projects in Tanzania worth almost £2 million, and I would hope that other Irish companies and organisations will enjoy similar success in the future.  In addition, the Irish Development Aid Office in Dar-Es-Salaam which oversees the Irish aid programme, also offers practical advice and assistance for Irish companies seeking to do business in Tanzania.</P>

      <P>As I announced recently at the launch of ABT's annual review and outlook for 1994-95, the Government has set the agency a target of increasing non-food indigenous exports, the sector for which it is responsible, to £6 billion by 1999.  I am satisfied based on the export performance of this sector in recent years, projected growth in our main markets, and the level of support available to Irish exporters under the EU co-funded market development programme for the period 1994-99, that this target is realistic and attainable.</P>
      <P>As regards the exports projections recently released by Forbairt, which operates under the aegis of the Department of Enterprise and Employment, I understand that these encompass a much wider spectrum of enterprises than those covered by the ABT targets, extending to food, meat and other companies which do not come within the trade board's remit.</P>

      <P>The Government is committed to achieving the greatest possible consolidation of resources in &ldquo;Ireland Houses&rdquo; wherever possible and I have already set out the considerable progress which has been made towards this goal in my reply of 9 February to Deputies Keogh and McDowell.  Since then it has been decided that the new embassies proposed for Hungary, the Czech Republic and Malaysia will also be developed along the lines of the Ireland House concept.</P>
      <P>However, in some countries, for practical economic reasons or because the political capital is in a different location to the national commercial centre, it is not feasible to have the embassy and all agencies under one roof.  Thus, in the United States, Canada, Germany, the Netherlands and Australia the embassies are located in Washington, Ottawa, Bonn, The Hague and Canberra while the State agencies are located in the main commercial centres.  In a number of countries office accommodation for some or all the State agencies has been consolidated but the embassy is separately located; Belgium, Denmark, France, Italy, Sweden, and Great Britain are in this category.  Only in Spain and Poland does An Bord Tráchtála have stand alone accommodation separate from the embassy and other agencies in the same city.</P>
      <P>As I have indicated previously, further possible consolidation of our representation abroad is kept under review by the foreign earnings committee so as to ensure that the most effective use is made of the resources available.</P>

      <P>Double taxation agreements facilitate the development of trade and they are also important for other areas of economic activity, particularly investment. Ireland's economic relations with Israel have reached the stage where a double taxation agreement is warranted, and negotiations on a draft treaty, which are primarily a matter for the Revenue Commissioners, are well under way.

      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to the additional allocation of £2.3 million provided in the context of the 1995 budget for tourism promotion and development activities.  Of this amount, £1.5 million is being added to the tourism promotion and development fund provided for under subhead B.3 of the Estimates provision of my Department.  Bord Fáilte will receive an additional £0.6 million for tourism development works, and £0.2 million is to be used to cover additional expenses under the Department's administration budget.</P>
      <P>The major element of expenditure under subhead B.3 of the 1995 Estimates provision is in respect of the overseas tourism marketing initiative.  This is a Government-private sector partnership campaign designed to increase tourist numbers and revenue from our four key target markets, i.e. Britain, the US, Germany and France.  TV and print media advertising campaigns are now in operation in these markets.  In support of these operations, I have decided to allocate, via Bord Fáilte, an additional £1 million out of the extra £2.3 million provision, specifically for complementary marketing and promotion campaigns in Britain, Continental Europe and other key third country markets, such as Japan and Australia.  Special allocations are being made also to assist in the organisation of major sporting events and towards special projects to be identified through the tourism council, which acts as an industry consultative body under my chairmanship.</P>

      <P>In the light of the success achieved in recent years and the excellent prospects for this year, I have recently revised An Bord Tráchtála's overall targets and our objective now is to increase non-food indigenous exports to £6 billion by 1999.  Support will be provided under the market development sub-programme incorporated in the operational programme for industrial development, 1994-99.  An estimated £450 million, comprising EU, Exchequer and private funding, will be invested over the six year period under the sub-programme, which outlines a number of measures and initiatives which ABT will be taking in conjunction with Irish exporters between now and 1999.</P>
      <P>As regards tourism, the Deputy will be aware of its vital importance to the economy.  Over 90,000 people are employed in tourism-related enterprises and last year tourism generated over £2 billion in overseas and domestic revenue. I intend to work closely with both Bord Fáilte and the Irish tourism industry to ensure that the sector continues to expand and develop.</P>
      <P>A total investment of £125 million is envisaged under the marketing sub-programme of the operational programme for tourism 1994-99.  I am confident that this unprecedented investment in the marketing and promotion of Irish tourism, together with the other measures in the operation programme, will ensure that we meet, if not exceed, the targets of 35,000 new jobs and almost £1 billion extra per annum in overseas revenue by 1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1795" /> In line with the importance which I attach to tourism promotion, I have recently decided to allocate a further £1 million to Bord Fáilte in 1995, over and above its normal allocation, for further marketing and promotional activity in a number of overseas markets.</P>
    <P>In addition, I intend to continue to encourage the efforts of the private sector to take on greater responsibility for tourism promotion in keeping with the increasing maturity and profitability of the industry.  In this connection, I have fully supported the overseas tourism marketing initiative which is a £6.3 million promotional campaign taking place this year in our four most important markets &mdash; the US, Britain, France and Germany.  The initiative is a partnership between the Government and the industry on both sides of the Border, in co-operation with the two tourist boards, and represents the largest ever overseas promotion of the island of Ireland as a tourism destination.</P>

      <P>The Uruguay Round of trade negotiations concluded at the end of 1993 and the resulting agreement came into effect on 1 January 1995.  The main changes agreed in the round were, first, an average 40 per cent reduction in tariffs to be phased in over about five years starting on 1 January 1995; secondly, an extension of the coverage of the rules to the new areas of services and intellectual property, as well as fuller coverage of agriculture and textiles; thirdly, a strengthening of the rules on matters such as dumping, subsidies and technical barriers to trade; fourthly, the introduction of an improved dispute settlement procedure; and, fifthly, the formation of the World Trade Organisation to implement the agreement.</P>
      <P>While it is still early days yet, implementation of the round is expected to boost investment confidence and economic growth in all markets, including the European Single Market, and at the same time provide a stable basis for trade and a reduction in trade disputes. Continued improvements in Irish competitiveness should leave Ireland well placed to benefit from the anticipated buoyancy on world markets.  In the case of sensitive sectors such as agriculture and textiles, the agreement is consistent with CAP reform already underway within the EU while extension of normal trade rules over a ten year period to textiles and clothing, including the abolition of EU import quotas from low-cost countries, should allow the industry sufficient time to restructure and take advantage of market opening by other countries.</P>

      <P>As the Minister for Enterprise and Employment indicated in his reply of 15 March last to Deputy Killeen's question on the same subject, the price increase in this material is part of a worldwide increase in raw material prices generally.

However, the Minister for Enterprise and Employment has asked the industrial development agencies to monitor the situation and the feedback to date is that there is no crisis in the various sectors affected, with companies being able to pass on the increases to the end user. These agencies will continue to monitor the situation and will be available to advise and, where possible, assist companies who experience particular difficulties.</P>

Such duty free sales are, strictly speaking, not in conformity with the operation of the internal market.  However, as an exceptional measure, the ECOFIN Council agreed that they could continue until mid 1999 in order to allow the operators involved sufficient time to diversify their activities.</P>

      <P>The local loans fund is a statutory fund under the control of the Minister for Finance, the capital for which has been provided by way of loans from the Exchequer.  The fund used these resources to make loans to local authorities for various purposes, mainly housing related.  Most of the loans currently outstanding to the fund have been used by the local authorities to finance the advancing of mortgage loans to house purchasers.</P>
      <P>At the end of 1994, the amount of principal on foot of such loans outstanding by authorities to the local loans fund was £490 million approximately. The local authorities make capital and interest repayments on these loans to the fund twice a year.  Almost all these loans were advanced prior to 1 July 1986.  Since then, most of the capital required by the local authorities to finance their mortgage lending activities has been provided by the Housing Finance Agency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government announced recently that it was accepting the judgement of the High Court in relation to the entitlements of women under the EU equal treatment directive.  It committed itself <Col N="1807" /> to paying the £260 million involved as quickly as possible.  In the current year, payments to the women affected will amount to an estimated £200 million. These liabilities are, of course, nonrecurrent.</P>
    <P>In the budget, I made a provision of £60 million against this contingency. The additional expenditure of £140 million in 1995 will not increase the Exchequer borrowing requirement because the Government has decided to finance it by the sale of certain assets. Sales will be limited to the amount needed to cover the additional Exchequer cost arising from the decision to accept the court judgment.</P>
    <P>Possible methods for the disposal of part of the local loans funds loan portfolio for this purpose are being examined at present.  However, only methods which will not alter in any way the existing relationship between the local authorities and individual borrowers are being considered.  The Housing Finance Agency and the National Treasury Management Agency are advising me on the technical aspects of the sale.  A final decision is expected shortly.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> The information requested by the Deputy in relation to live and stillbirths is set out in Table 1. The latest year for which stillbirth data are available is 1992.</P>
      <P>The information requested by the Deputy in relation to Down's Syndrome births is not available.  As part of the birth notification system, statistical information is collected on each birth and includes specification of congenital birth defects.  This data cannot, however, be used to provide national incidence figures for birth defects since the information is recorded shortly after the birth and many congenital anomalies, including Down's Syndrome, may not be positively identified at that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Comprehensive information on the prevalence of Down's Syndrome during the past ten years is, however, available for the Eastern Health Board area through participation in a concerted action programme of the EU on the epidemiologic surveillance of congenital anomalies, EUROCAT.  Approximately 20 regions throughout Europe are involved in this survey.  For the Eastern Health Board, a number of sources of information are used to ensure that reporting is as complete as possible.  These include the birth notification system, which is the principal source, as well as hospital discharge data, death certification, liaison with directors of community care and information from individual pathologists and <Col N="1811" /> paediatricians.  Table 2 sets out EUROCAT data for the Eastern Health Board showing numbers of Down's Syndrome births and prevalence rates per 10,000 live and stillbirths for each year from 1984 to 1993.</P>

The board has indicated that it is examining areas of greater need, including the development of occupational therapy and physiotherapy services, for the allocation of this year's funding.</P>
      <P>With regard to the particular case raised by the Deputy, I have asked the Eastern Health Board for a report on this matter and I will be in touch with him again as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> A development review group comprising of officers from the Department of Health and the Eastern Health Board was established in 1994 to review the development needs of James Connolly Memorial Hospital.  The review group has recommended that the present accommodation should be significantly upgraded and has prepared a planning brief for the future development of the hospital.</P>
      <P>I met a delegation from the Eastern Health Board regarding James Connolly Memorial Hospital and having taken the views of the health board into account I agreed that the hospital requires major upgrading and development at a cost of approximately £8 million. The health board indicated that it is prepared to utilise funds from the sale of some of the board's assets in order to provide funding towards this development. On this basis I agreed in principle that I will match such funds on a £1 for £1 basis.</P>
      <P>James Connolly Memorial Hospital has land assets surplus to its needs and it is proposed to dispose of a portion of these lands to part fund the development. No decision has yet been made regarding the amount or location of land to be sold.  A project team is being appointed to progress the development and it will be one of the functions of this team to examine all available options having regard to the overall needs of the hospital.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> Since 1987, an extensive national programme of hospital rationalisation has taken place.  The number of acute consultant staffed beds was reduced from over 15,000 in 1986 to about 12,000 by early 1990.  In February 1990 the then Minister undertook to maintain acute bed availability at approximately 12,000 beds, and this remains the policy.  The current number of acute hospital beds stands at 12,431.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The hospitals closed since March 1987 <Col N="1818" /> are listed at Appendix A.  The names and addresses of existing acute hospitals are listed in Appendix B.</P>
    <P>The general medical services scheme &mdash; GMS &mdash; under sections 58 and 59 of the Health Act, 1970, is concerned with the provision of a general practitioner medical and surgical service and arrangements for the supply of drugs and medicines for persons with full eligibility.  The latest figures available show that there are 1,667 general practitioners and 1,132 pharmacists contracted to provide services under the GMS scheme.</P>
    <P>There are 1,006 secretarial and 285 nursing staff employed by participating general practitioners in the scheme.  A subsidy is available towards the employment of these support staff under the terms of the GMS contract.</P>

        <i>Limerick East):</i> The Mental Health Association of Ireland will host the 1995 World Congress on Mental Health in Dublin from 13-15 August 1995.  It is expected that more than 1,200 delegates will attend the congress from all over the world.  The association has estimated overall expenditure on the congress to be approximately £400,000, most of which will be met from conference fees and sponsorship.  In view of the importance of this conference, my Department has agreed to make a total of £100,000 available to underwrite costs associated with its organisation.  The funding has already been advanced to the association via the health boards to assist with the cash flow involved in the congress organisation.  I understand that health boards will be assisting with aspects of the congress, such as an art exhibition entitled &ldquo;Time for Reflection&rdquo;&mdash; a project promoting artistic endeavour among those availing of mental health services &mdash; and with visits by delegates to mental health services.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> I have assumed that the Deputy is seeking information on all aspects of health boards' funding, including income, for the years in question. On that basis, the relevant details <Col N="1825" /> for the years 1991-94 are set out in the following table.  In the case of some health boards for 1993 and all health boards for 1994 unaudited outturn figures have been used in the absence of audited accounts.  It should be noted that as a result of the special funding made available in 1994 to eliminate <Col N="1826" /> excess debt in health agencies, the allocations of health boards for the years 1991 to 1993 inclusive, fall to be increased.  It is not possible, at this stage, to provide the information sought by the Deputy in respect of 1995, as financial plans for the year have not been completed by all boards.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> The reports on long-stay units for 1993 and 1994 will be available later this year.  These reports will be based on a new data collection system introduced in 1993 to update information requirements in the context of the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990, and to address existing problems of low response rates and poor data quality.  While considerable efforts have been made to obtain data for 1991 and 1992 in the new format, it is unlikely at this stage that sufficient coverage will be achieved to justify publication.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> The supply of discretionary health board services such as the home help services varies from <Col N="1828" /> health board to health board.  However, services widely available would include the home help service, home care attendant service, meals on wheels, day care, laundry service, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, chiropody and respite care.</P>
      <P>Most of these services are relevant to a number of different client groups, such as the elderly, persons with a mental handicap and persons with a physical disability.  As funding is allocated on the basis of the overall programme for each client group, it is not possible to identify separately the total expenditure on each individual service.  On the basis of information currently available to my Department, it is estimated that the home help service costs about £11 million and the meals on wheels services about £2 million.  However, I expect to have detailed figures in respect of each health board soon and I will then communicate details to the Deputy.</P>

        <i>Limerick East):</i> I propose to take Questions Nos. 82 and 83 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The information requested by the Deputy is set out in the following tables. Surgical operations and other procedures are reported via the hospital inpatient enquiry &mdash; HIPE &mdash; which relates to inpatient activity in acute public hospitals.  In Table 1, no figures are given for wisdom teeth removal since a <Col N="1829" /> significant proportion of these procedures are not carried out in acute general hospitals.  It should be noted that the figures for hysterectomy and D &amp; C operations are not comprehensive as there are a number of maternity hospitals not currently included in HIPE.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1830" /> Coverage for the hospitals included in HIPE is now approaching 100 per cent, but it will be noted in the footnote to the tables that coverage in earlier years was not as extensive as 1994 figures are based on the latest available returns.</P>

      <Quest>when a person (details supplied) in Finglas, Dublin 11 who is awaiting by-pass surgery in the Mater Hospital is likely to receive the necessary surgery; the average time for patients on the waiting list for this surgery in this hospital; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[6042/95]</QRef>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan, Limerick East) Michael Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> Open heart surgery operations for adults, including coronary artery by-pass grafts &mdash; CABGs &mdash; are currently performed for public patients at the national cardiac surgery unit in the Mater Hospital, Dublin, and at Cork University Hospital.  I understand the person in question was placed on the waiting list on 18 August 1994. The scheduling of surgery is a matter for the clinical judgment of the consultant concerned, is based solely on the patient's condition and not on the length of time on the waiting list.  Emergency cases are given priority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The need to provide additional facilities for open heart surgery for adults, including by-pass surgery has been recognised for some time and the following steps have been taken to improve the position.  In 1993, a sum of £1 million from the waiting list fund was allocated to enable the necessary facilities to be put in place at the national cardiac surgery unit, Mater Hospital, to increase the annual throughput of open heart surgery at the hospital from 750 to 1,000, an increase of 33 per cent.  In addition, in 1993 and 1994 funding of <Col N="1833" /> £2.8 million was provided to facilitate the doubling of cardiac surgery at Cork University Hospital from 200 to 400 patients each year.</P>
    <P>Over 1993 and 1994, in excess of £2 million revenue and £3.5 million in capital was allocated to the Mater Hospital for cardiac surgery and related developments. The building works associated with this development, which were completed in mid-1994, include additional cardiac maintenance beds, intensive care facilities and high dependency facilities which are required to support the cardiac surgery programme.  These new facilities at the hospital have now become operational and the additional cardiac surgery activity has commenced. Additional resources of £200,000 are being provided in 1995 to the Mater Hospital to ensure that the throughput in cardiac surgery in 1995 reaches the target of 1,000 open heart operations per year.</P>
    <P>The developments at the Mater Hospital, together with the developments for cardiac surgery at Cork University Hospital which were opened in November 1994 will have the effect of increasing the number of cardiac surgery operations performed on an annual basis in the public hospital sector by 47 per cent from 950 to 1,400.  The question of the provision of further additional facilities for cardiac surgery will be considered as sympathetically as possible in the context of the many competing demands for resources throughout the health services.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> Disabled person's maintenance allowance &mdash; DMPA &mdash; is the primary income support scheme operated by the health boards for people who, because of their disability, cannot work and are not in a position to maintain themselves in the community.  The current maximum personal rate of disabled person's maintenance allowance is £61 per week.</P>
      <P>Under section 69 of the Health Act, 1970, health boards, in assessing eligibility for disabled person's maintenance allowance, are obliged to have regard to the means of both the applicant and his-her spouse.  In the case referred to by the Deputy where the spouse was in receipt of the carer's allowance from the Department of Social Welfare, this allowance is disregarded by health boards when means testing for payment of disabled person's maintenance allowance. However, as the spouse in this case has surrendered the carer's allowance and taken up employment, the income from this employment would be taken into account in assessing the amount of disabled person's maintenance allowance payable.</P>
      <P>This case highlights the differences in the assessment of a spouse's income for disabled person's maintenance allowance and social assistance schemes.  As the Deputy is no doubt aware, responsibility for the disabled person's maintenance allowance scheme is being transferred from my Department to the Department of Social Welfare from 1 July 1995.  I will draw this difference in assessment to the attention of my colleague, the Minister for Social Welfare.</P>

      <P>Housing authorities are not required to apply an income limit in determing eligibility for local authority housing.  The application of an income limit and the manner of its operation are matters for housing authorities themselves but they must be satisfied that applicants are in need of housing and unable to provide it from their own resources.  In relation to the latter, authorities have been advised that they should, in assessing applications, have regard to household income.  Authorities have also been advised that the specification of a rigid income limit might unreasonably exclude from housing certain persons who, because of their overall circumstances, might not be in a position to provide adequate and suitable accommodation from their own resources.  It has been stressed to housing authorities that they should bring to the attention of housing applicants all the options available under &ldquo;A Plan for Social Housing&rdquo;, which may improve or speed up access to housing for the applicant.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 118 and 119 together.</P>
      <P>The Local Authorities (Combined Purchasing) Act, 1939, which provided for a centralised system for obtaining quotations and the appointment of contractors by the Minister for the Environment for the supply of commodities, including bituminous products, to local authorities was repealed with effect from 1 July 1994 in accordance with the provisions of the Local Government Act, 1994.</P>
      <P>Arrangements for acquiring bituminous products are now matters for each local authority.  I understand, however, that authorities are at present availing of the services of the National Roads Authority which is operating a centralised tendering system for such products. It is a matter for each local authority to determine to what extent it avails of these arrangements.</P>
      <P>It has not been the practice to publish information in relation to bitumen prices submitted by successful tenderers in view of the need to maintain competitive tendering and the possible implications for prices to be submitted for supplies in the future.  I do not consider that it would be appropriate to publish such information now.</P>
      <P>I have allocated all the funds available to me for non-national roads in 1995, apart from a small reserve for bridge strengthening works which will be allocated to eligible projects under the EU co-financed scheme of specific grants.  It is a matter for each local authority to prepare its road-works programme, having regard to the grant allocations, the own resources provision, and the cost of the various materials and other inputs.</P>

      <P>In order to do this, individual vehicles are generally required to operate a number of services to schools and, consequently, extended timetables often require some pupils to make an early start in the mornings and wait for some time in the evenings.</P>

      <P>The children in question reside outside the Waterford city catchment area and are therefore not eligible for transport to that post primary centre.  Any encroachment into other catchment areas in order to cater for children who attend school in Waterford city would be an infringement of the terms of the school transport scheme.</P>
      <P>It is the prerogative of parents to send their children to the school of their choice.  It is not, however, the object of the school transport scheme to facilitate parents in exercising that choice.  The operation and cost of private transport arrangements is a matter for the parents concerned.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the post primary transport scheme, my Department would be prepared to allow these children avail of transport from inside the Waterford city catchment boundary, provided that they are basically eligible for transport to the school of their own catchment areas.  This would be subject to there being spare accommodation available on the service and provided that no additional State cost is incurred.</P>

      <P>In 1993, my Department approved a proposal made by City of Cork Vocational Education Committee for the establishment under its aegis of an all-Irish post-primary school to cater for pupils from the all-Irish primary schools in the southside of Cork city. Accordingly, Gaelcholáiste Deisceart Chorcaí opened on 1 September 1993. The school is currently located in a temporary premises in the centre of the city.</P>
      <P>In accordance with standard practice the recognition of the school was given on a trial basis for a period of six years. The question of securing suitable temporary accommodation for the school during this period is primarily for the committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department is considering a submission recently received from the committee regarding a suitable location for the school and will be in contact with <Col N="1869" /> the chief executive officer in the matter shortly.</P>
    <P>The provision of funding for permanent accommodation for the Gaelcholáiste would not arise in 1995.  A request from the vocational education committee for funding to provide temporary accommodation or to rent temporary premises would receive careful and sympathetic consideration.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that all the information sought by the Deputy is not readily available and could be obtained only by the expenditure of a disproportionate amount of Garda time and resources.</P>
      <P>Statistics as to the numbers of persons convicted for offences committed while on bail are available only for the years 1992-1994.  They are as follows: 1992, 1,901; 1993, 1,691; 1994, 555.</P>
      <P>However, a word of warning and an explanation is necessary if the above figures are not to be misinterpreted.  First, the warning: the statistics relate to numbers of persons convicted of offences, so there may be an element of double-count, if some individuals have been convicted more than once of separate offences.</P>
      <P>Second, by way of explanation, I should point out that the statistics refer to the year the offence was committed and not the year when the conviction was obtained.  This explains why the 1994 figure is so low in comparison to 1992 and 1993.  As convictions are obtained this year in relation to offences which occurred last year, the figure of 555 can be expected to grow considerably.</P>
      <P>For completeness, I will set out the number of detected offences committed by persons while on bail for the years 1983 to 1994.</P>

      <P>The two bodies under the aegis of my Department are the Combat Poverty Agency and the Pensions Board.  The Pensions Board is not supported by Structural Funds.  However, the Combat Poverty Agency received funding under the HORIZON Community Initiative as follows: 1992, £389,209; 1993, £437,123; 1994, £382,554.</P>
      <P>The HORIZON funding was applied for by the agency on behalf of projects in the Community Development Programme which are already being funded by my Department.  (The Community Development Programme provides core costs for community development resource centres located in areas of high unemployment around the country). Some of these projects felt that they would be unable to access the EU Structural Funds themselves.  The Combat Poverty Agency administers the HORIZON funding and supports the work that the projects undertook to do with its help, which includes the development of innovative strategies to tackle the problem of long term unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Combat Poverty Agency also received £35,588 in 1994 from the European Social Fund, towards the cost of <Col N="1879" /> an Advanced Community Development Consultancy Programme (ACDC).  The ACDC Programme, which is run by the agency in conjunction with Community Action Network and Meitheal, provides training for trainers in community development consultancy.

      <P>The budget allocation of £60 million was provided as a first step towards meeting the Government's commitment, as outlined in the Programme for <i>A Government of Renewal,</i> to pay the legally determined entitlements of married women to social welfare equality payments.</P>
      <P>Following an examination of the recent High Court decision in what effectively amounts to two &ldquo;test cases&rdquo; heard in June 1994, the Government is introducing arrangements to give full effect to the decision of the court. Under these arrangements, the estimated 70,000 married women involved will receive payments on the basis of the rules applied to married men in the period of delay in implementing the 1979 Equal Treatment Directive.</P>
      <P>These payments will consist of increases for adult and child dependants and unemployment assistance and they will also receive the transitional payments as provided for in the court's decision.  In addition, compensation will be payable based on the increase in the consumer price index from the date of entitlement in December 1984 onwards to the date on which the payments are made.</P>
      <P>The total costs of these arrangements are estimated at some £260 million, of which up to £200 million will be paid by the end of 1995.  The remaining payments, estimated at £60 million will be paid from January 1996 onwards over as short a period as possible.  All of the married women involved will receive payments on account by September next at an overall cost estimated at £100 million.  Further payments on account will be made up to the end of December 1995 at a cost of £90 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A special unit is being set up in my Department to process the payments in question.  All the women who have received payments under the Europen Communities (Social Welfare) Regulations, 1992 (S.I. No. 152 of 1992) will <Col N="1881" /> be notified of the arrangements for the payment of arrears and an extensive advertising campaign will also be undertaken over the coming weeks.  In addition, a special telephone inquiry unit will be set up in the Department to deal with inquiries from the married women concerned.</P>

      <P>The national fuel scheme assists householders who are on long term social welfare or health board payments and who are unable to provide for their own heating needs.  A payment of £5 per week is paid to eligible households for 26 weeks, from mid-October to mid-April.</P>
      <P>An additional smokeless fuel allowance of £3 per week, was introduced in October 1990, to assist people living in the built up areas of Dublin to help meet the additional costs arising from the ban on the sale of bituminous coal in these areas.  This allowance has been extended to cover the Cork city and adjacent areas to coincide with the ban on the sale of bituminous coal which came into effect there on 13 February 1995.</P>
      <P>At present, a contributory pensioner and members of his/her household, can have means up to £5 a week in addition to the social welfare pension and qualify for the fuel allowance.  In the 1995 budget, I have increased this £5 means limit to £10 with effect from the start of the 1995-96 fuel scheme in October 1995.  Increasing the means limit by a further £10, i.e. from £10 to £20, would have financial implications which could only be considered in a budgetary context.</P>

      <P>The market development <Col N="1884" /> fund operated between October 1992 and March 1993, after which a review of its effectiveness was carried out.  The fund was established to provide temporary support to companies in order to maintain competitiveness and associated employment and to help companies adjust to the new market conditions arising as a result of the currency crisis of late 1992.</P>
      <P>The review found that four of the 704 companies assisted went out of business during the six-month period that the fund was in operation and that employment numbers in the supported companies were virtually maintained at the level originally approved.</P>
      <P>The review also noted the contribution made by the assisted companies in ensuring their future viability.  In applying for support, companies were required to submit plans outlining the range of actions which they were taking to overcome current and possible future currency related difficulties.  These actions, which included cost cutting, increasing productivity, improving services to justify higher prices and market diversification, were later supplemented by a serious of treasury management seminars run by ABT in December 1993.</P>

      <P>Although the CSO have still to finalise figures for 1994, latest available estimates indicate that total exports last year are likely to reach £22.4 billion, an increase of 14 per cent on the previous year.  The market breakdown of export performance for the period January-August 1994, the latest for which CSO figures are available, was as follows: UK, 27 per cent; Mainland <Col N="1886" /> Europe, 40 per cent; North America, 10 per cent; Rest of World, 23 per cent.</P>
      <P>An Bord Tráchtála expect 1995 exports to show an increase of 13 per cent to £25.3 billion.</P>
      <P>Targets set by Government for ABT focus on improving the export performance of indigenous Irish non-food companies. I recently announced at the launch of the annual ABT Review and Outlook for 1994 and 1995 that Government was aiming for an increase in exports by this sector to £6 billion by 1999.</P>
      <P>Working towards this objective the trade board are targeting a 17 per cent increase this year to £4 billion, with the main concentration on the British, remainder of the EU, North American and Asian markets.  ABT will be promoting a particularly intensive campaign to encourage exporters to seize new business opportunities emerging in the enlarged EU Single European Market, under the banner &ldquo;Opportunity Europe&rdquo;.  This will involve a dual startegy of supporting the 800-plus Irish companies at present selling in Continental Europe and encouraging Irish exporters who have already been successful in Britain to expand into other European markets.</P>
      <P>There will also be special emphasis in 1995 on encouraging companies to identify opportunities in the Northern Ireland market.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1887" /> The national marketing campaigns undertaken by Bord Fáilte and the overseas tourism marketing initiative include the targeting of potential tourists in the Southern States.

In addition the overseas tourism marketing initiative advertising on national cable TV stations reaches all cable subscribers in the south.</P>
    <P>Trade promotions involving the Irish tourism industry and US tour operators have taken place in major cities throughout the south over the past two years with a special focus on Texas, which is seen as the market with the greatest potential for growth.  Besides fulfilling requests from these states for brochures and other information on Ireland, Bord Fáilte has distributed over 200,000 copies of its main brochure to targeted regions of the south in 1994 and 1995.</P>
    <P>The Southern US States will also be extensively covered by the British Airways holiday programme which I launched last week in the US.  This programme, in conjunction with Bord Fáilte and CIE Tours, will be promoted to 32,000 travel agents and directly to 750,000 consumers throughout the US. British Airways will be selling holidays to Ireland on its seven direct services to London and many code sharing services with US Air from the Southern US.</P>

There are no restrictions on trade between Ireland and Indonesia.

      <P>Pyramid selling is prohibited by the Pyramid Selling Act, 1980.  The Act creates two offences: section 2 (1) provides that &ldquo;the promoter, or any of the promoters of, or a participant in, a scheme or a person acting on behalf of the promoter, or any of the promoters of, or a participant in, a scheme shall not induce or attempt to <Col N="1893" /> induce a person to become a participant in a scheme&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Section 3 (1) provides that &ldquo;If any person who is a participant in a scheme or has applied or been invited to become a participant in a scheme&mdash;</P>
      <P> (a)  makes any payment to or for the benefit of the promoter of or (if there is more than one) any of the promoters of, or a participant in, the scheme or a person acting on behalf of a promoter of, or a participant in, a scheme, and</P>
      <P>(b)  is induced to make that payment by reason that the prospect is held out to him of receiving payments or other benefits in respect of the introduction of other persons who become participants in the scheme. </P>
      <P>any person to whom or for whose benefit that payment is made shall be guilty of an offence&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Act specifies those elements which must be present in a &ldquo;scheme&rdquo; before it can be regarded as pyramid selling within the meaning of the Act. Any multi-level marketing activity containing those elements would bring such an activity within the scope of the Pyramid Selling Act.</P>
      <P>Enforcement of the Act is a matter for the Garda Síochána.  If the Deputy is aware of a suspected breach of the Act, she should report it to the Garda Síochána.  Fraud Section, Harcourt Square, Dublin 2.</P>
      <P>The interpretation of the Act with regard to any particular scheme is ultimately a matter for the courts.  For my own part.  I would urge the public to exercise extreme caution in relation to participation in any form of multi-level selling activity.</P>

      <P>Under CAP reform, quotas were introduced into the sheepmeat sector.  Council Regulation 2069/92 set individual producer limits based on the total ewe premiums granted in either the 1989, 1990 or 1991 marketing year to each producer. Ireland selected 1991 as the reference year.</P>
      <P>The regulation provided that in order to automatically qualify for the ewe premium quota a flockowner had to (a) have been paid the premium in 1991 (b) have applied for a quota based on the number of ewes on which they were paid the premium in 1991 less a deduction for a national reserve &mdash; which had to be established by deduction from existing premium rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1896" /> This reserve was necessary to allow access for both new producers and existing producers whose reference flocks were not in line with the normal pattern of the flock size.</P>

At a recent meeting which I had with Commissioner Fischler, he confirmed that the Commission would make a decision on the submission during 1995, hopefully by mid-year.</P>
      <P>A decision on extension and reclassification will provide a clearer basis against which decisions on a third category can be taken.  Consideration will also have to be given to the resources available for headage payments under the Structural Funds as well as the conclusions from the evaluation of the headage schemes which is currently under way, and which is due to be completed by end June.</P>

      <P>Under the system of support for producers of arable crops, introduced as part of CAP reform, area payments can only be claimed on eligible land, that is land which was tilled, other than for reseeding into grass, during the period from 1 January 1987 to 31 December 1991.</P>
      <P>These area payments are limited to a national base area of 345,000 hectares. The total area for which area payments was claimed in 1994, including areas under cereals, oilseeds, protein crops, linseed and set-aside was approximately 300,000 hectares.  This represents a shortfall of about 45,000 hectares in the usable national base area reflecting changes in land use from eligible arable crops to other agricultural and non-agricultural uses.  Such changes in land use are based mainly on commercial decisions by farmers having regard to the relative profitability of various land use options.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, I am concerned about the potential restriction placed on arable crop production by the eligible land rule.  I am at present actively pursuing this matter with the EU Commission with a view to having the eligible land rule modified.</P>

      <P>RTE has installed a new station in Malin to provide improved RTE reception to that area, and in some cases, to provide an RTE signal where it was not previously available.  The frequencies for that station have been allocated in accordance with international agreement and national planning requirements.  In doing so every effort was made to preserve direct off-air reception of UK channels where that was available.  I understand that the new station has caused some interference with fringe off-air reception of some UK channels in the area.  RTE is continuing this installation work at the moment and will make every effort to minimise such interference, including visiting viewers and television dealers in the area to advise them as to the best way to preserve all signals.  However, it may not be possible to reconcile the provision of national television services with continued direct reception of UK channels in every case.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The consultants referred to were <Col N="1910" /> engaged by the Efficiency Audit Group to conduct the detailed work of the review of the Defence Forces.  They prepared a confidential report for the EAG.  To ensure that the consultants had the necessary expertise, senior officers of the Defence Forces were involved at every stage of the selection process.  The selected firm, Price Waterhouse, provided a team which included Major General Lewis Makenzie, the ex-UN commander in the former Yugoslavia, and other Canadian military experts.</P>
    <P>The Canadian military team was accepted by the Irish military authorities as having the necessary and appropriate military competence to conduct the review.  The Efficiency Audit Group also had the services of a separate military adviser, a recently retired New Zealand Air Vice Marshal of international repute.</P>
    <P>No decisions have been taken on the report of the Efficiency Audit Group in relation to the Army School of Music, or indeed any other unit of the Defence Forces.  The important role of the military bands in the life of the Defence Forces is well known.  In any reorganisation arising from the EAG review, the contribution of the Army School of Music will be fully borne in mind.</P>
    <P>As I have already informed the House, I am consulting with all interested parties, including the military authorities and the associations representing military personnel, before any decisions are taken.</P>

      <P>The construction and maintenance of roads is a matter for the Department of the Environment and local authorities.  The Department of the Marine has no role to play in this regard.</P>
      <P>Under the Operational Programme for Environmental Services 1994-1999, the Department will have some £5.1 million available to help address priority erosion projects around the coast.</P>
      <P>This figure represents a considerable increase on the £100,000 per annum available in recent years for capital expenditure on coastal protection schemes.  However, it is not enough to deal with the major erosion problems around our coast.  In view of this, I intend looking at ways of increasing the funding for this important area over the next few years.</P>
      <P>In the context of the funding currently available and the need to undertake a best mix of protection projects, the Department has requested local authorities to provide details of their top four priority proposals for consideration. The bulk of replies are still awaited, I can, however, advise the Deputy that Kerry County Council's submission has been received.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The council has advised that their number one priority is the protection of the village green, a number of properties and a roadway at Waterville.  This <Col N="1916" /> road forms part of the N70 Ring of Kerry road.  Additional details including a cost benefit analysis will be required in order for this project to be assessed fully.  Upon receipt of the additional information, the Kerry County Council proposals will be considered along with proposals from other local authorities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Coveney)</NameTxt>
      <P>Twelve proposals to implement fallowing strategies at existing salmon farm operations for the 1995 season have been submitted to the Department.</P>
      <P>One proposal was lodged in September 1994, one in October 1994, two in November 1994, two in December 1994 and six in January 1995.</P>
      <P>The practice of fallowing fishfarm sites as part of overall environmental and fish health management strategies is now well established nationally and internationally.  Where implemented to date fallowing has had demonstrable benefits for fish health, fish husbandry and the control of sea lice levels. Accordingly, the Department is assessing, and consulting relevant interests on, the current group of fallowing proposals with a view to progressing them where technically feasible in 1995.  This assessment process will be completed in the coming weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A review of the legislation governing aquaculture is well advanced with the aim of introducing a new legal framework at the earliest possible date.  An overhaul is generally agreed to be long <Col N="1917" /> overdue to reflect changed conditions and, notably, increased environmental awareness and the significant technical advances in fish husbandry, including fallowing, of recent years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Coveney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose answering Questions Nos. 245 and 246 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1918" /> Perhaps responsibility for coastal protection lies with the property owner, whether that be a local authority or a private individual.  The role of the Department of the Marine is to work in conjunction with coastal local authorities on the overall management of the coastal zone.</P>
    <P>Since 1990 when funding for coastal protection was transferred to the Department of the Marine from the Office of Public Works no grant-aid has been provided in respect of new protection works in County Donegal.  No funding was provided by the Office of Public Works during the period 1987 to 1989.</P>
    <P>During the late 1970's coast protection schemes were constructed by the Office of Public Works at Rossnowlagh and Moville.  These schemes are maintained by the State and maintenance costs are recouped from Donegal County Council.</P>
    <P>Under the Operational Programme for Environmental Services 1994 to 1999, some £5.1 million is being made available to help address the serious erosion problem around our coastline. This represents a major increase from the mere £100,000 per annum available for this purpose in recent years but it is small in relation to the scale of the problem.  Given this limited level of funding the Department of the Marine will only be able to grant-aid local authorities to undertake the most urgent erosion protection projects, having regard to environmental, economic and ecological considerations.  I will be seeking additional funding for coast protection purposes.</P>
    <P>In order that the best mix of priority projects can be carried out over the next number of years, the Department have invited all maritime local authorities to submit for consideration full details of their top four priority protection projects, along with a cost-benefit analysis for each.</P>
    <P>We are currently awaiting a reply from Donegal County Council and if they include Holmes Beach on their list it will be given full consideration by the Department.</P>
