      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Taoiseach</askee>
      <Quest>if he intends to formulate proposals on the way in which public moneys will be spent in future referenda campaigns.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am at present examining the implications of the findings in the McKenna case for future referenda. These findings require careful consideration and any necessary proposals to comply with them will be put in place in due course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach put definite proposals in place in advance of a future referendum?  Does he agree it would be better to do this now rather than wait for a referendum as he might get it wrong again?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy it is very important that this should be clarified at the earliest possible time.  That is the purpose of the study that is now being undertaken, but obviously it has not been completed yet.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that the notion of spending public moneys should be examined and that it should not be assumed that public moneys should be spent on referenda campaigns?  There seems to be an implicit assumption that public moneys will be spent in a balanced way one way or the other.  Does the Taoiseach agree that there are many referenda in which it is not possible to produce a leaflet which puts &ldquo;both sides&rdquo; of the issue because there are many issues to which there are ten sides rather than a simple two sides?  Does he agree in principle that it would be better to abstain completely from spending public money on referenda campaigns?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy is putting an undue inference on Deputy O'Dea's question.  I do not think Deputy O'Dea was advocating expenditure, he was simply asking what we would do in the light of the judgment in the McKenna case.  That is how I answered his question.  There is no presumption as to the expenditure of public funds in future referenda campaigns. The matter is being examined.</P>
      <P>Undoubtedly there are five or even ten views on every such question but when it comes to voting in a referendum one can vote &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo; or abstain. The maximum number of views you can have on the question is three.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to confirm there was no inference in my question that public money should be spent.  Will the Taoiseach confirm that he is considering whether public moneys should be spent on future referenda campaigns or whether it should be left to the political parties to fund them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Deputy was inferring that public money should be spent and I was not inferring in my reply that it should be spent on future referenda campaigns.  The matter is now to be considered in the light of the court judgment.  When we have developed our thinking on the matter <Col N="315" /> further perhaps the Deputy will put down a further question and we will come back to this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>While I fully agree with the Taoiseach that one can only vote &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo;, I think he might agree if he goes back to the so-called substantive issue referendum that it was beaten for a multiplicity of reasons and that it would not be possible to issue a leaflet paid for by the Government in which the &ldquo;no&rdquo; side was expressed as one single coherent view.  Rather than funding propaganda for &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo; I suggest it would be better to allow those who are interested in putting forward their view in public to raise such funds as they want to support their own campaign from private and voluntary sources and leave Exchequer funding completely out of the equation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no trouble with that point of view.  Let me repeat there is no presumption in anything I have said in favour of the expenditure of public moneys in any shape or form.  I agree with the Deputy that it is the function of political parties in particular to give leadership on issues of this kind.  That is one of the purposes for which people subscribe to political parties &mdash; so that they may show leadership in matters of public policy.  Almost any referendum will be on a matter of public policy and it would be appropriate for a policital party not only to have an opinion but to disseminate that opinion quite widely. The fact that public funds were being expended in this instance may have created a sense in some political parties that there was not the same obligation on them to expend their own resources of time and money in giving an account of their position to the public.  That mistake, if mistake it was, will not be made on future occasions because clearly we will now know &mdash; by virtue of the Supreme Court decision &mdash; that it will be primarily, or perhaps exclusively, a matter for parties and other organisations to disseminate their views in the <Col N="316" /> appropriate way.  At this juncture, however, I do not want to prejudge the results of any examination we may make of the Supreme Court judgment beyond saying that we will and must fully respect that judgment because it is now the definitive statement of the law.</P>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 to 5 inclusive together.</P>
      <P>President Clinton's visit was very successful and I believe will have a very positive impact across a broad range of issues in both the political and economic areas.  Probably the most important dimension to the President's visit was the additional momentum it provided to the core objective of the 28 November communiqué &mdash; namely the commencement of all-party negotiations on an agreed settlement based on consent.</P>
      <P>The main focus of my discussions with the President was the Anglo-Irish communiqué, my assessment of the reaction to it and probable developments in the short to medium term.  We also discussed the situation in Bosnia.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="317" /> Naturally, I used the opportunity to express our deep appreciation for President Clinton's whole-hearted endorsement of the communiqué and his constructive and even-handed assistance throughout the entire peace process.</P>
    <P>We discussed the nature of the tasks to be undertaken in implementing the Dayton accord on Bosnia and, in particular, the peacekeeping role to be played there by US troops.  The President expressed great admiration for the many Irish people who had assisted in UN peacekeeping missions for almost 40 years.  This point was emphasised by him publicly on a number of occasions during his visit.</P>
    <P>We also covered EU/US and Irish/US relations and, in particular, the efforts being made to further develop Ireland' attractiveness as a destination for US investors.  Already the US is Ireland's second largest trading partner, our fourth largest export market and the largest source of inward investment.</P>
    <P>As the House will be aware, the US Commerce Secretary, Mr. Ron Brown, accompanied President Clinton.  Secretary Brown had a meeting with the Ministers for Finance, Enterprise and Employment, Tourism and Trade and Transport, Energy and Communications. The discussions covered issues of mutual interest across their areas of ministerial responsibility, a review of activity since the Washington Conference and the proposed follow-up conference.</P>
    <P>During the visit, two co-operation agreements were signed.  The Minister of State with responsibility for Science and Technology, Deputy Pat Rabbitte, signed a joint statement with Commerce Secretary Brown on plans for Ireland and the USA to co-operate in science and technology activities of mutual benefit.  The Minister for the Marine signed a Memorandum of Understanding that will allow Ireland to draw on the resources of US marine research agencies.</P>
    <P>The International Fund for Ireland announced its support for RADIUS, the <Col N="318" /> technology-based, market-driven programme that will support company to company product development between companies in the Border area and the US and between companies in Northern Ireland and the US.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste and Secretary Brown had a very successful, productive meeting with some 200 people representative of businesses in Ireland and the US, State agencies and local government. Again the proposed follow-up conference was the key item of discussion.</P>
    <P>Overall the President's visit demonstrated to the world how the situation in Ireland has been transformed over the past 15 months, serving to highlight the real benefits arising from peace and, at the same time, challenging everyone to build on it.</P>
    <P>I should like to avail of this opportunity to pay a special tribute and say a special word of thanks to all those who, whether serving in the Garda Síochána, the Army or the various branches of our public service, Protocol and so on rendered this such a successful visit.  It is important to recognise that months of intensive preparation, work and dedicated commitment went into making this visit the success it was.  It is appropriate that we should acknowledge and record that fact in the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I join the Taoiseach in his expression of thanks to all those involved in the preparation for the US President's visit.</P>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach accept that President Clinton acted as a catalyst in the run-up to last Tuesday evening's launch of the twin-track approach and that his visit and efforts behind the scene made that possible?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The imminence of the United States President's visit and his well known and continuing interest were certainly very helpful to the British Prime Minister and me in establishing the necessary momentum to obtaining the agreement.  I am very happy to express my thanks to President Clinton in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="319" />
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I join the Taoiseach in his expression of thanks to all those involved in the preparations for the US President's visit and congratulate them on having made the visit so successful. It was a major contribution to the peace process.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach said last week that President Clinton's visit was the catalyst for an agreement to be reached between the two Governments that probably would have happened anyway, whereas he was quoted in newspapers over the weekend as having said on the telephone to President Clinton that if we do not make it now we will never make it. Would the Taoiseach say which is the true version?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not actually recollect using those words on the telephone to anybody but I would acknowledge there was a sense of urgency about the matter arising from the objective situation on the ground, from a sense of frustration and exasperation that movement was not taking place, which was added to and given focus by the imminence of the US President's visit and his well known interest in the subject.  All of those factors combined to help us make the breakthrough on Tuesday last, 28 November, and I am very happy that that happened.  I am also happy to acknowledge the role of very many people in that endeavour, as I did in the House in reporting on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach accept that President Clinton made it very clear, both in public comments and in private briefings, that the American Government did not wish to tell us what to do but rather wanted to be supportive and was very keen to ensure that Americans were even-handed in their approach to the difficulties in Northern Ireland?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Indeed.  Members will recollect that in the course of my visit to the United States in March last I made the point repeatedly in public that the United States Administration was <Col N="320" /> and should continue to be balanced and even-handed in its approach as between the two communities and the various points of view held in Northern Ireland. That is extremely important.  It is very important that, if the US President and the United States in general are to play the constructive role they have played to date, both communities feel they will receive an attentive ear in Washington. It is also very fair of Deputy Harney to make the point that the US President has said that his role, and that of the United States, is one of assisting the parties to reach an agreement but not one of prescribing the nature of that agreement.  Members will recollect that in an intervention at the press conference after the agreement had been signed in Downing Street I made the point quite firmly that the agreement the British Prime Minister and I were announcing that evening was one between the British and Irish Governments, that it was our agreement.  Having said that, I am happy to acknowledge the assistance and the catalytic role &mdash; or whatever discription one might wish to attach to it &mdash; of the United States and the President in particular.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach comment on the core statement of President Clinton that anyone who renounces violence should have the right to participate in talks?  Since Ms Nancy Soderberg was quoted over the weekend as having said that the White House considers the idea of an assembly worthy of serious discussion but as forming part of talks, not substituting for them, what is the Taoiseach's view on her remarks?  Since is now appears that the Leader of the Ulster Unionist Party, Mr. Trimble, has rejected an involvement in Strand II of the talks, why does the Taoiseach consider it so important to give so much credence to the idea of such an assembly?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I attach a lot of importance to the constructive role the United States can and must continue to play in this area.  As I said in response <Col N="321" /> to Deputy Harney, it is very important, if the United States is to play that role, that it be seen to be balanced and even-handed between the different points of view.  I will not, therefore, respond to the Deputy's invitation to comment on particular quotations he has chosen from what President Clinton said.  I am sure he could have chosen other quotations that might, were I to comment on them, have given a slightly different impression from any comment I might make on the selection of quotations the Deputy chose to put to me.  I will not comment on any of those remarks.  President Clinton' own words and his record in this area speak for themselves without any embellishment from me.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I join others in congratulating all involved in the visit of President Clinton.  I also congratulate the Chair on his handling of the visit here in the Chamber in his own inimitable fashion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should not think that will allow him to get away with disorderly remarks.  The Ceann Comhairle is just as even-handed as President Clinton.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>It is sometimes difficult to get the Taoiseach to speak.  On other occasions it is difficult to keep him quite.  On the matter raised by Deputy Ahern &mdash; the refusal of Mr. Trimble to participate in Strand II of the three-stranded talks process &mdash; can the force and influence of President Clinton's visit be further put to the test in relation to the three-stranded talks?  Is the Taoiseach committed to the three-stranded process as the way forward?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>These supplementary questions are more appropriate to Question No. 6 and subsequent questions which will be taken in a few moments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach's very long reply covered many issues, not just the Northern issue.  Are there proposals for an economic conference referred to in the discussions held with Secretary of State Browne?  When does the Taoiseach think the follow-up conference will take place?  Will it be in the form of another conference, and will it take place here or in Washington?  Will the Taoiseach elaborate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That matter is being worked upon at the moment.  I cannot give the Deputy the sort of detail he is requesting.  I will make the appropriate inquiries and give the Deputy the up-to-date position as soon as it is available. As of now, all I can say is what I said in my reply, that there will be a follow up conference and that its subject matter, scope and location are under discussion. When there is a greater degree of decision on the matter I will communicate with Deputy Burke.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach did refer to President Clinton's praising the role of peace-keepers from this country over the last 35 years.  In view of the recognition of that role by President Clinton, will the Taoiseach acknowledge that our peace-keeping role in the world is better served in the manner in which we do it today than by any military alliance?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That is quite an extension of this question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is certainly approaching the visit of President Clinton from a very acute angle.  The matter of military alliances did not arise during the course of my discussions with President Clinton.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Question No. 2 refers to inward investment potential from the <Col N="323" /> visit.  Is the Taoiseach aware of the disquiet among the Border Members from all parties about the possibility that International Fund money will not be focused directly on proper infrastructure within the Border areas.  The Taoiseach is probably aware that many Border areas experience difficulty in attracting inward investment because they do not have serviced sites for industrial investment, and where they do have sites they do not have buildings. I believe that there is £35 million in peace initiative money available for investment in the Border areas which has not yet been earmarked.  Will the Taoiseach use his good offices to ensure that these funds are used to put in place the infrastructure for any inward investment that may result from these conferences?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I noted what Deputy Ahern said.  These questions should more appropriately be addressed to the Ministers for the Environment, Finance, and Enterprise and Employment to whom I will convey the concerns Deputy Ahern has just expressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, I ask for the co-operation of the Chair and the Taoiseach, It is likely that the Taoiseach will take the remaining questions together and we have about four minutes to deal with them.  As this is probably the last time this year we will have an opportunity to ask questions on Northern Ireland, I ask that these be put back until tomorrrow.  It would be unsatisfactory to be able to ask only two or three supplementary questions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>, <i>Limerick East):</i> I am aware of the very important contribution of the hospice movement in the provision of in-patient and home care for the terminally ill.  The health strategy document, &ldquo;Shaping a Healthier Future&rdquo;, Acknowledges the important role that palliative care services in general, and the hospice movement in particular, play in the delivery of services and improvement of the quality of life of terminally ill patients. It is my intention to promote the continued development of such services. Indeed, I was pleased in the current year to provide direct funding in excess of £500,000 towards the development of <Col N="327" /> new services in this sector.  In addition the local health boards are continuing to support the delivery of services by the hospice movement on a regional basis.</P>
      <P>A major focus of the hospice movement is the provision of services to cancer patients.  On taking office, I set as a priority, the development of services to combat cancer.  Accordingly, I have established a review group to examine the existing cancer service infrastructure and to prepare a policy statement on the development of services.  This group's work will include a review of the role played by palliative care services and the hospice movement throughout the country in respect of cancer patients and set out recommendations for their future development as part of an integrated service to cancer patients.  When the proposals of the review group are to hand, I will be in a position to decide on priority areas for development within the palliative care service and hospice movement as a whole.</P>

      <P>As the Minister knows, I welcomed his commitment to prioritise services for cancer patients while Minister for Health and I support all his efforts.  I welcome the review group because we need to set out clearly where we are going.  Does the Minister intend on receiving a report from the group, to create a permanent national co-ordinating body which would draw up and continually review and update guidelines and recommendations on the development of palliative care nationally, including in-care, home care and day care?</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> When the report is complete, I intend to study it and formulate proposals which I will take to Government.  Depending on the amount of money available to me in the 1996 Estimates, I will draw up a programme for the implemenation of the report.  I addressed the annual meeting of the Irish Association for Palliative Care on 24 November.  It acts as a co-ordinating voluntary group and has a <Col N="328" /> good relationship with my Department. I intend to continue to allow that voluntary group act as a co-ordinator with the full support of the Department.</P>

Would the Minister accept that it would be much better if his Department, in conjunction with the health boards, worked out a policy whereby the essential services of the hospice movement and palliative care would be dealt with on an equitable basis to ensure the proper functioning of hospice care facilities throughout the country?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> As the Deputy is aware the hospice movement is driven by voluntary groups in different parts of the country who come together in a loose alliance to share information.  Because it is driven by the strength of voluntary groups in certain parts of the country, it is not possible to have an even regional distribution.  The Department and the health boards match funds to back up the voluntary effort.  However, I am aware of the need and demand for palliative care; its availability is part of the health strategy.  I hope I will be in a position to refine policy on the area as soon as the report of the review group on cancer services comes to hand and ensure that palliative care facilities are directed towards people who are terminally ill with cancer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that the health boards have been trying to match the funding provided by local voluntary groups in each of the hospice areas.  However, the Minister must accept that there seem to be huge inequities in the system of providing finance to hospices.  A number of hospices have raised huge amounts of money through voluntary work &mdash; this is sometimes in the region of millions of pounds <Col N="329" />&mdash; and little or no money had been provided by the Department of Health through the health boards.  Would the Minister support the establishment of regional planning committees, involving the health boards, the voluntary agencies and the professionals involved in medical, nursing or other health care in hospices, to facilitate the removal of this inequity?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The hospice movement developed more quickly in some parts of the country than in others.  This was not due to Government policy operating on an unequal basis but rather the strength of voluntary organisations in places.  I would have no objection to any health board setting up co-ordinating committees along the lines the Deputy suggested. It is a good idea for health boards to have strong relationships with local voluntary organisations.  It is part of the health strategy that the direct funding arrangement that the Department of Health has with both the voluntary hospitals and the voluntary organisations would be devolved to the health boards.  The new relationships would be between the voluntary agencies, voluntary hospitals and the health boards rather than with the Department of Health.  The Deputy's suggestion is in line with Government policy.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> No, obviously I do not have any objection to equity.  However, the direction in which the health service is moving means that the health boards will have far more discretion over the allocation of resources paid to them by way of block grant.  The manner in which we grant aid to health boards will be equitable but, within their area of responsibility, the <Col N="330" /> health boards will have to make the decisions on funding.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The procedures to be used to investigate complaints or allegations against medical practitioners vary according to the category of doctor involved.  In the case of medical practitioners, other than medical consultants, who are employees of a health board, sections 22, 23 and 24 of the Health Act, 1970 apply.  In the case of medical consultants, the disciplinary and complaints procedures attaching to their contracts, in addition to sections 22, 23 and 24 of the Health Act, 1970 apply.  In the case of medical practitioners who are participating in the general medical services scheme, paragraphs 30, 31 and 32 of the agreement for the provision of services apply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to the above, the Medical Council has statutory responsibility which it exercises through its fitness to practice committee to inquire into the conduct of a registered medical practitioner, whether he or she is an employee of a health board or otherwise, on the grounds of alleged professional misconduct or on the grounds of unfitness to practice by reason of physical or mental disability.  Where the questions of fitness to practice of a registered medical practitioner arises, it is statutorily therefore a matter for the Medical Council to investigate.  I might add that where allegations of a criminal offence are made against a registered medical practitioner, this is a matter for <Col N="331" /> the Garda and the appropriate prosecuting authority.</P>
    <P>The Medical Practitioners Act, 1978 has now been in force for almost two decades.  An examination of the operation of the Act has revealed the need for substantial amendment of several of its provisions.  As indicated in reply to previous parliamentary questions, I hope to circulate the heads of the new legislation to my colleagues in the Government for their observations in the near future.  A Bill to amend the 1978 Act will be published shortly thereafter.</P>
    <P>I have had copies of these various provisions made available to the Deputy.</P>

If it had been indicated that the question would deal with specific cases I would have had the information to hand.  If the Deputy tables such questions I will answer them.  Sometimes complaints are made <Col N="332" /> to the Garda, or to the hospital authority or a health board.  We do not have a high incidence of complaints of alleged criminal offences committed by doctors.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> If there is a criminal offence certain obligations arise but if it is a question of unfitness to practice as a result of mental or physical disability the procedures are different. As regards somebody leaving the jurisdiction when they are the subject of investigation, the same procedure would apply as applies to anyone who is the subject of a Garda investigation.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Extradition could be sought in the normal way.  However, it would depend on the offence and on the extradition arrangements with the other country.  Cases of unfitness to practice are frequently due to mental or physical disability and would be adjudicated on by the Medical Council as it is the body with statutory responsibility for such issues.  If it were a criminal offence there would be a parallel approach.  The Garda would conduct a criminal investigation and the Medical Council would adjudicate on whether the person is fit to practice <Col N="333" /> regardless of the outcome of the Garda investigation.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East)</i>: There are procedures laid down under different sections of the Health Acts and under the contracts with consultants and medical practitioners.  It is time to update the Medical Practitioners Act, 1978.  As regards guidelines it depends on the incident which leads a party to believe that a medical practitioner is unfit to practice.  In the case of child sexual abuse the Minister of State, Deputy Currie, is proceeding to establish guidelines, for example, reporting to the Garda, and so on.  We have commenced an overview in the Department to ensure that there are standardised and easily understood procedures in place in areas where health services are delivered. Medical practitioners are one group of professional services providers but we must focus more widely than that as there are many service providers who would have contact with children both in care and living at home.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East)</i>: I am aware of the recent report from the Health Research Board which provides an analysis of some socio-demographic characteristics of drug misusers in the Dublin area in 1994.</P>
      <P>The main findings of the report indicate an increase of 5 per cent in the number presenting for treatment; the number of persons presenting for treatment for the first time increased by 34 per cent; almost 80 per cent of those in treatment were male; more than 80 per cent were unemployed; 60 per cent had left school with the minimum education; 92 per cent of those in treatment were in the 15 to 39 age bracket; 27 per cent of those receiving treatment lived in the north or south inner city; and 82 per cent of the clientele stated that an opiate was their primary drug of misuse;</P>
      <P>These statistics indicate that the profile of a drug misuser is very likely to be of a young male, unemployed, with limited education, living in the inner city area and with opiates as the primary drug of abuse.  This is a very worrying and tragic picture.  In addition, these facts suggest that the response to the drug problem has to be very wide ranging and involves many other agencies and organisations in addition to the health services.</P>
      <P>A further issue of concern which was not dealt with in the Health Research Board report is the high levels of crime associated with drugs and initiatives in this respect have been announced by my colleague, the Minister for Justice.</P>
      <P>As far as the health services are concerned there is a need to develop as a matter of urgency a comprehensive network of services in Dublin to respond to this growing problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most recent report from the Eastern Health Board indicates that approximately 800 people are awaiting treatment.  The board in consultation with my Department is addressing this issue as a matter of urgency.  A major component of the plan to eliminate these waiting lists is the establishment of community drug centres in local areas where the need for these centres has <Col N="335" /> been identified.  The most effective way to treat drug misusers is in their own locality where possible.  I am aware of opposition from local communities to the establishment of these centres.  I have asked the Eastern Health Board to approach the establishment of these centres with the utmost sensitivity and with the fullest consultation with the local community and I would appeal to such communities to help facilitate the provision of treatment facilities to drug misusers in their areas.</P>
    <P>In the fight against drugs the most effective weapon is education and prevention. In drug misuse prevention programmes, such as &ldquo;On My Own Two Feet&rdquo;, which was made available to second level schools in 1994, young people are given information on all drugs, but they are also trained to develop their assertiveness and decision-making skills so that they can resist drug offer situations.  The evaluation of this programme has proven it to be effective in changing young people's attitudes to drug misuse.  It is too early, however, to say how effective the programme is at influencing behaviour.</P>
    <P>Media campaigns can also be effective at getting a hard hitting message across to the public.  For this reason my Department's health promotion unit is working on possible themes for a major awareness campaign which will run early next year.  Because the nature and cause of drug misuse are complex, interventions, whether they involve education and training or clinical treatment, can be limited in their effectiveness without a concerted effort by all agencies, both statutory and voluntary, in addressing the problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply and agree that the report confirms we have a major drug problem, particularly in respect of teenagers who are increasingly caught up in the drugs culture.  I am concerned about the health element of the problem in the context of the number of young people <Col N="336" /> who present themselves for treatment. The report states the 30 per cent of drug addicts who present for treatment have stopped injecting.  What response is the Minister framing in respect of the remaining 70 per cent who presented for treatment but were unsuccessful in kicking the habit?  Does he agree that residential treatment centres would be more appropriate for stubborn cases. Young people could be taken out of the drug culture, put into residential treatment centres and then go back into the community where, with the help of proper support systems, they could be assisted in finally breaking the habit. Does the Minister agree that residential treatment would be more appropriate for the 70 per cent of addicts who presented for treatment but were not cured?</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> As the Deputy is aware, the hard drugs problem affects mainly the greater Dublin area.  It also affects most UK and other major cities in the world.  One cannot take a remedy from a shelf and claim it will solve the problem in any area and it is in that context we are approaching the problem.

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> If we could expand that treatment through community clinics and wider dispensation by general practioners, we could then attack the waiting list problem. Residential accommodation is also required.  We doubled the number of detoxification beds in Dublin this year by opening new facilities in Cherry Orchard Hospital.  Some of the addicts who avail of the six week detoxification programme revert to their old habits. Similar arguments could be made about whether the treatment of alcoholism should be done on a residential or community basis.  One system may work in some cases and not in others.  Under <Col N="337" /> both systems there would be breakdowns and regressions.  We can only endeavour to push the matter forward, ensure that facilities are available for those who require them and operate best practice.  I appeal to local communities to allow us operate what is essentially a health programme.  While I acknowledge the Deputy is inquiring about the health strategies available to drug addicts, it should be noted that the main problem arises on the supply side in that drug pushers and dealers actively encourage young people to become addicted to enable them broaden their customer base.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The problem of hard drug abuse, particularly heroin, affects mainly the greater Dublin area.  I am not claiming that people in other parts of the country do not take hard drugs, but in so far as the question of a significant number of addicts living in a locality is concerned, the problem affects mainly the Dublin area.  We are also concerned with the health problems associated with ecstasy and cannabis, the abuse of which is more common in other parts of the country.</P>
      <P>I have negotiated proposals with the Eastern Health Board and the management structure of the group dealing with the problem has been changed.  Through the Eastern Health Board we have good contacts with local communities and I have devised a programme for which I will seek funding in the Estimates to enable us expand the services in 1996.</P>

Early in the new year we propose to put in place a health promotion programme which will focus on the drugs problem in general but particularly on ecstasy, so that young people are aware of the damage it can cause to their health.  I agree the problem is widespread and not one affecting only large cities.  Children, parents and teachers must be given information to enable them educate young people to make proper decisions about substance abuse.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. O'Shea)</NameTxt>
      <P>Many persons with a mental handicap were admitted in the past to psychiatric hospitals who would not be admitted to such hospitals <Col N="339" /> today.  It has been the policy of my Department for some 15 years that persons with a mental handicap should not be admitted to psychiatric hospitals unless they have an underlying psychiatric disorder which cannot be appropriately treated elsewhere.  The report of the Review Group on Mental Handicap Services <i>Needs and Abilities,</i> 1991, endorsed this policy and recommended that an assessment be carried out of the circumstances and needs of each person with a mental handicap in the psychiatric hospitals.  If the assessment indicated that the person with a mental handicap no longer needed care in a psychiatric setting, the report recommended that he or she should transfer to a mental handicap service.</P>
      <P>The latest statistics available indicate that there were 915 persons with a mental handicap accommodated in public psychiatric hospitals on 31 December 1994.  This compares with 2,170 persons in 1981.  My Department, in conjunction with the health boards, has been engaged in a programme to transfer persons with a mental handicap from phychiatric hospitals and other unsuitable placements to more appropriate care settings.</P>
      <P>In 1994, additional funding of £785,000 revenue and £1.16 million capital was provided to transfer over 150 persons with a mental handicap from unsuitable settings.  Over 120 of these had been resident in psychiatric hospitals.  Included in this funding was £121,000 to assist with the extra revenue costs associated with the transfer of 30 persons with a mental handicap from St. Finan's Hospital, Killarney, to purpose build residential and day facilities in Killarney.  Planning permission has recently been received for this development and building work will commence shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1995, additional funding amounting to £600,000 revenue and £1.195 million capital has been provided to facilitate the transfer of 64 persons with a mental handicap from inappropriate care settings of whom 36 persons are <Col N="340" /> currently accommodated in psychiatric hospitals.  Included in the capital funding is an initial allocation towards the cost of providing purpose built residential and day facilities for a further 36 persons with a mental handicap from St. Joseph's Hospital, Limerick.  Discussions on this project are currently taking place with the Mid-Western Health Board.</P>
    <P>Where persons with a mental handicap continue to be cared for in psychiatric hospitals, health boards are encouraged to care for them in separate accommodation and to develop programmes of activity suited to their needs.  The reduction in the number of persons with a mental handicap in psychiatric hospitals has enabled hospital management to increase the staff-client ratio and to reduce the numbers accommodated in the various units to the benefit of the remaining clients.</P>
    <P>I am committed to continuing the programme of transfers of persons with a mental handicap from psychiatric hospitals to more appropriate settings as resources permit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Moffatt</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a perception that not enough is being done for the mentally handicapped, that they are second class citizens in receipt of second class treatment from the health boards and the Department of Health.</P>
      <P>Although the numbers have decreased in the past 15 years there are still more than 900 persons with a mental handicap in psychiatric hospitals, some of whom should be transferred to more appropriate settings in the community. This does not augur well for the success of the programme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>If sufficient resources were available, we would like to see all the persons concerned removed immediately, if possible, from their present settings.  The policy pursued by the Department for the past 15 years was endorsed by the report <i>Needs and Abilities.</i> Money is not always the first obstacle to be overcome, it depends on the number of persons in a particular <Col N="341" /> setting to be transferred.  Other factors, such as capital funding, the appropriate location for the persons concerned and staffing requirements, have to be taken into consideration.  Much has been achieved, which is not to minimise the problem confronting us.  During the summer I visited a number of settings. This year under the programme of transfers 100 persons in a number of health boards areas will be transferred. I would like to see this problem resolved, but we have to operate within the available resources.</P>

      <P>Despite what the Minister of State said problems are still being encountered.  If it was any other sector but the mentally handicapped, the matter would have been dealt with more expeditiously.  A number of severely handicapped persons are still being accommodated in inappropriate psychiatric units.  Little progress has been made in placing these patients in on campus special units where they would receive a high standard of care.  Will special funding be made available in the forthcoming budget?  I am alluding especially to the position which prevails at St. Ita's, Portrane, where the patients are not getting a fair deal.  This is disgraceful.</P>

      <P>I disagree with the Deputy's final comment although I agree that St. Ita's is an appropriate setting. When I visited the hospital during the summer I was greatly impressed by the standard of care provided by the staff in difficult circumstances.  This year £560,000 has been provided to place 24 persons at present in ward K in more appropriate settings.  The numbers are high &mdash; this should not deter us &mdash; but we have to operate within the available resources.  In this context worthwhile progress has been made at St. Ita's this year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Community ophthalmic services are provided free of charge by health boards to eligible persons.  The persons eligible are pre-school and national school children, in respect of defects discovered at child health or school health examinations, and persons in eligibility Category I, medical card holders and their dependants.</P>
      <P>Ophthalmic services are provided by health boards through hospitals and ophthalmologists directly employed by the boards or through the adult sight testing scheme.  Under this scheme ophthalmologists, ophthalmic medical practitioners and ophthalmic opticians in private practice who have entered into agreement with the boards examine eligible patients in their private practice premises and provide spectacles as appropriate.</P>
      <P>This year the health boards will spend over £6 million on the provision of community ophthalmic services.  All the boards operate a system which affords priority to applicants with special needs, such as persons with medical conditions, and every effort is made to ensure that urgent cases are processed without delay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="343" /> As the Deputy will be aware, I made available an additional £750,000 this year to health boards for the provision of ophthalmic services to adults on their waiting lists.  Allocations were made having regard to the information supplied to me by the boards in relation to waiting lists and other relevant factors. The additional moneys I have provided should result in about 15,000 medical card holders being removed from the waiting lists for sight testing services and supply of spectacles.  While the provision of this special funding in 1995 will make a significant impact on services for medical card holders I am concerned to ensure that ophthalmic services are provided to medical card holders within a reasonable period of time.  To this end my Department will continue to liaise with the health boards and the appropriate professional organisations with a view to developing the services further.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  He will be aware that the scheme has a public and private dimension. The public dimension has resulted in substantial waiting lists in seven of the eight health board areas.  The private dimension takes the form of an <i>ad hoc</i> scheme whereby health boards may employ private opticians at their discretion to reduce the substantial waiting lists.  I am concerned that some health boards seem to opt in or out of this private scheme on an annual basis and fail to provide continuous service to the people within their catchment areas.</P>
      <P>Is it possible for the Minister to request that all eight health boards employ private opticians to operate the eye testing scheme?  This would mean that equality of service would exist on a nationwide basis.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> My Department will continue to liaise with the health boards to provide the fullest possible service and eliminate waiting lists.  The Deputy tabled a question with regard to the waiting lists on a previous <Col N="344" /> occasion.  He will be aware that money has been allocated to the health boards, some of it as recently as September last. The Western Health Board, for example, received an allocation of £100,000.  As a result, the waiting lists in Counties Mayo and Roscommon have been completely cleared and 50 per cent of the waiting list in County Galway has been cleared.  Progress has been made in recent months, but I would like this to be sustained into 1996.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted with the Minister's answer.  I was not aware of that information.  I am pleased it has been made available to the House.  I tabled this question as a result of information I previously received, which indicated that the period of time spent by people on the Eastern Health Board's waiting list was only three months.  This is a tolerable position. However, in many of the other health board areas the length of time was a minimum of 12 months &mdash; in certain cases 36 or 38 months.  In the Western Health Board area it was 36 months.  I understand from the Minister's reply nobody remains on that waiting list as a result of the allocation of £100,000, a very small sum of money.  This represents tremendous progress for the publicly funded scheme.  The people involved deserve congratulation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Minister to continue to monitor this scheme because the level of performance appears to vary quite dramatically on an annual basis.  As I have stated, it is the responsibility of the chief executive officers of the health boards to decide whether private opticians will be used.  I ask the Minister to monitor this because it is suggested that medical card patients &mdash; primarily the elderly &mdash; have their eyes tested every two years.  He will appreciate that if elderly people do not have their eyes tested regularly, more serious eye conditions may result.  Such conditions would absorb considerably more money than the £11 cost of an eye test.  Regular eye testing can prevent the further development of serious conditions and <Col N="345" /> prevent further absorption of the Department's resources.  Perhaps the Minister's officials might consider the scheme in greater detail&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The Midland Health Board was is in a better position and therefore only received £30,000. The Mid-Western Health Board received £50,000 because its waiting list was not as long as others.  The North-Eastern Health Board received £85,000; the North-Western Health Board, £75,000; the South-Eastern Health Board, £75,000; the Southern Health Board, £85,000; and the Western Health Board, £100,000.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Such referrals have taken place on a small scale.  In terms of ophthalmology and ENT services, a number of patients have been referred from the North-Western Health Board and the North Eastern Health Board for attention in Northern Ireland.  The Deputy will be aware that patients from County Cork were sent for orthopaedic treatment to <Col N="347" /> Belfast as part of the waiting list initiative.</P>
      <P>Many Deputies have brought to my attention the fact that quite a large waiting list exists for people awaiting cardiac surgery.  I am currently engaged in negotiations with service providers, here and in Belfast, in an attempt to shorten that waiting list before the end of this year. If I am satisfied with that agreement, in terms of quality and price, it will represent another initiative undertaken by my Department.  The service will not be provided exclusively outside the State in Northern Ireland.  Some cardiac facilities in the South with spare capacity will be given the option to compete on the basis of a tendering system.  The arrangement is almost in place where a number of hospitals on this part of the island and a hospital in Belfast will participate in reducing waiting lists for cardiac surgery.</P>

Now that the straitjacket has been removed in relation to treatment outside the State, particularly with regard to cardiac surgery &mdash; the waiting list for which is quite long, sometimes too long for those seeking treatment &mdash; does the Minister intend to consider the area of experimental treatment outside the State?  Such treatment is not available within the State and is sometimes unorthodox. Nevertheless, people in desperate situations are quite prepared to try it.  Is the Minister prepared to consider such treatment?  In the past, the answer was firmly negative because such treatment was unorthodox, unavailable within the State and considered not to be of benefit to the individual patient involved.  I am glad to see that the Department's position has changed in relation to other treatment outside the State.  Will the Minister make a statement in relation to experimental treatment?</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Deputy O'Donnell will be receiving a written reply today to a question she tabled regarding the public cardiac surgery waiting list and the use of facilities in Belfast and in public and private hospitals in Dublin.  I refer Deputies to that reply because, having tabled the question, Deputy O'Donnell is entitled to receive the information first.  The policy is that services in the State should be geared to meet our needs.  This initiative will not be a permanent feature of cardiac surgery; it is simply aimed at reducing waiting lists while facilities here are prepared.</P>
      <P>With regard to the second issue raised by Deputy Lynch, the Deputy is moving into a different area.  Deputies will be aware that where a particular treatment is not available within the State, health boards will &mdash; under certain circumstances &mdash; fund patients to avail of it outside the State.  Sometimes if treatment is not available within the State, it tends to be new or experimental.  If it were routine it would be available here. The health boards have the discretion to decide on grant-aiding patients up to a level of £10,000.  If the financial requirement is greater than that figure, the case goes to the Department of Health for sanction.  That is totally different from the Department of Health buying items of service or for instance four hundred cardiac interventions from a hospital in Belfast.  It is a totally different scheme but I can provide the full guidelines to the second scheme mentioned by the Deputy.  However, the principles of it are as I have outlined.</P>

I trust the Minister does not intend that availability of services outside the State will be used as a device to delay appointments which would enable surgical operations to be carried out within the State?  While availability of the service in the North would serve patients in critical need of surgery, it would present enormous hardship to the families of cardiac surgery patients, who wish to be near their relatives when they are critically ill.  When will the Minister appoint the new board of Comhairle na nOspidéal which will enable a number of very necessary appointments, including the appointment of an oncologist in Cork? A number of key appointments are outstanding and cannot be made until the new board has been appointed.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The policy is to gear up the services to match domestic need.  The initiative on cardiac surgery involving a facility in Belfast is designed to cut waiting lists.  It arose from circumstances where there are some available funds at the end of this year.  I thought that was a good way to use them, but it will not be an ongoing scheme.  In terms of facilities being available, visits by relatives and so on, <Col N="350" /> patients for surgery will be selected from the northern half of the country, particularly the North-Western Health Board and North-Eastern Health Board areas.  The extra capacity in Dublin will be used for other areas.  This is a once-off initiative and will not be a routine part of the delivery of services.  On the question of Comhairle na nOspidéal, the Deputy's colleague.  Deputy Clohessy, has a separate question on that matter.  I will appoint the board shortly.</P>

      <Quest>the steps, if any, he is taking to redress the discrimination in the existing adoption law against a birth mother which requires her to adopt her own child upon marriage so that the birth certificate reflects the fact that she is the natural mother of the child.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Currie)</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to cases where the mother of a child born outside marriage and her husband, who is not the father, wish to share parental rights to the <Col N="351" /> child.  As the law stands, the only way in which they can have joint rights is by adopting the child.  Such an adoption terminates the mother's natural relationship with the child, and she and her husband are regarded in the eyes of the law as the adoptive mother and adoptive father of the child.  If the husband were to adopt the child on his own, this would have the effect of terminating the mother's legal rights with respect to the child.</P>
      <P>I am aware that some mothers are unhappy about the present situation and would prefer if their original parental relationship could continue to be recognised. However, providing for an alternative procedure for the exercise of joint parental rights in such cases would be a major legislative undertaking.  It would involve substantial amendments to existing adoption law and might also necessitate changes in the law on guardianship.</P>
      <P>As I have previously indicated to the House, my absolute priority in the adoption area is the preparation of amending legislation to address the issues raised in the judgment of the European Court of Human Rights in the case of Keegan <i>v</i> Ireland.  This involves giving the fathers of non-marital children a greater say in the adoption process.  My Department is currently preparing legislative proposals in this regard.</P>

Perhaps there should be a short delay to include Deputy Woods' proposal rather than incorporate the Keegan <i>versus</i> Ireland decision and put off for many years discussing the subject matter we are discussing.</P>

      <P>I agree with much of what the Deputy has said but not with her use of the word &ldquo;equally&rdquo;.  As I made clear, the Keegan case must be dealt with as a matter of priority.  The Deputy is right that this would present a major legislative undertaking in that substantial amendments would have to be made to the Adoption Acts and it might also be necessary to amend the law on guardianship, for which the Department of Equality and Law Reform has primary responsibility.  Last year, of the 424 adoption orders made by the Adoption Board 184, or 43 per cent, were in respect of children adopted by their natural mothers with their husbands who were not the fathers.  These cases, known as pre-marital adoptions, account for a significant proportion of the total number of adoption applications received by the board each year. I give those figures to illustrate that the numbers are quite large and that there are a number of satisfied customers.</P>

      <Quest>the new regulations, if any, the Government proposes to introduce to protect children in care in view of the series of scandals involving the sexual and physical abuse of children while in residential care centres such as Madonna House; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[18162/95]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>While I share the Deputy's concern about recent revelations of abuse of children in residential <Col N="353" /> care, it is important that we should not lose sight of the excellent work being performed by residential care staff, the vast majority of whom are above reproach and share our revulsion at what has happened.  Having said that I assure the House that a number of measures have been and are being taken to try to guard against the abuse of children in residential care.</P>
      <P>I recently made regulations under the Child Care Act in relation to the placement by health boards of children in residential care.  These regulations came into force on 31 October 1995 at the same time as 44 sections of the Act were brought into operation.  The new regulations set down requirements regarding adequate and suitable accommodation, food and care for children, the regular visiting, supervision and review of children in residential centres and the proper conduct of these centres.</P>
      <P>In particular, the regulations require each health board to satisfy itself that adequate arrangements are in place at each residential centre to guard against the risk of injury and for the reporting and recording of accidents and injuries affecting children residing there; to satisfy itself that procedures are in place for the prompt notification to the board of significant events affecting children placed there by the board; to monitor standards in each residential centre and ensure that the centre is visited from time to time by an authorised person; to arrange for the supervision of children placed in residential centres by the board, it requires that a child be visited as often as may be necessary, but the maximum intervals between visits will be three months during the first two years of the placement and six months thereafter; to arrange for the periodical review of each child placed in a residential centre.  Reviews will be carried out at intervals not exceeding six months during the first two years of the placement and thereafter at least once in each calendar year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to the regulations, my Department has also circulated a Draft <Col N="354" /> Guide to Standards in Children's Residential Centres.  This provides advice to all agencies concerned with the provision of residential care for children on the standards which should obtain in such centres.  The guide addresses a range of issues relating to residential care and pays particular attention to the need to ensure that children in care are not exposed to any risk of abuse.  The guide highlights the importance of agreed child protection procedures for residential centres which would define policy in relation to the prompt reporting and investigation of any suspicions or allegations of abuse or neglect of children while in residential care. Such a policy would also ensure that staff are equipped with the necessary skills to recognise and deal with any signs of symptoms associated with bullying, scapegoating, harassment or abuse.</P>
    <P>I should also mention that new directions have been issued in relation to the recruitment and selection of staff for children's residential centres.  Under these directions employers must obtain Garda clearance on all staff being considered for appointment to a children's residential centre.  These directions have recently been extended to include the recruitment of staff to any area of the health services where they would have substantial access to children or vulnerable individuals.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for his reply and I agree with his tribute to those who have given good service to children in need of care down the years.  Children in need of care are our most vulnerable citizens and those to whom we, as policy makers, have the greatest obligation.  I note the Minister of State said he issued instructions regarding the appointment of new staff and additional staff to residential care centres, but has he plans to introduce a screening programme for existing staff in such centres?  Some of the most horrific abuses have been to young people already in care and such evidence has emerged in a drip feed pattern in the past number of years.  I refer specifically <Col N="355" /> to the introduction of a screening programme for existing staff to ascertain their suitability to be left in charge of those most vulnerable young people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not agree more with the Deputy's emphasis on the importance of doing everything possible to look after the interests of those most vulnerable children.  That is why I have repeatedly emphasised that the needs of the child is the paramount consideration and must take priority over others.  As I outlined, we have done a considerable amount in recent times to ensure that with the introduction of the new regulations, the Draft Guide to Standards in Children's Residential Centres and the new directions regarding the recruitment and selection of staff for children's residential centres.  The emphasis is being put on new employees entering the service and the co-operation of the Garda to minimise and, if possible, to eliminate any inherent risks.</P>
      <P>Regarding existing employees, all the new regulations introduced will ensure constant monitoring of such staff.  Needless to say, staff about whom there might be the slightest suspicion would be watched very carefully and, hopefully, are no longer in the service. However, the monitoring system in place is so tight that I hope any fears the Deputy or I may have in that regard will be eliminated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister satisfied that sufficient resources are in place to enable the type of systematic monitoring he described?  In the light of the litany of horrific stories that have emerged, will the Minister tell the House how many, if any, people have been removed from their posts in residential care centres during the past two or three years?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>The last part of the Deputy's question is a separate matter.  While I pride myself on the interest I take on these matters, I would prefer to give accurate information to the House.  If <Col N="356" /> the Deputy would like to table a separate question on the matter, I will ensure a reply is provided.</P>
      <P>Regarding the first part of the Deputy's question relating to resources, if anybody offered me, as Minister in charge of child care, twice or three times the amount of money I am currently allocated, I would be delighted to accept it, but I am satisfied that the Government is giving a sufficiently high priority to this matter to ensure the necessary resources are being and will be made available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State has consistently said here and outside the House that the lead role in all matters relating to child care must be taken by his Department.  In the interests of accuracy the Minister of State will remember that he kindly answered a parliamentary question I tabled some time ago indicating that the child care section is one of the smallest units in his Department.  Does he consider that the resources of that section are sufficient to give the lead and provide the main monitoring requirements of the existing sections of the Child Care Act and the implementation of the additional 44 sections since 31 October last?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied that the number of staff in the child care unit in my Department at present is sufficient to do the job they have been given. While the Department of Health has the lead role in respect of child care, the health boards are involved and there <Col N="357" /> has been a considerable increase in the number of people available to carry out the necessary tasks.  For example, 750 additional people have become available in the child care services area over the last three years and almost 400 people became available in the past year so there has been a substantial increase, not only in resources but in terms of those who carry out the new functions which have been provided.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East)</i>: There is a number of reasons for a delay in appointing the board.  I did not have all the nominations from nominating bodies initially and working it out after that is a complicated jigsaw.  There are 27 on the board, 14 of whom must be consultants. In line with policy in equality and law reform, 40 per cent must be women. I have an obligation to spread its membership regionally through different health boards and I want to include some of the major hospitals also.  By the time one does the shuffling, it is quite an intricate piece of work.  Anyone could appoint the first 20 people but when it gets down to the last seven, one must ensure it fits all the criteria and that we get the best possible board which will work together.  It takes some time and I would prefer to reflect on it and have it right with the fullest consultations rather than rush my fences.

    <P>The Minister has made a major commitment to cancer treatment and women's health and I applaud him for it.

Cork has been <Col N="359" /> waiting for months for the appointment of an oncologist.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Health</askee>
      <Quest>if he has consulted with the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry or An Bord Glas following the report from the Nutrition Advisory Group on the low consumption of fruit and vegetables in Ireland in comparison with other EU countries.</Quest>
      <QRef>[17939/95]</QRef>

    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department is undertaking a widespread consultation <Col N="361" /> about the recently published report from the Nutrition Advisory Group. This involves the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry and An Bord Glas, among many others and will address issues such as the consumption levels of fruit and vegetables raised by the Deputy, I would add, however, that my Department is already engaged in promoting increased consumption of fruit and vegetables through its health promotion activities.</P>
      <P>The health eating guidelines recommend the consumption of at least four portions of fruit and vegetables every day.  This has been successfully demonstrated by the use of the food pyramid in recent years which, as the Deputy will be aware, places a strong emphasis on the importance of fruit and vegetables in a balanced diet.  My Department's Health Promotion Unit is in regular contact with all the relevant food agencies including An Bord Glas, in the context of ongoing healthy eating initiatives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Having regard to all the booklets and pamphlets which the Department and health boards produced on better healthy eating habits over the years outlining the benefit this would have on people's health, especially children in their formative years, and on the economy which produces these products, is it not regrettable that according to the EU Ireland eats the least amount of fruit and vegetables?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly, where on average only 30 per cent of the population eat the recommended four or more servings of fruit and vegetables and with nearly 40 per cent eating less than two servings per day, that is a situation about which we cannot be happy or complacent from a health point of view. The report which gave rise to the Deputy's question has been circulated to the Departments of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Education, the Marine, Enterprise and Employment, Tourism and Trade, the trade board, Forfás, <Col N="362" /> An Bord Bia and An Bord Glas on the basis that they come back to us within three months, i.e., by 29 February 1966.</P>
      <P>I take the Deputy's point on board. In the context of healthy eating week, a particular theme is selected each year. This year's theme was to eat more potatoes, bread and cereals.</P>
      <P>In the context of next year's theme, bearing in mind what the Deputy has said, we will look at the possibility of having fruit and vegetables as the theme for that week.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The publication of the Book of Estimates will be decided upon when the Estimates discussion is completed, in other words when it is ready, as I said on previous occasions.  So far as the Appropriations Bill is concerned, it will be published as normal, after all Supplementary Estimates have cleared the House.  One cannot publish the Appropriations Bill until the Supplementary Estimates have cleared the House.  Arrangements are being made to process Estimates next week.  I hope the Appropriations Bill will be published immediately thereafter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Everybody in the House will be aware of the reason we are concerned about this.  It has been <Col N="469" /> the practice for many years that the Estimates are debated in the last weeks of the session but never later than the final week of the session.  Normally, the Opposition &mdash; as the Taoiseach will be aware from the time he was Leader of the Opposition &mdash; would have the Book of Estimates for some time.  The Appropriations Bill is often used as the vehicle for the debate.  It is very difficult for us to plan for a debate on the Estimates if we do not know when we will get the Book of Estimates.  Will we have a debate on the Estimates?  Will the Book of Estimates be published before the end of the session?  In what order will the Estimates be taken?  It would help if the Taoiseach could tell the Opposition what he is planning in the financial affairs of the country.</P>

      <P>When I spoke on the Bill previously I outlined how tuberculosis had been brought under medical control, how people were protected from it and how it had been eradicated in humans.  However, having spent £1 billion or more we have not eradicated it completely in animals, although 99 per cent of our herds are free from it. The time has come for a critical analysis with a view to arriving at a conclusive decision.</P>
      <P>The Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry has great experience in veterinary science and administration.  It has had the advice and support of Teagasc, the veterinary organisations, the science departments in universities and the European Union.  It has collaborated also with experts in the United Kingdom.  What progress has been made in the implementation of a standard blood test to prove conclusively that bovine TB is present?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Obviously problems arise because three vaccines are being used; while each vaccine is up to the required veterinary science standard, animals, like humans, can react differently to different vaccines.  Consequently, if we are not able to introduce the blood test very <Col N="480" /> soon, we must introduce a standardised vaccine.</P>
    <P>For the past 14 years I have served as a public representative but prior to that I worked for 14 years with Galway, Mayo and Clare marts.  When representing constituents my colleagues and I are extremely frustrated at the Department's attitude.  The tests on animals may prove inconclusive or there may be a doubt about the animal's reaction but herd owners are then told they will not get another test until the animal has been removed from the herd.  I have intervened but failed to get the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry to agree to another test.  I spent until 1 a.m. in the morning negotiating on behalf of a constituent with the Department, but it would not accede to the farmer's request.  The farmer did not concede but eventually got a test after a 15 months' delay and no reactor was found in his herd.  Subsequently the farmer took a case against the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry and the Department took a counter case but, before the case went to court, the Department capitulated and withdrew its case.  Its credibility as well as mine was thrown out the window.  That is no way to treat a public representative or the person who owns the animal but it is part of the bureaucracy of State agencies, and local authorities.</P>
    <P>The discretion to take legal cases rests with the permanent bureaucracy which takes no cognisance of the service to be delivered to the public.  Another farmer who had reactors in his herd was ordered to depopulate it.  His forward store animals were taken to the former Hal A1 factory in Ballyhaunis where they were slaughtered but he was paid for weanlings.  He disputed the weights, the dispute is ongoing, but the Department has not made available the <i>de facto</i> information and documentation that is necessary for that farmer to be satisfied that he was treated equitably. Hal A1 has gone out of business and the Department of Agriculture, Food and <Col N="481" /> Forestry is washing its hands of it but it expects this small farmer who lives in the southern end of my constituency to try to survive on his small fragmented farm and bear this major loss.  That farmer is now in severe financial difficulty and the Department has not made him a satisfactory offer.</P>
    <P>If we are to progress we must have conclusive proof that the badger is to blame as on many occasions the Department has been very slow to accept the evidence of research in this area. Decisions have been taken, badgers eliminated and TB eradicated in those areas without scientific evidence to provide conclusively that badgers are the culprits.  The information held by the Department on behalf of farmers in such areas is not made available to them which is unfair and discriminatory.  Any information pertaining to a farmer or his lands, whether of an administrative, scientific or other nature should be made available to him on request.  The Department's failure to do so demonstrates that it is not operating an open book policy or delivering a fair and equitable service to all our farmers.</P>
    <P>We purchase approximately three million cattle eartags annually costing on average £400,000 &mdash; a large industry. I made representations to the Department on behalf of a small, indigenous company that contended it could do a better job on the provision of eartags than an international company that had been supplying them.  The small company spent up to £50,000 on research and development, on various trials nationwide, and had the full support of other Government Departments and State agencies like Teagasc, who carried out trials on their behalf and was in constant direct consultation with the Department.  At no stage did the company or I consider it would not be in the running for the tender for such eartags. However, the existing international company that had been supplying them tendered and was granted the contract for their supply.  The indigenous company and I were informed that the <Col N="482" /> European Union was considering introducing electronic tagging of cattle in future.  We were told also that in future pigs and sheep would be tagged by farmers; in other words, the Department would not be involved.</P>
    <P>That small, indigenous company could not afford to expend £50,000 on research into a product not knowing the exact parameters within which it had to operate.  If it had known electronic tagging was being proposed, it would probably not have expended that amount engaging in research.  Although its tender was commensurate with top British and Irish production standards for the supply of the requisite eartags, it was treated very shabbily.  In addition, the funds it expended on the requisite research and development must have been of benefit to the Department which, in turn, proposed major improvements in the existing eartagging scheme. The Department has that documentation on file, yet the company concerned received no recompense for its research and development in tendering to compete with the major international company already holding a monopoly within the European Union market.</P>
    <P>The Department of Agriculture operates on the basis of having a specific function to perform and not on the basis of the totality of a national contribution in collaboration with other State agencies and Departments.  This is in marked contrast to the policy of some semi-State agencies, such as the ESB and others who obtain valuable contracts for this country in international markets who then identify indigenous companies that can supply goods and services to those foreign markets as subcontractors. The same attitude should prevail within Government Departments irrespective of whether they have a brief in any given circumstance.  When an opportunity presents itself, is should be recognised for what it is, ensuring our innovative suppliers can supply almost all the goods and services we require.</P>
    <P>I was extremely disappointed at the attitude of the Department of Agriculture in not alerting that company to <Col N="483" /> the fact the EU proposed a change in the method of tagging, in addition to its continued use of the services of the monopolistic international company that had been supplying such eartags.  I hope this will be thoroughly examined by the Minister and that he will ensure transparency in future, any changes proposed being notified to farmers and others well in advance and any companies tendering for such products receiving adequate prior notice.  There is no point in fulfilling European Union directives in the spirit unless they are also interpreted in domestic and international law.</P>
    <P>As a member state of the European Union, Ireland has a right to veto decisions on subsidiarity, which should be exercised on some occasions even if it means risking the wrath occasioned by future decisions that may be taken by the European Commission or courts, thus fulfilling our role as positive members.</P>
    <P>After so many years of endeavours by the Department of Agriculture to eliminate TB, we should be able to reduce its incidence to 0.01 per cent of our national herd.  In addition, the Department must reach a conclusive decision on research and on the future criteria to be applied so that farmers, veterinary surgeons, consumers and international markets, will be fully aware that our standards are of the highest calibre and that our farmers and domestic and international consumers are made fully aware that our livestock, when slaughtered, is commensurate with the best to be found anywhere else worldwide.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>Unlike many other Members, my perspective of the eradication of bovine tuberculosis is somewhat different since, over the past 20 years or so, I have been associated with the veterinary profession and in the education of its practitioners.  No doubt most other Members view the operations of the scheme from the farmers' viewpoint.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="484" /> The eradication of bovine tuberculosis has proved exceptionally difficult. I was interested to hear Deputy Treacy contrast the eradication of bovine tuberculosis with its incidence among humans.  Perhaps it is worth making the point that its incidence has not been eliminated in humans and although, fortunately, it is still quite small in developed countries such as ours, it has increased marginally in recent years and remains a very difficult problem in some developing countries worldwide.</P>
    <P>When talking about the incidence of bovine tuberculosis, we must bear in mind the many other problems in life which are very difficult, if not almost impossible to resolve.  In that respect it was noteworthy that Deputy Treacy referred to a target incidence of 0.01 per cent, probably as high an attainable target as is possible within economic constraints. As all such objectives have an economic cost it leads one to question how much people are prepared to expend on attaining any such goal and whether such effort is warranted</P>
    <P>The eradication scheme has been a source of controversy over very many years.  It is good to note the Minister is taking an initiative designed to improve the position overall although, to some extent, constituting a step into the unknown, as it is impossible to predict with any degree of certainty whether it will be successful in Irish conditions; the reality is it has not been tried in Irish conditions.  The Minister has advanced many convincing, theoretical reasons for its being operable but, ultimately it is like any other experiment; we do not know its outcome in advance.</P>
    <P>Nonetheless it is important to approach the scheme in a positive frame of mind since it marks a fairly fundamental difference of approach &mdash; henceforth the farmer being responsible for the health of the herd.  Much of that responsibility was vested formerly in the veterinary surgeons working with the farmers.</P>
    <P>The ball is now very much in the farmer's court and it will be up to them to take a series of initiatives which were <Col N="485" /> not possible in the past.  This new scheme has much to recommend it in theory, but we will have to wait to see if it will work in practice.</P>
    <P>Regarding the practicalities of the scheme, I am glad to learn that meetings have been arranged for later this week between the Minister for the relevant officials in the Department and the veterinary practitioners to try to iron out the remaining difficulties.  It will be necessary to establish clear guidelines on how farmers will engage veterinary surgeons and organise the workload in a way that is acceptable to farmers and is also compatible with the capacity of veterinary practitioners to test animals. Quite a bit of work, mostly administrative and organisational, remains to be done, but I have no doubt that with goodwill on both sides a system can be worked out.</P>
    <P>What is happening now marks a fairly fundamental change which will present its own administrative challenges and difficulties. The aim of the scheme is to better tackle the disease by reference to market forces.  I am not too sure that in the case of the disease this will bring the desired results, but my attitude is that it should be given every chance.</P>
    <P>The scheme itself has been in operation since the 1950s.  Huge amounts of money have been spent but there is dissatisfaction at the incidence of bovine tuberculosis here.  It is very difficult to eliminate bovine tuberculosis in a country such as Ireland, and there are a number of reasons the incidence is so high. The levels of reporting are quite high and comparable to the best international standards.  That may be one reason the figures here do not compare favourably with those in other countries where there is not so well developed a system of reporting the incidence of disease.</P>
    <P>Another aspect relates to the very high level of tuberculosis which exists in wildlife, particularly in badgers &mdash; about 15 per cent of the badger population suffers from tuberculosis and some of that can be transferred to the bovine <Col N="486" /> population, yet the rate of tuberculosis in the bovine population is 0.3 per cent. I would not suggest for a moment that badgers should be eliminated as a means of dealing with this problem. What is needed is to eliminate tuberculosis from badgers rather than to eliminate badgers.  The fact that there is such a high incidence of tuberculosis in badgers creates its own problem among badgers and among wildlife generally.  I understand some progress is possible with the development of vaccine which it may be possible to get badgers and other wildlife to consume and in that way reduce the incidence of tuberculosis in the wildlife population.  The extent of the difficulty can be seen from the fact that in some areas the incidence of tuberculosis in wildlife is more than one hundred times as great as it is in the bovine population.</P>
    <P>It is also interesting that the incidence of the disease, while it is unacceptably high here and has given rise to enormous costs, is not that dissimilar to the levels in other parts of the world.  In parts of the United Kingdom, particularly parts of Somerset, which are similar from the point of view of climate, wildlife and environment generally, the incidence of tuberculosis in the bovine population compares to the levels existing here, as does the incidence in parts of New Zealand.  That is something we should keep in mind in formulating objectives to further reduce the disease. It must be remembered that some diseases are impossible to eliminate without incurring enormous cost.</P>
    <P>The scheme has been controversial in a number of ways over the years.  There is no doubt that there has been a significant amount of malpractice.  Economic pressures have encouraged some farmers to take short-cuts in handling the disease.  It cannot be denied that farmers changed tags on animals &mdash; I recollect court cases where people were convicted of this.  The length of time over which the test has to be carried out has resulted in economic pressures on farmers. That in turn led to demands for changes in the terms of the scheme.  In <Col N="487" /> some cases what we have seen is a conflict between economics and what would be ideal practice.  To be realistic we have to strike a balance between what is desirable in an ideal world and what is feasible and tolerable from an economic point of view.</P>
    <P>Some speakers criticised the bureaucracy of the administration of the scheme.  I have no doubt that it could have been better administered, but we live in an imperfect world and one has to learn as one progresses and hope that past difficulties can be eliminated.</P>
    <P>Much of the difficulty in dealing with this disease centres around the inadequacy of existing technologies.  The present test is quite imperfect.  It gives rise to false positives and false negatives. Some of the animals who suffer from TB do not test positive when subjected to the tuberculin test while some test positive when they are not infected with the disease.  That also creates difficulties. The elimination of the disease would be greatly facilitated by the development of a blood test similar to that for brucella.  The failure was in not putting enough investment into research to develop such a test which would have eliminated many of the problems that have existed.</P>
    <P>The second problem relates to the way Irish agriculture operates.  Most Irish cattle spend part of their lives on a series of farms.  The average Irish bovine is held on as many as six to ten farms in its lifetime.  There are few better ways of spreading infection than by sending animals on a tour of farms so that they can pick up infection, leave a residue of infection behind them and transfer it to other farms.  That is how Irish agriculture is organised, but it undoubtedly facilitates the transfer of disease and its proliferation.  It is difficult to handle but it merits more attention than it has been given.  The practice of buying infected animals has also been a source of proliferating this disease.  It is highly desirable that before animals are purchased by farmers they are tested to find out whether they are suffering from disease.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="488" /> I read the reply to a question tabled by one of our colleagues on the number of farmers, on a county by county basis, who organised for these tests to be carried out privately.  The numbers were very small and in the region of about ten farmers per county.  If that is the practice and people are prepared to go to marts and buy animals, there is an element of risk.  For commerical reasons, some of that is unavoidable but much more progress could have been made to curb the extent to which people buy infected animals and to which animals are transferred from place to place. It is an ideal way of spreading infection and merits much more attention than it has been given.</P>
    <P>Undoubtedly, the way forward not only involves initiative and a new approach to current technology but also depends on developing new technology. Quite an amount of research has been conducted here in the last five to ten years but virtually nothing was done prior to that.  When one thinks of the enormous sums spent on the scheme, it is appalling that virtually no research, quality control or development of new ideas and technology was undertaken to address the problem.  It is a great pity that much more effort was not made in the area.</P>
    <P>Matters have improved in recent years but we have lessons to learn from what happened.  There is scope for considerable progress but while farming practice regarding the transfer of animals from farm to farm remains unchanged it will be hard to make progress. We will also have huge difficulties while the technology for testing animals remains as it is.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Upton for a fine contribution on this topic.  I welcome any proposal to reduce levies paid by farmers and the incidence of animal disease which is a major scourge. I am happy that the Minister is more involved in consultation because his earlier disposition was towards confrontation. There has been particularly bad <Col N="489" /> feeling between the veterinary union and the Minister on this topic.</P>
      <P>Like other speakers I often wondered why a vaccine could not be made available to eradicate TB in animals as it has in people.  Deputy Upton pointed out that TB has not been totally eradicated in humans but is at a very low incidence. Why do we not spend more money on researching a vaccine?  Major scientific research is being conducted in New Zealand but they may still be five or six years away from finding a vaccine.  The result of proposals for research on the eradication of TB is that the Minister has established a committee.  This is not enough.  We must have research action. It is of major concern to me and my party that the Minister did not address this in his remarks.</P>
      <P>Administration costs are increasing. The Department's administration now accounts for one third of the cost of the scheme.  It is ironic that while we reduce farm levies, we see spiralling costs in the Department.  I hope the Minister will give us more details as to where these costs arise.  We have had many rows about public relations and increased administration costs in the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry and we do not get any answers.</P>
      <P>The Minister said some time ago that if we did not get rotation with testing, EU funds would not be available.  This is absolute nonsense.  There is money available but the Minister is not giving us detailed costing.  What is the position on the savings to farmers?  The Minister promised to reduce the farm levies, which is welcome, but this does not include the £14 million farmers will now pay to vets.  Is the Minister giving us the full information or is he underestimating the cost to farmers?  If these calculations are correct, the net saving to farmers is only £4 million.  These figures could be undermined by lack of competition in rural areas because of a shortage of vets.  No calculation has been made on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This privatisation scheme will hit small producers.  We all know what happens when privatisation occurs in rural <Col N="490" /> areas.  The most obvious example is the refuse service.  It is always difficult to get contractors to operate in sparsely populated areas and unfortunately the same situation pertains when one attempts to get veterinary surgeons to operate in rural areas.  The vets are calling this privatisation, and I have no problem with that.  I am sure the Fine Gael Party has no problem with it but I do not now know if the Labour Party and Democratic Left are totally happy with it.  We may have to introduce a compensation package or incentives to encourage vets to operate in remote rural areas.</P>
    <P>Privatisation and competition can result in great efficiency.  Last week's <i>Farmers Journal</i> contained two letters to the editor from veterinary surgeons in the west of Ireland.  They both mentioned that this privatisation could have serious effects on smaller producers. One veterinary surgeon in Boyle said that if the scheme is privatised it will leave worse off the small and medium sized producers, who account for 90 per cent of farmers in the Roscommon area. He said that as well as paying for the annual tests they will continue to pay for a pre-movement export test.  He asks why they are not represented and makes the point that perhaps many of them are not members of the farming organisations. He also says these farmers who will have to pay proportionately more will be affected and that the Minister is operating contrary to EU policy by penalising them.</P>
    <P>The second veterinary surgeon, from County Galway, said he will do quite well because he will not have to wait two months to be paid as happens now and will not have to pay the 25 per cent withholding tax which is currently deducted from his income at source.  He makes the point that privatisation would suit him.  Perhaps he will fall into the category of vets who will do nothing but TB testing and it would be disappointing if that were to happen in rural areas.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="491" /> He makes the point that if a veterinary surgeon has a good name for eradicating TB farmers will avail of his services and this could in fact lead to the spread of TB.  I do not say I agree with his view but it is an interesting comment on the scheme by a member of the Veterinary Union.</P>
    <P>We must ensure the small producer will benefit.  All farmers will contribute towards the cost of the measures but the small producer will pay proportionately more.</P>
    <P>The Department is in consultation with the veterinary surgeons and that is welcome.  There was a phoney war between them and I am glad that is over.  The bovine disease eradication scheme has been in existence for 41 years and millions of pounds have been spent on it.  Many experts argue that we are in the same position as 20 years ago but hopefully we will make progress now.</P>
    <P>The issue of badgers spreading TB is a contentious one.  Insufficient funding has been provided for research in this area.  The Minister said badger sets will be removed if necessary.  The Department is slow to give up to date information on the matter.  The Government intends to bring in a freedom of information Bill and the sooner it does so the better as it will enable us to find out what is happening in the various Departments.</P>
    <P>While the veterinary profession has an important role to play in TB eradication there is room for lay technicians under the scheme.  The matter caused industrial relations problems previously but perhaps such work could be carried out under the supervision of a veterinary surgeon.  EU funding will be provided irrespective of rotation testing and we must involve lay people if necessary.</P>
    <P>TB is not as prevalent in Northern Ireland and the reason may lie in what has been said about the movement of cattle.  There is also a very good computerisation and identification system in the North.  We should implement that <Col N="492" /> here as soon as possible.  It would be of great benefit not only in this area but as regards grant payments and so on. There is an excellent service in the Department of Social Welfare but that is not the case in the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that veterinary surgeons may only do TB testing and may not be available to provide other services required by a farmer.  That would be a serious matter.  Under the scheme a veterinary surgeon with a small practice may experience difficulties.  The existing system has not worked.  Perhaps we could compensate such veterinary surgeons in rural areas.</P>
    <P>Eolas has spent money trying to perfect the tag system.  Computerisation would help resolve problems that arise. Another area of wildlife which gives cause for concern is deer.  Deputy Leonard stated that testing had not been carried out on a deer farm in his county. On-farm hygiene and the quality of tests in laboratories must be investigated.  We realise the need to keep water and sewerage schemes free from pollution. However, the same priority is not given to the elimination of farm pollution and there is a backlog of grants to be paid. That type of on-farm investment is most important if animals are to be reared in a proper environment.</P>
    <P>One veterinary surgeon who wrote to the <i>Irish Farmers Journal</i> stated many small holders are not members of farming organisations.  Their concerns must be taken on board.  Such farmers may not be represented by Teagasc.</P>
    <P>I welcome the scheme and the fact that levies have been reduced.  The farming organisations are happy with it and there is broad consensus on what should be done in the future.  However, small producers may feel they are not represented under the scheme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill.  Bovine disease eradication has been ongoing in my county since 1954 when the area west of the Shannon was declared a &ldquo;clearance&rdquo;<Col N="493" /> area.  Despite much effort and considerable expense bovine TB is still a problem.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's frank admission that the target of a 50 per cent reduction set by ERAD has not been achieved.  The consensus is that while some progress can be made, final eradication will be possible only when new test vaccines for wildlife and movement control arrangements are in place. Pending the development of these two measures the emphasis must be on containing and reducing the incidence of disease and the cost of programmes.</P>
      <P>This is a new beginning.  I welcome the proposal to abolish the compulsory pre-movement test and the commitment to set up a comprehensive research programme aimed at curtailing the spread of TB by wildlife and to improve feedback to farmers who suffer a disease outbreak.  I know two farmers, whose lands adjoin, who have had reactors after more than 35 years free of TB. Four reactors were found in one herd and three in the other.  Those farmers were told they must have a clear 60 day test before selling stock, but when they sought the return of their livestock cards after that time they were informed that a further 90 day test was required.  They were not told, however, whether the infection was caused by a bought in animal, wildlife or otherwise.</P>
      <P>The Department should adopt a better public relations position in respect of farmers whose herds are affected.  They should be given detailed reports on whether TB is found in the animals after slaughter.  The Department's veterinary officer should also give his opinion on the cause of the outbreak.  Without the co-operation of farmers, veterinary surgeons and departmental staff, the objective of TB eradication will not be achieved.  A farmer whose herd has been clear for more than 35 years, on discovering an outbreak of TB in the heard, experiences the same trauma as if there were a death in the family.  His livelihood is at stake.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="494" /> I welcome the Bill and hope the proposals receive the support of all concerned. We must give the new scheme an opportunity to work.  Taxpayers, farmers and the EU can no longer pay out millions of pounds to control the disease.  I wish the Minister and his staff every success in controlling this terrible disease.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. H. Byrne Mr. H. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate. I am sure all farmers will welcome the proposed changes.  Farmers detest testing day.  Many people outside farming circles may not realise that it involves two days, the day on which the cattle are collected and injected and the day on which the veterinary surgeon returns to check if they have passed or failed. Most farmers have to present dairy and suckling cattle, yearlings, calves and weanlings for testing, all of which would be in individual paddocks during the summer months or in separate pens during the winter months.  All cattle must be confined in one area because veterinary surgeons will not go to different places on the farm to carry out the test. Cattle confined in this way become frightened and often run all over the place causing many difficulties for the farmers concerned.  If farmers had their way there would not be testing for TB.</P>
      <P>Another matter that contributes to the detest of testing day is the fear of not passing and this lasts from the day the farmer receives notification of the test until the veterinary surgeon returns to check the cattle three days after the test.  As Deputy Ring stated, an outbreak of TB in a cattle herd can be almost as devastating as a death in a family.  Therefore farmers would welcome any proposals to change the system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although all animals are moved approximately five times during their lifetimes and most land holdings are badly fragmented, our national herd has a clean, green image abroad.  A farmer's field could be surrounded by neighbouring lands which can mean cattle often intermix.  The Land Commission put forward proposals which would have enabled farmers to exchange lands and <Col N="495" /> keep their holdings together.  Perhaps we could reactivate those proposals and keep our clean, green image, for which farmers should be complimented.</P>
    <P>Many people in Germany, France and England want Irish beef on their supermarket shelves.  However, we have been affected by the tail wind of the incidence of mad cow disease in Britain in that there has been a 40 per cent reduction in our beef exports.  We have suffered at the hands of people here and abroad who do not care about the prosperity of our beef industry.  Some people will say almost anything to damage our clean image.  While the less we say about the mad cow disease scare the better, the 40 per cent reduction in our beef exports to Germany must be noted.  If the incidence of TB increases our beef industry will suffer further.  I was told recently that sheep scab is on the increase.  The Minister of State, Deputy Deenihan, will have a particular interest in this matter as it comes within his area of responsibility.  Sheep dipping is no longer compulsory.  Wexford had a proud record in the eradication of this disease.  When sheep dipping fees were payable activities at marts were monitored by the county councils, but this is no longer the case.  I understood that an appropriate scheme was to be introduced by the Department.</P>
    <P>The fact that the incidence of this disease is on the increase will not help our image.  I ask the Minister to introduce an appropriate scheme either to maintain the figures at previous levels or, preferably, reduce them.  I am not telling him what he must do to achieve this but, as in every other industry, there are cowboys in the farming sector.  I want to get at the people who care little about our image and think only in terms of earning the quick buck.</P>
    <P>The farmer does not object to paying fees.  If he believes that his produce will find its way onto supermarket shelves in Europe, he will be prepared to pay whatever it costs.  Problems can develop in the cattle sector, as in the case of the BSE scare.  In this context none of the blame should be attributed to this country.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="496" /> It is important that our image is maintained and, if possible, improved to protect our exports.  We export almost £1 billion worth of meat each year.  Live cattle exports amount to £250 million. A further £130 million worth of meat is produced for domestic consumption.  If our image was to be affected in any way, this would cause havoc in the industry. It appears the Minister is tampering with it to find favour with farmers. While I welcome recent developments, as a farmer I will try to ensure that our image is maintained.  I would like to think that everyone else will do the same but, as Deputy Upton said, we do not live in a perfect world.  As the beef sector accounts for 4 per cent of GDP and 10 per cent of net foreign exchange earnings, we must be careful not to play games or do anything that would harm our image to protect an industry which is of vital importance to us.</P>
    <P>Farmers danced with joy when they heard that the pre-movement test was to be done away with.  What were the arguments in favour of introducing it in the first instance?  Did it have any beneficial effect?  What is the reason for the sudden change?  Is it because the Minister is not going to deliver on his commitment in respect of the top-up premium for sheep in the near future that he wants to curry favour with farmers? Is he satisfied that by doing away with this test we can be guaranteed that levels will remain the same or be reduced?</P>
    <P>When buying or selling farmers are conscious of the status of their own herd.  There is no one more shrewd than the ordinary farmer who is selective in choosing the person from whom he will buy.  Heretofore he was sure that any animals for sale at the mart had been tested for TB, but now he will be cagey. What effect will this have on prices? Deputy Kitt referred to the small farmer who because of a bad harvest &mdash; most farmers in my constituency are engaged in mixed farming &mdash; is forced to sell his cattle to put bread on the table for his family and whose herd is locked up for a year.  I ask the Minister to give an <Col N="497" /> assurance that the proposed changes will not make a bad situation worse.</P>
    <P>There is a perception in non-farming circles that farmers are paid an adequate level of compensation and make money when cattle are removed from their herd and slaughtered under supervision, but this is not the case.  In some instances, despite having tested positive, no lesions or evidence of TB was found when the animals in question were slaughtered in the factory.  Does this suggest the scheme is not successful? The farmer concerned only receives one half to two-thirds of the market value of the animal.  Is there a question of dishonesty?  Where no lesions or evidence of TB is found, is the innocent victim, the farmer, not entitled to full compensation?  He is very definitely so entitled.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the present scheme is not all it should be but it will be difficult to develop a scheme which will be 100 per cent accurate.  However, when an innocent party loses a substantial amount &mdash; even though his herd proved to be clean &mdash; questions must be answered. It is a sad fact that £1 billion &mdash; a figure which substantially comprises taxpayers' money &mdash; has been spent on the eradication of bovine TB.  What has been the result of this expenditure?  In the current year, £500,000 will be spent on research and, out of £63 million, £20 million will be paid to administration.</P>
    <P>Having spent £1 billion, we do not know what causes the spread of this disease. Shame on all of us, and by that I refer to the successive Governments responsible, the Minister of State and the current Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry.  I have raised this issue on many occasions during the past year and have yet to see a change in attitude on the part of the Department and the Minister of State.  If this disease is to be eradicated, the Department must discover whence it came.  Is the disease spread by badgers, birds or the wind? The Minister of State cannot give me an answer.  Having spent £1 billion, we still do not know what spreads this disease. If the Department spent £500,000 on <Col N="498" /> administration and £20 million on research, the proportions might be correct. The Minister of State should consider why so much money is spent on administration.  He must also discover why so little attention is given to research.</P>
    <P>There has been a frightening reduction in the amount of money expended on research since 1990.  The allocation for administration has increased by 24 per cent while that provided for research has been reduced by 10 per cent.  This figure represents 10 per cent in money and another 10 per cent can be added to account for inflation.  That is a disgrace.  It tells me that we have a vested interest in continuing this programme of disease eradication because many people are doing well out of it.  The people who are doing best out of it are officials of the Department.</P>

      <P>Is suimiúil an Bille seo. Bhí deis ag an Aire tabhairt faoi na scéimeanna galair i mbeithigh go bunúsach agus is mór an trua nár glac sé leis an seans sin.  Tá mí-shásacht leis an scéim tástála i measc feirmeoirí agus an phobail. Is beag dul chun cinn a dhéanfar leis an mBille seo.</P>
      <P>When introducing this Bill, the Minister referred to historic changes in the TB scheme for 1996.  However, during the remainder of his speech, he failed to inform the House with regard to the nature of these historic changes.  It is clear that this Bill makes cosmetic changes and does not address the disease eradication schemes in the fundamental manner required, a fact to which virtually every speaker referred.  This situation is shameful in view of the reliance of our economy &mdash; employment in the agricultural sector &mdash; on exports of livestock and animal products.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a nation, we depend on freedom from major animal diseases in our national herd to ensure continued access to our major export markets.  To this end we have operated TB and brucellosis schemes since 1964.  In excess of £1 billion has been spent on such schemes and successes have been <Col N="499" /> achieved.  This is particularly true of the brucellosis scheme with 99.9 per cent of the nation's herds free of it.  Unfortunately, in the case of TB, only a little over 90 per cent of the herds are free of disease.  In a national herd of 7 million animals, that is quite a worrying statistic. Several reasons exist for the large differential between the two percentages.</P>
    <P>Brucellosis testing is mainly carried out by way of individual blood test.  The process of such testing is far more transparent and open in its operation.  Other aspects of the process, such as milk ring, are taken into account, as previous speakers have stated.  A high level of confidence exists with regard to the form of testing undertaken to detect brucellosis.  This is not the case with testing for TB.  The relatively low level of farmer confidence in the test has been exacerbated by the Department's handling of the scheme in the past.  The Bill before the House illustrates that point once more.  When there are fairly fundamental changes in the way the scheme&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill has nothing to do with the TB eradication programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen" hpid="Mr. Killeen Mr. Killeen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State is extremely helpful.  However, he forgot to draw the attention of his party colleagues to that fact.</P>
      <P>This is quite definitely the case with regard to TB testing.  Deputy Treacy outlined cases of cattle being removed from herds and, when slaughtered, it was discovered that no evidence of lesions existed.  Such cases are a very worrying part of rural folklore and are fundamental to the future of agriculture. The Minister of State, and anyone with a genuine interest in agriculture, should be aware of, and take account of, the facts when considering bovine diseases and their consequences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no doubt that there are many cases where cattle that tested as TB reactors were subsequently discovered to be free of disease.  Previous speakers <Col N="500" /> referred to the veil of secrecy which surrounds some meat plants and has the effect of increasing farmers' suspicions. It is not difficult to understand the ire of a farmer whose animal, which tested positive, is subsequently found to be free of disease.  Nevertheless, the farmer suffers financial loss and inconvenience associated with having his herd locked up.  This is the nub of the problem in relation to the TB eradication scheme.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the £285 million contributed to the scheme by farmers through disease levies.  This quite substantial contribution represents only a tiny proportion of the cost of the TB eradication scheme to farmers to date.  This is particularly true of the individual farmer whose misfortune it is to have his herd locked up because of TB. The scheme has never, at any stage, adequately addressed the question of compensation.  Farmers have very good reason to live in fear of having a TB reactor in their herds.  The potential cost of a relatively minor outbreak of the disease is enormous.  The farmer experiences a loss of income while his herd is locked up for a period which seems to vary in accordance with the fashion dictated by the Department at any time, rather than because of the establishment of fundamental facts through research or other means.  On almost every occasion there is an extra cost to the farmer in terms of his feed bill.  This happens during the period when he has no income.</P>
    <P>There is an incentive for each farmer to ensure that he does not have a TB reactor in his herd.  When such an incentive is present, ways and means are discovered to ensure that the worst does not come to the worst.  The current cost of the scheme is approximately £67 million. I am indebted to the Minister for informing me of that fact during his speech and I am sure it is relevant to the Bill.  Of that figure, the cost of testing is £20 million, compensation costs £20 million, administration £20 million and operational aspects account for £7 million. There is a temptation to oppose the <Col N="501" /> provision of £20 million for administration &mdash; that certainly would be popular among farmers and others &mdash; but my experience of administrative costs has been that they are in the main justified.  They arise because the format of a scheme may dictate that much administrative work is associated with it. It is hardly surprising that is the case with the substantial national herd and the records required to be kept on foot of the scheme.  I am therefore disinclined to adopt the populist approach and take a cheap shot at the administrators.</P>
    <P>The level of compensation, which is fairly modest, is clearly inadequate.  This is the one area of the TB regime that should be fundamentally examined.  A scheme should be introduced to ensure individual farmers are not so severely penalised that they must, in some cases, resort to illegal means to ensure they escape the net.  I do not think that happens to a great extent, but there is a strong incentive to do so.</P>
    <P>Deputy Byrne referred to BSE which, in terms of publicity at least, is the bovine disease that most readily strikes terror into the heart of the consumer.  Consumption of meat in some European countries has dropped dramatically mainly on foot of that concern.  As a nation we must ensure that first the problem is dealt with and that the public is fully aware of the measures taken to address the problem of BSE to ensure it does not constitute a threat to the national herd.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of this matter is the relationship between the veterinarians and the Department, particularly the Minister.  Initially it was stated that in order to qualify for EU funding for these schemes, rotational testing would have to be introduced and that there was no way out of that.  Unfortunately the matter became extremely confrontational and relations between the Minister and veterinarians broke down, which served nobody's interest.  That was further evidence that what is delivered and presented as absolute gospel by Ministers and Department officials in <Col N="502" /> terms of TB eradication is open to dilution when circumstances dictate. That undermines the credibility of the schemes and of the Minister.</P>
    <P>As many Deputies said, there is need to embark on a campaign of research into bovine diseases.  Farmers in particular have virtually no faith in the existing scheme of testing for TB.  It is vital that a scheme with a modicum of openness and transparency be introduced.  I know that poses difficulties for the Government in many areas, but perhaps it will be addressed in this area.  There is also need to restore the confidence of veterinarians and farmers in the Department, the Minister and the schemes.  Until that is done no progress will be made in the area of animal health.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Deenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies for their contributions.  Both I and the Minister appreciate the general supportive approach to the new proposals outlined by the Minister at the outset of the debate.  In response to Deputy Killeen regarding rotational testing, that proposal was put forward by a Fianna Fáil Minister, Deputy Joe Walsh.  It was agreed in Brussels that a certain package would be available provided we introduced rotational testing over a three year period.  We inherited that proposal and did our best to implement it.  I negotiated the issue with the veterinarians and agreement was almost reached, but in the end they decided otherwise.  As a result there is a possibility we could lose up to £14 million. The Minister is accused of being confrontational because he made an effort in that regard.  We may receive £4 million this year because we achieved about 20 per cent of rotational testing of the national herd.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>We hope we will achieve our objective.  Since Deputies referred to rotational testing, I wished <Col N="503" /> to put on record where that proposal came from and how the matter proceeded. We will never know how effective rotational testing would have been if implemented in full.  It was a reasonable proposal which veterinarians should have accepted.  From meeting these people at their conference last week I think many of them regret they rejected it.</P>
      <P>The eradication of bovine TB is always a contentious issue.  It is important to realise that currently less than 3 per cent of the total of 150,000 herds are restricted because of TB.  That is contrary to the damaging impression often given that the national herd is riddled with TB.  In disease terms 1 per cent infection levels are notoriously difficult to reduce.  Deputy Killeen stated that 91 per cent of herds are free of TB, but the figure is 99 per cent.  Bovine TB conforms to the predictable pattern in disease eradication, with rapid progress in the earlier stages and eventual reduced progress coupled with increasing difficulty.  In the periods when progress is rapid enthusiasm will run high and significant progress can be achieved.  Understandably when progress slows to a virtual standstill enthusiasm will wane.  When that happens it is very important to ensure enthusiasm is not replaced by pessimism. A one per cent problem is easier to deal with than a 100 per cent problem. Other countries have reduced that one per cent and eradicated bovine TB. Market image will be vital in the GATT-free market, strong competition trade area we are facing.  We should recognise the tremendous amount of work and commitment in the farming industry since the 1950s in getting the TB incidence level down to 1 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In countries where TB has been eradicated, such as Denmark, their eradication programme commenced at an earlier time when national herd populations were comparatively compact, that is prior to the policy to expand livestock production.  Thus unlike <Col N="504" /> Ireland, they were not battling to contain and eradicate the disease in the context of an expanding cattle population. In addition, the trading pattern in these countries does not involve extensive animal movement, as is the case here.  Their wildlife populations &mdash; and therefore any possibility of transmission of disease through the wildlife sector &mdash; are relatively small.  By contrast, Ireland has the same badger population as Sweden, which is a much larger land mass.  In our case the quarter of a million badgers are concentrated in closer proximity to our cattle herds. Many other countries have not eradicated TB &mdash; for example, New Zealand, Spain and Italy.</P>
    <P>For us the final eradication of bovine TB from the national herd remains the ultimate objective as part of our marketing image projection &mdash; that matter was referred to by Deputy Byrne.  It is very important that we retain the credibility of our national herd and the disease-free status for which we are renowned among our trading partners throughout Europe.  The current level of TB requires that, to maintain our officially TB-free status under the European Union Trading Directive 64/432/EEC, a TB test must be carried out on all animals each year.  In the circumstances an annual round of testing will continue to be a requirement, certainly for the foreseeable future.  That directive also requires that animals must be certified by an official veterinarian as having undergone a tuberculin test.  That in effect rules out the possibility of veterinarians being replaced by technicians for TB testing purposes and, perhaps, answers the question posed by Deputy O'Malley.  I was interested to hear Deputy Kitt recommend the use of lay technicians.  Some years ago I remember the then Minister Clinton being involved in a dispute with veterinary surgeons over a similar proposal.</P>
    <P>The general consensus and advice is that while progress can be made, final eradication of bovine tuberculosis will be possible only when a laboratory-based diagnostic blood test, a vaccine <Col N="505" /> for wildlife and computerised movement control are available and come on stream.  A number of Deputies touched on these specific matters in their contributions. Pending the development of these to practical field application, the emphasis must be to contain and, hopefully, reduce the disease and costs; hence the current proposals to introduce a more effective programme and to devolve the cost of testing element to farmer control.</P>
    <P>It is worth noting that our reactor compensation package is one of the most comprehensive in Europe, a matter to which Deputy Killeen and others referred.  The package is designed to ensure that in broad terms a farmer is enabled to purchase a similar commercial type replacement animal of the non-pedigree type to get quickly back into production.  The package comprises two elements, the price paid for the carcase by meat plants on the basis of a competitive weekly tender and the reactor grant structured to take account of the higher replacement value pertaining to higher yielding cows and in-calf heifers, as alluded to by Deputy Leonard, being up to £600 per cow in addition to carcase value.  Where the entire herd is depopulated, an additional depopulation grant is paid.  Alternatively, income supplement is payable monthly where more than 10 per cent of the herd has been removed and where depopulation is not considered appropriate.</P>
    <P>This year some £20 million will be paid to farmers by way of reactor grants. An independent study of the compensation arrangement carried out by Professor Seamus Sheehy of UCD in 1991 concluded that in general the compensation arrangement was fair in its application. The arrangement is non-statutory and works well.  Some Deputies saw implications in the new proposals for reactor compensation.  It should be noted, however, that reactor compensation is the subject of ongoing review in the light of market trends and any alteration to the grant arrangements is made in consultation with the main farming organisations.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="506" /> Grants are paid promptly once the herdowner has submitted the requisite back-up documentation as requested by the district veterinary office.  Nevertheless, it is accepted that breakdowns create hardship and inconvenience and no genuine farmer wants the disease.</P>
    <P>In regard to expenditure and benefit, the scheme for the eradication of bovine TB was first introduced in Ireland in 1954 initially on a voluntary basis followed by a progressive extension of compulsory measures.  Gross expenditure, including administration on TB and brucellosis disease eradication in the 40 year period up to the end of 1995, will be an estimated £1 billion with receipts of £353.2 million, giving a net expenditure of £646.8 million.  The predominant receipt was the disease levy amounting to £285.3 million in the total period.  The gross annual expenditure in 1994 was £64 million and will be £67 million in 1995.  Excluding the administration cost of some £20 million, the £44 million operational cost in 1994 comprised compensation for reactors of £17 million, testing fees of £20 million and materials, research and travel costing about £7 million.  Farmer levy receipts amounted to almost £28 million.</P>
    <P>Professor Sheehy's 1991 cost-benefit analysis carried out on the scheme expenditure demonstrated that the 16 per cent rate of return to expenditure was strongly cost beneficial having regard to access to markets which could have been denied in the absence of embarking on an effective eradication programme.  The annual expenditure must be seen in the context of protecting an industry with some £3 billion annual output, £2 billion in export earnings and its related employment which is substantial, and also in the context of the sheer magnitude of the essential annual programme involving ten million TB tests, 3.5 million brucellosis tests and the removal of and grant payment in respect of 30,000 TB reactors and 8,000 brucellosis reactors.  It should be noted that in the interest of efficiency in expenditure, TB and brucellosis tests <Col N="507" /> are in general carried out simultaneously.</P>
    <P>On the question of administration costs raised by Deputies, it is the intention that the Department will arrange to have an assessment undertaken in the context of the strategic management initiative and the reorganisation of the Department by a consultancy firm into staffing levels and other resources required to deliver the agreed programme with the following terms of reference, &ldquo;to evaluate the staffing levels and structures and other operational aspects and resources required at the Department's headquarters, DVOs and laboratories and elsewhere to effectively and efficiently implement the revised programme for disease eradication.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>On the wildlife aspect, the fact that bovine TB can be transmitted by infected badgers and cattle was recognised by all participants including the wildlife lobby at the Royal Irish Academy Conference in 1991.  There is also evidence available from the east Offaly project that removal of badgers helps to reduce the disease.  The extent of the involvement of wildlife is the subject of ongoing scientific research.  We are increasing the research effort on this aspect and farmers will assist the Department in the ongoing work which will be undertaken under licences from the Wildlife Service and in accordance with the provisions of the wildlife legislation. There is increasing concern about a position which requires the compulsory removal of valuable infected livestock while at the same time action is not being taken to address other sources of infection.  It is increasingly evident that all potential sources of infection must be considered so as to protect rural farm families and their livelihoods.  The increased research activities on wildlife will involve validation of data from the east Offaly project through replication of that programme in a number of areas where it is considered that bovine TB infection may be related to infected badger <Col N="508" /> activity; the securing of single and multiple licences in cases of breakdowns where there is a veterinary view of wildlife involvement and the continuation of other research.  Farmer participation under the direction of DVOs will be a significant element in the efficient implementation of the licensing arrangements under the foregoing research measures.</P>
    <P>A comprehensive research programme is continuing to examine all aspects in relation to the transmission of bovine TB and to develop new technological tools to address deficiencies. While some of this work is promising, field application of blood testing and vaccines is still some way off.  The Commission team which visited Ireland recently was extremely impressed with our research programme and this will continue both at national level and in conjunction with other countries.  In this context I refer in particular to the comments of Deputies Noel Treacy and Hugh Byrne when they criticised the amount of expenditure on research.  We hope to build on this programme and expand it.  I agree we need to put more money into research but the reality is that our present programme is quite a good one.  It is important that we build on it in order to arrive at an ultimate solution.</P>
    <P>A TB investigation unit with specialist staff is examining factors such as the possibility of DNA strain-typing.  Significant work on vaccine development and other projects is under way in the universities.  Irish researchers collaborate with their counterparts in other countries.  It can be noted that the tuberculin test is the scientific and legal test used throughout the EU and in most countries worldwide and it has been used to eradicate TB from cattle in most of the north European countries such as Denmark, Holland and France.</P>
    <P>As with most biological tests, the TB test has certain limitations.  A small number of reactors are found subsequently not to be infected, while others who test clear are found to be diseased.  The blood test is attempting to <Col N="509" /> overcome these limitations.  Of the 10,000 herds restricted annually for bovine TB, 5,000 have a single reactor only. Of these, a percentage do not have infection but reactions occur for nonspecific reasons.  We intend to increase the analysis of glands and, based on herd and area disease positions obtaining, we expect that it will be possible to lift restrictions on some herds earlier than heretofore.</P>
    <P>The clear intention is that restrictions will be lifted only where the most exhaustive laboratory tests of glands show no evidence of infection, there is no disease history in the herds involved and after considering the disease position in the area in question.  In practice, any earlier lifting of restrictions will arise only where such release does not pose any increased risks than would exist otherwise.</P>
    <P>The definition of an infected animal is that the animal reacted to the tuberculin test.  The absence of visible lesions at <i>post mortem</i> does not mean the absence of TB infection.  Arising from the regular and thorough testing programmes in Ireland, the disease is often detected before the advanced, visible lesion stage has been reached.  Any early lesions may be microscopic in nature and not visible to the eye.</P>
    <P>While the current cattle identity card system is generally sound, the development of computerised animal movement control with a permit for one movement only will improve tracing of disease.  Under the current cattle identity card system an animal may move any number of times within the 60 day TB test validity period.  The project has been complicated by the need to prioritise the computerisation of the CAP reform payments.  The Department is currently reviewing the requirements for a movement system in the light of the measures that are now in place.  I am very anxious to ensure that this review would be completed quickly.</P>
    <P>In regard to the likely benefits of the proposed new arrangements, it should be noted that the existing arrangements contained the disease at about the same <Col N="510" /> level over the past 30 years but at considerable and escalating cost to the Exchequer and farmers.  The objective of the revised regime is to make the programme more effective and to moderate costs.  To this end, cattle will continue to be tested each year and there are very strong measures in place or to be put in place to ensure that this will happen, i.e. checks at marts, meat plants, export points, restrictions on movement into and out of herds which are not tested, potential disallowance from premia/ headage schemes if farmers do not have valid identity cards, ultimately prosecution and fines and disallowance for compensation under schemes if rules are not observed.  I trust that this will allay the fears raised by Deputies that the abolition of the 60 day pre-movement test would increase the incidence of disease.  Farmers in general are responsible and will wish to protect their herds and investment.  The DVOs will supervise testing and arrange a higher level of testing by departmental vets and contract vets.  This testing will be targeted to areas where disease levels are high and where the testing programme is falling behind.  A quality control unit will be set up to monitor testing and to investigate suspicious events.  We will continue the random surveys and we will have a more active approach to research on transmission of TB by wildlife. In essence, the objective will be to operate a more targeted and strategic approach to this disease.</P>
    <P>Finally, in regard to the technical issue of the Bill, following the establishment of the Single Market, it is necessary <i>inter alia</i> to provide a legal basis for payment of levy on exports directly to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry rather than via the Revenue Commissioners as the Minister's agent, which was the former position.</P>
    <P>As the Minister indicated at the outset, the proposed amendments do not involve any extension of the levy arrangements or any change in the rates of levy.  There are, however a number of technical adjustments proposed to improve the supervision and inspection <Col N="511" /> of the levy system.  In particular it is proposed to extend the definition of an accountable person by whom or on whose behalf an animal is being exported from the State, to remove the exemption in regard to the keeping of records by whom or on whose behalf an animal is being exported and to provide for the inspection and removal of such records by an authorised officer of the Minister.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides for increased maximum fines on summary conviction for offences under the diseases levies legislation from £500 to £1,500 and an increase in the maximum fines in respect of certain offences under sections 48 and 49 of the Diseases of Animals Act, 1966.  The latter fines were last increased from August 1979 under section 23 of the Bovine Diseases (Levies) Act, 1979.  The proposed increases are from £500 to £1,500 in respect of a summary conviction, from £2,000 to £10,000 in respect of a conviction on indictment in respect of specified offences and from £1,000 to £5,000 in respect of other indictable offences.</P>
    <P>I have answered a number of specific questions in my contribution this evening.  Deputy Kitt asked about extending TB testing to deer and we are making progress in this respect.  If Deputies want any further information, they may contact me.  Overall this was a good debate which attracted a lot of interest.  A number of good suggestions were made which I hope we can examine and, if possible, take on board.  I ask the House to endorse these necessary administrative charges.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Our law in this area is contained in the Trade Marks Act, 1963, and the rules made thereunder.  Registration of trade marks is administered by the Patents Office, under the direction of the Controller of Patents, Designs and Trade Marks.  The Controller keeps the Register of Trade Marks and registration affords legal protection to a trade mark proprietor.</P>
      <P>In essence a trade mark is a badge of goodwill and the primary purpose of registration is to legally protect the exclusive rights of the proprietor and thereby the goodwill subsisting in the trade mark.  The function of the register is to record what are claimed as exclusive rights.  There are over 65,000 entries on the register at present and every year approximately 6,000 new applications are made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As with many other areas of enterprise in recent years, the pace of change in trade mark practice has been remarkable.  The Bill is necessary to take account of such changes as have taken place, particularly those arising from amended and new international agreements and regulations.  The basic international treaty relating to trade marks is the Paris Convention of 1883 which constituted a union for the protection of industrial property.  This treaty allowed countries to conclude other agreements provided they did not contravene the Convention.  One such agreement was <Col N="513" /> the Madrid Agreement of 1891 concerning the international registration of marks.</P>
    <P>In recent years the most important development has been European Council Directive No. 89/104 of 21 December 1988, which is an important single market measure to approximate the laws of member states on trade marks.  The directive does not attempt a wholesale harmonisation of national trade mark laws.  Rather, it concentrates on differences between member states which distort competition.  In particular, it harmonises the conditions for validly registering a trade mark and the rights conferred by registration.</P>
    <P>The second change of note also relates to our obligations within the European Community and concerns Council Regulation 40/94, dated 20 December 1993 which makes provision for a unitary Community trade mark. This new system will allow trade mark owners to register marks throughout the Community by means of a single application to the Office for Harmonisation in the Internal Market, dealing with trade marks and designs, in Alicante, Spain.  This office is scheduled to commence processing of Community trade marks applications from April 1996.</P>
    <P>Another important international development was the Madrid Protocol which was concluded in June 1989.  The Madrid Agreement and the Protocol are now more compatible with our national trade mark system.  The Protocol facilitates the international registration of trade marks by the World Intellectual Property Organisation in Geneva. Ireland signed this Protocol in December 1989.  It could not enter into force until four instruments of accession had been deposited with the World Intellectual Property Organisation.  To date, China, Cuba, Spain, Sweden, the United Kingdom, Denmark and Mongolia have deposited instruments of accession.  The World Intellectual Property Organisation will now discuss with member countries of the Madrid Union for the International Registration of Marks, common regulations and fees <Col N="514" /> which are expected to operate from April 1996.  As I will explain later, this Protocol has benefits for this country which we wish to avail of by becoming party to it.</P>
    <P>Apart from these recent international agreements, changes to the present legislation are required by developments and innovations in trade mark practices.  Since the Trade Marks Act, 1963, was framed there has been an international trend to register marks in respect of services and not just goods. The closest example of this trend is the United Kingdom which introduced the registration of service marks through the Trade Marks (Amendment) Act, 1984.  This is an important change in international practice which we must now accommodate in our law.</P>
    <P>Preparation of this Bill allowed my Department an opportunity to undertake a fundamental overhaul of the present legislation and to incorporate the various changes outlined above. This brings me to the main objectives of the legislation now proposed which are outlined in the long title of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The primary purpose of this Bill is to give effect to EU Council Directive No. 84/104 to approximate the laws of member states relating to trade marks. Implementation of the directive will reduce or eliminate differences in approach between EU member states in the area of trade marks, thereby reducing barriers to competition and assisting the completion of the Single Market.</P>
    <P>At the heart of the law governing registered trade marks are the key questions of what marks should qualify for registration and what rights are conferred by registration.  In order to be registered, a mark must be able to fulfil the essential function of a trade mark &mdash; that of distinguishing its proprietor's goods or services from those of his competitors; it may not, for example, be descriptive of the goods, or be a word which another trader might legitimately wish to use to describe his goods.  Nor may a mark be validly registered if it conflicts with an earlier right, for example a similar trade mark already on <Col N="515" /> the register.  Moveover the registration of a word or device as a trade mark does not give a monopoly to all uses of that word or device; it is necessary in law to make clear the scope of the protection conferred and what acts constitute infringements of the trade mark right.</P>
    <P>The Directive seeks to ensure that, as far as possible, these questions are answered in the same way throughout the Community.  Article 3 is concerned with grounds for refusal or invalidity which relate to the registrability of the mark &mdash; sometimes referred to as &ldquo;absolute grounds&rdquo;.  Article 4 refers to grounds concerning conflicts with earlier rights &mdash; often referred to as &ldquo;relative grounds&rdquo;; while article 5 deals with the rights conferred by a registered trade mark.</P>
    <P>Each of these articles contains mandatory provisions, specifying grounds or rights for which member states must provide and permissive provisions specifying grounds or rights for which a member state may provide.  The law may not, however, provide for any grounds or rights which are additional to those mentioned in the Directive. Taken together, therefore, articles 3 to 5 provide an exhaustive list of the grounds for refusing or invalidating the registration of a trade mark and of the rights conferred by registration.</P>
    <P>There is a close relationship between articles 4 and 5, because both are concerned with conflicts between trade marks.  Article 4 deals with the extent to which a trade mark constitutes a barrier to the valid registration of a later mark and article 5 with the extent to which the earlier trade mark can be used to prohibit use of the later mark.</P>
    <P>The directive is concerned with substantive law, not procedures.  While it sets out the grounds for refusal or invalidation of registered trade marks, it specifically says that member states remain free to fix the procedures whereby these grounds are applied.  This is why articles 3 and 4, which deal with the grounds for refusal or invalidation, <Col N="516" /> include the words &ldquo;shall not be registered or if registered shall be liable to be declared invalid&rdquo;.  Countries like the UK and Ireland, which register trade marks only after search and examination continue to do so, while countries that do not search or examine but leave the validity of a registration to be settled by litigation are free to retain their systems if they wish.  The essential requirement is that there must be some legal mechanism whereby the grounds of objection contained in articles 3 and 4 can be considered.  The changes to our legislation needed to give effect to these articles are twofold.</P>
    <P>First, the test for registering a trade mark will be whether the mark is capable of distinguishing its owner's goods or services from those of another.  The new and wider definition contained in article 2 of the Directive is reflected in section 6 of the Bill which permits registration of geographic names and the shape of goods or of their packaging.</P>
    <P>Second, the rights enjoyed by a registered mark will be broadened so that in future another person's use of the registered mark on similar goods or services will constitute infringement.  Article 5 of the Directive gives a much wider protection than was available under the Trade Marks Act, 1963.  Under that Act, infringement proceedings could only be taken if another person used the mark on the precise goods for which it was registered.  If that other person used the mark on similar goods or used it to sell services related to the goods for which the mark was registered, then the owner did not have recourse to trade mark legislation and had to rely instead on a common law action for passing off. Section 13 of the Bill will not only extend these broader infringement rights to similar goods but, in the case of a trade mark which has a reputation in the State, extend infringement rights to non-similar goods where the infringing use takes unfair advantage of, or is detrimental to, the distinctive character or repute of the registered mark.</P>
    <P>The Directive should have been implemented in this country by January <Col N="517" /> 1993.  Implementation by way of statutory instrument was considered unsatisfactory on legal grounds as substantial changes were required to comply with its terms.  Deputy Michael McDowell introduced a Private Member's Bill in March 1993 and I compliment him on his initiative in that regard.  At that time my predecessor decided to proceed with the preparation of an official Bill while retaining the overall scope and structure of Deputy McDowell's Bill.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the Bill is also to make provision for the new Community trade mark.  Council Regulation 40/94 of 20 December 1993 established the Office for Harmonisation in the Internal Market for trade marks and designs. This office will register Community trade marks which will have effect in all member states.  The Community trade marks system will operate in parallel with national systems and offer trade mark owners the opportunity to register their mark throughout the Community by means of a single registration.  The Bill makes provision in connection with the operation of Council Regulation 40/94.  Section 55 provides, <i>inter alia</i>, for filing applications for a Community trade mark to be made through the Patents Office in Dublin.</P>
    <P>A third aim of the Bill is to enable ratification of the Protocol to the Madrid Agreement concerning the International Registration of Marks and to implement certain provisions of the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property.  Part III allows us to meet our various obligations under both the Madrid Protocol and the Paris Convention. At present, an Irish trade mark owner who wishes to protect his mark in overseas markets must apply separately for registration in each of the countries in which protection is desired. This entails going through whatever procedures are required in each country, paying fees to each national trade marks office and undertaking substantial costs to pursue the various applications.</P>
    <P>Trade mark owners in many other European countries are able to register <Col N="518" /> their mark by means of a single application under an international arrangement known as the Madrid Agreement. Although this agreement has functioned for more than 100 years it has a membership of only 44 countries.  This arose because most participating countries conducted little or no examination of applications and fundamental objections to a trade mark only came to light when there was litigation.</P>
    <P>In contrast, our trade marks system is based on registration being granted only after full examination of the mark including a search of the register for possible conflicting marks.  Given the lack of compatibility between the Madrid system and many national systems it was not surprising that countries including the USA, Canada, Japan, the UK and Ireland remained outside the Madrid Agreement.  A Protocol to the agreement was concluded on 27 June 1989 which overcame the difficulties we had with the original agreement.</P>
    <P>Ireland signed the Protocol in December 1989 and section 57 allows provision to be made to give effect to it. This will make it easier for Irish industrial and commercial enterprises to obtain wider protection for their trade marks by means of a single application with the World Intellectual Property Organisation, WIPO, designating the member countries of the agreement where protection is required.  Equally, trade mark proprietors in countries outside Ireland which are a party to the Protocol will find it easier to register their marks here by designating Ireland in their applications for registration of trade marks with the World Intellectual Property Organisation.</P>
    <P>Section 58 enables us to make any amendments necessitated by any revisions or amendments of the Paris Convention.  Sections 59 to 63 give explicit effect in Irish law to our obligations under the convention to protect well-known trade marks and emblems of other convention countries as well as intergovernmental organisations.  Hitherto, the Controller of Patents, Designs <Col N="519" /> and Trade Marks exercised his discretion to take account of our obligations under this convention.  The incorporation of such obligations into the body of the Bill is a more satisfactory approach as it puts such obligations on a sound legal footing.  A new services programme is also being prepared by ABT to exploit the export potential of the services sector.</P>
    <P>This Bill aims to facilitate the registration of trade marks in respect of services. Up to now, service industries were unable to register such trade marks as section 11 of the Trade Marks Act, 1963, confined the definition of a trade mark to goods only.  The Bill will facilitate the registration of trade marks in respect of services by broadening the definitions of a trade mark as contained in section 6 to cover services.  This will benefit service industries who will now be able to protect the goodwill associated with their marks and should assist in attracting service industries to Ireland.</P>
    <P>Part I of the Bill clarifies matters common to most Bills and provides for repeal of the present law while Part II deal with the registration of trade marks generally.  It re-enacts much of what was contained in the Trade Marks Act, 1963, while taking account of various changes which have taken place since enactment, particularly those necessitated by Council Directive 89/104.  The Bill will deregulate the procedures involved in both the assignments and licensing of trade marks.</P>
    <P>Under current legislation the controller is required to examine in detail assignments and licences.  This is a costly exercise which has been justified on the basis that consumers needed to be protected. It was felt that unrestricted licensing could lead to deception of the public.  It is considered this is an unlikely danger as the person who stands to suffer most from the devaluation of a trade mark is the proprietor of the mark.  The best interests of the proprietor lie in ensuring that assignments and licences do not undermine the value of the trade <Col N="520" /> mark.  Section 26 requires that assignments must be in writing while section 27 provides for the recording of transactions affecting registered trade marks in the register.  Sections 30 to 34 deal with licensing arrangements.</P>
    <P>Under the 1963 Act a system of registering users of a trade mark was introduced. It was felt at that time a trade mark's capacity to distinguish could be undermined by unrestricted licensing and that a tightly controlled system of registered users would prevent deception of the public.  The reality in today's market place is that the trade mark proprietor has most to lose from a trade mark losing its reputation.  He will, therefore, ensure that the income he may derive from royalties does not suffer from the actions of licencees. Accordingly, it is not considered necessary to intervene in what is a commercial arrangement between a trade mark proprietor and a licensee.  Modern consumers are conscious of trade marks and exercise choice in selecting from the vast range of goods available in an increasingly globalised marketplace.  It is not considered necessary that the Patents Office should act in a consumer protection role through the compulsory recording and vetting of licences.</P>
    <P>The Bill will not require licensees to register their use of a trade mark with the Patents Office as was the case under section 36 of the 1963 Act but section 30 will specify that a licence will not be effective unless it is in writing.</P>
    <P>The present law also provides that where the proprietor of a registered trade mark applies to register the same or a similar mark for similar goods or services the two marks may be associated. The proprietor may only assign or transmit associated marks as a whole. The purpose of requiring marks to be associated was to protect the public from being misled into thinking that different goods bearing identical or similar marks originated from the same source when they did not.  The Government feels that such protection is no longer necessary since it is the trade mark proprietor and the assignee who <Col N="521" /> will stand to lose most should the trade mark be devalued through confusion on the part of consumers.</P>
    <P>Section 35 provides that applications can be in respect of services as well as goods.  Section 37 allows for goods to be classified by 34 different classes and services by eight classes in accordance with the Nice Agreement of 15 June 1957 for the international classification of goods and services.  It is proposed to extend this system to service marks in line with general international practice.</P>
    <P>Section 45 now provides for a trade mark to be registered for ten years and renewed for further periods of ten years.  Under existing legislation the first registration period was seven years with renewals for successive periods of 14 years.  This will bring our registration periods into line with those for the Community trade mark.</P>
    <P>Section 52 introduces a new category of trade mark whereby an association of members can register a collective mark in respect of goods or services, while section 53 deals with certification marks. Whereas an &ldquo;ordinary&rdquo; trade mark serves to distinguish one trader's goods from another, the function of a certification trade mark is to indicate that goods comply with certain objective standards in respect of, for example, origin, material, method of manufacture or quality.  These standards are set out in the regulations which must accompany a certification mark.  When an application is made to register a certification mark, the registrability of the mark itself is considered by the controller in the usual way.  The application is then referred to the Minister.</P>
    <P>The regulations are examined to see that the mark does guarantee genuine qualities or characteristics and that anyone whose goods meet these standards is allowed to use the mark.  The Minister must be satisfied that the applicant is competent to certify that the goods or services comply with these standards.</P>
    <P>The proposed Community trade marks system does not provide for certification marks.  It does, however, like <Col N="522" /> most continental European systems provide for collective marks.  These have a certain resemblance to certification marks in that they are accompanied by regulations concerning the use of the mark.  The essential function of the regulations of a collective mark however is to indicate who is entitled to use the mark, for example, any member of the association owning the mark, rather than to set out standards with which the goods or services must comply. The proprietor may, if he wishes, include such standards and in some cases a collective mark may provide as effective an indication of quality or origin as a certification mark.  In general, however, compliance with these standards does not itself confer the right to use the mark.  The primary function of a collective mark is to indicate a trade connection with the proprietor organisation; such a mark is therefore more akin to an &ldquo;ordinary&rdquo; trade mark than is a certification mark.</P>
    <P>I have not said &ldquo;Marx&rdquo; as frequently since I was in The Workers' Party &mdash; I am worn out repeating it but we will plough on.  Our trade mark system does not at present provide for the registration of collective marks.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>The Community trade marks system does however allow for the registration of collective marks, and these will have legal effect here.  The Bill therefore provides for collective marks.  In contrast to certification marks, there will be no requirement for the regulations of a collective mark to specify objective standards and it will not be necessary for the controller to refer the regulations to the Minister for approval.  Certification marks will be retained alongside collective marks since they perform a different function; they will also be extended to cover services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Part III of the Bill covers the various <Col N="523" /> provisions necessary to take account of the new Community Trade Mark Regulation 40/94, the Protocol to the Madrid Agreement and our obligations under the Paris Convention.  Section 55 provides for regulations to be made in connection with the operation of the Community Trade Mark Regulation 40/94 to which I referred earlier.  The Community Trade Marks system will operate in parallel with national systems, allowing trade mark proprietors to choose whichever system suits them best.</P>
    <P>Section 57 similarly allows for regulations to be made which will give effect in the State to the provisions of the Madrid Protocol.  This is an important provision.  As more countries ratify the Protocol the cost of protecting trade marks internationally will fall.  Proprietors will only have to make a single application under the Madrid Protocol and the international registration will have the same legal effect as though the application had been made to the national authorities in each of the countries designated.  This will result in considerable savings for trade mark owners. Sections 58 to 63 deal with the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property and our obligations under that convention.</P>
    <P>Part IV contains administrative provisions, many of which re-enact existing legislation.  Matters covered here include the maintenance of the register of trade marks, the powers and duties of the Controller of Patents, Designs and Trade Marks, and legal proceedings and appeals.  Under section 9 of the Act of 1963 the register consisted of two parts called Part A and Part B.  A trade mark was registrable in Part A, in accordance with section 17 of the Act of 1963, provided it contained a distinctive name, signature or word.</P>
    <P>However, words denoting the character or quality of the goods, geographical origin or surnames were excluded. Registration conferred exclusive rights to the use of the mark and made it <Col N="524" /> illegal for anyone to use a mark identical to or so nearly resembling the registered mark as to be likely to cause confusion. Part B of the register was restricted to trade marks which were capable of distinguishing the goods in respect of which the mark was registered from other goods.  In any action for infringement of a trade mark in Part B no relief was available to the plaintiff if the defendant established to the satisfaction of the High Court that the use complained of was not likely to deceive or cause confusion or be taken as indicating a connection with the authorised users of the registered trade mark.  To be accepted in Part A a trade mark had to be adapted to distinguish the applicant's goods while for Part B it was sufficient for a mark to be capable of distinguishing goods.  Hence, the criteria for registrability in Part B was less onerous. Section 64 provides that the register shall be maintained by the controller. The register will no longer be divided into Parts A and B.</P>
    <P>Part V deals with trade mark agents and replaces section 69 of the 1963 Act. Section 82 provides for the controller to maintain a register of trade mark agents while section 84 outlines the eligibility requirements to be placed on the register of trade mark agents.  Section 86 allows the controller to suspend or revoke the registration of a registered trade mark agent who ceases to be eligible to be registered or has been guilty of conduct disgraceful to that person in the capacity of a registered trade mark agent.</P>
    <P>Section 88 provides for rules governing the register as well as the professional qualifications and conditions for registration of an agent.  Section 89 is a new provision which confers privilege on communications between registered trade mark agents and their clients in the same way as between solicitors and their clients.  The provisions outlined in this part follow largely on the existing provisions in sections 105 to 109 of the Patents Act, 1992, as they relate to patent agents.</P>
    <P>Part VI is devoted to offences and <Col N="525" /> introduces important new measures to deal with the growing problems of the fraudulent use of trade marks and counterfeiting.  Since the Trade Marks Act, 1963, there has been a dramatic growth in the sale of counterfeit goods which feed off the reputation of well-known trade marks.  Section 90 gives much stronger protection to registered trade marks by broadening the scope of offences to include use of a mark which is identical to, or nearly resembles, a registered trade mark.  The unauthorised use of a registered trade mark devalues the reputation of that mark as the counterfeit goods are generally of inferior quality.  Such use also harms traders in the genuine goods who lose business and this Bill will provide trade mark proprietors with wider infringement rights, arising from the acts referred to in section 13.</P>
    <P>Part VII deals with miscellaneous and general matters.  I should like to draw Members' attention to section 96 which breaks new ground by placing the onus of proving use of a trade mark on the owner where use of the mark is contested. In the case of a person seeking to have a mark cancelled on the grounds of non-use under the 1963 Act, the burden of proving non-use rests with that person.  This is a difficult matter, and as it is reasonable and straighforward to call upon the owner of the mark to prove use, this is the approach taken here.</P>
    <P>The First and Second Schedules to this Bill set out requirements and procedures for registration of collective and certification marks respectively.  The Third Schedule deals with the repeal of the 1963 Act and enactment of this Bill. Existing registered marks kept under Parts A and B of the former register shall be deemed to be transferred on commencement of the new Act to the new register as set out in paragraph 2. The remaining transitional provisions relate to the status of applications for registration pending at the date of coming into operation of the new legislation as well as other matters.  Paragraph 15 deals with applications for trade marks <Col N="526" /> in respect of services which were made between 1 January 1993 and commencement of the new Act.</P>
    <P>Consultations on this Bill took place with the Association of Patents and Trade Mark Agents and the Irish Business and Employers' Confederation. Both organisations fully support the enactment of new legislation in this area, particularly the introduction of trade marks in relation to services and the updating required to bring us into line with the international agreements previously referred to.</P>
    <P>The question of co-ownership of marks was one of the main issues discussed with these bodies. Recent United Kingdom legislation allows a jointly owned trademark to be used separately and independently by each owner.  Both the Association and IBEC argued against this approach as it could lead to confusion for the public.  Section 25 of the Bill maintains the approach taken in the Act of 1963 requiring joint use of co-owned trade marks.</P>
    <P>My Department also raised the issue of whether a register of trade mark agents should continue.  We have accepted that there are benefits to trade mark proprietors and the Patents Office in having an officially recognised system of qualification to carry out trademark work.  Entry to the register is subject to an applicant satisfying the conditions laid down in section 84.  Companies or individuals who wish to carry out trademark work on their own behalf may continue to do so.</P>
    <P>In summary, I believe that there will be a general welcome for this Bill.  Its enactment will improve the environment for Irish businesses to protect their trade marks.</P>
    <P>Simplification of the procedure followed under the Act of 1963 has been effected in the Bill, particularly in the assignment and licensing of trade marks.  Infringement rights have been widened to combat the unauthorised use of trade marks.  The cornerstone of the Bill is Council Directive 89/104 which approximates the laws of the <Col N="527" /> member states relating to trade marks and careful attention has been paid to the wording of the directive in drafting this Bill.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann, mindful of the importance of the Common Agricultural Policy to the economy in general and the rural community in particular, demands that the Government enunciate a cogent and focused response to the EU Commission proposals for change, and that this response be based on an interpretation of the national interest that seeks to maintain as many viable farm holdings on the land as possible.</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil has tabled this motion to focus public debate on the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy, the importance of initiating this debate having been highlighted by the decision of Agriculture Commissioner Fischler to bring forward his proposals for reform. Policy makers in Europe and further afield are thinking ahead to the next round of world trade talks, enlargement to the east of the European Union and the implications of a single currency for agricultural policy.  In contrast, a passive approach to policy making has been the hallmark of this Administration's approach to date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In contrast to the cogent, focused response from Government this motion reasonably seeks, we have what is now a complete policy chasm between the Government partners.  The furious row <Col N="528" /> between the Tánaiste and Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry on reform of the Common Agricultural Policy is the latest manifestation of Government disarray on the range of issues defining our relations with the European Union.  Despite having been repeatedly promised since last spring, the publication of the Government White Paper has been long fingered again.  It is evident there is no agreement in Government on issues fundamental to the totality of our relations with the European Union.</P>
    <P>The squabble reported in today's papers between the Tánaiste and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry leaves our entire negotiating position in a state of chaos, the Tánaiste reported as having said that European Union enlargement was not only a political necessity but would present new markets and chances for Ireland.  In flat contradiction, the Minister is reported as saying that backward Eastern states would never be compatible with membership. It is against that background of in-fighting and incompetence on the part of members of the Government that vital issue of the Common Agricultural Policy is being debated publicly for the first time.</P>
    <P>The Common Agricultural Policy is a vital component of our entire economic structure, having been worth £1.3 billion in total in 1994, of which £669 million was disbursed in direct payments to farmers.  The reform of the Common Agricultural Policy goes to the heart of our national interest, placing the future economic viability of the majority in rural areas on the line.</P>
    <P>Commissioner Fischler's proposals must be given more consideration than their curt dismissal by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, whose knee-jerk reaction was rendered even more ridiculous by the total absence of any policy on his part.</P>
    <P>Commissioner Fischler outlined three main options for reform of the Common Agricultural Policy, the first being to maintain the <i>status quo</i> which, for want of any constructive policy suggestion, <Col N="529" /> apparently is the Minister's preferred option but not that of the Commissioner. Commissioner Fischler's premise is that, in the light of changing circumstances, the <i>status quo</i> is not sustainable.</P>
    <P>The second option outlined by Commissioner Fischler was for radical reform.  If adopted, such moves probably would range from no support for prices or others very close to world price levels to further decoupling of compensatory payments and their reduction over time.  For example, reducing milk and sugar prices to world levels would necessitate huge transfers of resources if compensation were to be achieved.  For a range of political and economic reasons, Commissioner Fischler has indicated that radical reform is not his preferred option in the short-term.</P>
    <P>The third option outlined by the commissioner is to deepen and widen the 1992 reforms which approach, according to him, implies a reduced reliance on price supports, where necessary, compensated by direct payments whatever may be their concrete form.  The linkage between income support and maintenance of the environment &mdash; already a feature of the rural environmental protection scheme &mdash; would be strengthened in such a scenario, this last option appearing to be that preferred by Commissioner Fischler.</P>
    <P>The lack of coherence in the broader areas of foreign policy, if not tackled, will have a serious impact on our ability to successfully articulate a cogent response to reform of the Common Agricultural Policy.  The internal structures of the European Union are also being subjected to reform, agricultural spending at present ring-fenced until 1999 resulting from intergovernmental agreement.  However, in an evolving European Union, in which the Parliament will have increased powers, that type of commitment may be impossible to achieve and its potential consequences for Irish agriculture extremely serious.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="530" /> Fianna Fáil demand that the Government articulates its definitive position on these crucial structural problems.  We must avoid a scenario in which, because of a lack of planning on the part of the Minister, the Government of the day in 1999, will be placed in the position of running around endeavouring to rearrange the deck chairs on the <i>Titanic.</i></P>
    <P>The long-term prospects of Irish agriculture are being retarded by the Minister's refusal to lead this important debate; having come into office when the policies of his predecessors were bearing fruit, his immediate problems were few and far between.  With the exception of the immediate problem in the sheep sector, the main issues were long-term.  It has become abundantly clear the Minister has given the latter little or no thought, he being typical of an X generation kid, with everything being geared to instant gratification.  If there are no photo opportunities in planning for the future the Minister simply is not interested.</P>
    <P>The determination of the Fianna Fáil Party to pursue reform of the Common Agricultural Policy is based on the following considerations.  In its own right reform of the Common Agricultural Policy is one of the most important economic issues with which Ireland will have to deal in ensuing years.  A shambles of historic proportions looms under this Government's management, the major policy issues being a matter of bitter public disagreement between the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry.  Furthermore, temperamentally, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry is disinclined to admit of lateral thinking.  Most dangerously of all, the Minister has made a political calculation that, come what may, he will not be in Agriculture House in 1999 &mdash; no doubt seeking further evalations in the meantime &mdash; and, accordingly, has no intention of interrupting his rise without trace in Irish politics in order to deal with this or any other difficult issue.</P>
    <P>Regardless of what the Minister may <Col N="531" /> say, enlargement is firmly on the agenda of the European Union.  The challenge to Government is to meet that challenge rather than run away from it.  Basic questions must be answered.  Will the Government move to veto enlargement given the statement of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry?  If, as everybody else in Europe believes, enlargement goes ahead, what are the views of the Government on the conditions for transition?  Should it extend over a five, ten or 15 year period?  What type of transfers should be effected within that period?  The resolution of such questions will have a profound effect on our agriculture sector.</P>
    <P>The Government must begin to articulate its position, otherwise its passivity in the policy area will result in the future of our rural communities being decided in Brussels.  As at present operated, the Common Agricultural Policy is virtually a charter for land clearance.  As matters stand, approximately 60 per cent of Irish farms are small, or moderately small, in terms of economic size. Of these enterprises, non-intensive and non-dairy livestock predominate; in 20 years the number of farms with dairy cows has halved.  In the same period there has been a dramatic shift towards dry stock systems.  This is in spite of the fact that dairying is five times more profitable.  Specialisation has gone hand in hand with a reduction in numbers.</P>
    <P>Eighty-four per cent of dairy cows are on 16 per cent of farms.  The 97,000 dairy producers in 1972 has been reduced to 41,000.  It is officially predicted that if current trends continue &mdash; and it seems that Agriculture House is intent on continuing with present trends &mdash; up to 12,000 dairy farmers will be out of milk production in the next five years.  The small dairy producer is being eliminated.  As matters stand, 50 per cent of producers are trying to survive on only 22 per cent of the quota.  Of the half of all producers trying to survive on less than 40,000 gallons, it is likely that half of them will be out of business in five years.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="532" /> Another disturbing trend is that the prohibitive price of quota is keeping new blood out of the industry.  Prior to the introduction of quota, for every two people leaving milk production, one new entrant was taking up the enterprise. The trend has been not only to bigger and fewer units but, away from the disadvantaged areas.  The acute lack of policy that characterises this Minister's performance is evidenced by the 10 per cent clawback on quota introduced by him.  It will have no effect on the continuing haemorrhage of quota from disadvantaged areas.  This is a classic case of a policy that is in direct variance with what is required.  The Minister's apathy should not obscure the fact that there are many policy instruments available at national level.  What is required is preparedness on the part of the Minister to stand up to vested interests.</P>
    <P>Not only is the national quota slipping into fewer and fewer hands, but a real chance to get more quota and to do something for people on the margins of the industry is being allowed to pass.  In March 1984 when the milk quota regime was introduced, the special position of Ireland and its dependence on dairying was recorded.  It was promised then that in the event of future quota becoming available, Ireland would have a priority claim.  Not only is our claim not being pressed, the Irish quota has been reduced by 9 per cent.  In contrast Italy has secured an 11 per cent increase in quota, while Greece got a 20 per cent increase.  There is a need for the Minister to give a commitment that securing delivery of that promise of extra quota for Ireland will become an urgent priority.</P>
    <P>I am not prepared to accept the argument that this is something Brussels simply will not countenance.  We are seeing huge discrepancies between dairying and dry stock sectors and great variations in income levels within sectors. Even within the dairy sector there are variations.  We have structural problems in our agriculture because we have so many holdings in European terms, <Col N="533" /> but the direction of policy in Agriculture House is to get the money and to send it out in the post and that it does not matter if we have thousands fewer farmers or if in five years time we only have half of the 50,000 farmers whose viability is threatened at the present time.  The policy is to keep up the momentum, to keep the cheques going out in the post and to concentrate on the large sums of money we are getting. No one is looking behind.  The whole thrust of Teagasc, who is supposed to be an advisory service, seems to be to get in the money.  There is no developmental arm in Teagasc at the moment, no planning for the future.  Only recently has the rural economy unit been revitalised, having done nothing for the last ten years in keeping with official policy. Can any Teagasc adviser point to one demonstration farm as an illustration that if farmers involve themselves in that sort of activity they will have a viable family farm in the year 2005? There is not one demonstration farm at the moment because no one seems to know what the situation will be in 2005. We are told that the good times are here, that everyone is reasonably happy and that if some cannot make it that is tough luck.  There is not sufficient debate, and I challenge the Minister to use this opportunity to lead the debate that must take place here if we are to maintain as many people on the land as possible.</P>
    <P>How can we maintain people on the land if there are no new entrants to the most profitable enterprises?  What are we doing about changing the trend for the disadvantaged areas scheme where quota is running out and we are seeing concentration of a national asset in fewer hands?  Commercial farmers will survive the reforms that are coming on-stream but what are we doing for rural economies and rural communities, for the next band of 50,000 farmers whose viability is threatened even before we move into the more competitive forces and more liberalised external trading environment after the next world trade organisation talks?  Are we prepared to <Col N="534" /> initiate policy in Brussels rather than being the policy takers we have been for so long?  Is it not the case that, despite increased output, increased value from the farm gate to our export markets, fewer people are in this business and that every official survey confirms that there will be fewer people in the business in the years to come?  Is that to be our response in policy terms at national level to have viable agriculture for the future?  Thirty years ago Mr. Mansholt was told to go back to Brussels.  We are implementing policies now that would bring about the scenario that Mr. Mansholt predicted.  We are doing it with official agreement, and we are not prepared to go back to Brussels and, in the next phase of CAP, talk about what is happening now and do something about it.</P>
    <P>According to the farm survey of 1994, there are huge variations between the sectors &mdash; 57 per cent of the beef herd are on dairy farms.  We are seeing concentration of profitability in fewer hands and more farmers going to the wall.  We have advisory services which are not planning for the future, which are not dealing with people who are on the margins and whose viability is threatened.  Rather we are concentrating in making sure that they make their returns and that they are commercial in terms of generating income.  That is as far as we are looking in terms of our agricultural research and advisory services. That is not good enough.  If we continue this way, we will end up with just 50,000 or 60,000 farmers, and what impact will that have on rural communities and rural economy in the future?  It will have a serious impact and the social implications of these reforms will have to be taken into account.</P>
    <P>We are heading for a more liberalised trading environment.  We have certain competitive advantages.  The fact that we have a grassland based agriculture can make us more competitive than others.  The one sector that, because of the strength of vested interests, did not undergo the changes that took place in the other sectors in the CAP reform, <Col N="535" /> was the dairy sector where prices are still subsidised.  We have not seen that in regard to beef where we implemented direct payment and compensatory measures instead.  That will change but we are making no effort, and no new entrants are going into the most profitable enterprise in agriculture which is dairying.  Official predictions are that fewer farmers will be in this business. The co-operatives would love to have just five people to collect their milk from outside the gate if possible, because that would reduce their costs, but in terms of the country and the impact on our rural communities that is an unacceptable scenario.</P>
    <P>It is time we made hard choices, took a pro-active approach and went into the country to talk to farmers' representative organisations and to farm families, and took some tough decisions to ensure we do not end up with a land clearance policy which it seems will be the outcome of the CAP reform.  We do not know where we will stand after 1999.  Whatever about plan B?  Plan A is a blank sheet at the moment and this is not acceptable.</P>
    <P>There are opportunities.  The on-farm investment schemes should be a powerful instrument for policy to help secure viability on smaller holdings.  We have failed to give priority to those areas where there has been a serious lack of investment in the last few years.  Those farmers cannot and will not be able to compete in the second phase of CAP reform if we are not in a position to allow investment in those farms to make them more competitive.</P>
    <P>The Teagasc <i>Agricultural Research Forum</i> which was published earlier this year put it better than anyone when it said:</P>
    <P>This vision of a three track farming system is based on the assumption that the pathways for future adjustment are already fixed by the structure which has evolved over three decades and by the limits set by the <Col N="536" /> external market and policy environment. An alternative scenario would see this prospect as too passive a stance to take for a country which is so dependent on its natural resources.  It would claim that the shaping of structural change in farming is not altogether dictated by inevitable and external forces.</P>
    <P>It would argue for the full manipulation of those levers that we in Ireland can control for ourselves in the pursuit of a model of development best suited to our circumstances. It might see possibilities in having research and development capacity more expressly focused around the different sets of problems of different regions in the country.  It would seek a more optimal balance than at present between palliative support measures and the required supports for resource development.</P>
    <P>There is need for more systematic thought and study on these or other options for the future of farming and other resources.</P>
    <P>To put it another way, the Minister should get on his bike.  There is a need for a greater policy input and a greater attempt to start deciding what our priorities are and fighting for them as the second phase of the CAP reform procedures begins.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to speak on this motion, the last words of which are &ldquo;to maintain as many viable farm holdings on the land as possible&rdquo;.  It is to this aim that we should give our attention.  I have been consistently critical of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry for not conducting a review, especially in areas like Mayo and other small farm regions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This time last year we were looking to 1995 with great expectations.  We recommended that people fill out the control of farmyard pollution forms.  In my constituency over 1,000 applied under the scheme.  At present, the <Col N="537" /> Department is dealing with last December's applications and hundreds of people who hoped to have buildings provided were cut off last spring.</P>
    <P>The food industry is on its knees as far as competitiveness and the exchange rate are concerned.  There are difficulties on small farms with cattle production. In November the IBEC news report carried an article stating that the food sector needs help now to ensure competitiveness with the UK.  The area from which I come has no worthwhile inward investment and no international companies.  The primary producers in the area depend completely on the food industry.  Last year we believed that the operational programme and INTERREG presented a great opportunity for job creation.  Over the last few months the Irish pound has been strengthening against sterling and hard earned markets in British multiple stores are in doubt.  Rather than expanding as people thought they would last year, they are doing well to maintain the <i>status quo.</i></P>
    <P>A group from the constituency came to Dublin to meet representatives from the IDA and Forbairt.  There is talk of a £200 million investment in the Border region under INTERREG, the operational programme, Leader, the county enterprise boards and the IFI.  In our discussions with the IDA and Forbairt we were told that they could get industries into the counties of Cavan and Monaghan if they had the money to build factories.  They have no money and moreover no remit from the Government to assist the development of the peace initiative in the Border counties.  They have no programme for factory building and they told us to build the factories and they would look for somebody to go into them.  That is not good enough.  Hard earned markets should be recognised and everything possible done to retain them.</P>
    <P>I mentioned the farm pollution scheme.  As I said, 1,088 people in my constituency applied and then the scheme was cut.  This is similar to what the Coalition Government did in 1983 when it slashed the farm grants.  They <Col N="538" /> have slashed them again and processed a trickle of applications.</P>
    <P>There has been much talk of alternative farm enterprises and there are many areas which we should examine with a view to developing markets.  A recent report by the nutrition advisory group stated that Ireland has the lowest consumption of fruit and vegetables in the EU.  That is disgraceful.  I asked a parliamentary question about the importation of frozen chips, crisps and so on.  Some 50,000 tonnes, worth £28 million, are imported in a year.  Those are areas which the Minister should examine because they present opportunities for job creation.  There is an opportunity to do away with import substitution but there is nothing being done in that area.</P>
    <P>A few months ago a group of free range egg producers told me that their adviser had been given different work and they now had no one to advise them.  There are 55 flocks in the constituency representing alternative enterprises to supplement dwindling farm income.  Some 39 of them in the Cavan area have 1,000 hens each while 16 in the Monaghan area have 500 hens. They are now dependent on a poultry adviser from Dublin.  There are two poultry advisers in the alternative farm enterprise section &mdash; one in Cork and another in Dublin.  This is the rejection people face when they try to develop alternative farm enterprises.</P>
    <P>I put down a parliamentary question in June to ask the Minister when the results of a study on dry stock farmers' income would be available.  The reply was that the results of the study, being carried out by the economic unit of the Department in conjunction with experts from Teagasc and agricultural inspectors within the Department, would be presented to the Minister in September. I rang the Department today and was told that the report was not yet completed and that I should check again in the New Year.  If the Minister is serious about an area with a low return of income it should not take six to eight months to carry out a survey.  I ask the Minister to address this right away.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="539" /> A number of co-ops in the Border area are asking for a peace dividend milk quota for farmers below the 30,000 gallon threshold.  They base their case on the benefits this could have for milk producers on both sides of the Border. It would have the effect of fostering good relations and common interest between farmers of different political viewpoints and it would be a positive initiative in support of the small dairy farmers in the region.  Within the EU approved operational programme 1995 to 1997 to promote peace and reconciliation in Northern Ireland and the Border counties, there is scope for both the Irish and British Governments to cooperate at a practical level in implementing a scheme to achieve an EU allocation of a peace dividend milk quota to the small dairy farmers as well as a chance to secure a long-term viable future for family farmers in the Border area.</P>
    <P>It has been established that the only long-term future in farming is in milk production.  The impact of the value of additional quotas would be enormous. Each one million gallon milk quota is worth £1.5 million.  That would support 80 extra jobs.</P>
    <P>As regards TB eradication, it is time to pay special attention to black spot areas.  Fianna Fáil provided extra resources and manpower for this before leaving office.  I hope this Government does the same and comes to grips with TB eradication.  Some 27 per cent of County Monaghan is disadvantaged and was not reclassified as severely handicapped. An irrefutable case could be made to include a large proportion of that area and an appeals system should be established to make that case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute briefly on this motion, the subject matter of which is immensely important.  In his contribution Deputy Cowen mentioned that the three options outlined by the Commission are to maintain the <i>status quo,</i> carry out radical reform of CAP and <Col N="540" /> develop or build on the 1992 reform.  All deserve careful consideration.</P>
      <P>Initially the response I received from those involved in the agriculture industry favoured building on the reforms already in place or maintaining the <i>status quo.</i> Those two options are attractive to farmers but they contain difficulties for the industry.  All sectors involved in the industry &mdash; farmers, agri-business, the Department and elected representatives &mdash; must carefully consider the future of the CAP.</P>
      <P>The Government should initiate the widest possible consultation and debate on the future of farming beyond the end of this century.  Agriculture must have a secure future as it is vitally important for the good health of the economy.  The reforms of the CAP initiated and carried out by Commissioner MacSharry have been of tremendous benefit.  The last few years have seen a considerable growth in farm income with consequential spin-off benefits for all sectors of the economy.</P>
      <P>My constituency of Cavan-Monaghan is one where food and agriculture dominate in terms of employment and account for over one-third of the workforce. The combination of heavy drumlin soil and small farm units resulted in low farm incomes with much underemployment. While the poultry, mushroom and pig industries are well developed, associated employment is of a part-time nature.  Industry consists of medium to small type businesses with only eight manufacturing industries employing more than 200 people; the majority, 64 per cent, employ fewer than 15.  Dairying is the major income earner in the north-east and north-west of this country.  Unfortunately, too many farmers have totally inadequate milk quotas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the lakelands catchment area the number of quota holders declined by 2,217, representing a decline of 36.4 per cent, between 1983 and 1993.  The drop in the co-ops' milk pool of almost 6 per cent represents a serious loss of income for the economy of the area.  In 1984 it was understood that we would obtain <Col N="541" /> additional milk quotas but this has not come to fruition.</P>
    <P>At Question Time recently I raised the issue of seeking an additional quota for both sides of the Border region. Deputy Leonard made the case adequately.  The programme to promote peace and reconciliation is an obvious mechanism through which to seek an additional quota as two of the stated aims are to promote rural and urban regeneration and create employment. This is particularly important in that the majority of farmers on both sides of the Border depend on dairying.  It accounts for one-third of the gross agricultural output of the region.  The provision of additional milk quotas would help to regenerate that economy and its positive effects would be obvious immediately.</P>
    <P>In order to secure a long-term viable future for family farms in Border counties that additional quota is needed.  It is particularly relevant to note that farmers on both sides of the Border share similar problems.  The majority of them depend on dairying and because of the restricted milk quota regime, which has been in operation for some years, farmers' income is not sufficient to sustain viable family farms.  The farm family population is in the decline with a consequent loss of economic and social benefit to the rural community in general.</P>
    <P>I instanced the serious decline in the number of milk quota holders in the lakelands catchment area.  That decline has serious consequences for the population of the area because of the importance of dairying in creating farm income and employment in the agri-industry.  If farming is to survive into the next century additional milk quotas must be made available.</P>
    <P>Recently the Minister stated that the average family farm income in less favoured areas increased to two-thirds of the national average.  Obviously, CAP reform compensatory payments had a significant impact on income in those areas but further supportive measures are needed.  The Minister and the <Col N="542" /> Department must realise and act on the basis that agriculture is the single most important sector in the north and west of this country.  Its role in the economy in that area is twice as great as that in the economy as a whole.</P>
    <P>In order to maintain viable rural communities the maximum level of dairy production and processing must be maintained.  We need vibrant and labour intensive agricultural enterprise.  When one accepts the need to promote economic regeneration and balanced regional development, then the case to provide additional milk quotas cannot be contested.</P>
    <P>I welcome the ring fencing of quotas in disadvntaged areas.  The subsidisation of quota restructuring is essential. Action is needed to prevent the loss of quota from those vulnerable areas. Another important incentive to retain quotas in those areas is to have grant schemes administered in such a way that they do not hinder a farmer in carrying out necessary improvements and making necessary on-farm investments.</P>
    <P>I know from contacts with people in the agri-industry that they are concerned about the reduction in export refunds.  Such decisions seem to be made on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis.  This is not acceptable and makes planning practically impossible.  Markets for milk powder and other products to countries such as Mexico depend on adequate export refunds being in place.  It is not acceptable to have decisions made on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis that affect the availability of supply to markets which, by their nature, necessitate long-term planning and continuity of supply and price.</P>
    <P>One of my fears about increasing the role and extent of direct payments under CAP reform is the easy way such assistance could be dismantled.  Increasing the scope of direct payments might appear attractive but it could be a short-term attraction.  Paying for production would be a better philosophy.  In discussing possible options on the reform of CAP the Government and the EU Commission must be mindful of the farm bill which will be discussed by the <Col N="543" /> US Government and Congress.  Their decision on whether to increase or eliminate farm supports will be crucial to world farming.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, many producers in the Border region, where dairy farming is crucial, encounter serious difficulties in increasing their quota and upgrading their on-farm facilities.  Those farmers want facilities put in place to meet relevant hygiene standards.  The dairy hygiene scheme introduced by the Minister's predecessor, Deputy Walsh, was targeted specifically at small producers. The number of approvals issued in County Cavan under that scheme, as outlined in a recent reply to a parliamentary question, make poor reading. The same applies to the control of farmyard pollution scheme.  I appeal to the Minister to increase the number of approvals under those schemes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;particular,&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;approves of the Government's policy in relation to negotiations on the future development of the European Union and in particular their intention to protect the interests of the Irish agriculture, food and rural sectors.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the debate.  It provides an opportunity for Members to debate an important issue and for me to set out the Government's policy in that regard. I enjoyed Deputy Cowen's rather colourful anecdotes which portrayed me as a short-sighted Minister, rudderless, without policies or planning and only interested in photo opportunities.  While this may make good Dáil sketch material, it is far from reality.  My Department has forcibly set out a dual strategy for Irish agriculture with the objectives of achieving an internationally competitive food industry with an additional market share and less <Col N="544" /> dependence on intervention and EU subsidies and maximising the number of family farms here and in Europe.  That is our dual strategy and all policies are aimed towards those overall objectives.</P>
    <P>The motion in the names of Deputies Cowen, Byrne, Ellis and Nolan has been prompted by the EU Commission's communication on the effect of enlargement and the accompanying agricultural strategy paper.  The motion demands Government action on foot of what is described, in their words, as &ldquo;the EU Commission proposals for change&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The first point to be made is that there are no such proposals, neither of these Commission documents contains any proposals.  They are discussion documents and extremely important discussion documents.  They have their origins in a request of the European Council which met at Essen in December 1994 for &ldquo;an analysis of the effects of enlargement in the context of the Union's current policies and their future development&rdquo;.  This request followed from the decision of the European Council in Copenhagen in June 1993 that &ldquo;the associated countries in Central and Eastern Europe that so desire shall become members of the European Union&rdquo;.  The Commission's documents will be on the table for discussion at the next meeting of the European Council which will be held in Madrid on 15 and 16 December.</P>
    <P>There are at least ten countries in Central and Eastern Europe that are potential members of the European Union.  Poland, Hungary, Slovakia, Lativa, Estonia and Romania have applied for membership and the Czech Republic, Bulgaria, Lithuania and Slovenia have declared their intention to do so.  In addition, Cyprus and Malta have also applied for membership.</P>
    <P>Enlargement of the Union to include the ten Central and Eastern European countries would add 106 million to the population of the Union and 1.1 million square kilometres to its area.  The increase in the Union's population and area would be 29 per cent and 33 per <Col N="545" /> cent respectively.  However, the combined GDP of the ten represents less than an estimated 4 per cent of the GDP of the existing Union.  The average GDP per head in the applicant countries is about 30 per cent of the Union average, with Romania, at 16 per cent, at the bottom of the range and Slovenia, at just over 50 per cent, at the top.  Each of these countries is still, to a greater or lesser degree, in the process of transition from a centrally controlled economy to a market economy.  The immediate impact of the change was a deep recession, from which recovery has been gradual and variable.</P>
    <P>On average 7.5 per cent of the applicant countries' GDP is derived from agriculture compared with 2.5 per cent in the case of the Union as a whole.  The proportion employed in agriculture in the applicant countries is 26.7 per cent on average compared with 5.7 per cent in the Union as a whole.  These averages mask a wide variation in range.  The Czech Republic has the lowest dependence on agriculture, with only 3.3 per cent of its GDP and 5.6 per cent of its population dependent on it.  At the other extreme, more than 20 per cent of Romania's GDP and 35 per cent of its population is dependent on agriculture. Those figures reveal that the countries of Central and Eastern Europe do not have similar economies, they are at different stages of development and their size and dependence on agriculture also differs.</P>
    <P>Recent studies conducted by the Agricultural Directorate of the European Commission identified three key structural problems facing the agriculture and food sectors of these countries. Access to capital is the first difficulty. Producers have little spare cash to invest, the State cannot afford to intervene and banks will not accept land over which there are ownership disputes as collateral.  Poor farm structures pose another difficulty.  Many farms are too small to achieve economies of scale and others that operated under centralised controlled bureaucracies are too large to be efficiently managed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="546" /> There are also structural problems in the servicing and processing sectors of the food industry.  Many upstream and downstream firms servicing agriculture or processing its products are still State owned, monopolistic and inefficient. The studies carried out by the Commission conclude that &ldquo;By the end of the decade supply and demand patterns in CEEC agriculture could be expected to have adjusted to the transition shock&rdquo;.  The report also states:</P>
    <P>In most countries, completion of land reform and restructuring of the food chain will take at least till the end of the decade, while farm structures could be expected to evolve even slower as the capability of agriculture to attract investment will remain limited.</P>
    <P>... the CEECs would be less in need of a high level of price and income support for their farmers than of targeted assistance for the restructuring, modernisation and diversification of their productive capacity in agriculture and the downstream sectors and for improvement of their rural infrastructure.</P>
    <P>It is clear therefore that it will take until the end of the decade at least for the majority of the CEECs to have reached a stage where, in the words of the communiqué issued by the European Council at its Copenhagen meeting, they will have &ldquo;the capacity to cope with competitive pressure and market forces within the Union&rdquo; in the food production sector at least.</P>
    <P>Negotiations on the terms of accession of at least two applicants, Cyprus and Malta, will commence six months after the conclusion of the Intergovernmental Conference and take into account its outcome.  The conference which is expected to commence next year during the Italian Presidency will address, <i>inter alia,</i> the conditions necessary for the proper functioning of the Union's institutions after enlargement. It is my experience that the <i>tour <Col N="547" /> de table</i> with 15 member states is somewhat unwieldy.  In any expansion all facets of the decision making process will have to be examined.  That will be the purpose of the Intergovernmental Conference.</P>
    <P>In relation to the Commission's discussion documents to which a number of Deputies referred, the Commission's strategy paper published last week identified three possible options for the Common Agricultural Policy in the context of enlargement.  Under the <i>status quo</i> option, the CAP would be extended to the new emerging states in Central and Eastern Europe.  In the broader external and internal context of the turn of the century, the Commission considers that such an approach may turn out to be short sighted and that a major drawback with this option is that EU agriculture will become increasingly constrained in its development.  This option would involve full acceptance of the regime of quotas and restricted output.</P>
    <P>On the one hand, even without enlargement to the east, yields will continue to increase and lead to further production growth in a number of key sectors, including cereals and beef and excluding sugar and milk where production quotas exist.  On the other hand, the quantity of subsidised exports is limited and may, in the context of further international trade negotiations, become even more restricted in the future.  During the next five to six years, starting from 1 July this year, the volume and value of export subsidies beyond the Union wll be constrained. Before the next GATT Round we will have that limitation.</P>
    <P>Neither, in the Commission's view, is internal demand going to increase substantially. In such circumstances growing surpluses could lead again to major market imbalances in the existing 15 member states.  The Commission concludes that enlargement to the east under <i>status quo</i> conditions for the CAP would add to the emerging market <Col N="548" /> imbalance and accelerate the deterioration. In simple terms, the new member states would have to be absorbed within the existing quota structure.</P>
    <P>Eventually the Commission expects that the situation could become increasingly untenable from a market and budgetary point of view and a major CAP reform would probably be unavoidable and inevitable.  Each reform after enlargement runs the risk of being particularly difficult, in terms of securing agreement, and costly.  Since farmers in the CEECs would have enjoyed high EU prices for a number of years they would have to be compensated at least for price cuts that take place after enlargement in the same way as their colleagues in the west.  The Commission concludes that the <i>status quo</i> option which appears to be logical at present would present major long-term market and budgetary problems. Clearly, it does not favour that approach.</P>
    <P>The second option is radical reform. Proposals for further radical reform of the CAP have been presented by some agricultural economists both in the context of and independently from the question of further enlargement.  In general, such proposals involve the abolition of price support or a reduction to world market price levels, time limited income compensation and abolition of quotas and other supply management measures.  Direct income payments and payments of an environmental nature would be on a national basis with or without Union co-financing.</P>
    <P>Although such a radical reform would involve large scale financial savings once compensation payments ended, it would imply a number of social and environmental risks which at least in some regions could lead to negative effects.  It would also, initially, before the phasing out of compensatory payments, require extra budgetary resources.  For example, if world prices were introduced for milk and sugar with full compensation, direct payment costs would be between £8 billion and £12 billion.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="549" /> The Commission recognises that if such payments were to be made directly from member state budgets, the question of economic and social cohesion would arise and transfer payments between member states would become necessary to bridge the gap between the richer and poorer countries to get the system to work.  Consequently, Union control over agricultural policy would be difficult to maintain.  In fairness, the Commission does not advocate this approach.</P>
    <P>This option would involve a move towards world prices and we would run the risk of renationalising the compensatory aids.  That is the worst case scenario from Ireland's point of view and I am glad the Commission has rejected it.  Unlke the Germans and the French, the Exchequer could not afford such national aid.  This would undermine the principle behind the CAP and of co-financing.</P>
    <P>The third option explored by the Commission is the extension of the 1992 CAP reform process.  This would involve a reduced level of price support compensated, where necessary, by direct payments.  Lower prices would enable the Union to participate more fully in the expansion of world trade. Given the existing and possible future limitations on subsidised exports, the ability to export without subsidies will, the strategy paper argues, become more and more crucial.  Equally, it is the case that growing competition in the Internal Market through increased market access will further emphasise the importance of competitiveness.</P>
    <P>The strategy paper also identifies the environmental and social aspects of the direct payments currently in place and raises the issue of strengthening these links.  These direct income payments include headage premia in respect of the social aspects and grants under the REPS in respect of the environmental aspects.  The paper also suggests that a further move away from market support to income support would allow greater <Col N="550" /> freedom to member states in the implementation of EU legislation, in particular in the field of income support policies.</P>
    <P>It is the conclusion of the Commission that a resolute continuation of the 1992 reform approach would cause less economic distortion than the other options. It would, in the Commission's view also tend to facilitate future integration of the CEECs.</P>
    <P>The attitude of the Government and its predecessors to the question of enlargement, as expressed in the Conclusions of the Copenhagen and subsequent meetings of the European Council, is open and positive.  The Copenhagen European Council Conclusions state:</P>
    <P>The associated countries in Central and Eastern Europe that so desire shall become members of the Union. Accession will take place as soon as a country is able to assume the obligations of membership by satisfying the economic and political conditions.</P>
    <P>That remains the position of the Government.  We believe that enlargement is necessary to consolidate peace and stability in Europe.  We also believe that enlargement can bring greater prosperity to existing and prospective member states by increasing trade and investment opportunities, provided the overall conditions are right.</P>
    <P>To achieve those conditions the process of enlargement should respect a number of key principles.  Applicant countries should accept Union policies as they have evolved to date.  The common policies should not be changed to meet conditions in applicant countries. This has been a guiding principle which has been applied to all previous enlargements and should continue to be respected.  Derogations will be required, but these will have to be temporary.  The transitional periods &mdash; in effect, the timescale for derogations &mdash; should vary with the applicant country to take account of the varying degrees of difficulty in the implementation by the applicants of Union policies on the one <Col N="551" /> hand and possible absorption difficulties which the Union may have on the other.</P>
    <P>Agreement will have to be reached in advance by the existing member states that the financial resources necessary for the continued implementation of Union policies in the existing as well as the new member states will have to be provided, in other words, budgetary approval will have to be given in advance by the existing 15 member states.</P>
    <P>The principle of common financing of the CAP must be fully respected.  The maintenance of this fundamental principle is an essential condition for the Government.  To ensure there is no ambiguity the principle of common financing and not renationalising is fundamental. Also within the Union institutions there should be a comprehensive study of and debate on the effects of enlargement on each of the agriculture sectors to ascertain what problems may lie ahead and satisfactory solutions will have to be found and agreed for them. The implications for the dairy sector, the various meat sectors, the grain sector and the veterinary sector will have to be carefully and individually studied in specific detail.</P>
    <P>As I stated earlier, if the conditions are right, the enlargement of the Union will bring major benefits to all member states.  The consolidation of peace and stability which will result is not only a highly desirable objective in itself, it will also provide the framework without which economic and social development is, at best, retarded and within which business confidence is nurtured leading to investment and growth.  Already the evidence for that substantial growth potential is there: since 1989, exports from the EU to the applicant countries have tripled while their exports to the EU have doubled.  It must be acknowledged that a substanital trade imbalance exists in the EU's favour at present.</P>
    <P>In considering the broader European picture, however, I have no intention of <Col N="552" /> overlooking the problems that may lie ahead for Ireland.  There is, of course, the potential for difficulties for Ireland deriving from enlargement.  However, I am determined that Ireland's interests will be fully secured.  They will be, if the enlargement process is conducted by respecting the principles to which I have referred.  In that event, the 140,000 farmers that make up the Irish agricultural sector and the 40,000 employees that make up the Irish food sector need have nothing to fear.  On the contrary, I believe that the basis for further advances will have been laid.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, the motion in the name of Deputies Cowen, Byrne, Ellis and Nolan is misguided.  It attempts to address proposals which have not been made.  The Commission's documents are a basis for discussion, in the first place at the Madrid European Council meeting later this month.  We have opened a debate, rather than commenced a process, in relation to the CAP.</P>
    <P>The approach which the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste will adopt at that meeting will be along the lines that I have indicated to the House.  That, I and the Government believe, is the correct approach at this stage.  As the enlargement process continues, the Government will adopt more detailed positions in defence of the Irish agriculture, food and rural sectors, in line with the same general principles as will inform our approach in Madrid.  For these reasons, I commend the amendment to the motion to the House.</P>
    <P>A number of points were raised with which I want to deal, having set out, in concrete terms, the Government's exact position.  This matter was discussed by the Council of Ministers, in the context of agriculture, on Wednesday night last. The Irish position, as I have outlined it, of commitment to the CAP found a real resonance among other member states. While not wishing to pre-empt the public position of any member state, I believe that the fundamental principles of the CAP have very strong support among the key member states in the Union.  This is something which has <Col N="553" /> taken many years to build and accounts for 45 per cent of the Union's total budget.  I do not believe it will be dismantled.</P>
    <P>The entire process of detailed decisions on enlargement will only be taken following the Intergovernmental Conference.  The Intergovernmental Conference will commence under the Italian presidency.  Ireland will play a key role during its own presidency.  I do not know when the Intergovernmental Conference will end.  However, the decisions on the institutional and other arrangements arising from the Intergovernmental Conference must be put in place before the questions in relation to the CAP can be addressed.</P>
    <P>I wish to make clear that there is no need for panic among farmers or others in the food processing sector.  These events will take place a considerable way down the road.  Deputy Cowen made the point that the Department has no planning process.  I wish to make it clear that some of the photo opportunities for which I am so criticised all took place in relation to the key national food strategy.  The investment of £640 million was aimed at providing a long-term direction to the application of innovation, technology and marketing expenditure towards becoming less dependent on the CAP and developing a more vibrant, competitive and dynamic food industry.  I am conscious of the fact that that is the future direction of food policy.  Whatever daily decisions I make, the ultimate objective of winning extra market share for the Irish food sector and developing process technology, products, etc., is absolutely critical in this regard.  There should be no misunderstanding in relation to this issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>That brings me to my next point.  I will not take a cheap shot by inquiring with regard to what was done in relation to the national milk quota between 1984 and 1994.  However, am I <Col N="554" /> to suddenly parachute into Brussels and obtain an extra milk quota for Ireland? The milk quota regime is embedded.  I would be interested to hear from Deputy Cowen with regard to what is Fianna Fáil's direction in relation to milk?</P>
      <P>The price of a gallon of milk in New Zealand, and the régime there, is such that unlimited production exists.  There are no quotas.  People can produce as much milk as they like and new entrants can follow a career in dairy farming. However, the price of milk in New Zealand is 56 pence per gallon.  The price of milk in Ireland is 113 pence per gallon, roughly double that of New Zealand. Europe is faced with a choice.  The best way to retain small viable rural holdings is through milk quota; milk quota at a price; milk quota which is heavily subsidised in relation to the price of milk. With regard to all the dairy, ice cream and butter supports which exist in terms of export subsidies, I believe it is in Ireland's interests to have a strong support system which permits clear profitability. It is generally agreed that the cost of producing a gallon of milk varies, from the most efficient to the most inefficient, between 40 and 70 pence per gallon.</P>
      <P>I wish to make clear that simply allowing access to new entrants and ignoring the super-levy is desirable, but, when the details are considered, it is apparent that a serious market imbalance would be created in terms of overproduction of milk.  We must remember that 60 per cent of the dairy exports outside Europe could not be carried out without substantial aid and supports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will not indulge in an endless period of navel-gazing.  I will proceed with the job of vigorously defending the Irish farm and food sector and setting out a clear context and plan for its future development in terms of a national food strategy.  With the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste, I will articulate &mdash; in Government, this House and Brussels &mdash; a clear policy that Ireland's political commitment is to maintain the social and rural fabric of Europe.  We do not believe in <Col N="555" /> denuding Europe of family farms.  We believe that the essential income supports should be sustained and market balances should be adhered to within our overall GATT obligations.  I ask the House to accept my amendment.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for providing a very broad outline of his views on reform of the CAP.  While the Minister stated that he and the Government are open to, and positive about, reform, he also stated that he will not accept the motion.  I regret this but I hope the debate will be of some assistance in relation to the Madrid European Council meeting.  I am glad that support for the Common Agricultural Policy exists within the European Union.  I would not like to see the process of reforms, particularly those carried out by Commissioner MacSharry which provided a significant boost to small farmers in the west being dismantled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that proposals have been made by the European Commission. Since the European Union may expand to include up to ten countries from Central and Eastern Europe, I hope we will consider closely the three options proposed: the <i>status quo,</i> radical reform of the Common Agricultural Policy and development of the 1992 reforms.  The Minister explained that each of these options have major implications for farmers and everybody employed in the agri-food sector.  Those of us who are interested in the future of Irish agriculture, particularly the farming organisations, public representatives, the agri-food industry and the Government, must examine the Commission's proposal in some detail and quickly agree on an Irish position. The objectives must be clearly defined during the course of a major debate on <Col N="556" /> the future of the Common Agriculture Policy which is certain to follow publication of the Commission's White Paper.</P>
    <P>We should rule out the option of radical reform of the CAP.  Such a development would risk dismantling the CAP and would not be in Ireland's interest. On the maintenance of the <i>status quo,</i> which has been of benefit to farmers, as the Commission points out, that option would risk provoking a major reform after the Eastern European countries have joined the Union.  The Commission's view is that we should develop the 1992 reforms, and the Minister spoke along those lines.  That could have many attractions from an Irish point of view but it would pose the risk of renationalising the CAP, which would not be in Ireland's interest.  Our priority should be to examine these options and take a definite position, with strong emphasis on small family farms &mdash; the Minister referred to family farms and rural development.</P>
    <P>One of my recent major concerns has been store producers and smaller farmers in the west.  The 25 per cent reduction in export refunds affects Irish farmers, particularly small producers &mdash; that represents a reduction of 40 per cent in export refunds since last September. Many allegations have been made as to why that happened.  The IFA stated that beef producers made a concerted effort to reduce beef prices as a result of the scare on refunds, but there is no basis for these price reductions.  I understand last week there was only a partial restoration of the refund cuts and the industry is very dissatisfied with the small increase.  The Minister will have to fight very hard in that regard. Export refunds have been a very effective method of dealing with beef production, particularly in regard to third countries.  To pick the sector at the bottom of the profit scale of European agriculture defies explanation.</P>
    <P>The Commission's decision, which effectively contributes to instability in a sector that merits quite the opposite treatment, is ill-advised, particularly <Col N="557" /> since we were told that the cut was on foot of allegations about certain practices that had not been proven.  Such knee-jerk reactions are unacceptable. Allegations must be fully investigated.  If there are wrong doings they must be corrected, but it is irresponsible to impose such measures before an investigation takes place.  We are lucky that people in the business are wise enough to buy stock well into spring and therefore there should be no reduction in prices.  However if the Commission continues along these lines in other sectors, agriculture will have a very bleak future.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to some of the points made by the Minister, particularly on the milk sector.  For some time I have heard suggestions about a B quota system. If such a system is introduced the smaller dairy producer will be badly affected.  I would be totally opposed to the introduction of such a quota.  The Minister spoke about the position in New Zealand and Australia, but the world market for European product has reduced significantly &mdash; between 1980 and 1994 production dropped from 16.6 per cent to 11.1 per cent, with a reduction of approximately 50 per cent in dairy exports.  If GATT was as successful as it should have been, every other participating country should have experienced reduced production also, but New Zealand and Australia increased production on the world market by 53 per cent.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that when we cut back production it is not for the benefit of other producing countries; I would like to think it is for the benefit of the farmer.  The supervisers of GATT are at fault in that they have not penalised those who are guilty in that respect. Europe's answer is simple: release quota and increase production.  To introduce a B quota would be the worst evil because our farmers would be expected to produce milk at 70p per gallon, to sell to a marketplace where the price is £1.10 per gallon and where people allegedly claim they are not subsidised. Since the Minister referred to New Zealand and Australia, we have <Col N="558" /> granted to those countries a tonnage of butter at prices equal to our own.  They supply the market and take the profit which they use against the European Union and the rest of the world.  They claim the price charged is a world price, but we in the EU are the subsidisers of that price.  A B quota should not be introduced because farmers are not capable of producing milk at 70p per gallon and the consumer does not require them to do so.</P>
    <P>It is significant that the Irish Dairy Board has not addressed the key issue of a B quota and the impact on farm incomes, which at the end of the day is the real issue.  Some people believe that a B quota is a priority in other member states of the EU.  It may be a priority among processors and marketeers, and in some instances national policy makers, but it is not a priority for farm producers. For example, in France a recent statement was to the effect that the introduction of a B quota would destroy milk prices and directly reduce incomes. There are many ways to proceed with the A quota.  For example, the African nations, the developing countries where population is estimated to increase from 620 million to 900 million in the next ten years, must be taken into account as a new marketplace for our products.</P>
    <P>We owe a huge debt to our young farmers because of the mismanagement of the milk quota to date and the promises made to them when they were prepared to take over farms and try to make them viable.  The assurances given by Governments and the European Commission regarding start-up quotas were not adhered to.  That debt which is owed to a vibrant part of our society must be met.  I see no problem with increase the A quota, in a planned way, to meet the needs of today and help young farmers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion as proposed by Deputy Cowen. Being used to Brussels-speak, it is not usual for a European Union Commissioner to convey a clear message when outlining Community farm policy <Col N="559" /> for the next ten years or so, but a blunt and bad news message is even more unusual considering the Commissioner in question is a former Austrian Minister for Agriculture.  The message was simple &mdash; more changes in the CAP are inevitable and are on the way.  Many of my farmer friends were most critical of Ray MacSharry when in reality he did a fantastic job for Irish agriculture.  Now that he is no longer a Commissioner for Agriculture we all realise what a big loss he is.  He was much criticised by the Minister's party who told us about his Cromwellian tactics and claimed that the collapse of Irish agriculture was inevitable.  Instead it prospered.  He saved the day and we have a vibrant and strong agricultural sector.  The Minister is reaping the rewards derived from proposals of a Fianna Fáil Government which put agriculture on a proper footing.</P>
      <P>The future of our economy depends on how the Minister handles the proposed CAP reforms.  We need to be well positioned to meet the challenges to current agricultural policy.  These challenges hold greater importance for urban than for rural Ireland.  People who live in urban areas are probably more dependent on agriculture and related services than those living in rural areas and on small farms.  Munster is heavily dependent on the agricultural industry.  The boom in agriculture has resulted in increased employment in many dairy co-ops, beef processing industries and bacon and pork factories across Munster, the east coast and the west.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The extra money mooted for Leader schemes pales beside the loss of even 1p per gallon in the price of milk.  The current blueprint as set out in Dr. Franz Fischler's paper on agriculture is a reform of reforms.  Already Dutch and French farmers are pressing for changes in the set aside schemes and in quota restrictions.  We are all aware of the large factory farms in the Netherlands. Many of their dairy herds housed in intensive units never see the light of day <Col N="560" /> and are fed from grain grown in other countries and well preserved fodder grown in their country.  Any reform of the Common Agricultural Policy in that area will help to develop Dutch agriculture. The French have large ranch-type farms in the Paris Basin, in the grain growing and dairy and beef farming area.  We are aware of the changes in CAP they would favour to give them an edge to develop an industrial type of agriculture which is not in the interests of countries similar to ours.</P>
    <P>Some European agricultural products are coming close to being set at open prices on the world market.  The Minister is aware of that position and he will be further aware of it if he survives for another year and a half on the opposite side of the House.  We must never forget that, despite the silver tongues of Carla Hills and Mickey Kantor, the United States system of subsidising farms continues, but in a totally different way from our price support mechanism. While European prices and world prices may be converging in some cases, that is not so in the case of our country's principal agricultural products, beef, milk and sugar beet.</P>
    <P>The MacSharry reforms allow for compensation payments.  Any reduction, of these payments, phased or otherwise, must be resisted in our national interest. In the tough negotiations ahead, we will rely on the Minister to follow the Fianna Fáil-MacSharry act and the Fianna Fáil party policy.  The Minister will receive my support and that of my party, but he will have to carry the day in the interests of Irish agriculture.</P>
    <P>In case there is any doubt about the Commissioner's blunt warning.  I would like to review briefly the forces seeking further changes in the CAP, apart from continuing complaints from the UK and other countries about its high cost.  The forces to which I refer include those involved in the next round of world negotiations in the year 2000.  That is only four years away and we all remember the tough negotiations which took place two years ago.  The next round could have devastating consequences <Col N="561" /> for our agricultural economy.  We have seen the effect on our pockets of the accession of Greece, Spain and Portugal to the European Union and up ten more countries are queuing to join.  The Social Fund is the major issue for new member states.  The main idea is to draw down increasing funds which leaves less available for us.  The surpluses which necessitated the last reform of the CAP are reemerging due to a mix of initiatives, weather conditions and technology.</P>
    <P>Dr. Franz Fischler has a major task ahead of him.  It is up to our Minister to plan ahead, create alliances and protect our national interest.  The CAP was the main reason the people voted to join the Common Market in 1972.  It is still relevant as we have benefited from it and it is important that we do not erode our agricultural position.</P>
    <P>A frightening scenario is building up in the Government comprised of the Fine Gael Party and two left wing parties, one more extreme than the other, which have a hatred of agriculture.  I believe the Minister will not have the support in Cabinet he deserves to make a strong case for Irish agriculture and that he will not have the support of a united front when he goes to Europe. The thinking of the extreme left wing of the Cabinet is to erode agriculture, to destroy the family farm and to support what is good in industrial agricultural, but that cannot be the way forward.  I appeal to the Minister to fight his corner and, if necessary, to resign from Cabinet if he does not get his way.  I am aware of the type of policies favoured by the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa, and some Dublin left wing Labour Deputies who would like to see agriculture go further into the doldrums. I am nervous that the Minister's party who have a lust for power&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The truth is often bitter when heard from across the House.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer to the BSE scare.  The Minister said in the past few days that its cost to the Irish nation could be in the region of £50 million.  I am worried about it, but the less said about such an issue, the better.  Non-European countries which are large importers of our products could stall or cease trading with us and the cost would be much more substantial than the £50 million mentioned.  It is unfortunate that I must raise this issue, but many people in the industry have brought it to my attention in recent days.  The industry must be protected.  We have possibly the best beef farmers, the best quality beef in the world and we must protect it.  I urge the Minister to be more cautious in future when he makes such press statements, and I do not say that in any damaging way.  He should take into account the value of the Irish beef industry at farm, processing and export levels in order to save it, protect it and rectify it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
      <P>Lahinch is one of the towns designated under the special resorts scheme announced by the Minister for Finance in the budget.  Last year, during the life of the previous Government I made representations to former Minister for Tourism and Trade, Deputy McCreevy, in regard to Lahinch and I pointed out the infrastructural difficulties would have to be addressed. <Col N="563" /> These were included in a proposal from Clare County Council for cohesion funding under the Burren and north Clare scheme.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, Lahinch has been successful in starting a major sea world project which will bring huge benefits to the town but which will also increase the pressure on its infrastructure.  A large number of developments are proposed or are under consideration and many of them are at the planning stage with Clare County Council, where a logjam has developed.</P>
      <P>The developers have been making representations to Members and others. We have the classic case of County Council saying it is not within its remit and that it would not have the capital resources to deal with the problem while the Department appears to lay the responsibility at the door of the local authority.  That is extremely frustrating for the developers.  I am trying to establish that it is the responsibility of the Department to deal with this problem and that any confusion between the Department and the county council should be cleared up.  Naturally, the developers are concerned since it is a pilot scheme, there is little time to avail of funding and no progress has been made.</P>
      <P>The Lahinch scheme, which is included in the Burren-north Clare cohesion scheme, will cost £3.5 million and is the third project under that scheme.  Obviously, it will not be reached for a long time but officials of the county council indicated that with goodwill and a decision to proceed quickly, it would allow the development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To understand the scale of the problem at Lahinch, one must bear in mind that the existing treatment plant, such as it is, was constructed to cater for a population of 560 people.  During 1995, the population of Lahinch was about 5,000, not including day visitors. Obviously, the population far exceeds the infrastructural provision.  In an attempt to get over the logjam, the <Col N="564" /> county council has suggested an interim measure which would cost about £250,000 and that proposal has been put to the Department.  Unfortunately, there has not been any indication that any progress has been made.</P>
    <P>Obviously, for a town like Lahinch which has enjoyed and wishes to continue to enjoy blue flag status this is a serious matter and those people who do a great deal of voluntary work are more than anxious to hold on to that status. In addition, these developments would breathe life into the town.  They are the sort of developments which were envisaged under the scheme.  An extraordinary amount of development is proposed. At present, planning permission is awaited for the construction of approximately 180 houses or chalets and other houses are ready to proceed. There are proposals to erect 20 to 30 apartments, an extra 50 hotel bedrooms and a number of retail outlets. Obviously, jobs would be created in the short-term in construction and in the long-term, the quality of tourist accommodation at Lahinch and the facilities in the resort would be much improved if these developments go ahead.  I urge the Minister to resolve the difficulty between the county council and the Department and ensure that at least in the short-term the county council gets the go ahead to do the relatively minor works it proposes.  He should ensure that the Burren and north Clare cohesion scheme, which also includes Lisdoonvarna's water and sewerage scheme, is expedited at European level and is given the go ahead.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Killeen for raising this issue which I will bring to the attention of my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Howlin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The tax incentives provided under the urban renewal scheme have been very successful in promoting renewal and revitalisation of cities and towns around the country.  There is every reason to <Col N="565" /> believe that the new incentives under the 1995 resorts scheme will be equally successful in promoting the renewal and development of the 15 designated resort areas, including Kilkee and Lahinch, in County Clare, and hopefully, places like Ballybunion in County Kerry.</P>
    <P>The Minister for the Environment fully appreciates the importance of tourism for Lahinch and, indeed, for the whole of north Clare and the Burren region.  Up to one million persons visited the region last year and during the peak tourist season the accommodation in Lahinch was fully utilised.  Towns like Lahinch are well placed to take full advantage of County Clare's great tourism potential and the Department of the Environment is anxious, therefore, to ensure that the level of water supply and sewerage services in the county are sufficient to meet development needs. Indeed, I was in County Clare yesterday to launch a Leader II programme and I was impressed with the enthusiasm for future tourist developments and other positive developments in the food industry.  At present, County Clare is buoyant and there is a great sense of expectation.</P>
    <P>With the objective of preserving and protecting the unique Burren environment while, at the same time, meeting the needs of an expanding tourism market, the Department of the Environment has submitted an integrated water supply and waste water treatment proposal for the Burren and north Clare region to the European Commission for support.  This proposal, the first part of which is estimated to cost about £10 million, will support infrastructure development for the region as a whole.</P>
    <P>Within that overall framework, Clare County Council submitted an outline proposal last August to upgrade the sewage collection and treatment system in Lahinch.  The proposal envisages upgrading the collection system along the Milltown Road, and provision of additional treatment capacity and new storm water tanks at an estimated cost of £240,000.  In subsequent discussions with the council, the Department of the <Col N="566" /> Environment agreed that a consultant should be engaged to prepare a detailed report on the proposed improvement works and I understand that this will be ready shortly.</P>
    <P>Until such time as the consultant's report is received in the Department, they cannot be certain as to what specific works may be needed at Lahinch, or what the cost is likely to be.  The Minister, however, is well disposed towards the council's proposals and there will be no avoidable delay in dealing with them when the report is submitted to the Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for affording me the opportunity to raise this important issue on the Adjournment and I am glad the Minister is present to respond.  The announcement of the closure of Iduna Ireland Limited in Kingscourt, County Cavan, has come as a severe blow to the 50 employees of the company, their families and, indeed, the local community.  It is the one factory in the area whose employees are almost all female.  To lose one's job at any time is heartbreaking but the news of job losses at Christmas is even more difficult for everyone concerned.</P>
      <P>I raised this matter by way of parliamentary question earlier today and I sought this Adjournment debate to highlight once again my serious concerns about the loss of these jobs.  It would appear from the Minister's reply to my parliamentary question that the decision to close the factory is irreversible due to the company's decision to rationalise its worldwide operations.  I appeal to the Minister, and through him to all the State agencies, to explore every avenue and make every contact possible to find a replacement industry as a matter of extreme urgency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The workforce in Iduna Ireland Limited is highly skilled.  That makes the task of IDA Ireland and all the other State agencies to secure a potential <Col N="567" /> investor much easier.  The skills of the workforce, coupled with the strong work ethic of the people of Counties Cavan and Monaghan &mdash; and I am sure the Minister would include north Meath as well &mdash; make Kingscourt an attractive town for any potential investor.</P>
    <P>The existing employees of Iduna Ireland Limited want to work and Kingscourt and its catchment area cannot afford to lose those jobs.  Kingscourt is a town with great community spirit and an enterprise culture.  A potential investor would be given the utmost help and co-operation from the local community and local public services.</P>
    <P>I know from officials in the State agencies that they are fully aware of the strengths of Kingscourt as a centre in which to invest, with its easy access to airports and ports, to densely populated centres and, most important, the availability of a top class workforce.</P>
    <P>I trust the Minister will ensure that the negotiations to secure a replacement industry will be conducted with the utmost urgency because that employment is absolutely necessary for the individuals concerned and the Kingscourt area in general.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure the Deputy that the proposed closure of Iduna Ireland Limited is a matter of great concern to me.  I share his anxieties at the effects this will have on the workforce, their families and the Kingscourt economy.  In my written reply earlier today, to the Deputy's question, I referred to the reasons leading to Iduna's decision to close and also to the strenuous efforts being made to find a replacement industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Basically, the position is that due to increased competition from the Far East and high production costs in Europe, Iduna NV, the Dutch owners of Iduna Ireland Limited decided to rationalise their worldwide operations.  As a result, the company advised IDA Ireland earlier this year that they intend to close the Kingscourt plant.  At the request of <Col N="568" /> IDA, Iduna deferred closure until the end of the year and the plant is now scheduled to close on 22 December 1995.  I have asked the State Agencies to do everything possible to find a replacement industry for Kingscourt.  In this regard the overseas and regional offices of IDA Ireland have been informed of the impending closure of the facility and the availability of a skilled workforce.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned in my reply earlier, IDA Ireland is making every effort to seek a new investor for this facility. Interest has been expressed by a number of potential investors and the IDA is currently engaged in ongoing discussions with one of these investors.</P>
    <P>Both IDA and Forbairt are continuing to promote the Kingscourt area as a suitable location for further industrial development.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you for allowing me raise a matter which is of serious concern to a large number of farmers not only in my county but throughout the country.  I refer to the failure of herd owners to submit their area aid forms last spring before the closing date on 28 April.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Prior to this year, this matter was dealt with by the Department's officers in Castlebar and the application forms were usually posted each year to all farmers participating in the schemes for headage, suckler cow and special beef premiums.  However, the section relocated to Dublin in 1995.  It could well be that the transfer of files, etc. resulted in some confusion but I am informed that many farmers did not receive their forms by post this year.  I do not know whether this was a general rule or an oversight affecting only some people. One way or another, I am aware that some farmers, including elderly farmers and farmers living alone, were not sufficiently alert to realise that the closing date was imminent and consequently did not look for their forms in time.  I understand the practice in previous <Col N="569" /> years was to send a copy of the herd details for the preceding year and a separate sheet which merely required a signature if the position had not changed in the meantime.</P>
    <P>I would be obliged if the Minister would inform the House if he has made representations to Brussels with a view to alleviating this problem.  The farmers concerned, together with their families especially at this time of the year, are anxiously awaiting the Minister's and the Department's response.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy McDaid for raising this matter on the Adjournment.  Some 1,400 farmers nationwide sent in their 1995 area aid applications late, that is, after the final 18 May closing date for forage only area aid applications.  I expect that about 1,000 of these late applications involve farmers in our disadvantaged areas. Clear instructions were given on the 1995 forage only area aid applications and on the help sheets which accompanied them to the effect that farmers should submit those applications before the closing date of 28 April 1995 or, at the latest by 18 May 1995 subject to a late application penalty of 1 per cent for each working day after 28 April.  Despite these instructions, however, many farmers either did not submit an area aid application or submitted a late application.</P>
      <P>I am very concerned about the position these farmers find themselves in. The submission of a valid area aid form is essential to secure most livestock premia payments and all disadvantaged areas headage payments.  I have, therefore, arranged for my officials to make a case to the EU Commission to see if the problem can be overcome.  I cannot guarantee a successful outcome to our approach to the Commission but I can assure Deputies that every effort will be made to secure such an outcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am also considering the concessionary arrangement under the suckler cow and special beef premium schemes whereby the EU Commission allows us pay premium on up to 15 livestock units <Col N="570" /> of suckler cows or male cattle after taking into account each applicant's milk quota and ewes submitted for ewe premium where no area aid application has been submitted or where an application has been submitted late.  I have asked my Department to consider, therefore, whether payment on up to those 15 livestock units can be made to the late applicants concerned.</P>
    <P>I assure Deputy McDaid I have experienced this problem extensively in my constituency.  I appreciate the sentiments expressed by the Deputy.  For various reasons, farmers did not submit their application forms in time.  We will do everything possible to ensure a successful outcome with the EU Commission.</P>

      <P>I thank you for allowing me raise this matter on the Adjournment.  I wish to share time with my colleague, Deputy McGinley.</P>
      <P>I raise this matter because it will have serious implications for the fishing industry especially in the west and north west.  We all agree that the overall share of fishing stocks allocated under the quota to Ireland falls short of being fair and reasonable.  We also agree that the proper management and protection of our fishing stocks is imperative for the survival of the industry in the long-term.</P>
      <P>How can the EU Commission say it wants an 80 per cent reduction in the mackerel quota?  If our stocks are so much in danger the fishery should be closed and operators compensated until such time as fish stocks are replenished. I am sure the Minister will agree this will not happen.  Any reduction of this nature is equal to closing down an industry and it would decimate an already weak peripheral economy.  I hope the Minister will get enough support at the Council of Ministers meeting to ensure that this reduction does not become a reality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Killybegs there are 12 factories and approximately 2,000 people are <Col N="571" /> employed there, not to mention those who work on the boats.  The same applies in Burtonport, Moville, Greencastle and other fishing ports along the west coast.  It is of the utmost importance to these areas to ensure that this industry is kept viable.  The Commission and the Government must reconcile the socio-economic realities with the need to preserve fish stocks.  Any reduction must be where it will have the least effect on the economy.  My constituency should suffer the least number of cuts in the Irish quota.  The cuts would not have such a devastating effect on Scotland and Norway which have traditional commercial fishing industries and stronger economies than the west and north-west coast of Ireland.</P>
    <P>An additional problem is that the fishing industry will not accept scientific evidence and research undertaken in May when there is no mackerel.  It is important to provide adequate funding for proper research into the preservation of fish stocks.  I know it would be expensive but an inspector or biologist should work on a trawler for the entire mackerel fishing season, to conduct a proper research.  This would be money well spent and would ensure that it is recognised that mackerel stocks have moved from their traditional locations. No cognisance has been taken of the new stock available along the west coast.</P>
    <P>I implore the Minister to try to ensure there is not a cut in our quota but, if there is a reduction, to address its effects on local economies.  I also ask him to make every effort to protect this part-time and seasonal industry which is probably the only real industry along the west coast.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley" hpid="Mr. McGinley Mr. McGinley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
      <P>Ba mhaith liom mo bhuíochas a ghabháil don Teachta Coughlan as ucht a cuid ama a roinnt liom.  Recent reports of a possible reduction of 80 per cent in the mackerel TAC for 1996 have caused consternation in the pelagic fishing sector. Mackerel is the backbone of the fishing <Col N="572" /> industry in the north-west, particularly in Donegal.  Any reduction, however small, in our quota would have very serious implications but a reduction of 80 per cent would be catastrophic and would mean the death of the industry. Such a reduction would be a mortal blow to the economy of Killybegs and a wide area of south-west Donegal stretching from Glencolmcille to Donegal town and up into the Rosses.  It would also jeopardise the huge investment by native fishing entrepreneurs and super-trawlers which depend entirely on mackerel fishing and would give fishermen no option but to put their vessels on the scrap heap while the thousands of people working in onshore processing would be out of work in areas which have very few employment alternatives.  The only alternative for most people would be the dole or emigration. This cannot be allowed to happen.</P>
      <P>The demand for such a drastic reduction in the quota is based on scientific surveys which indicate that stocks are being seriously depleted.  Such surveys must be taken with a pinch of salt. Fishermen have reported that there is no noticeable reduction in stocks, and they have often been proven to be accurate in the past.  The Minister has a heavy responsibility in this area and I know he is gallantly fighting the battle on behalf of fishermen.  He knows from his visits to the north-west and elsewhere the importance of mackerel fishing to the industry.

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputies for their positive and constructive approach to this matter. I am very glad to have the opportunity to update the House on the current EU negotiations with Norway on the 1996 fisheries agreement and, in particular, on the very hard line I am taking on any proposed mackerel agreement within those negotiations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="573" /> The EU and Norway are in the middle of the annual round of fisheries negotiations which cover a number of species where there is joint EU-Norwegian interest.  Ireland's only interest is in the mackerel agreement. While the Commission negotiates, we are fully involved in EU co-ordination on the matter in Brussels.  The second round of talks with Norway broke down last Friday and no date has been set for a resumption, although there will be EU co-ordination in reviewing the situation in Brussels tomorrow.</P>
    <P>These are vitally important negotiations for the Irish pelagic sector and we are to the forefront in taking a tough line with Norway.  Since taking office I have urged the Commissioner and my colleagues in the Fisheries Council to ensure that the EU adopts a robust approach to Norway's demands in this year's talks.  Current arrangements on mackerel shares are unbalanced in favour of Norway whose share of the total allowable catch is approximately 30 per cent.  While this would have been stabilised under the 1994 Accession Agreement the subsequent vote by that country against EU membership left the arrangement open-ended and subject to annual negotiation.  Earlier this year we fought hard to contain any further increase in the Norwegian mackeral share and managed to keep the increase to a symbolic .05 per cent in the face of the Norwegian demand for an increase of 50 per cent or more.  Norway continues to look for an increased share of the mackerel stock and to rule out any significant flexibility to fish for mackerel in its zone, and this despite the fact that its fishermen have significant rights to fish for species in EU waters to the north and west of Ireland.</P>
    <P>The context of the negotiations on the 1996 agreement is grim and the scientific advice on the mackerel and other stocks is pessimistic.  Scientists have recommended an 80 per cent cut in the mackerel TAC for 1996 in order to restore viability.  A reduction of this <Col N="574" /> magnitude would have devastating effects on our pelagic fleet and the related processing sector which is of such major economic importance to north west coastal communities.  That being said, this scientific advice has to be taken seriously.  We cannot afford to be complacent about the state of stocks and it is clear that decisive action must be taken if the collapse of stocks is to be avoided.  In other words, a level of reduction is unavoidable but the approach should be incremental and sustainable over a period.  I want to achieve a balance between scientific and conservation imperatives and the industry's need for certainty and sustainable fishing in the foreseeable future.  The so-called &ldquo;quick fix&rdquo; solution of imposing such a major reduction does not strike the necessary balance.  Anything other than an incremental approach would decimate our pelagic fleet which does not have the scale and extent of fishing opportunities available to the Norwegians not just in their own fisheries but in EU waters as well.</P>
    <P>To date, the Commission, in leading the negotiations with Norway and other member states, has shared our view on the need for a medium term approach to the mackeral TAC.  The negotiations broke down last Friday on this very issue and both sides are now reflecting on their positions.  In the interim I have written to Commissioner Bonino and the President of the Fisheries Council, Minister Atienza, setting out the Irish position in strong terms.  I have stressed that any reduction in Ireland's mackeral fishing rights relative to Norway would be unacceptable and would create the gravest difficulties for Ireland in the Fisheries Council.  I have pressed for a balance between acknowledged scientific concerns and the vital economic needs of the mackerel industry.  I have made it clear that, in the context of the already unbalanced mackeral sharing in Norway's favour and the existing rights of Norwegian fishermen to fish in EU <Col N="575" /> waters, I cannot accept the drastic &ldquo;quick fix&rdquo; of a massive cut in the TAC favoured by that country.  We will keep the pressure up in the days and weeks ahead.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the fishing industry supports my tough stance on this issue and I will continue to keep in close touch with the fisheries organisations as the negotiations develop.  I am sure <Col N="576" /> Deputies will support my strongly held position on the need to resist Norwegian demands on share and other entitlements while at the same time pressing for a balanced and careful approach to the mackeral TAC for 1996 and future years.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 6 December 1995.</P>

      <P>, <i>Limerick East</i>): In my reply of 24 October 1995 to the Deputy's question regarding the number of persons with a disability awaiting residential care, I stated that the figures given in respect of persons with a mental handicap had been provided to my Department by the health boards earlier this year.  I also stated that they did not take account of the additional 243 residential places for which funding had been provided in 1995.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="363" /> The figure of 480 persons with a mental handicap awaiting places in residential services in the Eastern Health Board region to which the Deputy has referred in his current question reflected the preliminary information which was available to the board at that time from the mental handicap database.</P>
    <P>Since then, both the health boards and my Department have been working to complete the process involved in validating the initial information from the database.  The database information includes details of the numbers in receipt of services on a full-time basis, those in receipt of services on a part-time or shared basis, those who are currently without a service and who require immediate placement and those who will require services in the near future. It is hoped to have the validation process completed towards the end of the year.</P>
    <P>The current figure available from the Eastern Health Board, which is still subject to final validation, indicates that a total of 414 persons with a mental handicap are awaiting places in residential services.  The breakdown of this number between the various community care areas is as follows:</P>

    <P>In compliance with the provisions of the Data Protection Act with regard to the preservation of confidentiality of personal information, the information submitted to my Department from the <Col N="364" /> health boards does not include the names of individual clients.  This information is retained at health board and agency level and it would not be appropriate for me to give these details.</P>
    <P>Prior to the establishment of the database, information on the numbers awaiting services did not distinguish between current and future need nor did it reflect the level of support required by those on the waiting lists for services.  The database will provide this information which will enable my Department and the health boards to assess the needs more accurately and to plan the development of the services in a more co-ordinated manner.  The timescale for meeting the needs of the people on the waiting list for residential care in the eastern region will be dependent on a number of factors.  These include the level of immediate need identified by the database, the mortality rate among the older client population in existing services, and the level of increased resources, both capital and revenue, which can be made available to the services over a given period of time. The Deputy will be aware that since 1990, some 1,030 additional residential and respite places have been provided nationally for people with mental handicap.</P>
    <P>Some of the major factors influencing the size of the waiting list for residential care in the eastern region include the growth in the overall population in the region in recent years, the age profile of persons with mental handicap and their carers and the increased longevity of persons with mental handicap resulting in fewer vacancies arising in existing services.</P>

      <P>, <i>Limerick East</i>): I met &ldquo;Positive Action&rdquo;&mdash; the support group for Anti-D recipients and their families &mdash; on 1 November, 1995.  It was agreed at that meeting that intensive discussions would take place during the month of November between officials of my Department and the executive of &ldquo;Positive Action&rdquo; and between the legal advisers to the Government and the legal advisers to &ldquo;Positive Action&rdquo;, in an attempt to resolve outstanding issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To the conclusion of these discussions, comprehensive documents on a non-statutory compensation scheme and on health care measures to address the many complex and varied needs of those diagnosed positive for hepatitis C were forwarded to the executive committee of the organisation on Friday, 1 December.  Similar comprehensive documents were forwarded on 1 December, 1995 to &ldquo;Transfusion Positive&rdquo;&mdash; the support group for blood transfusion recipients who have been <Col N="366" /> diagnosed positive for hepatitis C.  I propose to circulate copies of these documents to all Members of the Oireachtas later this week.</P>
    <P>The non-statutory scheme of compensation offers numerous advantages as opposed to court proceedings and without the delays and costs associated with a statutory scheme.  The advantages for Tribunal applicants include: speed, informality, flexibility and privacy; negligence need not be proved; the right of court action is completely preserved unless and until an award is accepted by the applicant; proceedings before the Tribunal will be subject to judicial review; the concept of a provisional award, which is not available in Irish law, allows a claimant to return to the Tribunal for future specified unexpected consequences of the hepatitis C infection: this is a particularly important option for claimants given the uncertain nature of the hepatitis C infection and the scheme is entirely optional and imposes no disadvantage to applicants. It is explicitly stated in the provisions of the scheme that it will continue indefinitely.</P>
    <P>I anticipate that there will be an opportunity later this week to make a full presentation of the outcome of the negotiations to members of the Social Affairs Committee.  I would propose to make a full statement on this matter on that occasion.</P>

      <P>, <i>Limerick East</i>): I propose to take Questions Nos. 32 and 50 together.</P>
      <P>The criteria normally used in determining an area as &ldquo;remote&rdquo; in the context of the general medical services (GMS) scheme are as follows: the location and size of the area involved; the population; the number of medical card holders in the area; the distance or distances from the nearest town or towns; the number of general practitioners practising in the area or adjoining areas and any other information relevant to the particular case.</P>
      <P>The terms of the GMS contract provide that remote areas shall be specified from time to time by the Minister for Health in consultation with the health boards and the Irish Medical Organisation.</P>
      <P>The practice is that applications for remote area status under the GMS scheme are made to me by the relevant health board following consultation with the doctor or doctors involved.  I have no plans to extend the number of areas currently designated as &ldquo;remote&rdquo; under the GMS scheme.  However, I am prepared to consider any such application made to me by a health board which would be considered on its own merits.</P>
      <P>I understand that the Southern Health Board considered the question of whether the Drimoleague/Drinagh area should be declared a remote area under the scheme.  In view of the proximity of the area to the towns of Skibbereen, Dunmanway and Bantry and given the arrangements which are in place locally for the provision of general practitioner services, the board did not consider the area to be a remote area within the terms of the scheme.</P>

      <P>, <i>Limerick East</i>): I propose to deal with Questions 33, 34, 35, 36, 48 and 93 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provision of treatment services for drug misusers is a matter for health <Col N="369" /> boards in the first instance.  Treatment services vary from one health board to the next, depending on the demand for these services.  The services include detoxification, methadone maintenance, needle exchange and counselling and advice, depending on the clinical judgment of the health professionals who assess each case presenting for treatment.  As treatment is provided in a number of facilities, including psychiatric and general hospitals and through general practitioners, it is not possible to quantify the exact number of treatment places available.  Approximately 1,200 people are on methadone maintenance programmes with the Eastern Health Board treatment centres, the Drug Treatment Centre and general practitioners.  In addition, a number of drug misusers are in receipt of treatment, advice and counselling at other facilities provided by both statutory and voluntary agencies, which are funded through health boards.  The most recent report from the Health Research Board indicates that a total of 2,702 individuals in the greater Dublin area received treatment for drug misuse during 1994.</P>
    <P>In the Dublin area there are waiting lists for the treatment of heroin abusers at all drug treatment centres.  The most recent report from the Eastern Health Board indicates that approximately 800 people are awaiting treatment.  The board, in consultation with my Department is addressing this issue as a matter of urgency.  A major component of the plan to eliminate these waiting lists is the establishment of community drug centres in local areas where the need for these centres has been identified.  The most effective way to treat drug misusers is in their own locality where possible. I am aware of opposition from local communities to the establishment of these centres.  I have asked the Eastern Health Board to approach the establishment of these centres with the utmost sensitivity and with the fullest consultation with the local community and I would appeal to such communities <Col N="370" /> to help facilitate the provision of treatment facilities to drug misusers in their own areas.</P>
    <P>In the fight against drugs the most effective weapon which we have is education and prevention.  In drug misuse prevention programmes, such as &ldquo;On My Own Two Feet&rdquo;, which was made available to second level schools in 1994, young people are given information on all drugs, but they are also trained to develop their assertiveness and decision making skills so that they can resist drug offer situations.  The evaluation of this programme has proven it to be effective in changing young people's attitudes to drug misuse.  It is too early however, to say how effective the programme is at influencing behaviour.</P>
    <P>Media campaigns can also be effective at getting a hard hitting message across to the public.  For this reason my Department's Health Promotion Unit is working on possible themes for a major awareness campaign, which will be run early next year.  Because the nature and cause of drug misuse are complex, interventions, whether they involve education and training, or clinical treatment, can be limited in their effectiveness, without a concerted effort by all agencies, both statutory and voluntary, in addressing the problem.  A major stumbling block to success in the Dublin area for example is the strong links between drug misuse and factors such as unemployment and social deprivation.</P>
    <P>For these reasons my Department is co-ordinating the response to drug misuse and demand reduction through the re-established National Co-ordinating Committee on Drug Abuse.  This Committee is comprised of representatives from a number of Government Departments which have a role to play in the prevention of drug misuse.  The Committee, will in turn establish two further sub-committees, one on demand reduction and one on supply reduction, to focus on these specific areas.</P>

      <P>, <i>Limerick East</i>): The Eastern Health Board region was allocated £3.003 million revenue and £1.320 million capital to develop new services for people with a mental handicap this year.  Details relating to the services to be provided in the eastern region were agreed by the eastern region Mental Handicap Planning Committee, on which St. Michael's House is represented within the guidelines issued by my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In all a total of £528,000 in additional revenue funding was allocated to St. Michael's House and a further £266,000 to other agencies in respect of clients on St. Michael's House waiting lists.  This <Col N="372" /> amounts to 26 per cent of the total revenue allocated to the eastern region and 37 per cent of the new residential accommodation which was provided in the region in 1995.</P>
    <P>Capital funding of £500,000 has also been provided to St. Michael's House to support these developments.</P>
    <P>The additional funding enabled St. Michael's House to provide 13 residential-respite places, 38 day places, enhanced home support services, enhanced services for people with disturbed behaviour and hepatitis B vaccinations for staff and client groups considered to be at risk.  In addition 14 clients on St. Michael's House waiting lists benefited from the new services provided by other mental handicap agencies in the Dublin area.  All of the residential and day places put in place in 1995 by St. Michael's House were provided on the north side of Dublin.</P>
    <P>In addition to the development funds for the provision of new services, additional funding was also provided in 1995 to meet identified needs in existing services.  St. Michael's House was allocated an additional £100,000 this year bringing the total additional funding provided over the last three years to the agency under this heading to £500,000.</P>

      <P>, <i>Limerick East</i>): Cannabis is a Schedule 1 controlled drug under the Misuse of Drugs Acts, 1977 and 1984.  This is the schedule of control which, according to the UN Conventions on Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances, must be applied to substances such as cannabis and cannabis resin, for which there is no current recognised medical or scientific use.  The manufacture, possession, supply and prescription of the drug are prohibited, except under licence from the <Col N="373" /> Minister for Health.  Such licences may, under the law, be only granted for the purpose of research, forensic analysis, or in respect of the use of the drug as an essential starting material for the manufacture of other drugs.</P>
      <P>The question of legalising cannabis is raised from time to time with frequent references to the medical and other benefits, which allegedly would be associated with such action.  The position is that the medical claims being made in favour of cannabis are not supported by clinical research.  My own view is that people and particularly young people who use cannabis can be easily led to experiment with the abuse of other addictive drugs and for these reasons I have no plans to provide for it on prescription.</P>

      <P>I have recently announced a number of extensions to the existing controls on smoking in certain places.  The amending regulations will be laid before the Oireachtas shortly and will come into effect on 1 January.</P>
      <P>From that date, smoking will be prohibited in hospitals, nursing homes and other health facilities such as residential and day care centres.  It will, however, be permitted to provide specific facilities where staff or patients may smoke.</P>
      <P>This new restriction will ensure that all staff, patients and visitors are protected from the effects of unwanted tobacco smoke.  The previous restriction provided only for the designation of non-smoking areas within the hospital and it was clear that a more comprehensive restriction was necessary.</P>

      <P>, <i>Limerick East</i>): The provision of services for drug misusers is a matter for health boards in the first instance.  All boards have made provision in their services for treatment of young people under 18.  The type of treatment is determined by an assessment made by an appropriately qualified medical practitioner.</P>
      <P>In the Eastern Health Board for example, the Talbot Centre, which is closely linked with the City Clinic in Amiens Street, provides counselling and advice for young drug users in the north inner city who are not addicted to opiates. In the Southern Health Board a similar programme is provided in Arbour House for adolescents with drug related problems.  A number of voluntary agencies are also funded by health boards for the provision of services.</P>
      <P>As part of its plan to develop a comprehensive network of treatment services for drug misusers, the Eastern Health Board will be paying particular attention to the needs of drug misusers under the age of 18.</P>
      <P>A full treatment service is provided to people under 18 who are addicted to heroin, but, in general it is health board policy that methadone is not prescribed without the consent of a parent or guardian.</P>

      <P>, <i>Limerick East</i>): Myrtleville and Fountainstown are two small villages in the Kinsale dispensary district of South Cork.  The Southern Health Board has no official premises or the use of any premises in either of these two areas.  Of the 23 people receiving supplementary welfare allowance in these areas, 14 opted to have payments made to them by post and the remaining nine (four in Myrtleville and five in Fountainstown) opted to have their SWA collected on a weekly basis from the local community welfare officer.</P>
      <P>The health board recognises that the existing arrangements for people not being paid by post are unsatisfactory. Accordingly, they have written to the recipients offering them a choice of four different locations for collection of SWA i.e. Carrigaline health centre, Crosshaven health centre, Ballyfeard health centre and Minane Bridge community centre.</P>
      <P>Pending a response from the recipients the board has reluctantly continued to operate the existing service as a number of the recipients do not have private transport and public transport is not available in all areas.  I hope that this clarifies the position for the Deputy and I will keep her informed of developments.</P>

This information is already available through health centres, local health board officers, schools, GP surgeries and pharmacies. In addition, the health boards have been asked to consider what additional public information initiatives are required and to decide what particular measures need to be taken in each of their areas.</P>
    <P>The Department and the health boards operate a comprehensive system for monitoring the incidence of meningitis which includes the immediate notification of cases of bacterial meningitis to the Department, following a notification by a general practitioner or hospital-based doctor.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>, <i>Limerick East</i>): The subvention scheme which accompanied the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990, was implemented on 1 September 1993 and ensures that those most in need of care in a nursing home, and without the means to pay for it, receive assistance towards the cost. With regard to the question about the assessment of adult children of an applicant for subvention, I wish to point out that a health board may only assess a son or daughter's ability to contribute towards the cost of the nursing homes fees of a parent if the son or daughter is aged 21 years and over, is residing in the jurisdiction and posseses sufficient personal income according to the procedures laid out in the Nursing Home (Subvention) Regulations, 1993.</P>
      <P>Of the 6,876 subventions approved to the end of September 1995, health boards had made a reduction as a result of the son or daughter's ability to pay in 1,146 cases or one in six of the subventions approved.  I believe that sons and daughters who are in a position to contribute towards the cost of a parent's nursing home fees should do so.  The State recognises this contibution in the tax relief it gives on such payments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The current levels of subvention and the position of those dependent elderly who have no funds other than the noncontributory pensions are amongst the various aspects of the scheme currently being examined by a working group, <Col N="378" /> comprised of officials of my Department and the health boards, which is reviewing the operation of the Nursing Homes Act.  I expect to receive the group's report in the next week or so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>, <i>Limerick East</i>): I have seen the reference in the annual report of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul to the problem of youth homelessness.  I am pleased to note that the society has welcomed the commencement of the Child Care Act which is an important element in our overall response to the problem.</P>
      <P>As the House is aware, I recently made an order bringing 44 sections of the Act into operation with effect from 31 October 1995.  Some 61 of the 79 sections are now in force and I intend to bring the remaining 18 sections into operation before the end of 1996.  The sections now in force include key provisions dealing with the protection of children in emergencies, care proceedings and the powers and duties of health boards in relation to children in their care.  These greatly strengthen the powers of the courts, the health boards and the gardaí to intervene to protect children from abuse and neglect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to homeless children, section 5 of the Act requires health boards to take such steps as are reasonable to make available suitable accommodation for homeless children up to 18 years.  Health boards are developing a range of options to enable them to discharge their responsibilities under this section.  These include: emergency hostels and other forms of residential accommodation; day care programmes <Col N="379" /> for adolescents who are currently homeless or at risk of being homeless; out of hours social work services targeted at homeless children; special foster care services for out of home adolescents.</P>
    <P>However, I acknowledge that there is still room for improvement and, with the support of the Minister for Health, I will be seeking additional resources for the child care services in the Estimates for 1996.</P>

      <Quest>if he will ensure that the ten or so remaining temporary Passport Office staff (details supplied) who have served for many years in their current positions can be ensured permanent employment within the Civil Service in view of the fact that there was an understanding to this effect and these people co-operated fully with the new procedures implemented in the Passport Office.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>Following a survey of staffing structures in the Passport Office, conducted by the Department of Finance in 1993, a number of recommendations regarding the permanent and temporary staffing levels in the Passport Office were made.  In summary, the recommendations provided for an increase in the permanent staff of the Passport Office with a consequent decrease in the number of temporary clerical assistants (TCAs) recruited during the periods of peak activity each year.</P>
      <P>Arising from this survey, an agreement was signed between the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Civil and Public Service Union (CPSU) on 8 February 1994, on the implementation of the recommendations on the staffing levels.  The CPSU, who represent the TCAs in question, agreed that six clerical assistant posts would be filled by way of a special confined establishment competition for the TCAs in the Department of Foreign Affairs.  In the agreement the CPSU also accepted that this TCA competition was an exceptional measure and that no further such competitions would be held in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the foot of this agreement the Civil Service Commission advertised the competition in March 1994.  Some 31 candidates were interviewed by a Commission board and six appointments were subsequently made.  Unfortunately, none of the TCAs in question, <Col N="383" /> who were all interviewed, was successful.</P>
    <P>I would like to record my appreciation of the hard work and dedication of all the temporary staff who work in the Passport Office.  However, I regret following the implementation of the above recommendations that it is not open to me to offer permanent employment to TCAs in the Passport Office. All future recruitment to my Department will be done through the normal Civil Service Commission open competitions. Of course, it is open to all TCAs who work in my Department to apply for clerical assistant and other vacancies through the Civil Service Commission, subject to the usual qualifying conditions.</P>

      <P>As I stated in reply to a question from Deputy Ó Cuív on 17 October 1995, I told the family that I would take up with the Home Office any points identified by the family's legal advisers as requiring explanation or clarification. I understand that the family are waiting for a decision by the British Legal Aid Board about a possible change of solicitors looking at the case.</P>
      <P>In April 1995 the family requested that the Home Office be asked for a copy of the book of evidence in the murder trial.

      <P>The aim of the Government was to reach a quota of 3 per cent overall in the Civil Service.  As of October 1994, the most recent date for which data is available, the percentage of people with disabilities employed in the Civil Service was 3 per cent.  This figure relates to the Civil Service as a whole. However, at October 1994, 20 of the 29 Departments and Offices had a percentage of 3 per cent or higher of disabled people on their staff and a further three Departments had a percentage between 2 per cent and 3 per cent.</P>
      <P>All Departments are required to play their full part in ensuring that this objective is met and maintained.  Civil Service Departments with a low representation of staff with disabilities are being encouraged to increase that representation where feasible, taking into account their overall staffing needs.</P>
      <P>I attach, for the Deputy's information, a list indicating the percentage of people with disabilities employed on 1 October 1994.</P>

      <P>The new renewal scheme for traditional seaside resorts commenced on 1 July last for a three year period.  The purpose of the scheme is to renew and update the tourist amenities and facilities in a certain limited number of seaside resorts.</P>
      <P>I stress that this new initiative is a pilot scheme and is thus of an experimental nature.  It must, therefore, be applied on a limited basis to evaluate its efficacy.</P>
      <P>Kilrush was not selected for inclusion in this scheme; however, Kilkee and Lahinch, both of which are situated in County Clare have been selected for this pilot scheme.  As the Deputy will appreciate, it is not possible to designate every area of the coast for the purposes of this pilot scheme.</P>
      <P>Until this pilot scheme is firmly established it would be inappropriate to consider the designation of any further towns.  Consequently, I have no plans to extend the scheme.</P>

      <P>The exchange rate figures sought by the Deputy are set out in the following table.  As regards volume of trade, official figures are not compiled for the volume of trade with the UK or any other individual country: the table therefore shows the value of trade with the UK, for the years 1985 to 1994 inclusive.  The trade figures from 1993 onwards are not fully comparable with those of earlier years, due to the introduction in 1993 of the system of compiling intra-EU trade statistics known as Intrastat, which was necessitated by the advent of the single market.  As regards 1995, the latest trade statistics available are for the six months to end June and these are shown in the table.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I can confirm that I have received representations on this matter.  The position is as follows.</P>
      <P>Member-owned golf clubs are exempt from VAT in so far as they are non-profit making bodies providing facilities for persons taking part in sport.  However, the relevant provision in EU VAT law explicitly requires that this exemption cannot apply if the basic purpose of the service being supplied is to obtain additional income for the organisation by carrying out transactions which are in direct competition with those of commercial enterprises which are liable to the tax.  Commercial golf courses have been liable to VAT since 1992 in accordance with the provisions of EU and Irish VAT law because they are clearly engaged in the course or furtherance of business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For some time, the representatives of <Col N="392" /> the commercial clubs have complained that the present situation, whereby they had to charge VAT on their facilities, but the traditional golf clubs did not, was putting them at a competitive disadvantage. It should be noted that all the representations I have received claim that green fees are an important source of income for the member-owned clubs. In fact, many clubs have pointed out that this income is vital for their financial viability and the maintenance and development of their facilities.  Furthermore, much has been made of the leading role taken by the member owned clubs in promoting Ireland abroad as a holiday destination for international golfing tourists.  All this only serves to underline the fact that the member-owned clubs compete with commercial clubs for green-fee type income.</P>
    <P>While extending the application of VAT to member owned golf clubs, great pains were taken to ensure that the requirement, as provided for in the 1995 Finance Act, was carefully targeted at the particular area of distortion.  From 1 January, 1996, VAt at the 12.5 per cent rate will apply to the green-fee type turnover of member owned clubs but only where a club's turnover from such sources exceeds, or is likely to exceed, £20,000 in any period of 12 months; membership fees will remain exempt from VAT.  Turnover from membership fees, bar receipts etc., are not taken into account in calculating the £20,000 registration threshold.</P>
    <P>Golf is not the only sporting area where distortions of competition can arise.  Accordingly, the 1995 Finance Act also contains measures enabling the Revenue Commissioners to designate any exempt sports facility liable to VAT where they are satisfied that the facility in question is creating, or likely to create, a distortion of competition for a taxable person providing similar services.</P>
    <P>Finally, as regards the effect on tourism of VAT on green fees, the following points are relevant.  Firstly, in many instances, the effective VAT rate should be less than 12.5 per cent.  This is <Col N="393" /> because the organisations concerned will be able to recover the VAT borne on their inputs such as buildings, machinery, greens maintenance etc., in respect of the taxable part of their activities, a facility denied to them up to now because of their exempt status. Secondly, member owned clubs have had a reasonable period to prepare for the new situation.  Thirdly, I would point out that, unlike their competitors in the UK, France and Spain, where the standard rates of VAT apply to green fees, that is, 17.5 per cent, 20.6 per cent and 16 per cent respectively, Irish clubs will be subject to the reduced rate of 12.5 per cent.</P>

      <P>Over a period of 50 years or so the powers of the Commissioners of Public Works to execute drainage works were derived from the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945, solely.  This Act related to the execution of such works by way of comprehensive schemes for entire river catchments.  In this period works proceeded on the basis of settled lists of priority major and minor catchments.  More than 40 schemes were undertaken, conferring benefit on upwards of 650,000 acres of land.  These powers were extended by the Arterial Drainage (Amendment) Act, 1995, which provides a means for the commissioners to carry out flood relief schemes for the alleviation of localised flooding.</P>
      <P>An arterial drainage scheme for the Glyde and Dee, No. 2 on the priority list of major catchments, was completed in 1957 and there is an ongoing programme of maintenance works to ensure the preservation of the standard of drainage provided by the scheme as designed.  However, drainage schemes in general do not guarantee total immunity from flooding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Erne River Catchment is No. 10 on the priority list of major catchments for arterial drainage.  Two schemes for <Col N="395" /> this catchment have been considered over the years.  In 1970 a scheme for the portion of the catchment lying entirely within the State was prepared and in the early 1990s a scheme for the FinnLacky, a tributary which spans the Border, was prepared in conjunction with the Northern Ireland Drainage Authority. Neither scheme was proceeded with on economic grounds.</P>
    <P>The Fane is No. 20 on the priority list of minor catchments but has not yet been reached in the drainage programme.</P>

      <Col N="396" /> The Deputy will be aware that investigation and detailed research into the causes of suicide has not been easy at national level.  In the past there has been an understandable reluctance to even discuss the issue and this made the compilation of accurate data on the frequency and pattern of suicide more difficult.</P>
    <P>Reliable information on the occurrence of suicidal behaviour is essential if help is to be made available to those considered to be at risk.  This is why I announced, last week, the establishment of a National Task Force on Suicide. This expert group will have the following terms of reference:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  To define numerically and qualitatively the nature of the suicide problem in Ireland.</P>
    <P>(ii)  To define and to quantify the problems of attempted suicide and para-suicide in Ireland, including the associated costs involved.</P>
    <P>(iii)  To make recommendations on how service providers can most cost-effectively address the problems of attempted suicide and para-suicide.</P>
    <P>(iv)  To identify the various authorities with jurisdiction in suicide prevention strategies and their respective responsibilities.</P>
    <P>(v)  To formulate, following consultation with all interested parties, a national suicide prevention strategy.</P>
    <P>It is anticipated that by July 1996, the task force should have completed a detailed analysis of all existing data relating to suicide, attempted suicide and associated factors.  The rest of 1996 would then be devoted to a major consultative exercise involving all interested parties leading to the formulation of a national suicide prevention strategy by the end of 1996.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan, Limerick East) Michael Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>, <i>Limerick East):</i> I am pleased to inform the Deputy that I have approved a comprehensive investment package in excess of £10 million to upgrade facilities and equipment at St. Luke's Hospital, Dublin.  This investment will see the hospital developed into a national centre of excellence in the treatment of cancer and provide for a complete upgrading of accommodation and equipment throughout the hospital. Specifically, in relation to radiotherapy equipment, I have already provided £3 million to enable the hospital to purchase a package of new state of the art equipment.  The following is the position in relation to the delivery and commissioning of the new equipment at St. Luke's Hospital:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&mdash;two new linear accelerators have now been delivered and are being installed prior to commissioning;</P>
      <P>&mdash;a new simulator has been operational since September 1995;</P>
      <P>&mdash;a new CT simulator has been delivered and will be operational in February 1996;</P>
      <P>&mdash;a new treatment planning system has been delivered and will also be operational in February 1996.</P>
      <P>The Deputy should appreciate that given the highly technical nature of the treatment carried out on radiotherapy machines, absolute accuracy and precision are required in the installation and operation of such equipment. Hence there is a significant lead in time for the commissioning of new radiotherapy equipment following delivery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the existing treatment equipment at St. Luke's, the hospital put in place a comprehensive maintenance contract earlier this year to ensure that its linear accelerators were operating to full capacity.  In general, the operational efficiency of radiotherapy equipment can reasonably be <Col N="398" /> measured in terms of machine downtime as a proportion of total operational time.  However, radiotherapy equipment, of necessity, requires to be temporarily taken out of service for a variety of reasons, including calibration and validation work, preventative maintenance and, on occasion, for repair work.</P>
    <P>Contingency arrangements are automatically put in place by the hospital when equipment is temporarily out of use, to ensure that all emergency cases are accommodated and continuity of treatment.</P>

      <P>, <i>Limerick East):</i> Entitlement to health services is based on means.</P>
      <P>At present there are no plans to exempt income received by farmers under the rural environmental protection scheme from the assessment of means for medical cards and other health board schemes.  I should point out that even though a person's income exceeds the income guidelines, that person may still be awarded a medical card if the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board considers that the person's medical needs or other circumstances would justify this.</P>
      <P>Assessment procedures for all schemes will continue to be reviewed and whatever improvements are necessary in the interest of equity will be implemented.</P>

      <P>, <i>Limerick East):</i> The conditions necessary for admission to the Chiropodists' Assessment and Advisory list are: (1) membership of the Society of Chiropodists and Podiatrists of Ireland and eligibility for State Registration in the United Kingdom, (2) to have been in full-time practice in chiropody for not less than five years out of the previous seven years, prior to June 1963.</P>
      <P>These groups are the only ones recognised for the provision of chiropody services in the public health service.  This is on the basis that they have undertaken a three year full-time, comprehensive course of training or were established as practising chiropodists fulfilling the above criteria when the assessment committee was established in 1974.</P>
      <P>My Department is currently examining the possibility of establishing a revised assessment mechanism for chiropodists, and I shall be in contact with each of the relevant organisations in due course.</P>

      <P>In March this year, my Department issued guidelines to health boards on family planning policy. The guidelines outlined the need for the development of comprehensive family planning services in each health board area.  This would also include the provision of services for disadvantaged and-or at risk groups and persons with special needs.  Health boards have been asked to establish, in consultation with the groups involved, the most appropriate means of providing family planning services to ensure that they are user friendly, effective in achieving their objective and, where appropriate, that advice and information is furnished in a manner which is easily understood by the recipient.</P>
      <P>If the Deputy is aware of a particular case of the nature referred to in the question, perhaps he would communicate the details to me and I will ask the relevant health board to provide a report to the Deputy.</P>

      <P>, <i>Limerick East):</i> Physiotherapy forms part of the treatment regime for a wide variety of ailments and disabilities and physiotherapy services are available in all health board areas.  As part of the more recent developments in the general practitioner service, health board general practice units have been requested to target resources for the provision of paramedical services, including physiotherapy, which would be readily accessible to general practitioners for their patients.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Owing to the wide range of areas where physiotherapy is used, it is not possible to generalise with regard to <Col N="407" /> waiting times.  These can vary from immediate treatment up to five to six months depending on a wide variety of factors.  Waiting times in individual cases will depend, for example, on whether a patient or client is being treated on an in-patient or out-patient basis, the specialty involved and the level of priority accorded to the case by the medical practitioner concerned.  As with all medical treatment, patients are seen on the basis of medical priority with the most urgent cases being seen first.</P>

      <P>, <i>Limerick East):</i> As I have informed the House on previous occasions, I am concerned about the adequacy of speech and language therapy services generally and regard the expansion of such services as a priority.</P>
      <P>The provision of speech and language therapy is the responsibility of the health boards.  All boards recognise the need to improve this service.  Additional revenue funding of £1.5 million was made available in 1993 and again in 1994 for the development of services for people with physical disabilities.  In 1995, additional revenue funding of £2 million was provided for these services. I am pleased to report that in the last three years, boards have allocated £695,000 to the development of speech and language therapy services including £300,000 in 1995.  This additional funding has allowed the recruitment of 28 speech and language therapists as well as the purchase of additional speech and language therapy equipment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will appreciate that in the light of competing demands for development of other services for <Col N="408" /> people with physical and sensory disabilities, improvements in the speech and language therapy services can only come about on a phased basis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>, <i>Limerick East):</i>  The report <i>The Years Ahead &mdash; A Policy for the Elderly,</i> stressed the need to develop a range of services for people with dementia, including Alzheimer's disease, and their families.  The report was adopted as official Government policy towards the elderly.  Between 1990 and 1994 an additional £21 million was made available to the health services to implement key recommendations of the report, including the strengthening of home and community support for people with dementia and their families.  The investment by boards in additional community nursing, day care, respite services and nursing home places has increased the support available to sufferers of Alzheimer's disease and their carers.  The care of those with dementia is clearly emerging as a priority for many boards, a development which I fully support.  This year, an additional £7.5 million is being made available to improve further health and welfare services for the elderly and their carers, including the development of specialist assessment and community support services for people suffering from dementia and Alzheimer's disease.</P>
      <P>This year I have decided to allocate £80,000 in core funding to the Alzheimer Society of Ireland in recognition of the contribution the society is making to the development of services for people with dementia throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="409" /> The Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990 which commenced on 1 September, 1993 widens the options available to those caring for dependent relatives with dementia.  Under the Act, health boards may pay a subvention towards the cost of care in a nursing home of a person who needs that care and who does not have the resources to pay the cost.  Almost £15 million has been made available this year to fund subventions under the Act.</P>
    <P>As Minister for Health, I am very conscious of the contribution made by carers to the maintenance of dependent people in their own homes, and I will continue to encourage health boards to develop and extend support services for these informal carers, whether by services in the home, by respite care in a hospital or nursing home or long-term residential care.</P>

      <P>Adoptions are arranged by registered adoption societies and, to a lesser extent, by health boards.  For that reason, information as to the number of people on waiting lists for adoption is not available to my Department.  However, I am arranging for a copy of the Adoption Board's annual report for 1994, which was recently published, to be forwarded to the Deputy.  This contains useful information about the level of activity in relation to both national and foreign adoptions.  The report reveals a continuing decline in the number of children available for adoption within the State with a corresponding upsurge in interest in the adoption of children from abroad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the criteria used for placing people on waiting lists for adoption, the adoption agencies undertake <Col N="410" /> detailed assessments in order to establish the general suitability of prospective adoptive parents.  The agencies must also have regard to the legal requirements laid down in the Adoption Acts in relation to eligibility to adopt.</P>

The plan includes the proposed provision of a community <Col N="411" /> residence in Carraroe, County Galway in year three, i.e. 1977, funding for which will be considered in the context of the resources available to me in 1997 and the competing demands for those resources.</P>

      <P>, <i>Limerick East):</i> As far as I am aware, only one health board has adopted a policy of having all new consultant appointments in the geographical whole-time category: In other boards a separate decision is made in relation to each new and replacement consultant post. The final decision on such matters rests with Comhairle na nOspidéal which has the statutory responsibility for structuring consultant posts.  The Government remains committed to the maintenance of private medicine both within the public hospital system and in the private <Col N="412" /> sector.  As Minister for Health I have a particular responsibility to ensure that the needs of public patients are satisfactorily provided for.  I am satisfied that the present mix of consultant posts adequately addresses all of these requirements.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>, <i>Limerick East):</i> I am very concerned about the number of people on the waiting list for cardiac surgery and I am anxious to reduce the waiting period for those people at present on the list.  The waiting list for cardiac surgery stands at 1,597.</P>
      <P>The strategy to deal with cardiac surgery waiting lists has been to provide additional facilities and infrastructures within the public hospital service to increase annual activity.  To date this strategy has resulted in an additional cardiac surgeon being appointed at the Mater Hospital where the annual activity for open heart operations has been increased by 250 per year to 1,000 per year; an additional cardiac surgeon being appointed to Cork University Hospital where an activity level of 400 open heart procedures per year is due to come on stream shortly.</P>
      <P>The combined effect of this action will be to increase annual activity for cardiac surgery to 1,400 per year an increase of 47 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am now anxious to expand the current public hospital capacity for cardiac surgery.  I have asked my Department to formulate proposals for the provisions of additional cardiac surgery activity in the public hospital system.  I am fully <Col N="413" /> committed to the provision of additional capacity including the appointment of additional cardiac surgeons on a permanent basis within the public system over the next two to three years.  This examination of the long-term requirements will begin immediately.  However, because of the need to ensure that future developments are well planned and to allow sufficient time to put in place the type of permanent, expensive, high cost infrastructure required for cardiac surgery it will take some time before this additional capacity comes on stream.  I have, therefore, asked my Department to see whether any health care organisations can provide cardiac surgery at prices which are reasonable and affordable on a once-off basis.</P>
    <P>I am at present engaged in finalising negotiations on the purchase of additional once-off procedures and I hope to be in a position to make an announcement in this regard very soon.</P>
    <P>The major objective is to increase the permanent capacity for cardiac surgery in the public hospital sector and in the meantime to provide additional procedures quickly to ease the problems of those waiting cardiac operations.  I am hopeful that the short-term approach together with the long-term planning initiative will ensure that waiting times for cardiac surgery are reduced significantly and I look forward to co-operation from everybody involved to bring this about as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the need for improved infrastructure in Border areas and this is taken fully into account in determining allocations under the programmes for which I am responsible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1995, total grant allocations for non-national roads to Cavan, Donegal, <Col N="421" /> Leitrim, Louth, Monaghan and Sligo county councils amount to £25.19 million, an increase of £3.86 million, or 18 per cent on the corresponding 1994 payment figure.  The discretionary grants paid by my Department to the local authorities concerned have included an element in recent years for reopening cross-Border roads.  In addition, support is available for road improvement projects of benefit to industry under the EU co-financed grants scheme and the INTERREG II Programme, and further assistance is likely under the Special Support Programme for Peace and Reconciliation.</P>
    <P>As regards water services, the INTERREG II Programme is specifically directed at improving water quality in cross-Border areas in order to facilitate tourism and protect water quality for commercial, industrial, recreational and domestic users.  Under the programme, a total of £14 million is being provided for water and sewerage schemes in the period 1994-1999.  Eight major schemes are involved, together with some 50 small water and sewerage schemes in Border counties.</P>
    <P>Besides the INTERREG II Programme a major investment programme to provide other major schemes in the Border region is being co-financed through the Cohesion Fund and the Structural Fund, as well as schemes financed totally by the Exchequer.</P>

      <P>My Department has received a request from the City of Dublin Vocational Educational Committee for funding for the provision of a sports hall at Ballyfermot senior college. However, due to the demands on capital resorces available, priority had to be given to the provision of essential teaching accommodation.  As a result, it is not possible to make funding available, at this stage, for the provision of a sports hall at the school.</P>

      <P>The original application made by the school in question was for the replacement of five prefabricated classrooms.  My Department's senior inspector responded to this application by recommending the provision of six general classrooms and toilet facilities for the school.</P>
      <P>The trustees of the school then offered a vacant convent building which they thought could be converted easily and economically to provide the recommended additional space.  The schedule of accommodation was therefore revised to include the refurbishment of six general classrooms, a science laboratory, an art-craft room, a home economics room, a staffroom and toilet facilities within this building.</P>
      <P>However, before any funds could be committed to such a project, the school authorities were requested to carry out a feasibility study to determine if the conversion works would be the most cost-efficient way of providing the recommended teaching spaces.  It was found that the works could not be carried out within the cost limits and the school authorities and their design team have recently been requested to report on the costs associated with providing the originally recommended six classrooms as a new extension.</P>
      <P>When this report has been received and considered, the Department will be in contact with the school authorities again.</P>

      <P>A pilot security project, covering a number of schools in the East Finglas area, was initiated in 1993 on a temporary basis.  It is being continued for a further year.  In view of the significant cost implications, I have no plans to extend the scheme to any other school or area at this time.  However, the matter will be kept under review in the light of available resources.</P>

      <P>The pilot scheme of teacher-counsellors is intended to offer special targeted support to selected disadvantaged schools which are encountering particular difficulty in coping with disruptive and disturbed pupils.</P>
      <P>The key role of the teacher-counsellor is to co-ordinate a whole school approach to devising and implementing good practice and strategies which will help prevent the occurrence of disruptive behaviour; and to teach and counsel small groups and individuals who exhibit presistent behavioural difficulties in the classroom.</P>
      <P>A total of 27 teacher-counsellor posts have been allocated under this initiative. The pilot scheme has been introduced in the Tallaght/Clondalkin and north inner city areas.  Particulars of the individual schools involved are attached.</P>
      <P>The scheme will be closely monitored by my Department's primary inspectorate. The question of further development of the scheme will be considered in the light of the review of the pilot phase of the initiative and having regard to resource availability.</P>

General Secretary, ICTU.</P>
      <P>The group has the following terms of reference.  First, to review the operation of the Courts system, having regard to the level and quality of service provided to the public, staffing, information technology, etc; the financing of the Courts system, including the current relationship between the Courts, the Department of Justice and the Oireachtas in this regard; and any other aspect of the operation of the Courts system which the group considers appropriate. Second, in the light of the foregoing review, to consider the matter of the establishment of a commission on the management of the Courts as an independent and permanent body with financial and management autonomy (as envisaged in the December 1994 document entitled A Government of Renewal).  Third, to have investigative, advisory and recommendation functions and to make a report (and any interim reports and recommendations as they see fit) to the Minister for Justice on the foregoing matters.</P>
      <P>In deciding on the composition of the group, I was conscious of the need to avoid having a group which would be so large as to be unwieldy, while at the same time having the balance and range of experience necessary to discharge its mandate in an efficient and effective, way.  I believe that the group I have selected meets these criteria.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that submissions from interested parties have been sought by the group.  It should be noted that a public advertisement was placed calling for submissions by 22 December 1995 and also a number of sub-groups will be working on different aspects and they will be able to discuss relevant areas with interested parties. All interests, including those mentioned by the Deputy, will have a full opportunity to express their views to the group on matters coming within its terms of reference.</P>

      <P>Under the terms of the court orders applying in the various legal proceedings taken in relation to the payment of equal treatment arrears, the State will meet the legal costs of the plaintiffs to be taxed in default of agreement. The State will meet the legal fees as adjudicated by the Taxing Master under the normal procedure whereby a solicitor's bill is examined by the Taxing Master who may either allow or reduce the amount involved.</P>
      <P>The question as to whether the married women concerned may be charged additional fees, over and above those to be met by the State, will be determined by the nature of whatever agreement they may have entered into with their solicitors.

    </Speaker>
    <P>The small number of overseas jobs that have been created in counties Monaghan and Cavan since the beginning of this year is, of course, disappointing, and is largely due to the fact that no new overseas industries have been established in those counties this year.  I should stress in this regard, however, that project location decisions are a matter for decision by the companies themselves, and that their decisions are <Col N="451" /> influenced by a variety of factors outside the control of the agencies coming under the remit of my Department.</P>
    <P>I must also add that negotiations between these agencies and individual promoters is a matter for the day to day administration of the agencies themselves and not one in which I have a specific function.</P>
    <P>I can, however, assure the Deputy that IDA Ireland will continue to promote the Cavan and Monaghan areas for mobile investment and I am sure that the economic benefits arising out of the peace process will contribute to the development of those counties in this regard.</P>

      <P>Due to increased competition from the Far East and high production costs in Europe, Iduna NV, the Dutch owners of Iduna Ireland Limited decided to rationalise their worldwide operations.  As a result, the company advised IDA Ireland earlier this year that they intend to close the Kingscourt plant.  At the request of IDA, Iduna deferred closure until the end of the year and the plant is now scheduled to close on 22 December 1995.</P>
      <P>I have asked the State development agencies to do everything possible to find a replacement industry for Kingscourt. In this regard the overseas and regional offices of IDA Ireland have been informed of the impending closure of the facility and the availability of a skilled workforce.</P>
      <P>IDA Ireland is making every effort to seek a new investor for this facility. Interest has been expressed by a number of potential investors and the IDA is currently engaged in ongoing discussions with one of these investors.

      <P>Under the Abattoirs Act, 1988, the local authorities are required to appoint a wholetime veterinary inspector to carry out the functions proscribed by that Act.  At present, all local authorities other than Cavan, Kilkenny, Laois, Leitrim, Longford, Louth, Monaghan, Roscommon, Sligo and Tipperary NR County Councils have wholetime veterinary inspectors employed for this purpose.  My Department does not make a financial contribution towards the costs involved. Slaughter fees are payable by the abattoir operators and these go some way towards meeting the expenses of the local authorities.</P>

      <P>The artificial insemination of cattle is currently governed by the Live Stock (Artificial Insemination) Act, 1947, and the regulations made thereunder in 1948.  The company referred to in the question is not licensed under this legislation to provide an artificial insemination service to farmers.</P>
      <P>The decision of my Department not to grant a licence to this company has been the subject of a High Court case by the means of the judicial review procedure. The High Court judgment in the case, which was delivered in July of this year, upheld both my Department's decisions in respect of the company's application and the policy adopted by it in this area.  However, that judgment has now been appealed by the applicant to the Supreme Court and the date of hearing is awaited.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that a number of questions about the High Court judgment in the Carrigaline case were asked in this House only two weeks ago on Tuesday, 21 November &mdash; Questions Nos. 196 to 199 on the Order Paper &mdash; and I would refer her to my answers on that occasion.  I pointed out at that time that the lengthy judgment in the Carrigaline case had only just been delivered and that I would have to consider it <Col N="458" /> carefully, and take legal advice, before any definitive comment can be made. An approved copy of the judgment has not yet been made available by the court.</P>
      <P>I also pointed out that the High Court, in affirming the statutory basis for radio frequency licensing, including the validity of the exclusive MMDS licences, confirmed my duty to regulate the use of the radio spectrum in the national interest.  An important consideration is the quality of services to television viewers.  This places a demand on frequency space.  However, I must also have regard to Government policies and objectives in the broadcasting area, which will require frequencies for a third independent television channel, as well as an Irish language channel, Teilefís na Gaeilge, both of which are to be provided on a nation-wide basis. Provision will also have to be made in the near future for frequencies to broadcast programmes in the new digital format.</P>
      <P>As soon as my Department receives a detailed licence application from the Carrigaline group, Southcoast, it will be fully examined in a process that is fair and impartial, but which takes account of all my responsibilities.  I will also have regard to whatever wider geographic implications may arise from the Carrigaline case but in advance of a new application by Southcoast, or by the Donegal group, and full consideration of all the factors I have outlined, it would be premature of me to adopt any position at this stage.</P>

      <P>I have had no indication that the present standard of telecommunications infrastructure in the Border areas is unsatisfactory. The development of Telecom Éireann's network and infrastructure is, however, a day-to-day operational matter for the company and I am precluded under legislation from interfering in such matters.</P>
      <P>I have brought the content of the Deputy's question to the attention of Telecom Éireann's management and the company has informed me that the Border regions are already served with modern high speed transmission links and that continuous upgrading and extensions are planned over the next few years.  In that context, I am satisfied that high technology telecommunications facilities in the Border areas will continue to be developed and will further enhance the economic potential of these areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Telecom Éireann has submitted applications for EU assistance for a number of projects under the INTERREG programme.  These projects involve fibre optic cabling and exchange replacement and upgrades along the Border region totalling approximately £16 million.  All the applications for funding under the INTERREG programme, including those submitted by Telecom Éireann, are currently being examined by my Department in conjunction with independent consultants to ensure consistency with the aims and objectives of the programme.  That examination will be completed shortly, after which it will be necessary to liase with the European Commission concerning the investments to be funded.  Telecom Éireann's proposals, if approved, will serve to further <Col N="460" /> enhance other measures, including those relating to the peace process, in support of the economic development of the Border region.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Lowry)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 180 and 181 together.</P>
      <P>The Interdepartmental Transport Accessibility Committee does not produce progress reports in its own right.  However, my predecessors and I have outlined to the House on a number of occasions the progress which has been made to date in relation to the introduction of transport accessibility improvements.</P>
      <P>The implementation of such improvements in transport infrastructure and services is essentially a matter for transport operators and others directly involved in the transport chain.  In order to facilitate progress in this country, the committee to which the Deputy refers has been in existence since 1988, chaired by my Department.  The committee pursues a policy of seeking to secure such improvements in accessibility to all modes of public transport as can be implemented within the resources available to transport providers and other relevant bodies, including the companies within the CIE Group, who participate fully in the committee's work.  The implementation of this policy has led to considerable improvements in public transport access facilities for people with mobility handicaps.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In so far as rail services are concerned, it is now Iarnród Éireann's policy that all new rail vehicles will be accessible to people with disabilities. DART trains are wheelchair-accessible as are the new Arrow railcars, which also have wheelchair-accessible toilets. The new carriages for the Dublin-Belfast service will also have this facility, while the existing Intercity <Col N="462" /> trains all have at least one dedicated area for wheelchair users in the dining cars.  All major railway terminals and the majority of mainline and DART stations are wheelchair-accessible and it is company policy that all new stations and any major refurbishments of existing stations should make provision for the disabled.  In addition, particular attention is being given to the needs of people with mobility handicaps in the design of the proposed light rail system for Dublin.</P>
    <P>As regards bus services, both Bus Átha Cliath and Bus Éireann endeavour to obtain the most accessible and user-friendly vehicles available on a cost-effective basis.  Both companies in replacing their urban fleets are guided by the recommended specifications of the Disabled Persons Transport Advisory Committee, a UK statutory body which advises on the needs and requirements of the mobility impaired.  Bus Éireann has also acquired over 160 improved coaches for its Expressway network, which include a facility whereby the front of the coach may be lowered to facilitate access.</P>
    <P>Wheelchair users present the greatest accessibility challenge to bus operators, the main problem being the lack of affordable, operationally-proven and cost-effective wheelchair-accessible buses.  In this connection, the introduction of more than 90 wheelchair-accessible taxis in the Dublin area represents a significant step towards providing a flexible, door-to-door facility corresponding to the particular needs of wheelchair users.  Bus Átha Cliath and Bus Éireann are monitoring technological and operational developments associated with wheelchair-accessible buses and I have requested both companies to accord high priority to affordable accessibility improvements in their fleet replacement programmes.</P>
    <P>Meanwhile, Bus Átha Cliath, on behalf of the interdepartmental committee, has acquired a number of wheelchair-accessible minibuses to operate a service for the general public &mdash; the Omnilink service &mdash; on a pilot basis. The project was undertaken on the understanding that it would attract a <Col N="463" /> grant of £592,000 under the EU Horizon Programme, representing a contribution to the capital and operating costs of the scheme over a two year period.  In the event, total EU funding made available was limited to approximately £210,000 relating almost entirely to the capital element only.  In view of the shortfall in the EU contribution, it was necessary to re-appraise the project.  As a result, instead of the Clontarf-Finglas service (Route 103) originally proposed, a city centre service (Route 222) linking the O'Connell Street and St. Stephen's Green areas to the accessible DART system at Tara Street Station was introduced on 28 May last.  All aspects of the pilot scheme are being reviewed by the committe.</P>

      <P>I understand that the circumstances surrounding the purchase and subsequent operation of the <i>MFV Marita</i> are currently the subject of correspondence between BIM and the owner.  It would be inappropriate for me to comment on the specifics of the case.  I can confirm that I have decided to carry out a comprehensive review of fishing vessel safety generally.  This will be taken forward in consultation with the fishing industry and other relevant interests.</P>

      <P>Donegal County Council has applied to the Department of the Marine for orders prohibiting the disturbance of beach material by motorcycles, beach buggies and such like vehicles at the beaches of Carrickfin and Lisfannon. The applications were published last July in local newspapers in accordance <Col N="466" /> with the Foreshore Acts.  No objections to the making of the proposed orders were received and the Department is consulting the Office of the Attorney General with a view to settling the terms of the draft orders.</P>
