      <P>I wish to seek the Adjournment of the House to debate an urgent and important matter, the circumstances surrounding the employment of the personal assistant to the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Deenihan, and the apparent breach of social welfare regulations where the said personal assistant was concurrently drawing an invalidity pension while working full-time for the Minister over a period of five months.</P>

      <P>It is also proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that: (1) Nos. 2 and 3 shall be decided without debate; (2) subject to the agreement of No. 5, No. 4 shall be debated with the Final Stage of the Fifteenth Amendment of the Constitution (No. 2) Bill, 1995, and the proceedings on the Fifteenth Amendment to the Constitution (No. 2) Bill, 1995 and No. 4, if not previously concluded, shall be brought to a conclusion at 7.00 p.m. by one question in the case of the proceedings on the Fifteenth Amendment of the Constitution (No. 2) Bill, 1995, which shall in relation to amendments include only those set down or accepted by the Minister for Equality and Law Reform and one question in the case of the proceedings on No. 4, such questions to be put from the Chair forthwith and successively; (3) Private Members' Business shall be No. 15 and the proceedings thereon shall be brought to a conclusion at 8.30 p.m. tonight.</P>

      <P>Following the unsustainable attacks by the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, Deputy Lowry, on the semi-State sector, will the Taoiseach, possibly with the Tánaiste if he so wishes, meet the chairmen and chief executives of all the semi-State companies to restore their morale and focus their attention on the serious challenges they face in the commercial sector?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The report containing the recommendations in question has <Col N="1692" /> been published and the Government has yet to make formal decisions on the recommendations.  If legislation is required to implement them, such legislation will be introduced.  It is not incumbent on me or even possible for me to give a legal interpretation as to whether every one of the recommendations can be implemented by Executive action or whether some of them will require statutory provision.  I am not sufficiently <i>au fait</i> with details of existing legislation to enable me, without notice, to answer a question of such legal complexity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy to respond.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an important matter.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry to trespass on the Chair's prerogatives.  The Government made it clear when the judgement was announced that it should be respected.  It is important for the rule of law in Europe &mdash; which was under threat during the first half of this century and which has been protected thanks to international institutions of this type &mdash; that whether States like its conclusions or not they should respect them.  That is important in the context of this matter.  Human rights is an international and not purely a national matter. We have moved away from the time when States made their rules on these matters independently and without regard to international norms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1693" /> It is not particulatly profitable for this House to become involved in individual criticisms of other Governments.  That general rule I have set out is respected by this Government, by its predecessors and by this country.  That is sufficient indication of our view.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>The House should take this opportunity to congratulate Séamus Heaney on winning the Nobel Prize for Literature.  He is the fourth poet this century to win the prize and it is a great honour for him, his family and for the country.  The Taoiseach met Mr. Heaney on his return to Ireland.  When football teams do well on behalf of this country the House is always ready to congratulate them.  We are proud of Mr. Heaney's achievements and this House should honour him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to promised legislation on freedom of information which the Tánaiste said yesterday would lift the curtains of secrecy that have clouded public policy making in the State for generations, how can the Taoiseach justify the secrecy and obfuscation this Government continues to use to protect its affairs in the context of answering parliamentary questions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How can the Taoiseach's alleged <Col N="1695" /> commitment to openness and accountability on his own behalf and on behalf of his Ministers be justified when he is in perpetual flight from my questions&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Several times before the summer the Taoiseach promised to introduce legislation in the autumn to deal with the problem of stray horses in city areas.  We were told in June that the Minister of State, Deputy Deenihan, was on schedule in dealing with this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know if his party has applied the reins to Deputy Ahern.  The question raised by Deputy Ahern is important, particularly in his <Col N="1696" /> constituency and a number of others.  I expect the text of the legislation to be submitted to the Government at the end of November but realistically the legislation will not be before the House until January.  If we can introduce it before Christmas we will do so.  This is a matter of some importance and we are pursuing it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The previous promises were that we would have this legislation this session.  Has the Minister been deflected or is he chasing other strays? What has happened?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to prolong this discussion.  When I give an indication of when legislation of this nature will be introduced, I offer the best estimate but that does not constitute a cast iron promise that the legislation will be ready at a certain time.  It is not possible to make cast iron promises given that new legislative priorities will intervene and sometimes unforeseen difficulties in drafting other legislation might postpone something in the queue.  The Deputy will appreciate that this is how these things work.  However, this legislation is being taken seriously because it is a matter of concern in a number of constituencies.  That is all I can say at this point.</P>

      <P>The legislation in place is reasonably adequate and it is a matter of ensuring that it is enforced and that prosecutions are brought successfully by assembling the necessary evidence etc.  I am not aware that there is a problem with the terms of existing law in this matter but if the Deputy has any evidence which suggests that is a problem as distinct from enforcement and prosecution I will, of course, have the matter investigated by the relevant Department.</P>

    <P>Following the Minister's decision not to accept my Committee Stage amendment I considered some of the difficulties he had with it and put down an improved amendment.  Everyone is aware of the many arguments we have had about the wording of the Bill and my Committee Stage amendment.  It is essential that our views are on the record so that we can prove we are consistent in what we say.  I have come across an attitude &mdash; not shared by the Minister or Deputy Woods &mdash; that the legislation should be passed on a sort of nod and wink basis.  This would not be appropriate as it deals with a very important matter.</P>
    <P>The amendment seeks to differentiate between our approach and that of other parties.  It is my firm belief that divorce should be available and people should have the right to remarry.  That view has been articulated by my party over the past ten years.  In saying this we believe that the Constitution should set out in broad terms the fundamental laws of the State.  It is the job of politicians to legislate and notwithstanding our belief that people should have the right to remarry &mdash; we are <i>ad idem</i> with the Government on this point &mdash; we fundamentally disagree with the tactics and approach adopted by the Minister in this regard.</P>
    <P>The Constitution should claim the <Col N="1703" /> allegiance of all people.  It is important to point out that many people hold the same views as we do.  In its submission to the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation the Church of Ireland stated that the Constitution is not a suitable vehicle for dealing with detailed social legislation. Unfortunately this is what we will end up with if the Minister includes his proposed wording in the Constitution. Difficulties arose in 1986 because the necessary legislation was not in place.  However, we have not learnt from that experience, the later amendments to the Constitution or the débâcle in the X case.  An amendment must be made to the Constitution but we, as legislators, should put the question to the people in the full confidence that they will allow us to legislate.  We should ask them about the principle and then apply the detail to it.  That is the most appropriate direction to take.</P>
    <P>The amendment states &ldquo;Notwithstanding any other provision of this Constitution,...&rdquo;.  I am not one of the constitutional lawyers in our party but many people, particularly those in family law, are extremely concerned that the amendment tabled by the Minister will have to be read in conjunction with other provisions of the constitution.  A cursory glance at the Constitution reveals that difficulties may arise in that regard.  I am not convinced that the Minister's strategy is appropriate because his method of seeking to reassure people is unnecessary and inappropriate.  I know what he is trying to do and understand the reasoning behind it but it is fundamentally flawed. People who will vote &ldquo;no&rdquo; in the forthcoming referendum will not care one iota about any reassurance the Minister seeks to provide by means of constitutional amendment.  I do not believe he should have embarked on this course.</P>
    <P>During the Committee Stage debate I was distressed to hear the reason he went down this path.  We are all aware of Deputy Woods' position on this issue.  He stated that the Minister had accepted the criteria in this regard set <Col N="1704" /> down by Fianna Fáil.  I do not agree that accepting the criteria laid down by a particular party is the right way to go about amending our Constitution.  We should listen to the views of various groups.  The Minister is aware that I am voicing an opinion held not only by my party but by many Members of the House.  I believe it was Deputy O'Keeffe who said on Committee Stage that he was sympathetic towards my view but did not believe it was the correct path to follow.  A number of other Deputies expressed that view publicly at that forum and privately at that time. That view is held by minority groups such as the Church of Ireland and by not only constitutional lawyers but, more importantly, by lawyers directly involved in family law cases who are concerned about the constitutional imperative contained in the Minister's amendment.</P>
    <P>The amendment I tabled today is simple, straightforward, easy to comprehend and, if accepted, there would be complete understanding that the laws of the land would set out the provisions for divorce.  Notwithstanding the Minister's view regarding reassurance and so on, which I appreciate, I believe it is fundamentally wrong.  There are other ways of reassuring people.  Unfortunately, the fact that the Minister is saying that we must reassure people by enshrining something in the Constitution rather than saying we will legislate properly, is sending out the wrong signals about ourselves.  Unfortunately, he is saying we do not trust ourselves and we do not believe that the public trust us either, and that is not appropriate.</P>
    <P>Another reason I tabled this amendment, although it is not the main one, is that I would be concerned if there were a two minute debate on this issue. Members should put their views on this issue on the record of the House.  Even at this eleventh hour I appeal to the Minister to accept the many arguments made about the approach to amending the Constitution and to accept my bona fides that there is a genuine case for changing the approach to this issue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not support the amendment tabled by the Progressive Democrats for the same reasons we outlined in respect of the amendment it tabled on Committee Stage.  There is no question of these issues being glossed over.  They have been considered seriously and genuinely by Members on this side of the House and members of my party.  We have had discussions, parliamentary party meetings, taken soundings of people's views on the issues involved and expressed them at some length on Second Stage and again on Committee Stage.  A number of my party colleagues and Deputies from both sides of the House spoke on Committee Stage.  There is no question of a decision on this issue being slipped through as suggested by Deputy Keogh.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy Keogh said, one is always a little concerned about being repetitive when discussing an amendment different from one tabled on an earlier Stage. The Minister said that amendment was not appropriate, would have led to more problems than the proposed wording and, consequently, we could not support it.  The amendment contained a clause that if a judge found that there was just cause for a dissolution of marriage, it could be dissolved.  The term &ldquo;a just clause&rdquo; is very open and the Minister has gone to great lengths to specify the conditions and terms under which divorce could apply if the people support a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote in the forthcoming referendum. I will not delay the House by repeating the debate on the issue.  We set out our reasons for supporting the Bill on Second and Committee Stages. Deputy Keogh said that a Constitution should set out broad terms and I agree. It represents people's aspirations and it should be concerned about the broad guidelines for legislation.  We are concerned that there would be a broad guideline to ensure that there would not be quickie divorces; hence, we want a reasonable time period to elapse between the breakdown of a marriage and a divorce.  That is a broad guideline. Legislation can be introduced within <Col N="1706" /> that broad guideline but one of the parameters which we considered important is that there should be a reasonable time gap between those two events.  That would allow time for reconciliation, counselling, arrangements and mediation.  In the studies on children we undertook we found that the time gap was particularly important to facilitate the making of a variety of arrangements and to provide for a period of adjustment. Perhaps the proposed guideline is not such a bad one.</P>
    <P>Many people in our party from throughout the country have said there must be some gap and that we cannot fall into the same trap into which Britain and other countries fell when &ldquo;quickie&rdquo; divorce was introduced.  Such divorce in these countries caused so much difficulty that they are now trying to move back from what are effectively divorces after three months.  This is one of the guidelines we saw as being important and which we wish to see included.</P>
    <P>I am happy the Minister has included these guidelines as important criteria. We are satisfied he has made an honest, sincere and good attempt to introduce an appropriate amendment which embodies general guidelines and leaves the detail to be decided by legislation. People do not want &ldquo;quickie&rdquo; divorces and they want this view enshrined in the Constitution.  This has been our understanding from an early stage and we would ignore the sincere views of people, including members of our party, if we did not seek to have such a broad term included.</P>
    <P>The other major area we wish to see covered in the constitutional amendment is protection for children.  The greatest concerns of people with regard to divorce and the proposal to remove the ban on divorce from the Constitution are the care, custody and maintenance of children and the psychological effects on them, not only of marriage breakdown and separation but also of the extra problems which may arise from removing the ban and providing for divorce.  Because we are proposing <Col N="1707" /> to take away the absolute safeguard of the complete ban on divorce, we strongly feel that protection for children must be clearly stated in the Constitution. We must not just say that there might or might not be such protection and that it will depend on how a vote goes and so on.</P>
    <P>These are the parameters we want to see enshrined in the Constitution.  We want it to provide broad protection.  The protection proposed in the constitutional amendment is not absolute or detailed but it provides an umbrella under which legislation can operate and under which we as public representatives can design legislation.  We can be sure that if this protection is not in the Constitution somebody such as a barrister or a Member of the House will quickly make this clear.</P>
    <P>We are concerned in broad terms about children and &ldquo;quickie&rdquo; divorces. Many people have said they would be far less concerned about the removal of the ban if it were not for their concern about children.  They want to see in the Constitution a reflection of their concern about the way children will be treated if the amendment is passed.</P>
    <P>Some will say that this kind of clause is included so that extra support can be won.  Much has been made of this in the media and the House.  As far as I am concerned, this matter is straightforward and simple and has nothing to do with winning support.  We either support, protect and care about children and are sensitive to their needs or we do not.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree there is nothing wrong with winning support but we should be clear that our duty is to try to include in the Constitution the right parameters and broad terms which will protect children.  Deputy Keogh wants things said on the record so that she can <Col N="1708" /> refer to them.  Her lawyers have presumably advised her to ask people to say things on the record so that they can be criticised in future.  I can only say what I believe and know to be the case. I speak not as a lawyer and an expert but as a person who is perhaps an expert about people, as most Members are. Politicians are experts in knowing what people want, understanding their needs and representing them.  The legal experts are there to find solutions and to devise the methodology of meeting the broad aspirations of people.</P>
      <P>We believe the Minister has dealt with this challenge close to rightly.  We cannot be certain that every word is watertight but we know he has the assurances and legal support of the Attorney General in putting forward this constitutional amendment.</P>
      <P>Our concern is that there should be protection for children and this will be important in any legislation which is subsequently introduced.  My experience as Minister for Social Welfare warns me that if such protection is not included in the Constitution a Minister who argues at the Cabinet for changes which invlove money will not be able to rely on any constitutional protection or umbrella.  Views on these matters change from time to time and it is important to have broad guidelines in place.  The constitutional amendment proposed by the Minister appears reasonable and it covers the principal elements which are important for people when such a major change is proposed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We cannot support the amendment tabled by the Progressive Democrats.  It contains the words &ldquo;notwithstanding any other provision of this Constitution&rdquo;. The intention, presumably, is to set aside the other provisions of the Constitution.  This contrasts substantially with what the Minister is doing. He is placing the proposed constitutional amendment within the Article of the Constitution on the family and the proposed entitlements will be part of that Article.  These entitlements will be contained in that section which also <Col N="1709" /> stresses the position of the family in society.  Obviously, if there is a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote these changes will have to be taken within the context of the very high regard which we have always had for the family and which is enshrined in our Constitution.  These changes take place in that context.  The broad parameters are broad parameters within the family. That may be inconvenient for lawyers who might like something very simple, such as, notwithstanding anything else in the Constitution, we can do all the things we want to do here.  Clinically, from a lawyer's point of view that could be much neater.  If lawyers were asked how they would deal with it, they would say to leave it to them and to very simple legislation and that they would deal with it in that context.  That is an understandable reaction.</P>
    <P>Life might be simpler for everyone if, like Britain, we did not have a written Constitution and we had the same flexibility as in Britain.  My experience shows that as far as the ordinary citizen in this country is concerned, our Constitution &mdash; and the records in the courts show that again and again &mdash; is one of the best things the man or woman in the street has going for them.  It is my belief that the Constitution is important, practical and has effect, which has been shown time and again.  It is a stay on the Executive and the Government of the day. They must have regard to what is in the Constitution.  It is particularly important for ordinary citizens and we are all ordinary citizens.  These are some of the reasons I feel we are adopting the right approach.  There must be broad parameters to cover these areas and if they were in the Constitution there would be flexibility and opportunity to develop legislation in relation to divorce.  In fact, the Minister has already put the draft Bill before the House.  It allows for considerable flexibility and if the people decide in favour of this amendment it will allow for the introduction of divorce under these broad terms.  It is a major change for us and one which we support, not just in relation to putting the issue before the people but the principle <Col N="1710" /> of the change of removing the ban on divorce.  In supporting that principle we want safeguards.  We believe the Minister's amendment is probably as right as anybody can get it at this time.  That is why we will not support the amendment put forward by the Progressive Democrats.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>My sympathy for the spirit of the Progressive Democrats' approach does not permit me to give support to the letter of the amendment as proposed.  My view is that the ban on divorce should never have been in the Constitution.  At the foundation of the State the founding fathers, in their wisdom, did not include the constitutional ban on divorce and it was only in 1937 that such a prohibition was introduced. Yet we have to be cognisant in discussing this issue of the need to get the support of the people to ensure the referendum is passed.  It seems clear from all the available research that the majority of the people would prefer to retain some of the conditions in the Constitution.  In that situation I set aside my own views in relation to the supremacy of parliamentary democracy when dealing with matters that should best be dealt with by legislation only.  I have never been one to pander to populism. I am a strong believer in parliamentary democracy but I have to accept the practical situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a job to be done.  It is absolutely wrong, considering the extent of marital breakdown in Ireland, that the ban on divorce and the prohibition on the right to remarry should continue; 75,000 people in Ireland are separated and, unfortunately, because of the extent of marital breakdown, that figure is increasing year by year.  Will we condemn these people to remain in a constitutional limbo where they either have to refrain from second relationships or, if they do involve themselves in second relationships, they have no proper legal or constitutional cover?  It would be utterly wrong of us to ignore that problem. It is our job as legislators to ensure <Col N="1711" /> that the right to remarry, which is available in every other civilised country, is available here.  If it is more likely that the people will accept that proposal by having restrictions in the Constitution then let us go that route.</P>
    <P>We could lose sight of the overall objective in the debate on the technical approach.  It is important to go back to first base when we are discussing this issue &mdash; the need to deal with the unfortunate victims of broken marriages.  Certainly we must have compassion for them and we must take the necessary steps to try to do what we can from a legislative point of view and, in particular, to give them the right to remarry.</P>
    <P>We also have to take into account the broader considerations of society and those affecting the whole island.  I have no doubt, even though it is not the primary reason for movement on this front, that a negative decision on this issue would not be helpful to the peace process or to the way in which the Republic would be viewed by our friends and neighbours in Northern Ireland.  It is important from that point of view that there is a positive decision in this referendum and that we show we are a modern pluralist State, that we are not just paying lip service, that we are taking the necessary steps to ensure that we are and can be fully regarded by all as a modern pluralist State.</P>
    <P>Insufficient attention has been paid to the question of whether the right to remarry is a civil right.  I confess to being a little embarrassed by the comments of the Chinese Deputy Prime Minister &mdash; who visited this country during the week &mdash; when he was rightly asked by Government Ministers, the Taoiseach and the media about human rights in China.  He was able to suggest that, in effect, people in glasshouses should not throw stones.  There is no way one can equate the most awful things that happen in China with the fact that there is not a civil right of remarriage here.  He was able to do it and to say that the matters which were raised were internal as far as the Government of China was <Col N="1712" /> concerned and that the question of human rights was not one for us to raise. In effect, he turned the argument around and said that we have our own difficulties here from the point of view of civil rights in that we do not even have the right of divorce and remarriage. From the international point of view, it is just another aspect that has to be considered when we compare ourselves with other countries, We cannot be like ostriches and bury our heads in the sand.</P>
    <P>The Minister's proposal seems to have the best chance of attracting the broadest level of support.  It is quite clear that virtually all the parties in the Dáil support it.  I am sure Deputy Keogh will not disagree that in broad terms the Progressive Democrats Party supports that approach although it would prefer from the tactical point of view to have it presented in a somewhat different way.  In broad terms the Progressive Democrats Party wants to have divorce and the right to remarry made available as do the rest of us.  From the point of view of the overall objective of securing a positive vote in the referendum we have to give credit to the Minister for coming up with a balanced proposal that is not 100 per cent acceptable to everybody but has the best chance of being accepted by the people.  I support that.</P>
    <P>The referendum campaign so far has been reasonably balanced and I hope that will continue.  There is a very good chance that the balanced proposal from the Oireachtas will be accepted and I intend to do what I can to ensure that. In spite of the fact that the Progressive Democrats approach has not been adopted, I hope the party will do the same.  Taking the practicalities into account, I fully support the approach adopted by the Minister and cannot support this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to deal with this amendment in a general way in terms of its approach to constitutional change in the key area of dissolution of marriage. Clearly that approach is at odds with the route chosen by the Government, a <Col N="1713" /> route which, as evidenced by the response to the Progressive Democrats amendment on Second Stage, commands widespread support among the broad spectrum of political opinion.  I know there are differing views as to the desirability of putting detailed criteria into the Constitution, particularly where social matters are concerned.  Nevertheless, we have to face up to the fact that there are genuine fears in our community concerning the adverse effects which might be attendant on the introduction of divorce, particularly in so far as dependent spouses and children are concerned.  There is also apprehension that a divorce regime might mirror the regime in other jurisdictions where divorce is readily available even after a very short period of marriage and only on the most tenuous evidence of marriage breakdown.  We may feel these fears and apprehensions are groundless but as legislators we cannot ignore them.  We must deal with them in some way.  The way the Government has chosen to deal with these matters is by way of the specific provisions which are the subject of the Fifteenth Amendment of the Constitution (No. 2) Bill, 1995. This Government is deeply committed to ensuring that couples whose marriages break down will have a right to remarry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For them to have this right it is necessary that the divorce referendum be passed and that is the essential issue on which we should focus.  It is not an abrogation of legislative responsibility to accept that on some issues the decision of the people must take precedence over our authority.  It is not legislative cowardice to accept that many people might reject the introduction of divorce here if primary legislation rather than a constitutional provision is to be the main instrument of the change.  The amendment proposal put forward by the Government is comparatively brief but encapsulates the essential requirements that would have to be fulfilled before a valid divorce could be granted.  This is a reassurance to the many members of our society <Col N="1714" /> who have strong views on the type of divorce regime most suitable for Ireland.  It is the ultimate guarantee that what they vote for is what they get.  If the provision is to be changed in the future, it is the people who will change it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Keogh's amendment is purely an enabling measure designed to permit the Oireachtas to prescribe the conditions under which a divorce will be granted.  This approach is not capable of obtaining majority support at this moment.  It lacks precision and does not offer the security evident in the Government's proposal.  The Deputy will not be surprised therefore if I say with regret that I am not in a position to accept her amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister quite rightly says I am not surprised that he is unwilling to accept this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand where the Minister is coming from and the reasoning which prompted him to adopt the approach he has taken.  He wants to be practical and have the measure go through.  I want the ban on divorce to go and that is fundamental to my arguments.  The Minister will accuse me of being impractical if I say I do not honestly think a great number of people believe it is necessary or right to put this measure into the Constitution. When we consider something as fundamental as amending our Constitution what should guide our approach is what is right, not what is expedient.  I am not condemning the Minister for this because he believes this is the only way to have this measure passed.  That belies the maturity of the electorate who can understand the arguments.  I believe we will have a successful outcome to the proposed amendment because Irish people are compassionate, and understand the necessity for thousands of people to regularise their situations and be given the right to remarry.  That is why people will vote &ldquo;yes&rdquo; and not because of the constitutional imperative to look after children and so on.  I agree wholeheartedly that we should have protection for children and that we <Col N="1715" /> should not have quickie divorces.  I do not have any problems with the arguments made on the type of divorce regime we should have.  The removal of the ban on divorce will not result in a divorce culture.  Our children have a fundamental right to be protected whether or not we have divorce, and it should not be necessary to enshrine in the Constitution a provision to safeguard them, as if such provision were some type of <i>quid pro quo</i>.  That would be almost to say children will be messed up if divorce is introduced and that we must, through the Constitution, make sure they will be looked after.  Marriage breakdown exists.  They are unhappy families and children who are at risk. Every time we open our newspapers we see reports of abuse of children.  As a society we need to safeguard our children by ensuring that we have the legislative framework to do so, and that should be fundamental to our society, not just tagged on to divorce legislation. We should protect children not just in the context of divorce but in the wider context.</P>
    <P>I appreciate Deputy O'Keeffe's concern to get the support of the people for the amendment to the Constitution, and the way to do that is by persuasion and reassurance.  It is not necessary to enshrine the detailed provisions in the Constitution.  From the time this legislation passes until the referendum is put to the people it behoves the Government to campaign energetically for the amendment and to explain what legislation has been put in place since the last divorce referendum.  That is the kind of reassurance people need.</P>
    <P>The Minister intends to do everything he can to get this amendment through, and he knows I will campaign for the deletion of the ban on divorce.  I am unhappy with the approach taken and I have expressed my views as well as I can, unfortunately to no effect as far as having my amendments accepted is concerned. Ironically, despite my disagreement with the Minister's approach, I am <Col N="1716" /> determined that the Progressive Democrats will campaign to give people a second chance, to give them the right to remarry.  I do not want my disagreement with the tactical approach of the Minister to be misunderstood or taken as a reason for not voting &ldquo;yes&rdquo; in the upcoming referendum.  I am disappointed with the Minister's approach which I think is wrong and will result in future difficulties.  However, I agree with the view of many who have campaigned for divorce for many years that half a loaf is better than no bread.  I hope that despite misgivings regarding the provisions put before us by the Minister people will vote wholeheartedly in favour of the right to remarry.  What we are talking about is a civil or human right.  Although I am disappointed with the Minister's approach, I have to accept the view of people in this House.  In trying to deal with people's fears the Minister is unnecessarily using a sledgehammer and has not listened to my views. However, it is very important that these views be expressed on the record of this House.</P>

      <P>Tairgim: &ldquo;Go rithfear an Bille anois&rdquo; I move: &ldquo;That the Bill do now pass&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I express my appreciation to Deputies on all sides of the House for participating in what I consider to have been a most constructive and useful debate as it progressed through the House.  What I would like to do now, in very brief terms, is to deal with some of the false impressions being given about the implications of introducing a limited form of divorce into this jurisdiction.</P>
      <P>It has been claimed that divorce will discriminate against the first family and in favour of the second.  The constitutional amendment is framed precisely in order to ensure that proper provision, having regard to the circumstances, will be made for divorced spouses and for children.  In addition, while divorce dissolves the relationship between the spouses, it does not diminish their inalienable rights and duties in relation to their children.</P>
      <P>There has been criticism that the amendment would permit divorce even when the spouse seeking a divorce has not left the family home.  It is true that, in certain circumstances, it is likely that the living apart criterion will be interpreted so that a couple may be under the same roof but in two separate households.  I see nothing wrong in that. The concept of living apart is already applicable in judicial separation proceedings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has also been said that the amendment will allow one spouse to be divorced against his or her will.  Many spouses have already been deserted against their will and are left with no <Col N="1718" /> legal remedy whereby they might rebuild their lives by embarking upon a second marriage.  We as a people need to focus on what we understand by the marriage tie.  Surely our understanding is deeper than considering it a formal contract whose letter must be adhered to even though everything that might make the relationship real has long since vanished.  Marriages break down. Sometimes both partners accept that fact.  Sometimes one will cling to the hope of reconciliation.  The State has no part to play in locking people into marriages in which they no longer wish to remain.  Divorce is not a perfect option but it provides a legal remedy for those who wish to enjoy a second chance when their marriages have ended.</P>
    <P>Other arguments, with little merit, have begun to crop up in recent days.  It has been said that divorce rewards desertion but I can assure the House that the conduct of the parties will be a factor when a court has to consider the financial and property adjustment orders it should make in an individual case.  The premature break-up and sale of family assets is claimed to be a consequence of divorce.  This ignores the reality that similar orders are being made by the courts under the Judicial Separation and Family Law Act, 1989 and I have heard no great outcry about the dissipation of assets in relation to that Act.</P>
    <P>As in 1986, it is again being sought to make succession rights an issue.  It is true that, following a divorce, the spouses concerned cease to be spouses for the purposes of the Succession Act, 1965.  At present, in judicial separation cases, many spouses have their succession rights against each other extinguished and the position is not entirely dissimilar in respect of divorce.  What must be noted, however, is that in a divorce context, in making the various financial adjustment and property orders at its disposal, a court must have regard to the spouse's loss of succession rights. If adequate provision cannot be made for a spouse at the time of the granting of a divorce decree, I would envisage <Col N="1719" /> that such a spouse, providing that he or she has not remarried, would be entitled to apply subsequently for appropriate provision to be made out of the estate of a former spouse.  This possibility is provided for in the draft Family Law (Divorce) Bill published recently.  The succession rights of children will be unaffected by the divorce of their parents, whether it be their right to succeed on intestacy or, where a will has been made, to bring an application for proper provision out of their deceased parent's estate on the grounds that a parent has failed in his or her moral duty to make such provision for them, as provided for in the 1965 Act.</P>
    <P>It is surprising that the issue of pensions also appears to be surfacing again, despite the fact that there are detailed provisions to ensure that, on a divorce, pension adjustment orders can be made so that a dependant spouse can obtain a portion of the retirement benefit of his or her spouse.  The possibility of creating a separate and independent benefit in favour of the dependent spouse will also exist.</P>
    <P>A final issue, and one about which we have heard much in recent weeks, concerns the rights and welfare of children,. In this context, it is important to distinguish between material and emotional welfare.  When parents separate it is important that the material welfare of their children is safeguarded and the legislative framework is in place to ensure that parents maintain their children where this is possible.  Where it is not, the social welfare system will provide financial support.  The modifications introduced by the Social Welfare (No. 2) Act, 1995 guarantee that the children of divorced parents will be treated no less favourably than the children of separated parents at present.</P>
    <P>In emotional terms, children in an ideal world have a right to the society of both parents and to a loving and caring home.  However, with the incidence of marriage breakdown today, those rights are already being violated.  Through providing increased financial resources <Col N="1720" /> for mediation the State can try to ensure that the breakdown is managed in such a way that does least damage to children. It can also put in place legislation which ensures that, in matters affecting children, the welfare of the individual child is always the paramount concern. This has already been done.</P>
    <P>Nobody would be foolish enough to deny that the breakdown of a marriage may have a detrimental effect on children, but we must separate the damage caused by the conflict leading up to the actual breakdown from that which may be attendant upon the separation.  In many cases it is the former that is likely to give rise to the most trauma.</P>
    <P>I thank Members for the care they exercised in examining the Bill and for the temperate manner in which they expressed their points of view.  I look forward to embarking on the campaign trail with other parties and I fervently hope that our combined efforts will result in the Irish people voting &ldquo;yes&rdquo; in the referendum on 24 November.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill has completed all Stages and we agree that it should be passed.  We have had a broad-ranging debate in which there has been wide participation.  I pay tribute to the Minister's officials who were helpful in providing information on this complex issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill gives the people an opportunity to vote on 24 November on whether we wish to remove the constitutional ban on divorce and allow a court, designated by law, to grant the dissolution of marriage under certain conditions.  We support the Bill for three reasons.  First, it provides the people with an opportunity to vote and to indicate their wishes on this important issue which, ultimately, is the most democratic approach to take. Second, the amendment makes provision for the important criteria set down by Fianna Fáil to prevent quickie divorces, provides an opportunity for reconciliation between the spouses whose marriages have broken down and <Col N="1721" /> protects the position of children, vulnerable spouses and other family members.</P>
    <P>Under the proposed amendment, a court may grant a dissolution of a marriage only where these criteria are met. That is what we asked the Government to include and that is what has been done.  Third, if the people vote &ldquo;yes&rdquo; in the referendum the amendment, including the safeguards, will become part of Article 41 of the Constitution which provides constitutional protection for the family.  That Article states that, &ldquo;The State recognises the Family as the natural primary and fundamental unit group of Society...&rdquo;.  Certain confusion has been created outside the House regarding the position of the family and for that reason I stressed the necessity to insert this amendment in Article 41. That Article also states that the State &ldquo;...guarantees to protect the Family in its Constitution and authority...&rdquo; and, furthermore, &ldquo;The State pledges itself to guard with special care the institution of Marriage, on which the Family is founded, and to protect it against attack&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It is in this strongly family oriented context, which places heavy obligations on the State, that the amendment which will pass today would be placed.  In the course of the debate we indicated, and our researches have shown, that there is a down side to marriage breakdown and divorce that cannot be ignored, especially if children are involved.  The Minister referred to this when he spoke about the material and the psychological difficulties that can arise in marriage breakdown, separation and divorce and stressed that, from the point of view of legislation, the necessary steps have been taken.</P>
    <P>While much has been done during the past nine years, through the introduction of necessary legislation and improvements in support services, to deal with the problems associated with marriage breakdown and separation, outstanding issues need to be tackled now in a positive and urgent way.  That is the reason my party proposed a five year <Col N="1722" /> strategic action plan.  Marriages and especially children must be protected and supported.  The Government must put this plan into effect now.</P>
    <P>Central elements of the plan include measures to enhance the status and perception of marriage and to support families under pressure; substantially increased counselling services and a provision which would place an obligation on spouses in cases involving divorce or separation to participate in the counselling process, particularly where children are affected.  Because I recognise that a good deal has been done in each of these areas already I say we should complete the work and devise a plan to cover the first five years to ensure that the best intentions of Members on all sides of the House are fully realised.</P>
    <P>In addition, there is a need to provide for better support services and &ldquo;time out&rdquo; for parents who care for children in the home.  There is also a need for a national network of skilled, professional mediation services to minimise the harmful emotional and psychological effects of separation and divorce on children and for a commissioner for children who would be responsible for highlighting to parents the needs of children in cases involving marriage breakdown or divorce and for pressing the needs of children in court, where necessary.</P>
    <P>It would also be helpful if parents were required to attend an information session on the short and long term effects of marriage breakdown and divorce on children and advise them on the legal implications of guardianship, custody and access for themselves and their children and the potential financial costs of separation and divorce.  There is a need for an immediate upgrading of family courts with the appointment of extra judges and the provision of suitable private consultation and waiting rooms.</P>
    <P>When replying to the debate on Second Stage the Minister said he accepted the need to make further provision in each of these areas, but felt it <Col N="1723" /> would be difficult to devise a five year plan prior to holding the referendum.  I call on the Government to give a firm commitment that it will introduce such a plan and to set out its proposals well in advance of the referendum.</P>
    <P>While I accept he will not be able to complete all the details the Minister should at least set out the parameters of such a plan, to which Members on all sides of the House would be committed, so that the people will know that while much has been done, that which remains to be done will be done urgently because of the changes that could take place during the first five years.</P>
    <P>Regardless of whether the referendum is passed most of these changes will occur in any event.  Consequently, my party hopes the Minister will proceed along these lines.</P>
    <P>This has been a good debate which has been handled by Members on all sides of the House in a sensitive and thoughtful way.  Deputies expressed support for the measure and, in some cases, their individual concerns.</P>
    <P>Deputy Keogh and her colleagues tabled their amendments in the sincere belief that it was the better way to proceed. My party could not agree because it strongly felt that it was important to have these safeguards included in the Constitution.  Deputy Keogh mentioned that our children have a fundamental right to be protected.  That is the reason my party made the argument strongly throughout the debate on this important Bill which could have long term effects on society, that this safeguard should be included in the Constitution.</P>
    <P>We support this Bill and wish the Minister well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>My party would like to see the State give people a second chance. Although I disagree with the tactical approach adopted by the Minister I wish him well and sincerely hope his tactic works.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is widespread support among Deputies on all sides of the House for <Col N="1724" /> the right to remarry, even among those whom I would regard as conservative in their views.  This is very heartening. Those who do not support the right to remarry are also sincere in their views, but the overwhelming reason many people support the proposal that the Constitution should be amended to permit the right to remarry is that they wish to show compassion for those who find themselves in the unfortunate position where they cannot have a second relationship or family, as they see it, regularised and where there is no legal redress.  We have to come to grips with this problem and legislate for these people.  They cannot be ignored.</P>
    <P>There are now 19 separate Acts on the Statute Book.  This should provide reassurance.  It behoves all of us to make people aware of the safeguards which exist.  It must also be acknowledged that there is a need to provide greater support for families and children in particular.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that financial support for counselling and mediation services has been increased, but there is a need to ensure that adequate resources are made available on an ongoing basis for the many voluntary organisations providing these services. In a sense, it is extraordinary that the organisations advocating a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote in the referendum include agencies dealing with the causes of marriage breakdown and providing refuges for battered wives and children.  That is indicative of the support the Minister and the Government will receive from those who know that we must deal with the reality of marriage breakdown and cannot ignore it.</P>
    <P>It is important that we do not see women as victims.  It is extraordinary that the &ldquo;no&rdquo; campaign seems to be expressing the same fears as it did in 1986 and portraying women as dependants and victims.  That is wrong when we consider that, in the main, women seek judicial separation and barring orders and will in future seek divorce.  Many women want to put the past behind them and rebuild their lives.  In many <Col N="1725" /> cases they want the right to remarry and enshrine their new families in a legal framework.  I hope that facility will be provided at long last.</P>
    <P>Deputy Woods referred to the family law courts.  Presumably, there will be a backlog of cases.  I ask the Minister for Justice to provide judges, ensure there is proper training for them and that a proper family court system is available to those who wish to deal with their difficulties in that way.</P>
    <P>Marital breakdown is a complex area. The simplistic views of many on the &ldquo;no&rdquo; side of the campaign are untenable. I do not propose to delay the House by dealing with the fears expressed at the outset of that campaign. I intend to campaign vigorously notwithstanding my disagreement with the tactical approach of the Minister.  I wish him well in his efforts and I hope that the right to remarry will be enshrined in our Constitution.  I thank him for his courtesy in listening to the many arguments put to him and also thank his officials for their courtesy and the work they have done.  I hope the Minister receives widespread support from all Members and that those who expressed support here will translate that into active campaigning for the right to remarry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>1.  In page 4, between lines 28 and 29, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2)  All land which, immediately before the commencement of this section, was vested in Forfás, and all rights, powers and privileges relating to or connected with such land shall, on such commencement, without any conveyance or assignment, stand vested in IDA for all the estate or interest for which it was vested in Forfás but subject to all trusts and equities affecting the land subsisting and capable of being performed.</P>
      <P>(3)  The powers and functions set out in section 16 of the Industrial Development Act, 1986, may be exercised by IDA notwithstanding anything to the contrary in subsection (1) of section 9 of the Act of 1993.</P>
      <P>(4)  Forfás and each Agency may sell, lease or otherwise dispose of land otherwise than in accordance with subsection (1) of section 16 of the Industrial Development Act, 1986, with the express consent of the Minister.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to provide detail of the way in which the land and building currently in the ownership of Forfás will be handled in future.  When the Industrial Development Bill, 1993 was passed the management and ownership of the land was left in the hands of Forfás.  It was not intended that Forfás would be an operational agency but a policy orientated and co-ordinating body and it was not intended that it would have the mainstream handling of a property portfolio. However, both agencies needed time to <Col N="1729" /> identify the best way to handle the estate.  An evaluation carried out by the evaluation committee set up under the industrial operation programme and an independent consultancy recommended the approach being taken, namely, that for the future the IDA would manage the industrial lands and buildings.  The reason is there would be enormous procedural difficulty in trying to split estates and allocate them to different agencies but, more importantly, the IDA is the mainline user of sites and advance factories.  The State has been traditionally involved in the provision of land and buildings in relation to incoming investment.  Forfás was consulted about the proposed transfer and is happy about it.</P>
    <P>I am determined that there will be proper guidelines for this operation and meetings were convened to ensure there will not be any practical difficulties.</P>
    <P>The second major element of the amendment is in subsection (4) where we are providing that the agencies may sell, lease or dispose of land otherwise than in accordance with section 16 (1) of the Industrial Development Act, 1986, provided that they deal in land, sites or buildings solely for industrial use. Occasionally land was acquired that is no longer suitable to be maintained in the industrial land bank for various reasons.  It is desirable and was recommended in the evaluations that a commercial and pragmatic approach should be taken to the management of land banks and other property.  It will be open to the authority to dispose of land for non-industrial use should it be in accord with sensible commercial management and with its mandate.</P>
    <P>There is a requirement that they do so with the express consent of the Minister. This is not included because the Minister will supervise every decision the IDA might undertake on a day to day basis, to ensure in legislation that the IDA does not have the mandate of a commercial property development company.  Its activities in this regard would be commercial in approach but <Col N="1730" /> within the mandate of an industrial development agency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with many of the Minister's comments regarding the amendments to section 4.  I am glad there is not more bureaucracy with various areas split between Forfás and Forbairt with regard to leasing, mapping, delays in new conglomeration staff and arguments within the company.  The Minister recognises that the IDA is, in a way, the parent organisation of the other two.  I realise the work which would be necessary and the arguments which would follow if there were changes in many industrial estates and areas in the country and if Forfás owned plants, machinery, buildings and land. On that basis the amendment is welcome.</P>
      <P>The issue of land banks must be addressed.  Land was disposed of over the last few years on the instruction of Government at times of difficulty in the economy.  However, there is now a shortage of land in many areas for industrial development.  Much of the disposal of land was not in the best interest of industrial development or job creation.  The Minister should have greater power when sites are being disposed of.  I am aware of areas where land was required but not available. Land was then purchased which did not have commercial value and was not suitable for industrial development.  I am not completely happy with the disposal of land without some recognition of its importance or research on its future potential if it was retained by the IDA.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is why it needs to be recommitted.  As far as I can see, it is wrong.  The subsections that section 3 with the proposed amendment are purporting to insert are subparagraphs of the First Schedule of the 1993 Act. However, there cannot be two subsection (2)s.  They must be numbered differently and in any event, subsection (2) does not appear to stand with the proposed subsection (4).</P>

Subject to my contribution later, it should read that what is now in section 3 should be called subsection (2) and what is contained in the amendment should be called subsections (3), (4) and (5).</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>This problem is typical of the difficulties we seem to have encountered from 1993 onwards with regard to these matters.  One of the main reasons for the Bill is that the 1993 Act is a mess.  It has not been possible to operate it and it has added to the confusion and tension which exists between all the newly created and proliferate agencies.  The introduction of this Bill was necessary for them to operate and to try to rectify some of the errors made in 1993.</P>
      <P>The 1993 Act was introduced just before the summer recess.  It was included in a long list of legislation which, the House was told, needed to be passed in a number of days.  It was not properly examined and I warned about this aspect at the time.  My warning has been borne out since all these amendments are necessary.  The Bill was improved somewhat on Committee Stage in the Select Committee. However, we are in an awful mess now in terms of this amendment.</P>
      <P>I am also disappointed that this is the only amendment in the Minister's name. From what he said in the Select Committee, I hoped he would deal with cartain other matters also.  He accepted a number of my amendments on Committee Stage but other points, of which this is only one, have not been addressed. This is disappointing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If this is enacted in a proper form, one of the effects of the amendment will be to turn the 1993 Act of its head.  From <Col N="1733" /> reading the 1993 Act, it is clear the central holding agency or company was to be Forfás.  Under the terms of this amendment, it appears Forfás will not hold anything.  This is the direct opposite of what was enacted only two years ago.  That seems to be very sloppy indeed.  If it was right two years ago, why is it wrong now?  Furthermore, if it is thought appropriate to take all property out of the ownership and control of Forfás, why does all property go to the ownership and control of the IDA?  In the long term, the more important of the two line agencies from this country's point of view is Forbairt.  It has the more difficult task and if it does not succeed, then the industrial development of this country does not succeed.</P>
    <P>It is somewhat arbitrary that all the property vested since 1993 in Forfás is now to be vested in the IDA.  If there is a difficulty between the two agencies it would be better to allow the land to continue to be vested in Forfás.  If the Minister reads the speeches made by his predecessor in 1993 on the Bill, he will find that the idea was that there should be a holding company and that neither of the line agencies should be involved in the holding, ownership or management of property.  Their job was to promote, not to be concerned with buying, selling, holding and managing property. That made sense if one was prepared to accept the overall logic of the argument, but that has now been turned on its head.</P>
    <P>If in the future Forbairt, as the indigenous agency, wants to make land available to an Irish enterprise, it cannot do it itself nor can it go to its parent company, Forfás, to do it.  It has to go to the other line agency, which in a limited sense is its rival, and ask it to provide land for an enterprise that it wishes to establish.  There is a conflict of interest, as the Minister must appreciate, because while the system may work most of the time, it may well be that an indigenous company, which Forbairt is promoting, and an overseas company, which the IDA is promoting, both want the same piece of land.  The IDA will be the <Col N="1734" /> owner of it and the IDA's instinct, a natural one, would be to transfer that land to the company it is promoting.</P>
    <P>How is that conflict to be resolved? We have had some examples of it already.  We have seen one example in Shannon this summer which causes me a great deal of concern.  The IDA against the wishes of Forbairt and SFADCo promoted an overseas company that will have a very serious effect in a very limited market on an entirely Irish owned company which has become a successful world company.  This problem will be more frequent when it comes to buying and selling land.</P>
    <P>I do not know how section 3 (2) can stand with the other subsections.  There is a general power in section 3 (2) to acquire, hold and dispose of land and other property or any interest therein, and then in the proposed section 3 (4), which at the very least, should be section 3 (5), it states that</P>
    <P>Forfás and each Agency may sell, lease or otherwise dispose of land otherwise than in accordance with subsection (1) of section 16 of the Industrial Development Act, 1986, with the express consent of the Minister.</P>
    <P>The Minister, explaining that, said cases had arisen where the IDA or Forfás should not be confined to selling land for industrial purposes.  I agree.  There are instances where pieces of the rather large amount of land they hold would from time to time have to be sold for non-industrial purposes.  That would be perfectly valid, but if this power has to be put in here now, it implies that the IDA or Forfás did not have that power to sell for non-industrial purposes, although it has sold land for non-industrial purposes in the past.</P>
    <P>The Minister may recall that in 1988 there was a big effort to get the IDA, then the sole agency, to dispose of land. It was under a great deal of pressure to do it.  I remember at the time being opposed to selling land at Ballylongford, County Kerry, which I regarded as perhaps the most valuable potential <Col N="1735" /> industrial development land in Europe. It is flat land right beside 80 feet of water at low tide.  I objected vociferously to the IDA selling that.  It was to be sold in part to people who wanted to build a hotel there and in part to local farmers for agricultural purposes.  My objections since prevailed and it was not sold in the end, but it sold other property at that time, some of it at quite a low price.  If this amendment is necessary, that means the IDA had no power to sell that land.  I question that because I believe it had power, but the latter part of this amendment implies it did not.</P>
    <P>Section 3 (3) and section 3 (4) will make the conveying of State held property very difficult in future.  All that is required is a simple straightforward statement, as there is in 3 (2), that</P>
    <P>Forfás and each Agency shall have the power to acquire, hold and dispose of land and other property or any interest therein</P>
    <P>without all these limitations in the other sections.  If the Government is to overrule the other sections in the 1986 and 1993 Acts, the clear implication is that the IDA did not have power to sell in the past except for the purposes specified in the sections, and that is a very serious matter.</P>
    <P>The Minister has not given any explanation of why it is proposed to transfer all the land from Forfás to the IDA two years after it had been transferred to it. He just says that Forbairt agrees with it. The Minister said the IDA is the main body involved in disposing of land or selling it to incoming companies, but Forbairt should be to the forefront of our thoughts and concerns in this House, because the future of Irish industrial development is bound up with whether it succeeds.  I do not see why it should be put in a statutory position of playing second fiddle and allowing the IDA to decide everything.  Forbairt can only have access to land or development sites if the IDA does not want them for <Col N="1736" /> overseas company purposes.  That is wrong.</P>
    <P>As regards the other amendments, the Minister, and his Department, were good enough to write to me recently on the question of vesting securities in trusts and making investments in trusts. That deals with one of the points I raised and an amendment I tabled on Committee Stage.  I was given the name of a specific body, which I cannot recall, that was interested in this and wanted power to take these investments, which I accept.  The Minister will recall that there were a number of other such amendments which have not reappeared. I had hoped they would, but I did not table the amendments again.  I suppose I will have to have them tabled in the Seanad.  It is a pity they were not dealt with.</P>
    <P>As far as this is concerned, it is only adding to the confusion.  I suggest to the Minister that subsection (3) (2) is enough and that he is only confusing the issue by bringing in these other points because they will raise considerable difficulties when it comes to the technicalities of conveyancing.  Not only do they raise difficulties for the future but, by implication, they raise difficulties for the past.  If it is thought necessary to include these provisions now, particularly those in subsections (3) and (4), a conveyancer would have to conclude that because the Oireachtas thought it necessary to include them, there was a problem before their inclusion.  It is assumed the Oireachtas would not include something which is not necessary.</P>
    <P>There have been many sales of land acquired for industrial purposes for non-industrial purposes.  I could name such places &mdash; for example, Shannon Development sold land in the mid-west region.  I recall instances of this coming before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on State-sponsored Bodies where land was sold off for housing in County Wicklow, County Wexford and other counties.  It would be better if these three proposed subsections were not proceeded with because they will only cause enormous confusion.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1737" /> If we must have three agencies, it is better that the holding company as envisaged in 1993 should continue to be that and it should not be done through one agency to the detriment of another. I am long enough dealing with such bodies to know that the worst thing we could have is to have two of these agencies at each other's throats.  It is not fair to those involved in them that they will be forced into this situation.  The Minister can give assurances in good faith, but he does not know as much about this as I do and the way some of these agencies react and interact with one another.  If the IDA owns a choice piece of land, a Forbairt customer, no matter how worthy, will never see it.  That is wrong and it should not happen.  For that reason, I ask the Minister to withdraw these proposed subsections because they confuse the issue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to clarify the pagination issue.  If these amendments are accepted, section 3 will become section 3 (1) and the others will be subsections (2), (3) and (4) and (1) will become the First Schedule and so on.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Keeffe said the Minister should have greater powers to police decisions in relation to land being disposed. I suggest there should be broad agreement as to how the IDA would manage its property portfolio.  I do not believe it would be appropriate or that the Minister would be qualified to get involved in every decision.  Clearly, in instances where there is disagreement, it would be appropriate for the Minister to be involved if there was an issue to be overcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason for vesting the property portfolio in the IDA is that it would be extraordinarily cumbersome to pursue the alternative route suggested by Deputy O'Malley of leaving all the agencies with powers in relation to property and then proceeding to conveyance from Forfás on an individual case by case basis every item of land to each of the agencies.  That would be a cumbersome approach to adopt. <Col N="1738" /> Instead, the approach being adopted is that we are proceeding by way of legislation to vest the property portfolio in the agency which has the prime interest and measure of industrial support to manage land and industrial estates.</P>
    <P>We provide that the IDA can conveyance appropriately parts of that property back to the other agencies, but that would be a very small proportion of its overall portfolio compared to what is now being vested in the IDA.  The reason the consultants and the evaluation unit in the Department identified this as the best approach is that the management of land banks and industrial property has not been in the mainstream a vehicle of support used by Forbairt. We have not taken the approach to indigenous industry that the type of support we would offer to it would be primarily by way of providing land or buildings.  That approach has been essentially one for the IDA which is competing with other industrial agencies which often offer such provisions.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy knows, there has been a correct tendency in recent years to downgrade the extent to which, even at IDA level, we get involved in managing land banks and providing advance factories as a means of industrial support. It continues to be an important vehicle for the IDA.  That is the rationale behind this approach.  The overall portfolio would be vested in the agency for whom it has the most value.</P>
    <P>Forbairt is happy with this approach because it does not see this as imposing any limitations on its freedom of manoeuvre in respect of its portfolio of indigenous companies.  The approach to the development of indigenous companies has, of course, been primarily on building the capabilities of Irish industry. That has focused not on land and building support but on capability within those companies.  It will not be extremely cumbersome for the IDA to conveyance.  One of the reasons for putting in subsection (3) of this amendment is to remove any ambiguity that either Forfás or ministerial consent might in some way be necessary before the IDA <Col N="1739" /> could proceed to deal or sell part of its portfolio.  We have taken this opportunity to remove any such ambiguity that might make the opportunity for IDA to sell commercially excessively cumbersome or subject to some doubt.</P>
    <P>The Deputy correctly indicated there have been occasions in the past when land has been sold for non-industrial purposes.  There was an implicit power that the IDA, as it was then, could do that.  However, because of the more active approach that will be taken in the future on foot of recommendations about the management of the industrial portfolio, there will be more selling of property where it is of less strategic value.  It is important that the existence of this power is made explicit in the Act, that section 16 of the 1986 Act permits the IDA or the agencies to buy or sell land and build buildings, but only if it is for the promotion of industry.  It is conditional that those activities are in the context of industrial promotion.  At one reading, one could say that disposing of the land commercially was sensible and in the interests of industrial promotion. However, someone interpreting that law could say that it was a restriction and that it would not technically be in compliance with the Act if it was disposing of land for a non-industrial purpose.  We have decided to insert subsection (4) to remove any ambiguity that might be there.  I also assure the Deputy that each agency will not be in any way constrained in the handling of land vested in it.  Equally, if land is conveyanced by the IDA to Forbairt, it will be in no way constrained in the selling of that land.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>All I have learned from the Minister is that he apparently intends paragraphs (2), (3) and (4) in this amendment to be new subsections rather than paragraphs.  Any Member reading this amendment could not but conclude that what was proposed were three new subparagraphs in paragraph (1) of the First Schedule to the 1993 Act.  If the Minister wanted these to appear as new and separate subsections, <Col N="1740" /> he should have said &ldquo;In page 4, between lines 28 and 29, to insert the following subsections&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>We were advised that the correct procedure was the one we followed.  I agree with the Deputy that it would have been much easier to understand if this had been clarified. When the drafting took place, we were informed that it was more correct technically to do it in the way it was devised. However, I accept the point that the way it was drafted was confusing.  It was not the way we approached it in our briefing, but that is the way it came out on the Order Paper.  I accept what the Deputy said.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Minister for that but it has caused unnecessary confusion and anxiety.  This may get over some of the technicalities but not the principle.  If the Minister looks back at the amendments put down on Committee Stage of this Bill, he will find that when it was proposed to add a subsection, it said &ldquo;to insert the following subsection&rdquo;.  Committee Stage took place in 17 July.  The practices should not have changed that dramatically between then and October.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>When handling Bills previously, I have seen that when a section had no suggestions, it said &ldquo;after this paragraph, to insert (2), (3) and (4)&rdquo;.  It was implicit there that if they were accepted by the House, they would become &ldquo;(2), (3) and (4)&rdquo;.  There was not the explicit amendment saying that &ldquo;(1)&rdquo; would go in before &ldquo;the&rdquo;.  I have seen examples of this practice before in this House.  Most Members would have also dealt with it in that fashion.  The practice is not as uniform as the Deputy would like to think.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The instance in which the Minister speaks is, of course, when the amendment is being made to a normal subsection.  However, this is not the case here.  First, it is not numbered as a subsection, but more importantly, it <Col N="1741" /> inserts a subparagraph rather than subsection. If something is described as following immediately afterwards, it is not unreasonable to assume that what follows afterwards are further subparagraphs. However, we have discovered that they are not subparagraphs intended to be inserted in the First Schedule but are separate subsections to stand on their own in section 3 of the Bill.</P>
      <P>The difficulty I have with their substance has not been allayed by what the Minister has said.  He said that &mdash; I may not be quoting his words precisely but I am correct about the sense behind them &mdash; this amendment was being put in to avoid any doubt so that land can be sold for non-industrial purposes.  I accept that this is the motivation, but that immediately implies that there was, and is, doubt over sales that took place which were not in accordance with section 16 of the 1986 Act or section 9 or the First Schedule to the 1993 Act. This is a serious matter, not a minor point.  We are discussing this Bill because mistakes were made in 1993. My concern is that they may be repeated and there may have to be a 1996 or 1997 Bill to rectify what happened here.</P>
      <P>A straightforward right to convey in all circumstances would have been adequate.  The Minister is only creating doubt by putting in subsections (3) and (4).  If they are necessary now, something must have been wrong before.  If this is the case, much of the conveyancing that took place must have been wrong as well.</P>
      <P>I do not follow the Minister's reasoning in regard to subsection (2).  The reason everything should become vested in the IDA is not clear to me. Forbairt has at least equal claim.  There will be conflicts of interest between the two agencies.  They arose this summer and Deputy Harney and I wrote to the Minister about a clear case.</P>

      <P>I am aware of that but there is a clear conflict of interest between the two agencies in terms of the promotion of a particular proposal. However, that will arise also in respect of land.</P>
      <P>Forfás, pending the passing of the Bill, has thousands of acres of land across the country.  Much of it is of marginal value or attractivness while some parts are valuable and attractive.  People do not want the marginal, unattractive sites.  They tend to concentrate on well located sites that are well serviced and so forth and into which they move immediately.  If there are two conflicting applications for the same site, one from overseas and one that is indigenous, there will be a regrettable conflict.  In passing subsection (2) this House is resolving that conflict of interest in favour of the overseas promoter every time.  The land belongs to the IDA and the IDA can do with it as it wishes, as the Minister said.  It does not have to transfer it to Forbairt or to Forbairt's customer or client; it can vest it in its own client.</P>
      <P>It is wrong to have two agencies potentially in conflict.  It is wrong that the House should resolve that dispute in advance in favour of the overseas promoter against the Irish promoter each time.  Industrial development promotion within Ireland in the indigenous sector is fragile.  It has not taken off in the way one would have wished or hoped.  This will not be a great help to it.  Great confusion will be caused by the two subsections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subsections (3) and (4) were only published last night.  It is probable that nobody outside this House has seen them.  I would like to show them to some firms of solicitors which carry out such conveyancing for these companies because they would be concerned about them.  Usually, if there has been doubt and it must be resolved by legislation a preliminary phrase &mdash; for example, &ldquo;For the avoidance of doubt&rdquo;&mdash; is used and the provision is made retrospective.  This is not made retrospective and will come into effect when the Bill is passed.  It <Col N="1743" /> does not affect anything that happened post 1986 or post 1993.  It means that what happens after October or November this year is correct but if it happened before then it is not.  That is wrong.</P>
    <P>The use of the phrases &ldquo;with the express consent of the Minister&rdquo; and &ldquo;notwithstanding anything to the contrary in subsection (1) of section 9&rdquo; and subsequently permitting the IDA to carry out these functions is somewhat reminiscent of what we heard about Horgan's Quay yesterday.  Deals that can be done privately with the consent of the Minister are not advisable.  If a public body here has the right to sell land, it can only have such right if it is given it by this House.  If it is given that right it should be on specific terms.  It should not be a case of: &ldquo;you can sell it provided you comply with these conditions but if you do not comply with the conditions you can still sell it provided the Minister gives his consent&rdquo;. That principle is wrong.</P>
    <P>We heard about the Horgan's Quay case yesterday and we should avoid the possibility of such cases arising again. These are the subsections that give rise to cases such as Horgan's Quay.  If this House gives a body the right to sell land, it should set out that right in legislation; it should not be done in private, behind-the-scenes deals with Ministers giving their consent to something that would otherwise be illegal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not here today because mistakes were made.  Contrary to what the Deputy said, it was always the intention that the property and security would be transferred from Forfás to the agencies.  It was never the intention that Forfás would become the manager of large portfolios of securities, land or buildings.  The Deputy is incorrect in suggesting that such was the approach or intention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Clearly, time was required to assess how future management of the property portfolio would best be organised.  That period has elapsed and careful study has <Col N="1744" /> been given to the intended approach. We have been assured by the best advice that this is the correct approach. It has been recommended by outside consultants and has been examined by legal personnel in the IDA and Forbairt who are satisfied that it is legally adequate to meet their requirements.  It has gone to the board of Forbairt which is satisfied that its needs in relation to indigenous industry are catered for correctly. In the event of a conflict such as the Deputy envisages arising, we would, through the normal procedures of regular meetings between the chief executives of the two agencies and our liaison with them, ensure that there is no diminution of the efforts of Forbairt in this area.</P>
    <P>The Government approach does not see the development of land banks or advance factory buildings as the main vehicle for support of indigenous industry. I doubt that it was the approach when the Deputy was a Minister. Indeed, the Deputy was keen that land banks should not be excessive to needs, that we should move to a point where land banks were the minimum required to support industrial development and that we concentrate instead on the capabilities of our industries.  Our approach is entirely consistent with that.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also raised the issue of uncertainty in the past as to the implications of section 16 which provides that for the purpose of providing or facilitating the provision of sites or premises for the establishment, development or maintenance of an industrial undertaking the authority may, among other things, acquire land, construct, adapt or maintain buildings, provide services and so forth if the authority considers that industrial development will or is likely to occur as a result.  In the past, the Industrial Development Authority interpreted that section to mean that it could sell land for non-industrial uses where it was appropriate to the commercial management of its portfolio, even though the Act requires it to do these things only if it considers that <Col N="1745" /> industrial development will or is likely to occur as a result.</P>
    <P>That was a legitimate interpretation of the section.  The authority could say that it was managing a portfolio effectively and commercially to ensure that it had adequate resources for industrial development and if it had land that was not germane to that task it could rightly dispose of it.  The authority was correct in that interpretation and we have taken the opportunity to provide a clarification in subsection (4) of this Bill to make it explicit that it has that right.</P>
    <P>However, I have reserved the consent of the Minister.  That is not to suggest, as the Deputy has, that there might be an effort to sell below cost.  There is no such intention and if I engaged in any such activity I would be answerable to the Dáil and Deputies would be entirely correct to ask questions about how I exercise my right of consent.  The purpose of providing for ministerial consent is simply to ensure that we do not go to the other extreme in relation to section 16 and find that we have an industrial agency in the commercial property market, so to speak, with a portfolio of property which does not have a bearing on its clear mandate of industrial development.  The sole purpose of providing for ministerial consent is to ensure that the agency keeps its eye on its primary mandate as outlined in section 16, that is, industrial development.</P>
    <P>The Deputy referred to conflicts of interest which can occur between the IDA and Forbairt in regard to specific properties.  Yesterday the Deputy's party leader raised questions on this issue in the Dáil and we had a very worthwhile discussion on it.  I outlined to the Deputy's colleague that the IDA and the other agencies operate under clear negotiating guidelines under which they must take into account the potential effect of a proposal on another industry.  They must look at the overall markets in which the companies will play, they must satisfy themselves that there is scope for the two companies to satisfactorily develop in the market and <Col N="1746" /> look at other issues such as import substitution of the incoming company and whether it is likely to establish itself in another country, such as Northern Ireland, Wales or Scotland and compete directly with the other company.  When drawing up grant approvals they must look at those issues and, if necessary, as happened in the case to which the Deputy referred, impose conditions to prevent damage to the established Irish company.</P>
    <P>That is the procedure in place and in order to prevent any ambiguity I will communicate with the agencies to ensure there is proper consultation between them in the event of any such conflicts.  There has been consultation between them to date.  There was consultation in the case to which the Deputy referred and the final decision was arrived at following that consultation. The system in place is working well.  I accept that the split between the agencies will give rise to a need for tighter procedures, which I am putting in place.</P>
    <P>On the question of dealing in land, the conflicts to which the Deputy referred will not arise in practice.  We have carefully gone through the legal and policy issues with the two agencies which are happy, as are those employed by Forfás, to assess the best way to manage a portfolio.</P>
    <P>At the end of the day an industrial estate is a unit and it has to be managed as such.  It cannot be managed by making three-quarters of it the responsibility of the IDA and the other quarter the responsibility of Forbairt or whatever other mix might emerge.  There has to be coherent management of the estate but at the same time one has to ensure that the needs of Forbairt will be catered for if and when they arise.  I am satisfied that Forbairt's needs will be catered for and it is happy with the procedures which have been put in place.</P>
    <P>I think I can put to rest the Deputy's fears that we are creating a legal mine-field or that there will be difficulties in conveyancing.  We have availed of the opportunity to remove any doubts <Col N="1747" /> which might arise about the speedy conveyancing of properties.  We have also removed any doubt that the authorities might have been under some restriction in selling land for non-industrial purposes or that they might have to go back to Forfás or the Minister in regard to specific handling under subsection (3) of the original section 9 which may have given rise to possible confusion.  In future land banks and the industrial portfolio will be managed much more commercially than they have been in the past and the main emphasis will be on the incoming investment.  We do not regard the provision of land and buildings as a major vehicle for Forbairt but we envisage that this may occur and provision has been made to accommodate these needs when they arise.  Forbairt is satisfied that the procedures are adequate to protect it.</P>

      <P>Having listened attentively to the points made by speakers on both sides of the House, it is obvious that our industrial development is nearing a crisis.  The Culliton group was originally set up to bring about changes in the IDA.  I agree that if the Minister breaks up the company it will lead to more confusion and argument. If Forfás wants to use an IDA site for a new development in future, will the site become the property of Forfás?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have listened attentively to the reports of the conflict which has arisen between a town in my county and the western part of the country.  I do not want to mention names but an objection was lodged by a firm against a development by a company from the North Atlantic area almost on the eve it <Col N="1748" /> announced its decision.  The international firm has incurred major expenditure and its management has been investigated as a result of the objections raised by that firm.  It is grossly unfair that this should have been allowed to drag on for so long.  I do not want to interfere with the confidentiality aspect by mentioning names&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Minister referred to this in the context of a priority question yesterday.  Our job creating agencies are not doing very well abroad and this case will merely create further confusion and will not do anything to improve the image of the country.  The people in that company have complained to me about what has gone on and I am very annoyed about what has happened.  I do not want to sound parochial as a town in my constituency would have been the beneficiary of this development but my information from the parent company in the North Atlantic area is that a small minded firm in this country raised the objection.  It will be unfortunate if the company decides to locate this development in Scotland or Wales which are very near to us, as can be seen from the fact that it is cheaper to fly from Manchester to Dublin than to fly from Cork to Dublin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to prolong the debate but the Minister does not seem to fully appreciate the significance of what he is doing in sections 3 and 4 from a purely conveyancing point of view.  If he says there was some uncertainty in that regard and that we must rectify it, that uncertainty has not been rectified retrospectively.  A great deal of land has been sold since 1986 with which I agree.  I wish it could have sold more, particularly land that is useless. It does not appear to have had the power to sell it because, according to the amendment, it was relying on section <Col N="1749" /> 16 (1) of the 1986 Act.  Subsection (1) sets out the circumstances in paragraphs (a) to (h) in which it can acquire and sell land but all those instances are governed by the words that it can do all those things if the authority (1) considers that industrial development will or is likely to occur as a result and (2) is satisfied that the undertaking conforms or will conform to the criteria set out in subsections (3) and (4) of section 21 or section 25 (2).  That power could only have been exercised under the 1986 Act if the IDA, then called the Authority, considered that industrial development will or is likely to occur as a result of the sale of the land.  If it were selling it for the purposes of building a hotel, farming or housing, three main purposes among others for which it did sell land, it could not be satisfied that industrial development will or is likely to occur as a result.  In that sense it is right to rectify it but it highlights that a mistake was made.  It must be rectified because in the past there was not just a doubt in that regard but a lack of power.</P>
      <P>Section 9 (1) and (2) of the 1993 Act does not seem to change the fundamental position as set out in section 16 of the 1986 Act.  I cannot put the case any stronger than that.  I am concerned about the matter but we can only wait and see what will happen.  I believe this issue will be raised at a later stage and will prove very expensive for somebody who will fight a case in court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding the issue raised by Deputy O'Keeffe concerning the taking of space by a Forbairt company, if it were renting, it would be renting from the landlord which would be the IDA.  If it decided to purchase, which would often be the case, it would purchase outright but the management of the estate would remain with the IDA.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I note the point Deputy O'Malley raised.  He said that before my time as Minister and during his time as Minister property was disposed of.  Section 16 could be interpreted incorrectly.  On <Col N="1750" /> balance a reasonable view would be that the activity of selling land no longer worthwhile for industrial uses, where the agency decided that it would sell supernumerary land which did not fit into its plans in the interests of its overall mandate to promote industry, would comply with its general mandate of considering that industrial development will or is likely to occur as a result.  It would be husbanding its resources wisely so that the money, the land bank, available to it would be accessible to support industrial development.  It would be reasonable to argue that its selling of land that was redundant for industrial purposes and using the proceeds to acquire more suitable land or whatever would be viewed as the pursuit of its overall mandate.</P>
    <P>I am not keen to do what the Deputy might suggest would be a solution &mdash; to delete the requirement that industrial development will or is likely to occur as a result.  It would not be satisfactory if we deleted that requirement and the company were merely a commercial property management company.  I have chosen to maintain a ministerial interest in this area to ensure that it continues to comply with its overall mandate of industrial development.  It is appropriate that we would remove any doubt.  In future agencies will be required to manage their portfolios more commercially than they have in the past.  That has been the thrust of recommendations put forward.  We are ensuring that they will be managed commercially and that there will not be an impediment to their commercial management.  The legal advisers of the Department and agencies considered this, are pleased with our approach and it is on that basis I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>This is another Bill in the long saga of industrial development legislation.  The proper context in which to look at it is that of the 1991 Culliton report, the principal attempt made in the State to get our industrial development activity on the right lines having accepted that it was not working as well as we would have wished up until then. It is regrettable that this legislation and the 1993 Act does not follow what Culliton recommended.  It follows it in parts superficially but the whole thrust underlining the Culliton report is ignored and we are in an unhappy position at present.  What was attempted in 1993 has not worked and instead of the central point of Culliton, that we should try to rationalise and get rid of the several agencies we then had, we have gone to the opposite extreme.</P>
      <P>In the Schedule to this Bill, 37 quangos, in addition to the existing ones, have been given statutory authority. I gave an account of them on Second Stage in July and the figure was approaching 100, and I believe I said then that I was still counting.  The numbers have not declined since.  If the establishment of quangos solved our problem, we would not have 280,000 unemployed.  We have more quangos for that purpose than any other country and recent unemployment figures do not give any indication that the problem is being solved.</P>

This proposal, however, falls within the remit of the Constitution Review Group and I assume it will consider it.  Having regard to the Law Reform Commission's work programme it is more appropriate that the Constitution Review Group, which has a specific time limit to report, should examine the matter.  This matter is one that can also be examined by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Family and the proposed official commission on the family.

I will not go over the debate we have had on the divorce referendum because this would not be helpful.  Does the Taoiseach agree that the definition of the family in the Constitution does not reflect the family circumstances of at least 20 per cent of families in this jurisdiction and that it is unsatisfactory that the Constitution does not recognise families other than those based on marriage?</P>

      <P>I am disappointed with the Taoiseach's response given that we have had a great deal of discussion over the last day or so on the expenses of other people.  It appears that a great deal of trawling in that respect was done but the Taoiseach could not get someone in his Department to trawl for the expenses of Government press secretaries. Does the Taoiseach accept that amounts involved in salaries and other payments is way in excess of what it was last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Deputy want me to give details of the expenses of former Government press secretaries? All Government press secretaries have done their job well.  This has involved all of them in hospitality and other expenses which go with the job.  I do not propose, unless I am pressed by the Deputy, to engage in a detailed trawling exercise in regard to the expenses of previous Government press secretaries.  I can assure the House that the present arrangements are ones where any expenses undertaken are very necessary and reasonable but I do not propose to go back on the work of previous press secretaries at this juncture, unless the Deputy insists and I would hope he would not.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>It almost seems like a threat when the Taoiseach says he would refer to previous press secretaries. Perhaps the Taoiseach would reflect on his statement.  I am sure he could refer to the time when there was only one Government press secretary but now every Minister has a group of <Col N="1758" /> handlers both inside and outside such as press secretaries, press companies and PR companies.  If the Taoiseach wishes to dwell on that we could add up the figures.  Does the Taoiseach believe that the individuals employed &mdash; not so much those in the Taoiseach's Department because that is a small part of the cost &mdash; by other Departments should be subject, as they used to be, to Department of Finance criteria?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that a number of Ministers in the present and previous Administration have had communications consultants working for them over and above the normal press secretary arrangements.  I do not have any communications consultants working on my behalf, despite advice from Deputy O'Rourke on one occasion that I should have and that I needed one.</P>

      <P>Certainly, I was amused by it.  To answer the point made, it would be more appropriate, if the Deputy wants to ask questions about public relations consultancies, that he address them to the relevant Ministers.  I do not have any public relations consultancy operating on my behalf.  So far as the press secretaries are concerned, I am giving four pages of figures which, I have no doubt, will be interesting and informative for the Deputies in terms of the comparative costs of press operations in different Departments in different eras of public administration.  I would point out that in real terms, this expenditure peaked in 1992.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure how many people were covered in 1992. There were Department of Finance guidelines on the contract that would be allowed to an individual Minister or <Col N="1759" /> Minister of State and is the Taoiseach standing by those old guidelines if they still exist?  What exceptions does he allow to go outside those guidelines, as one contract does?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not in a position to answer questions about any individual case.  The Deputy is straying outside the question.  I have not been asked about Department of Finance guidelines or consultancies in other Departments, I have simply been asked about press secretaries and assistant press secretaries in my Department and that is all I am briefed to answer today.  In general terms, and without reference to individual cases, of course, I would encourage and would be very anxious that Department of Finance guidelines would be respected in all cases.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>In the negotiations to form his Government was it part of the deal that there would be three Government press secretaries, one for each party?  Will the Taoiseach accept that the cost of employing a Government press secretary would be much less if we had one party in Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not so sure.  It is quite some time since there was a one-party Government.  The figures for total costs are as follows: 1990, £107,000; 1991, £123,000; 1992, £129,000; 1993, £108,000; 1994, £89,000 and 1995, £128,000.  The highest figure was in 1992.  The Deputy will be able to pose his own questions, perhaps to himself, about why that should be the case.  I was not involved in any negotiation of the matter that required agreement on a press secretary representing each of the three parties in the Government.  Where there have been two parties in Government, it has been standard practice over many years &mdash; indeed, as far back as I can remember &mdash; that there would be representation from all of the parties in the Government press secretariat in the Taoiseach's Department.  In my experience in this Government it has worked exceptionally well as an arrangement.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 to 8, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>My discussions on 2 October with a UUP delegation, led by the party leader, Mr. David Trimble, MP, were very positive and constructive.  We explored some of the key issues to be addressed in the context of all-inclusive talks leading to a negotiated settlement. The delegation stated the Ulster Unionist Party position with regard to the commencement of such talks and, in particular, that the issue of illegally held arms on all sides would first need to be satisfactorily resolved.  For my part, I outlined recent efforts to secure progress on this issue within the context of movement towards all-party talks in roundtable format.</P>
      <P>My meeting with the UUP was on an open agenda basis and the party's recently announced assembly proposal was not raised by the delegation.  At the same time, however, we remain open to the ideas of everyone on the best way forward in meeting our objective of comprehensive all-party negotiations covering the three core relationships within and between these islands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The meeting with the UUP holds much more than mere symbolic significance. First, it indicated a readiness by that party to play their part along with everyone else in improving the climate for all-party talks.  Second, exchanges of <Col N="1762" /> this kind not only facilitate greater mutual understanding but also help to ensure that full account is taken of Unionist views in policy formulation along, of course, with those of Nationalists.</P>
    <P>Regarding my meeting with the Sinn Féin leader, Mr. Gerry Adams, on 29 September, we had a lengthy and detailed exchange of views on how best to achieve the necessary progress on the decommissioning issue, so that all parties will feel sufficiently secure to engage in roundtable all-party talks on a settlement.  Having regard to the ongoing efforts to resolve the problem, it would be inappropriate to elaborate further.  I can however say that the discussions were useful.</P>
    <P>With regard to the suggestion which I recently made in this House that Sinn Féin, the UDP and the PUP should perhaps devise their own proposals on the decommissioning issue, I did not expect that those parties would necessarily respond to me or to other members of the Government.  While I have not received any formal responses, I nevertheless believe that the parties concerned are committed to satisfactorily resolving this matter so as to pave the way to all-inclusive talks.  This obstacle, I am convinced, will be overcome.</P>
    <P>In recent weeks, there has been very worth-while progress in the scale of dialogue involving, in particular, the Northern Ireland parties and the two Governments. I believe that there is now a greater willingness on all sides to listen to, and reflect more carefully on, the views and concerns of others.  For our part, the Government is doing everything it can to encourage this developing spirit of openness and tolerance.  It is our intention to honour all the commitments made in the Joint Declaration including paragraph 6 which, of course, is set in the context of political dialogue involving the representatives of the Unionist tradition.  The establishment of the Constitution Review Group demonstrates our openness to change.</P>
    <P>I believe that the peace process is now entering a new phase of trust and confidence-building.  In that regard, I <Col N="1763" /> welcome and am carefully studying the statement issued by Mr. Gerry Adams on Monday.  I note in particular the statements that Sinn Féin are totally committed to the democratic process and the achievement of peace which must involve a permanent end to all violence.  I also note the statement that it is self-evident that threats of any description have no role in any peace process.  For our part, the Government will continue to do everything it can to build trust and confidence with a view to bringing about a durable political settlement achieved through a process of dialogue and agreement.</P>

      <P>Is the Taoiseach still of the view that the Governments are tantalisingly close to reaching agreement with a view to all-party talks commencing?</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach first said that about ten days ago and as he may or may not be aware, many of the other participants in these talks do not share the view that the Governments are tantalisingly close.  Will he elaborate on why he believes they are tantalisingly close?  Has he come to an agreement on the commission, its terms of reference and so on?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to be pedantic but the word &ldquo;tantalising&rdquo; has a particular meaning; it does not mean you have arrived at a destination but that it is within sight and is something that you may or may not achieve.  I could give a definition of tantalising&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;it relates to the experience of the King of Phrygia who was condemned to stand in water that receded when he tried to drink it and under branches that drew back when he tried to pick the fruit.  It does not mean necessarily that you have arrived at your destination when you say that something is tantalisingly close.  I think the word is apt because it demonstrates that we can see what is attainable but we are <Col N="1764" /> not there yet and there is no certainty that we will arrive.  It will require that extra effort by everybody to traverse the gap between potential and reality and it is not just the Governments that will have to move on this.  I am encouraged by the statements of various people in recent days.  I am encouraged by the sense of engagement of a variety of people, including obviously two Governments, the parties in Northern Ireland and the US Administration on this matter.  I hope the &ldquo;tantalisation&rdquo; will not last unduly long and that we will achieve results.</P>

      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that the new Unionist Party leader's openness to dialogue is welcome; at all the meetings that have taken place he has expressed an openness to engage in dialogue.  Did Mr. Trimble respond to the Taoiseach's suggestion that he should join the British-Irish Parliamentary body?  Is he aware that the SDLP will not accept the idea of an assembly in advance of or as a substitute for all party talks as it is the view of Mr. John Hume and his party that they tried that road in 1975 and in 1982 but it failed?  Does he agree that there will never be serious negotiations as long as some parties can cherry pick from the menu?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a question simply of cherry picking; everybody has the right to bring their proposals to the table.  It is not a matter for Government or Governments or sets of parties to say this is the agenda and no other participant may add anything to it.  I think we must stress that all parties, including the Unionists, the SDLP, Sinn Féin and others, are quite within their rights in putting forward new suggestions for the agenda or postulating ways in which deadlocks or problems which exist can be overcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I did not get a positive response from the Unionists to the suggestion I made about joining the British-Irish parliamentary body but that is not something on which I believe they have a totally closed mind.  I am aware of the views of <Col N="1765" /> the SDLP on David Trimble's proposal of an assembly.  In my response to that statement I said two things: first, that it should be looked at carefully by all; second, that any proposal had to be within a three strand framework and there could be no question, therefore, of internal arrangements substituting for the three stranded arrangements that are necessary.</P>

      <P>In view of the statement yesterday by the British Minister for Defence is it not quite clear that the British Government, and in particular the British Conservative Party, does not seem to have any intention of being properly in the European Union and would prefer if the European Union would join the United Kingdom?</P>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach comment on the claim made at the Conservative Party conference that it was never intended that the Joint Framework Document would be implemented by the British Government and that a senior Stormont Minister said that what was described as the entirely repulsive framework document had been no more than a booster rocket to get the process airborne? Surely if one is talking about trust and &ldquo;tantalisingly close&rdquo;, this statement does not help.</P>

      <P>I wish the Taoiseach success in his encouragement of Ulster Unionists to participate in the British-Irish parliamentary body.  As a former co-chairman we sent many signals to them but, unfortunately, they were all repulsed.  In his contact with the British Government will he ask the Prime Minister to use his influence to get the Unionists to participate in that body? When the British-Irish parliamentary <Col N="1766" /> body last met, Mr. Mates, who sometimes is regarded as a senior spokes-person for the British Government, made certain remarks about a short term return to violence being considered by both Governments, Will the Taoiseach give his views on those remarks and tell us if he raised them with Mr. Major in the meantime?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied that Mr. Mates's views in this instance did not represent in any sense the thinking of the British Government.  I do not see a need to raise them with the British Government because I do not believe they represent the views of the British Government.  I believe we will hear views of this nature from time to time, but if we were to become involved in protest politics every time somebody said something they should not have said, we would not be using our time as effectively as possible.  I believe the British Government is committed to finding a solution to the dilemmas that we now face and I am confident that my beliefs will be vindicated by results in due course.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not argue with the Taoiseach about the dictionary definition of tantalising except to say that the signal the Taoiseach sent out when he used those words was positive and most people felt the Governments were very close.  I believe it was an unfortunate choice of words.</P>
      <P>Is it the case that there are fundamental differences between the two Governments on the decommissioning issue?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Deputy would describe as positive the signal I sent out in a speech ranging over a number of ideas on that occasion.  I believe it is and was a positive signal and as I spoke we were moving towards an agreement, and we are still moving and are further along the road to agreement. I have no problem with any message on that occasion being described as a positive one because it was and was intended to be but, equally, I believe <Col N="1767" /> that the use of the term &ldquo;tantalising&rdquo; was an accurate and reasonable description of the situation because, although we are moving towards an agreement, there remains the possibility that we would not achieve it if we do not all make the necessary effort.  In that context the word was accurate and apt and far from giving a misleading signal, it gave a very accurate signal.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach said he was considering Mr. Gerry Adams's statement of 9 October.  Does he welcome that statement, particularly the section he quoted which states that threats have no part to play and that the aim of everyone is permanent peace? Would he agree with Mr. Séamus Mallon who said the British Government should accept that statement as fully satisfying the requirements of paragraph 10 of the Downing Street Declaration and that both Governments should now move to organising all-party talks based on that?  We have stated many times that it would be helpful if we heard this from the leader of Sinn Féin.  Now that we have, does the Taoiseach welcome it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have accepted for quite some time that Sinn Féin has met the requirements of paragraph 10.  For that reason I have been pressing for all-party talks to begin as soon as possible. However, I recognise that there are others involved whose sensitivities and concerns must also be taken into account.  I refer not just to the British Government but to the Unionist community as represented by the various political parties, notably, the Ulster Unionist Party, who need also to be able to come independently to its own judgment that the provisions of paragraph 10 have been complied with. Without attempting to tell the Ulster Unionist Party what to think, it is my view that Mr. Adams's statement is a significant one.  The passages referred to by the Deputy about threats having no <Col N="1768" /> place in a peace process, and the very comprehensive nature of the speech and of other statements made about this demonstrate a significant and important new commitment on the part of Sinn Féin in this area.  I am very glad that this has taken place.  The language used by Mr. Adams is the sort of measured and careful language I recommend &mdash; and have recommended &mdash; to all in the peace process.</P>

      <P>Leaving aside the Ulster Unionist Party for the moment, will the Taoiseach use this speech of Mr. Gerry Adams to recommend strongly to the British Government, which is still in doubt, that it can interpret this statement as satisfying paragraph 10 of the Downing Street Declaration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly will bring this statement to the attention of the British Government and indicate my view that Sinn Féin has satisfied the provisions of paragraph 10.  However, I would not wish &mdash; it is one of my constant concerns &mdash; in any discussion of this matter to, in the Deputy's phrase, leave aside for the moment the concerns of the Unionist Party&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The statement by Mr. Adams is of significant help in that regard.</P>

      <P>I would like to touch on another aspect.  Pending the beginning of all-party talks, what is the attitude of the Irish Government to the encouragement of economic co-operation between the two communities in the North?  Furthermore, what practical steps can we take to encourage such <Col N="1769" /> cross-community co-operation?  I have in mind the work of the Phoenix Trust and bodies of that kind where both communities are working together to encourage economic activity in the deprived areas of Belfast.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I strongly encourage cross-community activity of that nature. One of the benefits of bodies like the International Fund for Ireland is that they provide a financial resource specifically directed at encouraging cross-community co-operation of an economic kind.  I also commend the two biggest parties in Northern Ireland, the Ulster Unionist Party and the Social Democratic Labour Party, on the discussions they have already had on economic matters. I encourage them to intensify these discussions and extend them to include political matters and the ideas that each of the parties is putting forward regarding these matters.  There is no need to await all-party talks &mdash; although we want to bring them about quickly &mdash; for bilateral discussions to take place between the parties on their own initiative.</P>

In regard to Question No. 8, will the Taoiseach agree that if the divorce referendum is defeated, even though it is a matter for this State and this jurisdiction, it will send out false signals to those in Northern Ireland who wish to misrepresent what happens in the Republic?</P>

    <Col N="1770" />
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That risk exists, and is one of the reasons I am doing everything I can to ensure that the divorce referendum is not defeated.  On the other hand, this is a proposal, namely, creating the right to remarry, that ought to be assessed on its merits rather than by reference to its effect elsewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Given that in the Downing Street Declaration the Irish Government committed itself to the creation of a more pluralist society here, is the Taoiseach concerned that by inserting the words into the Constitution the Government is pursuing a course of action to which the Church of Ireland said it strongly objected?  Whatever about the merits of the proposal as far as the Government is concerned, is the Taoiseach concerned about that matter, and has he taken the opportunity to discuss this with the Church of Ireland authorities?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter of the wording of the divorce referendum proposal has been discussed extensively in the House, and the Minister for Equality and Law Reform has engaged in extensive consultations with all the relevant interests.  I presume, although I cannot give dates, that he included the Church of Ireland in his round of discussions. The Government came to the view it came to, after very careful consideration, precisely for the reason adverted to by the Deputy in her earlier supplementary question.  We want the proposal to pass and to give the maximum reassurance to people who might be worried about the proposal and its implications &mdash; for example, in regard to unduly speedy divorce &mdash; that provision is being made to ensure that does not happen.  What we have done we have done to maximise the likelihood of a favourable verdict by the people on this matter.  I stress that this is a matter for the people to decide. They are sovereign, and they will make the decision on the matter.</P>

      <P>I accept what the Taoiseach said about the Minister, Deputy Taylor, and I do not wish to discuss the Government's strategy because a decision has been made on that matter. However, given the strong submission made by the Church of Ireland to the Forum, will the Taoiseach not accept that the very least the Government could have done was to discuss that submission with them and explain the Government's strategy so that there can be no misrepresentation of the Church of Ireland's strong views given to the Forum and not heeded by the Government? This is particularly relevant given the commitment in the Downing Street Declaration regarding pluralism.</P>

If further discussions are sought by the Church of Ireland on the subject we will be happy to enter into them, but I am not aware that such discussions have been sought.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with that view. <Col N="1772" /> I quoted from paragraph 6 of the declaration in a wider context on a number of occasions.  It imposes an obligation on the Irish Government to seek to reassure both communities in Northern Ireland to the greatest extent possible and in seeking to ensure that the concerns of the Unionist community on, for example, decommissioning are taken into account, I am acting in accordance with the imperative created by that paragraph.  I agree with Deputy Harney's view that paragraph 6 has other related implications in respect of domestic law and so on here.  Furthermore, it commits us to entering into discussions with members of the Unionist community regarding their views on matters this side of the Border and as soon as talks commence we hope such discussions will take place.  However, after much effort by many people we have established formal dialogue between the Taoiseach and the Leader of the Ulster Unionist Party, something which has not occurred for 25 years.</P>

      <P>We are pleased that dialogue has begun between the Taoiseach and Mr. Trimble but, from a communications point of view, there is a lack of dialogue between the Republic and Northern Ireland.  We are not getting our message across to Northern Ireland. Since the <i>Irish Press</i> went out of circulation, many people in Border counties purchase the <i>Irish News</i> and the <i>Belfast Telegraph</i>.  While messages from Northern Ireland are clearly beamed into the Republic, messages about what we stand for here are not beamed into the North.  Will the Taoiseach encourage RTE in this regard?  Dialogue is taking place at top level, but we are not getting our message across to the ordinary people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's concerns are worthy of a separate question. Efforts are being made to ensure that RTE coverage is more widely available in Northern Ireland and, for the reasons <Col N="1773" /> outlined by the Deputy, that is desirable. I cannot, however, give him up-to-date information on the subject without prior notice.  He should table a further question on the matter to me or, more appropriately, to the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht because the matter is worthy of consideration.  We should use every opportunity to transmit our views to the people in Northern Ireland.  I commend Members of the House who have visited the North for meetings and I encourage them to continue to do so.  All parties have been active in this regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9, 10, 11 and 12 together.  I met Mr. Felipe González, Prime Minister of Spain and current President of the European Council in Madrid on Tuesday, 3 October 1995. Overall the meeting was very useful and constructive and enabled me to gauge Spanish Presidency thinking on a range of important issues, many of which will carryover into Ireland's Presidency of the EU from 1 July next.  The meeting <Col N="1774" /> also strengthened Irish-Spanish relations and underlined the concerns which Ireland and Spain share on the European agenda.  We agreed that close contact at both official and political level should be maintained between the two countries.</P>
      <P>More specifically we discussed the forthcoming European Council in Madrid and the longer term challenges facing the European Union.  In relation to the Madrid Council, the Prime Minister briefed me on the main agenda items which are expected to include employment policy, economic and monetary union and the report of the Reflection Group established to help prepare for the 1996 Intergovernmental Conference.</P>
      <P>I stressed to the Prime Minister the importance which Ireland attached to the issue of employment and expressed the hope that the Madrid Council would give a further significant impetus to a co-ordinated approach at European level in this area.  On economic and monetary union we both noted the positive outcome of the informal ECOFIN in Valencia and looked forward to a similar positive outcome under this heading at the Madrid Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the Intergovernmental Conference we noted that the Reflection Group would report to the Madrid Council.  This report will provide a basis for a discussion at Madrid on the Intergovernmental Conference agenda. The Council will also decide the commencement date for the Intergovernmental Conference.  We had an exchange of views on the Intergovernmental Conference which featured a strong, shared concern to preserve the present institutional balance, including the existing power of the Commission.  I indicated that Ireland believed that the Intergovernmental Conference should take particular account of the issues of greatest concern to the citizens of Europe, notably employment and crime, including drug trafficking.  In regard to the latter I expressed concern that the existing provisions under the justice and home affairs pillar of the <Col N="1775" /> treaty were not working effectively enough.  I also outlined the general Irish approach to the review of the common foreign and security policy due at the Intergovernmental Conference.</P>
    <P>We reaffirmed our support for future enlargement of the Union while underlining the need for careful preparation on both the part of the Union and those countries who wish to join. Prime Minister González agreed with me that future enlargement should not be used as a pretext to dismantle existing common policies, notably the CAP.</P>
    <P>While in Madrid I was also honoured to have an audience with King Juan Carlos.  In addition, I took the opportunity to have a discussion on European issues with Mr. Jose Maria Aznar leader of the Opposition Partido Popular.  I also attended a dinner hosted by the Irish Ambassador to Spain for members of the Spain-Ireland Business Club.</P>
    <P>I paid a short visit to New York from 4-6 October.  The principal purpose of the visit was to attend the ICCUSA American Celtic Ball Dinner which gave me the opportunity to address a distinguished audience of senior American and Irish business people on the current economic position and prospects for Ireland.  I was glad to be associated with their seventh anniversary celebration. The business community in the United States has a significant role in the promotion of peace in Ireland through economic growth.</P>
    <P>I attended a meeting of the Ireland-America Economic Advisory Board on 6 October where I briefed the members on political and economic developments in Ireland and on North-South relationships and heard their views on steps they believed were important and on which they were prepared to be active personally.  The board meetings bring together a significant number &mdash; 16 on this occasion &mdash; of respected Irish-American chairmen and chief executive officers of leading US corporations.</P>
    <P>While in New York I availed of the opportunity to meet a delegation from &ldquo;Americans for a New Ireland Agenda&rdquo;<Col N="1776" /> comprising Mr. Niall O'Dowd, Mr. Bruce Morrison, Mr. Joe Jamison, Mr. Chuck Feeney and Mr. Bill Flynn.  We discussed the Northern Ireland situation generally and reviewed in some detail the current issues in the peace process.</P>
    <P>During my visit I also had meetings, organised by the IDA, with companies in the financial services sector to discuss investment projects in Ireland.  I also met representatives of the Meath Association of New York.</P>

      <P>I will not ask the Taoiseach what he discussed with the Meath Association.  Since he dealt with his two visits, a large number of issues were raised.  I want to clarify the Government's position in regard to European economic and monetary policy which he discussed with the Spanish Premier.  Can I take it from what the Taoiseach stated recently that we will join the European Monetary Union, irrespective of whether the British do so?</P>

      <P>It is the Government's intention that we meet the necessary criteria to enable us join the European Monetary Union on the commencement date in 1999.  We have not made a final decision as to whether we will do so if Britain does not join, but I hope we will be in a strong enough position to join.  I also hope that Britain will join on that date.  It is by no means a foregone conclusion that it will not do so.  Britain would accrue considerable benefits from joining the European Monetary Union, from the point of view of the importance of London as a financial centre and the overall economic stability of Britain, factors which I have no doubt will weigh heavily on the minds of whatever the Government is in Britain at that time.  Obviously, the interests of Ireland will be of secondary concern, but I will ensure they are represented to it.  So far as the importance of stable and growing trade between the two islands is concerned, it is important that we should be part of the European currency union together.</P>

We did not discuss the economic position of Spain <i>vis-à-vis</i> EMU as such, but he did indicate that Spain would do everything it could to comply with the convergence criteria so that it would be eligible to be part of the economic and monetary union.

      <P>I omitted to answer an earlier question from the Deputy. We did not discuss the Gibraltar judgement.  One of the main purposes of the meeting was to discuss the need to formulate a common strategy.  I believe &mdash; Prime Minister González agrees with me as, I think, does Jose Maria Aznar, the leader of the Opposition in Spain &mdash; that there is a strong common strategic interest between Ireland and Spain about protecting <i>acquis-communautaire</i> in regard to the Structural Funds, the Common Agricultural Policy and so on and that there is need, in our approach to the Intergovernmental Conference, <Col N="1778" /> the financial perspectives for the European Union and enlargement, for close co-ordination and consultation between us because we will find that Ireland and Spain will be on the same side on most of the major issues in Europe.  It is important that there should be a good personal understanding at every level between Ireland and Spain on these issues.  That was one of the important purposes achieved by this visit.</P>

      <P>While I agree with the Taoiseach that the criteria for European Monetary Union must be met, it would be totally unrealistic for Ireland to join if Britain stayed out.  One of the difficulties is that whereas Britain accounts for 28 per cent of our trade only 14 per cent of our foreign debt is in sterling. We have a twin track approach.  Has the Government given any consideration to the preparation of a paper on the implications of European Monetary Union for the economy and on enlargement? They are more important than some of the other issues which are receiving much attention in relation to changes at European level.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government is undertaking detailed studies of those matters, particularly economic and monetary union.  It has undertaken an assessment of all the implications of the choice we will have to make, including the one to which the Deputy referred in regard to what we would do if Britain did not join.  That is being analysed carefully by the Government and much advance work is being done.  It is my view that Britain will not make a decision until late in the day on that subject.  I do not think it will signal its view in advance.  We will have to make our decision quickly as a result.  The more preparatory work that is done the better.  My own hunch is &mdash; I could be wrong &mdash; that it will join at the end of the day.</P>

      <P>I have been urging the Taoiseach for some months to prepare <Col N="1779" /> our case.  Has he given any consideration or support to the idea of publishing a White Paper on European Monetary Union?

      <P>It is.  While I am convinced of the need for a systematic analysis of the choice in the public arena I am not altogether convinced that a Government White Paper is necessarily the only or best way of securing that systematic analysis and debate.  There is the risk, given the way in which the exchange markets react unpredictably to words which might be used, that they might read things into papers which were not intended because of the use of a particular phrase.  We are all aware of how quickly they can react in such circumstances. I would be hesitant about committing myself to the publication of a White Paper, but I agree with the basic thrust of the Deputy's remarks that we must have a coherent, analytical and clear sighted debate on the subject.</P>

Have the Cohesion countries devised a strategy in regard to European Monetary Union and, particularly, the Structural Funds?  Everyone says that 1999 is a long way away, but the discussions on the criteria will begin in exactly two years time and the figures that will be used will cover the period 1993-97.  Is a strategy being devised that all four countries &mdash; Ireland, Spain, Portugal and Greece &mdash; could put forward in the discussions that will take place?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>We agree that we should consult closely with one another but we did not produce a paper or anything that I could refer to as the joint Irish-Spanish strategy. That was not the purpose of the meeting.  Detailed arrangements for economic and monetary union will be raised at the Madrid council which will be chaired by Prime Minister González.

Will the Taoiseach assure us that the strategy involves all four countries and not just Spain?  The Spanish criteria might work against us the next time round.  We cannot use the objective one argument as we did before but we can use other objective arguments.  Greece and Portugal are similar to us.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 23, 28, 29, 32, 34, 55 and 142 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The level of bovine tuberculosis in Ireland is low with over 99 per cent of the seven million animals in the national herd clear of the disease.  The remaining incidence is essentially residual infection which has been difficult to reduce. At the same time, we must keep essential eradication arrangements in place if we are to maintain our trading status and our access to EU and third country markets.  My objective is to introduce an <Col N="1783" /> effective programme which, while meeting that requirement, is also less costly on both taxpayers and farmers.</P>
    <P>For 1995, I have been seeking to implement the programme that was approved for EU funding in 1994.  That programme provided for an element of rotation testing between practices and drawdown of EU funding is contingent on implementing this.  Following rejection by the IVU of negotiated terms, I issued phase three of the 1995 round on an area basis to seek to deliver on the terms of the approved programme and to secure EU funding.  That approach was also opposed by the IVU and other arrangements had to be made to seek to implement the required level of rotated and other testing.  I have recently issued phase four of the round in the normal way.  It was essential to take the foregoing measures to seek to secure EU funding both for 1995 and later years and to avoid creating undue difficulties for farmers who wish to sell cattle.</P>
    <P>I am currently having discussions with the farming organisations on revised arrangements for the scheme for 1996. These arrangements would cover, <i>inter alia</i>, partial decentralisation of responsibility for aspects of the scheme, more focused use of the veterinary resources available directly to the Department, greater use of technology in the programme, and more effective wildlife control.  Emphasis will continue to be placed on improving the efficiency of the programme including research designed to overcome technical barriers in testing methodology so as to progress towards full eradication.  It is envisaged that a restructured eradication scheme will lead to a reduction in the current level of bovine disease levies.  Decisions on EU funding for the scheme in the future will be taken following discussions later in the year with Commission officials on the operation of this year's programme and on the new arrangements to be put in place for the future.</P>

      <P>The position is straightforward. We still have a chance of drawing down £4.2 million in EU funding this year.  FEOGA and EU auditors will come here next year to see how many tests we rotated in 1995.  I am confident that between now and the end of the year we will rotate sufficient tests.  That is why the action I took, despite the intransigence of the IVU, was essential. If we do not get EU funds we face the prospect of increased levies or seeking a greater contribution from the taxpayer. The Deputy asked about the 1996 scheme.</P>

      <P>The Minister can answer the first question.  Will rotation be a feature of the restructured scheme?  The Government suffered a humiliating climb-down this week.  The Minister says there is a chance of obtaining £4.2 million in funding.  When he introduced rotation he said it was a prerequisite to obtaining the funds.  Is it true that under the third phase only 2 per cent of the total herd was involved in the rotation testing?  How does that square with the Minister's claim that two-thirds of the herd needed to be rotated in order to receive the money?  The Minister embarked on a confrontational course with the IVU and sought to overturn its decision and right as a union to decide whether to accept the negotiating position. Without any strategy, the Minister has gone headlong&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I was not and am not prepared to see the practitioners hold those funding the scheme &mdash; taxpayers and farmers &mdash; to ransom. I am adamant about that.

      <P>Is the Minister aware that as UCC statistics are based on 74,000 herd tests there is a level of spontaneous rotation at present?  It shows the private veterinary surgeon tests 53.6 per cent and between different private veterinary surgeons in the same practice, departmental veterinary surgeons, temporary veterinary surgeons and others involved in this area 47 per cent of herds have been tested.  Why did the Minister not make that argument to the Commission rather than engaging in this bungling effort that alienates farmers and veterinary surgeons?

      <P>The Minister promised to do this last February and I presume he is aware of the many farmers who relied on the availability of temporary lease quotas from co-ops for the past number of years.  They were not told until mid-July what their position would be this year.  What will the Minister do for the main dairy farmers, with small and <Col N="1788" /> medium size enterprises, who are now being offered 3,000 to 5,000 gallons lease quotas instead of 10,000 to 20,000 gallons lease quotas?

      <P>Regarding the question raised by the Deputy about small farmers, I took the exceptional step today of introducing measures which will have a 10 per cent clawback on private leases for cheque book farmers.  This will involve a 10 per cent deduction for people who had temporary leases and who will have them in the future.</P>
      <P>I am not satisfied with the situation whereby all the milk in the restructuring scheme is being siphoned off when milk is making as much as 60p a gallon.  As the Deputy is aware, that is cheque book driven.  I have taken this exceptional step and the legislation will be put in place soon.  It is a new measure which has been checked by the Office of the Attorney General and the EU Commission. It meets fully the ultimate legal powers I can take in this regard.</P>

Why has he not been in a position to deliver for those farmers, who were not told about their position in mid-July?  Was it another promise made in the early flush of ministerial office?  Can the Minister explain the position to farmers who are worried out of their wits about how they will work out their quota and the over supply of milk?

      <P>My Department has instituted civil legal proceedings for the recovery of a sum in excess of £900,000 in respect of intervention beef which was misappropriated. The Deputy will be aware that two executives at the plant in question were sentenced by the courts on 5 October having pleaded guilty to conspiracy to defraud.

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that another £900,000 is due to him, arising from similar activities in the cannery of this factory?  A sum of approximately £900,000 was fraudulently claimed in the boning hall and as a similar amount from 1990-91 arises from the cannery will the Minister institute proceedings? When did he institute the proceedings for this £900,000?  Is interest being claimed as much of this money is outstanding to his Department since 1989?  That is six years ago and a large amount of interest is due.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Minister answer the remaining part of my question regarding the steps, if any, he proposes to take to have the instigators of these frauds identified? The two gentlemen convicted the other day on their own pleas of guilty <Col N="1792" /> were said, by the prosecution and the judge, not to be the beneficiaries of the fraud.  The beneficiaries were the owners of the factory.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Evidence was supplied to the tribunal by a former boning hall manager employed at Rathkeale by AIBP which was corroborated by company records.  Information was also uncovered by the Department's control inquiry team which made an unannounced inspection of the premises with the benefit of a search warrant.  The Garda Síochána, through the DPP, instituted legal proceedings against three Rathkeale employees, namely the plant manager, the accountant and the supervisor of the boning hall who were charged with conspiracy to defraud.  The first two pleaded guilty and were sentenced to six years on 5 October.  They were also disqualified from serving as company directors, auditors or managers for the next six years.  Each must perform 240 hours of community service. Implementation of the sentence has been adjourned to 4 November 1996 but the judge has not ruled out a requirement that either defendant serve an appropriate portion of sentence.  The boning hall supervisor pleaded not guilty and, following court proceedings, the judge directed his acquittal.</P>
      <P>In relation to the recovery of funds, the group refused to accept the findings of the beef tribunal with regard to this matter.  I have challenged, through their solicitors, a demand for payment of the sum mentioned.  Consequently, on the advice of the Office of the Attorney General, the Department has taken steps through the Office of the Chief State Solicitor to institute legal proceedings for the recovery of the funds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Goodman group issued a statement on 4 April 1995 which said: &ldquo;It follows, if it is the case that if any individuals indulged in unacceptable activities in the group's plant in Rathkeale, Goodman International shall recompense the Department for the appropriate loss&rdquo;.  I was very disappointed to find, when we pursued this matter of <Col N="1793" /> recovery, that we received a solicitor's letter stating they would not pay it.  This is why we have instituted legal proceedings.</P>
    <P>I do not have information to hand regarding the additional £900,000 in the cannery.  The question related to one sum of £900,000 but I will communicate with the Deputy in relation to the cannery.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister answer the latter part of my question regarding the steps, if any, he proposes to take to have the instigators of these frauds identified?</P>
      <P>The judge and the prosecution both made it clear that the two men who pleaded guilty were not the instigators, that they did not get one penny from this prolonged fraud over a period of two years and that the beneficiaries were the owners of the factory.  Information had to be sent to an address in Ravensdale, Dundalk, County Louth, each week showing how much was got illegally out of the intervention line and the intervention system.</P>
      <P>The judge and the superintendent both found that the two defendants were only doing what they were told to do by their superiors in County Louth and if they had not done it they would be expendable.  Therefore, they felt they had no option.  In those circumstances will the Minister tell the House what steps he proposes to take to have the instigators of this very large and serious fraud prosecuted and in particular whether he will ask the Director of Public Prosecutions to make an application to the court under section 160 of the Companies Act, 1990, to have the top management of this group&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department is responsible for the development of afforestation policies in this State, and in collaboration with the Department of Enterprise and Employment, for timber processing policies.  Broadly similar arrangements exist in Northern Ireland. Of course, the impact of such policies within the two jurisdictions affects the whole island of Ireland and, indeed elsewhere. There is already a substantial level of cross-Border trade in timber and in timber products and there is an increasing integration within the timber processing industry on the island.  I believe that the existing liaison process is satisfactory and provides considerable benefits, particularly in the afforestation, trade and plant protection areas, to forest industry participants and the sector as a whole in both jurisdictions. It is clearly desirable in these circumstances that policies in these areas are complementary.  To this end, there is regular liaison between my Department and its counterpart in Northern Ireland, the Department of Agriculture.  It is a matter which I keep under review and if the level of liaison needed requires <Col N="1795" /> strengthening in any way, I will certainly raise the matter with my counterpart in Northern Ireland.</P>

Junior Ministers have nearly always taken responsibility for forestry.  I have taken a personal interest in this sector and I think it will benefit from my assiduous efforts in that regard.  A joint forestry liaison group meets twice yearly to deal with all forestry matters, representing both Departments.  There are two cochairpersons and the group meets here and in Northern Ireland.  There was a full exchange of information.</P>
      <P>In relation to the sawmilling sector, my discussions with BALCAS, and the fact that BALCAS, based in Enniskillen, is Coillte's largest customer, buying 23 per cent of their log sales, there is a huge exchange.  Ultimately our forestry will be based on exports so we will have to take an all-Ireland view of this. Forbairt and the forestry service are very anxious, both at planting level, at sawmilling level and in all aspects of exchange of technical information to work as closely together as possible and if the Deputy has any suggestions as to how to improve the liaison, I would be happy to implement them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry if he will make a statement on the circumstances surrounding the employment of the personal assistant to the Minister of State at his Department and the apparent breach of Department of Social Welfare regulations whereby he was concurrently drawing invalidity pension while working full-time for the Minister over a period of some five months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Deenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>Mr. Michael Kelly commenced work as a personal secretary attaching to my constituency office on 3 January 1995.  Prior to that Mr. Kelly was in receipt of an invalidity pension. His entitlement was based on his inability to undertake physical work relating to previous employment.  I nominated Mr. Kelly for employment as a personal secretary attaching to my constituency office.  The particulars relating to his terms and conditions of employment were a matter for negotiation by him with the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry.</P>
      <P>Negotiations between personnel divisions of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry and the Department of Finance commenced in January, were protracted in nature, and were not finalised until 11 May.  During this period, at no stage did either Mr. Kelly or any other official inform me of the fact that Mr. Kelly had continued to draw invalidity pension while employed as a personal secretary within the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry. I was only made aware of this fact for the first time by way of telephone conversation with the personnel division of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry on the evening of 12 May.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1797" /> At no stage did Mr. Kelly simultaneously receive both invalidity pension and remuneration from the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry during the period 3 January to 11 May. When the matter was brought to my attention on 12 May, action had already been taken by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry to fully refund the invalidity pension to the Department of Social Welfare and a full refund of £2,691 was made by the Department on 7 June 1995.</P>
    <P>At the outset, this was a personnel related matter which was administered by the personnel division in the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry and I was assured that matters were being satisfactorily resolved.  I deeply regret the incident and I am satisfied that the matter was promptly dealt with when it became known to me.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The regulations governing the receipt of invalidity pension state that the recipient must notify the Department of Social Welfare if he or she changes address and in other circumstances, but in particular if he or she becomes capable of or takes up employment. Failure to observe these regulations can lead to the disallowance of the pension and to legal proceedings. These regulations were printed on Mr. Kelly's pension book.  Are any prosecutions pending under section 224 of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act, 1993, or have they been waived by the Minister for Social Welfare?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a matter strictly for the Department of Social Welfare and I am sure it will deal with it.  It had notice of it since last May and I am sure it has considered it so I suggest that if the Deputy wants further replies, he take the matter up with the Minister for Social Welfare.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>When somebody takes up employment it is usual for them to pay PRSI on their income.  Was PRSI paid in relation to Mr. Kelly while he <Col N="1798" /> was working with the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry?  Was he covered for occupational injury benefit from the first day of his employment?  If he had an accident during his employment from 3 January to 11 May, was he covered from the first day of his employment, although the contract had not been finalised?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>In that instance, the normal departmental procedures would apply.  I also point out that Mr. Kelly's contract was signed on 12 May.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>In other words, if Mr. Kelly had an accident or some difficulty any time from 3 January to 12 May he was in serious difficulty?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is another matter. I am sure Mr. Kelly was covered by the normal procedures during that period. Because of protracted negotiations between the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry and the Department of Finance, which should have been resolved earlier, Mr. Kelly was put in this position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>In his statement the Minister said he employed Mr. Kelly who presumably is a friend of his given that he would have to deal with much of his confidential constituency work and would be <i>au fait</i> with the various rules and regulations which apply to constituents' problems and would perhaps deal with invalidity pension applications during the course of his work.  Is it the Minister's position, despite the fact he was in constant contact with Mr. Kelly on a weekly or probably on a daily basis, that at no stage from 3 January to 10 May did he and Mr. Kelly have any discussion about the fact that he was not in <Col N="1799" /> receipt of payment from the Department of Social Welfare?  Did the Minister know &mdash; I presume he did &mdash; he was in receipt of invalidity pension before he started work?  If that is the case, is the Minister saying this matter was not discussed between him and Mr. Kelly until he got a telephone call from the Department of Social Welfare about it?  Is the Minister suggesting that no discussion took place between himself and Mr. Kelly who was awaiting his contract from 3 January and was in daily or weekly contact with the Minister on various matters, and that although trying to settle everyone else's problems, he was not in a position to settle his?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>During the period because of my concern about the protracted negotiations between Mr. Kelly, the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry and the Department of Finance, I arranged two meetings with a Department of Finance official and the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry regarding his salary and the fact that it was not being expedited.  At no stage during those meetings was there any mention of invalidity pension. When I introduced Mr. Kelly to the Department, I introduced two others who were on social welfare benefit at that time.  I presumed that three signed off immediately from any benefit and I left it at that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I knew Mr. Kelly was on invalidity pension before I brought him to Dublin.  Following my introduction of Mr. Kelly to personnel in the Department, I presumed he discontinued to draw invalidity pension.  The other two people immediately withdrew their claims.  I was asked how I thought he would survive in those circumstances. I was confident that because his wife has a shop, Mr. Kelly had some independent means.  He did not mention that he was under any financial pressures.</P>

The Minister was aware he was in receipt of invalidity pension at the time, but he did not find out if, but presumed he was in a position to discontinue that.</P>

      <P>The reason I took Mr. Kelly on was that he was a good community worker.  He is chairman of the local development association in Tarbert and chairman of the north Kerry development associations.  He has been associated with a number of major developments in his native village of Tarbert and is involved in the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and social housing. The man comes with a very good record as regards commitment to the community. Mr. Kelly handled telephone calls, day to day issues in my office and took clinics when I was not available. He attended branch meetings and worked on Saturdays when I was busy.</P>
      <P>When the Department of Social Welfare was asked to investigate the case in the normal way, the Department stated that Mr. Kelly's actions were a technical breach of the regulations rather than a deliberate one.  It also stated that Mr. Kelly did not receive concurrently an invalidity pension and his salary from the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry.  The amount of invalidity pension paid after he had taken up employment was deducted with his consent from the arrears of salary due to him.  The Department pointed out that Mr. Kelly did not get any salary payment from the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry until after the contract was agreed and signed which did not happen until 12 May 1995 and that he was not paid until after 18 May 1995.  He last received invalidity pension on 27 April 1995.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this important debate.  This motion highlights Fianna Fáil's concern about the shortfall in the number of places on the vocational training opportunities scheme.  The VTOS programmes, in which participation increased from 247 in 1989 to 4,600 in 1994, were a very positive development and the work of the various Ministers for Education and Governments during that period should be recognised.  It is very disappointing that the Minister has not fulfilled the promise she gave in early 1995 to provide 1,000 additional places on the VTOS.  I have spoken to people who participated in the courses and teachers and others involved in delivering the service and all of them were fulsome in their praise of the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By and large our educational system has served the country well.  There have been substantial developments over the years and access to education has also been improved.  However, there is obviously still much room for improvement; no education system can stand <Col N="1912" /> still.  It is important for the education system to adapt to changing needs and to reflect the new needs of society. Unfortunately many people have not enjoyed the full benefits of education and have been disadvantaged as a result.  The provision of an opportunity for all to develop their educational potential to the full is not realised for many students because of their social and economic backgrounds.  Unfortunately, there is not a level playing pitch for all students.</P>
    <P>Last night Deputy Martin quoted from many reports which have praised the VTOS.  The decision to cut back on this year's original provision of an additional 1,000 places is a retrograde step.  Instead of curtailing the programme, provision should have been made to considerably expand it in the future.  To say that the Government's decision is extremely short-sighted is an understatement.</P>
    <P>The long term unemployed in our society face particular problems.  The 1992 Labour Force Survey indicates that more than half of the long term unemployed have been unemployed for more than five years.  Very long term unemployment continues to be growing feature. In its report <i>Ending Long-Term Unemployment</i> the National Economic and Social Forum produced data which shows that the long term unemployed have lower levels of qualifications compared to other groups.  The reality is that the education attainment of the long term unemployed is relatively low.  The National Economic and Social Forum report clearly states that the VTOS represents a useful and beneficial model and welcomes the Government's proposals to provide additional resources and places on it.  If the long term unemployed and other groups are to have any chance of acquiring employment then they must have adequate qualifications.  The long term unemployed have relatively low education and skills levels and approximately half of them have no formal educational qualifications.  Naturally long term <Col N="1913" /> unemployment makes it more difficult for a person to find employment.</P>
    <P>The NESF report indicates that people who are unemployed for more than two years have a 74 per cent chance of being unemployed a year later.  That is a harrowing and frightening statistic and the Government's decision to cut back on the number of places on the VTOS defies common sense.  This decision means 1,000 people, a large percentage of whom are probably young, will be denied the opportunity to get off the live register.</P>
    <P>This scheme has undoubtedly been very successful in giving people the opportunity to acquire additional educational qualifications.  I know from my county vocational education committee that there has been a high success rate among those who have completed a VTOS programme in proceeding to further education or gaining employment. Deputy Martin gave statistics on the employment levels achieved in some schools and I think these are borne out in other schools throughout the country. I support this motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel disadvantaged because of the limited time made available to Independent Deputies.</P>
      <P>The decision to remove the small benefit made available to the long term unemployed through the VTOS during the same year it has been decided to abolish third level fees for the children of the rich and affluent says much about the Government and whether its members are genuinely concerned about the issues which led them into politics in the first instance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This issue was brought to my attention by groups of long term unemployed people, mainly disadvantaged women from the Cherry Orchard-Ballyfermot and inner city areas of my constituency. The Minister was short on argument and, therefore, had to quote many statistics.  I wish to balance those statistics by quoting the statistics given in reply to my Question No. 97 on 27 September last.  These statistics make interesting reading.  In the Cherry <Col N="1914" /> Orchard A ward 46.7 per cent of people are unemployed while in Cherry Orchard C ward 50.5 per cent of people are unemployed.  I do not have time to read all the statistics but the VTOS was invaluable in such areas.  It is amazing how the good schemes always get the chop.  The reason for this is that they attract people and cost money.  The Government decides to get rid of them because they are too good.</P>
    <P>A group of women in the Ballyfermot vocational education committee and another group of women in the North Strand vocational education committee asked me to mention their plight.  These women secured places on a course but following the cutback they were told that it would not go ahead.  This is an absolute disgrace and I ask the Minister to honour the commitments given to people.  I strongly support the motion calling on the Minister to provide an additional 1,000 places that are badly needed under this scheme.</P>

Tá sé tábhachtach go mbeadh sé ar a gcumas postanna a fháil in a mbeadh oideachas riachtanach, agus go mbeadh siad in ann na gnáth rudaí a dhéanamh, fiú amháin léamh.</P>
      <P>Uair amháin nuair a bhí mé ag cabhrú sa chóras seo, bhí aithne agam ar fear go raibh post maith aige agus ní raibh sé ábalta léamh a dhéanamh; bhí sé ag brath ar chompánach san áit in a raibh sé ag obair chun go mbeadh a fhios aige cad a bhí ag teastáil nuair a tháinig na fógraí isteach.</P>
      <P>Ba cheart go mbeadh deis ag chuile dhuine tairbhe a bhaint as an chóras oideachais, ní amháin ó thaobh obair a fháil ach ó thaobh saol níos fearr a bheith acu i leith caitheamh aimsire agus pléisiúr a bhaint as staidéar agus leabhair a léamh. Tá an-suim agam i VTOS ach tuigim nach féidir go mbeadh an deis sin ag gach éinne fiú amháin dá mbeadh i bhfad níos mó seansanna le fáil.  Mar sin féin tá 4,000 áiteanna ann faoi láthair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1915" /> When I heard of this motion I took it for granted there was a cutback in the provision of educational services.  The Minister has contributed greatly to the increased expenditure on and expansion of educational services.  In 1995 she maintained the 4,000 places allocated under the scheme in 1994.  She has been reminded that she made a promise to increase that number of places but in these days when we are encouraged to cut back on services the Minister for Education is in the same position as most Ministers, and somebody must bite the bullet.</P>
    <P>When she encountered difficulties regarding the provision of special assistance for students in disadvantaged schools, she was successful in making an important decision in that regard.  I would welcome it if the Minister could increase the number of places under the scheme from 4,000 to 8,000.  One does not need to have an interest in education but an interest in the human race to appreciate that the more people who are encouraged to participate in education courses the better.</P>
    <P>It is important that the unemployed who have a leaning towards education should be encouraged to participate in education courses.  The VTOS, which enables the unemployed to continue their education without suffering financially, is a marvellous scheme.</P>
    <P>It is easy to understand why the Opposition tabled this motion and it is easy for them to say that the Minister should increase the number of places under the scheme but she has done a great deal of work in this area.  She gave figures which Deputy Gregory did not want to hear; I suppose there are some things we do not like to hear.</P>
    <P>Three years ago 1,920 places were provided under that scheme and during the past two years that figure has doubled to 4,000.  I, and I am sure, the Minister will accept that it would be better if 6,000 places were provided and that the number of places were increased annually as long as people want to participate in such courses. <Col N="1916" /> Unfortunately, we have heard cries that we must introduce cutbacks, control spending and so on even from the Leader of the Opposition.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> That is the difficulty.  Members of councils will be familiar with the views that itinerants should be housed.  While various suggestions are made in that regard, people always want them housed on the opposite side of the town to where they live.  I am not suggesting that there should be a cutback on the VTOS but the Minister when making a decision must weigh up all areas of education.</P>
      <P>I checked the increased allocation of places under various schemes.  The number of places under the Youthreach programme, which deals with adult and continuing education, has increased from approximately 1,600 to 2,400, a major increase in three years.  The expenditure on the adult literacy and communication education scheme has increased from £1 million in 1992 to £1.9 million in 1995.  That scheme relates to adult education also.  The number of adults categorised as disadvantaged has increased almost fivefold, from 273,000 to 1.210 million.  The Minister is spending a great deal of money on adult education. I was fascinated by the level of increases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The number of pre-schools has gone from none in 1992 and 1993 to eight in 1994 and 33 in 1995.  The basic rate of capitation grant has increased from £28 in 1992 to £40 in 1995.  The disadvantaged grant rate has increased from £45 to £65 in three years.  The pupil-teacher ratio has also increased.  The disadvantaged fund for primary schools has increased almost threefold, from £1.14 million to £3.38 million.  Education is very important but it is a high expenditure Department.  As I am aware from my earlier career, teachers will continue to look for more money.  I am sure when Deputy Martin was teaching he was not <Col N="1917" /> interested in a salary increase, he taught for the love of it.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> The maximum class size in disadvantaged primary schools decreased from 39 in 1992 and 1993 to approximately 28 or 29.  In three years the number of remedial teachers has increased from 947 to 1,188.  The increased allocation of teachers costs money.  There are not enough childcare assistants but the number has more than trebled, from 70 in 1992 to 229 in 1995.  The number of home-school-link co-ordinators increased from 45 to 105.  I could continue but I gave those figures to explain why any Minister who is increasing expenditure and expanding facilities in so many areas of education will reach the stage where there is not sufficient money to fund additional increases.</P>
      <P>Given that the number of places under VTOS has increased from 2,000 to 4,000 and will be maintained at that figure this year and while we would all consider it better if the number of places were increased, the Minister must be defended for the role she has played, particularly in regard to the various adult education schemes, including literacy training.  Those schemes are important.  Everyone recognises his or her need as the most important and people prioritise, but what a Minister considers a priority may not be perceived as such by others.  It is difficult to do what is right when one has limited resources.</P>
      <P>We are lectured regularly by the Leader of the Opposition about the importance of balancing the budget. This is part and parcel of what the Government has to do.  In this case there are no cutbacks.  The scheme is continuing.  However, cutbacks will be necessary and we will have to bite the bullet on that although people will say that cutbacks are being made in the wrong areas and priorities are wrong. Cutbacks involve subjective decisions and judgements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1918" /> The Minister cannot be condemned when she has retained in 1995 the 4,000 places which existed in 1994; this is double the number of places available in 1992.  The Opposition should be reasonable. I accept why they make the case for more places and one could argue that the Minister should have increased the number of places, but we must be practical and realise there is a limit to what she can do.  She has done an extremely good job as the figures I gave show.  While I regret there is not an increase in VTOS places, I accept the Minister has managed to retain existing places and for this she deserves our thanks.

I could not help but think that Fianna Fáil was never in power. However, it is not long since it was in power and at that time there were 2,000 places in this scheme while now there are 4,000.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>We are lectured by the leader of Fianna Fáil and by that party's Deputies about the need to balance the books by reducing expenditure.  How we can do this is a mystery to me and I would like somebody to tell me how it can be done.  For the past six or eight months, during Private Members' time Fianna Fáil have said we must spend more money on various schemes but it did not say where we can cut back.  We have had crocodile tears from that party for some time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not denying that the scheme is good.  However, there is a shortage of builders, carpenters, plumbers and <Col N="1919" /> block layers.  Is it because many young people are going to universities and regional technical colleges to be awarded worthless pieces of paper? They would be far better looking for jobs in the trades rather than attending third level institutions and finishing up with nothing.</P>
    <P>A local authority in north Cork requested from the local employment exchange some months ago a list of names of the unemployed so that they could select people for the social employment scheme and were given a list of approximately 150 persons.  Local staff interviewed 100 of them and offered positions on the scheme to 20 but only eight accepted.  Were the other 12 people working or drawing unemployment assistance?  The social employment scheme is not the best paid scheme but it is better than receiving unemployment assistance.  Perhaps it is time the Minister looked at this and other schemes.</P>
    <P>The number of people on the VTOS scheme has increased substantially in the last year or two.  When Fianna Fáil was in power there were 2,000 places, now there is twice this number and the Minister has no doubt this will be the case next year.  It is hypocritical of the Opposition to say the number of places should be doubled and there should be no cutbacks when there were only 2,000 places when it was in power.  This is hypocrisy.

      <P>The provision of a proper education system is an obligation which is part of the State's role in achieving economic prosperity, social wellbeing and a good quality of life in a democratically structured society.  Education is an inherent aspect of the State's economic success and prosperity as it contributes to and actively promotes innovation and adaptability.  It is well documented that many foreign multinationals choose Ireland as a centre of investment because of our highly educated workforce.  The Labour Party <Col N="1920" /> is acutely aware of the role education plays in the current success of the economy and it is committed to continuing this role.</P>
      <P>The community as a whole benefits from a proper education system.  Individuals also benefit.  Education helps to empower communities and to empower individuals.  It is the latter empowerment which is the source of the collective good.  Education is an important part of each individual's personal development and that is the main aim of education.</P>
      <P>Since 1993 the first Labour Minister for Education, Deputy Bhreathnach, has brought about the most fundamental changes in education in the history of the State.  Change is taking place at pre-school, primary, second and third levels.  This is an illustration of the Labour Party's dedication to the provision of a proper and modern education system.</P>
      <P>The importance of education is most fundamentally borne out in the correlation which exists between it and employment.  Numerous studies have shown that the lower a person's level of education, the more likely he or she is to be unemployed.  Almost 85 per cent of the long term unemployed do not have a leaving certificate.  It was due to the realisation and acceptance of this correlation that the VTOS, which focuses on the development of employment related skills, was established.  The scheme has been an unprecedented success in the field of adult education.  It gives a second chance to attain a level of education to thousands of people who missed out on this opportunity the first time round.  This second chance empowers the individual and helps many to get out of the rut they may be in.  Individual empowerment facilitates the collective empowerment of the community and, indeed, the nation towards which we are all working.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We in the Labour Party are committed to the success of the VTOS.  Neither the Minister for Education nor the Labour Party wishes to undermine the success of the scheme.  We recognise the <Col N="1921" /> invaluable contribution the scheme is making in the fight against unemployment and every effort is being made to ensure that this positive work will continue. It should be remembered, as the Minister has duly noted, that through her commitment to the VTOS the number of places available under the scheme now stands at 4,000.  When the debate commenced the impression was given that the scheme had been discontinued.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. B. Fitzgerald Mr. B. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Martin will be aware, the number of places has doubled in three years.  In addition to the increased number of available places, funding for the scheme has also increased substantially under the present Minister from £7 million in 1992 to £18.5 million in 1994.  The Labour Party is aware of the contribution the VTOS makes and will make to society and the role it plays in the fight against long term unemployment, a cancer which has afflicted society for far too long.  This year 611 VTOS students, 1 per cent of the total number of students, sat the leaving certificate.  The Labour Party is committed to consolidating this figure and expanding it in the future. The VTOS will not be allowed to fall by the wayside.  Its contribution is far too valuable for such a fate.</P>
      <P>It is unfortunate that we have to address the problem of the lack of education among the unemployed.  The old saying &ldquo;prevention is better than cure&rdquo; is particularly relevant in the area of education.  While previous Ministers for Education neglected the full and effective role education has to play in the personal development of every individual, they also failed to realise its potential in the fight against unemployment. It is up to the present Minister to try to undo some of the damage that has already been done and also to ensure that such neglect of education never happens again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know from experience in my own constituency at successive elections that there were always letters from Fianna <Col N="1922" /> Fáil Ministers informing constituents they would get their school the following week or the following month, that the extension to the school would be sanctioned or the number of teachers would be increased.  If they were reelected they went back to the Department of Education only to find that no money was available.  That was the case in my constituency until the present Minister was appointed.  Fianna Fáil colleagues in County Meath will bear me out on that.</P>
    <P>De Valera once said the Labour Party would have to wait.  The people have had to wait too long for a Labour Minister for Education.  The record will bear testimony to the fact that no other Minister for Education has been as dedicated to the disadvantaged in education and to adult education as Deputy Bhreathnach. No other Minister for Education has provided such an amount of resources to these two groups.</P>
    <P>While the announcement of the postponement of the extra 1,000 places has caused much concern and anger, not only within Fianna Fáil but among every party, it should be remembered that not all vocational education committees have been able to fill their existing allocations. I understand the Department of Education has asked vocational education committees to provide information on the number of places they currently offer in order to spread the reductions as evenly as possible.  It is hoped that this will enable the Department to facilitate as many people as possible and to alleviate any upset that might otherwise be caused.</P>
    <P>The Economic and Social Research Institute has described the VTOS as a high quality programme which attempts to provide a bridge back into education and a training system for long term unemployed.  The Labour Party is committed to ensuring that the VTOS maintains its reputation.</P>
    <P>Economic growth and success is, to a large extent, due to the availability of suitably qualified and adaptable personnel with the necessary personal and <Col N="1923" /> vocational skills.  This has been incorporated into the recently published White Paper on Education and it will continue to be the guiding principle of the Government and the Minister in our ongoing fight against unemployment in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Opposition parties should have realised when they were in Government the invaluable contribution education can play in the fight against long term unemployment &mdash; they controlled this country for a considerable period from 1987-92 when the real damage was done&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am disappointed there is not a greater interest in this debate. We have had some exciting times in the Chamber recently.  It has been described as a star Chamber because of various events when we have had a packed public gallery and a packed press gallery.  As we debate the fundamental issue of social justice and equality, there is a number of people in the public gallery but there is no great interest.  Perhaps this is because other things are happening in our capital city tonight.  It is a sad reflection on how the media treats issues of this nature.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support this motion and I am directly asking the Minister to change her mind on this issue.  We have heard much rhetoric from the Government about the need to protect and support the vulnerable, the marginalised and the less privileged in our society.  These objectives and policies would find widespread support without question across party lines in the House.  I would like to think that during our period in Government with the Labour Party we strived to achieve those objectives of equality wherever possible, across a wide range of Departments.  In the Department in which I worked much of our work was <Col N="1925" /> related to issues outside this country but equality was one of our objectives.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in her speech at the UN conference in Beijing, recently reaffirmed this principle in spelling out to the international community that education was the most fundamental of human rights.  She was right in saying that.  She told the world she was working on equal access to education in Ireland and she referred especially to the position of women and I support her strongly in doing that.  It was a great pity that she did not tell her audience in Beijing that she was cutting back on the only education programme run by her Department for the long term unemployed, namely the vocational training opportunities scheme.  She omitted to report to her audience, which consisted mainly of women, that at a time when education spending had increased by 25 per cent in the past two years she had singled out for blatant discrimination the participation of the long term unemployed, many of whom are women, in second chance education.</P>
    <P>The Minister's decision to cut £5 million from this scheme is nothing short of disgraceful and indicates the Government has turned its back on the long term unemployed.  The VTOS is the main second level adult education programme designed for people who are unemployed.  This Government cannot claim to have any sense of social justice or understanding of the plight of thousands of unemployed who have benefitted &mdash; and should continue to benefit &mdash; from this scheme.</P>
    <P>The link between educational qualifications and opportunities of getting a job are universally recognised.  A leaving certificate will not automatically get you work but it will provide the individual with some hope of doing so.  The VTOS scheme has proved to be a great success and in some cases where participants did not get work immediately they benefited greatly from the experience. This Government has no option but to rescind its decision to cut back on this very valuable scheme, otherwise it can <Col N="1926" /> never claim to represent the interests of the most vulnerable sectors of society.</P>
    <P>The Government's response to the motion tabled by my party colleague, Deputy Martin has been pathetic.  We heard the predictable reaction tonight which shows total disregard for the strong case made by many Deputies on this side of the House.  The Minister and her colleagues have stubbornly refused to budge and have reverted to the now predictable option of amending the motion, patting herself on the back and asking the House to agree that she is doing a great job.  The sad reality is that the Minister is not listening.  We have heard a great deal from this Government about the need to accommodate and to listen, the need to recognise the committee process and the need for openness and inclusiveness &mdash; fantastic jargon.  We are told that if Opposition Deputies come up with good ideas the Government will be glad to listen.  What we have heard is a simple rejection, which I deeply regret.  This is a very serious matter and in terms of the overall budget, it is not a huge demand on our part.  The Minister is not only ignoring our views, she is not listening to the representatives of the Irish National Organisation of the Unemployed, the INOU, and to <i>The Irish Times</i> journalist Fintan O'Toole who spoke of the Minister's action in the following terms:</P>
    <P>This is frankly a disgrace not just to the most left wing Government in the history of the State but to any Government.  Politicians are in Government to bring a sense of social values to bear on the often irrational machinery of bureaucracy.  That this has not happened in this case says a great deal about the corrosive effects of mass unemployment on those very social values by which a society brings order and reason to its decisions.</P>
    <P>Fintan O'Toole certainly made his point very succinctly and I ask the Minister to take note of that and not to fudge the issue.  I am asking her to agree to the Fianna Fáil motion tonight, it will not be seen as a climb down if she does <Col N="1927" /> so but a response to the Private Members' motion tabled in the public interest.  If the Minister does not decide to change her mind I appeal to the backbenchers &mdash; though sadly from what I have heard tonight we would not have much hope in that area &mdash; to voice their views.  I appeal especially to Labour Party and Democratic Left Members who claim to represent left wing politics to convince the Minister that she should agree.  Deputy Kemmy, among others who have problems with their conscience, raises his head when there is a whiff of scandal &mdash; the Lowry affair is another example &mdash; and issues an ultimatum. Mr. Charlie Bird from RTE gets his soundbite.  We hear such comments so I will be watching carefully and waiting to hear what the Minister has to say or to Government backbenchers saying they will reserve their position.  When it comes to the unemployed there are no ultimatums and Charlie Bird can twiddle his thumbs on the plinth because no backbencher from this cosy arrangement will put his head on the line on behalf of a vulnerable sector. Sadly, the unemployed do not count when it comes to taking an honourable stance on a vital national issue.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to do the honourable thing and support this motion.  I now ask for the opportunity to share my time with Deputies Killeen and Power.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>It is clear that the Minister has a commitment to the VTOS and she announced her intention to provide an extra 1,000 places this year.  I was surprised at some of the previous speakers who claimed credit for the doubling of places from 1992-94 but apparently they <Col N="1928" /> have forgotten that the Fianna Fáil Party was party to that Government and supportive of the Minister's wish and intent to increase the number of places. If there is a problem about the number of places it clearly is not with Fianna Fáil, it is either with her own colleague, the Minister for Finance or with the new partners in Government, Fine Gael or Democratic Left.  As my colleagues said, this scheme has been enormously successful, its need is substantial and proven and it is a scheme with the potential to deliver enormous benefits.</P>
    <P>The whole role of education has changed very substantially and the way people look on education has changed and developed.  This particular scheme has given unemployed people an opportunity not only to return to full-time education and improve their job prospects but also a sense of personal worth and achievement.  It is a scheme which clearly has the support of the people at whom it is directed, the unemployed.  It suits them for a number of reasons and they clearly see that it benefits them. Surely this is the type of scheme which any Government and this Government in particular with its claimed commitments should look at and seek to develop.</P>
    <P>The loss of the 1,000 additional places is of considerable significance but perhaps of even greater significance is the message being sent out by the refusal to provide these places.  It is clearly being read by the Irish National Organisation of the Unemployed as a negative message directed at them.  It is telling them that this scheme is dispensible because it caters for the unemployed.  I do not believe that we can stand over that. Politicians of all hues stand sufficiently indicated for their failure to address the problems of the unemployed without coming up with a scheme that provides in some sense a solution for a certain number and then deciding to jettison it. That is a message which no Government ought to give out and get away with it.</P>
    <P>The Minister could still persuade her colleagues to allow the places she promised to be filled.  I believe that is her <Col N="1929" /> wish and she has an opportunity tonight to vote for the Fianna Fáil motion and allow these places to be filled during this year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>The vocational training opportunities scheme is one of the great success stories in education.  Success cannot be measured in numbers, but in this case the numbers tell their own story.  In 1989, 247 people took part in the scheme.  That number increased to almost 2,900 in 1993, and last year the figure was 4,600.  The Minister recognised the obvious increase in demand for the scheme and promised to provide 1,000 additional places in the 1995-96 academic year.</P>
      <P>People who have participated in these schemes can vouch for their worth. Many of those people were unemployed, suffered from low self-esteem and an inferiority complex and had little hope for the future, but the vocational training opportunities scheme has changed their lives in a positive way.  It has given them new confidence, and the proof is there for all to see.  In the majority of cases the participants subsequently took up further activities, some going on to further education and others going straight into employment.</P>
      <P>Study after study has demonstrated the direct relationship between lack of educational qualifications and the chance of being unemployed.  The VTOS was an investment in people, giving them a second chance of obtaining an education.  This is about people, not figures.  This scheme was needed, and it was working, but the Minister has cut funding by £5 million.  That decision is incredible and I cannot understand how a Minister could have taken it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Minister first took office, we were all told about her involvement in education and her great understanding of the disadvantaged.  Although I do not doubt her understanding, she certainly does not give the impression that she is willing to take the necessary action.  Here is a Minister who promises free third level education while at the same time telling the unemployed that <Col N="1930" /> there are not sufficient funds to fulfil the promises she made to them.  The Minister should recognise her responsibilities, but she seems to have her own agenda and to be playing to her own sector.  I am surprised that Fine Gael colleagues tolerated her antics.  They should know better.</P>
    <P>We read in Democratic Left newsletters how annoyed their members are about this measure and that their Deputies will do their best to have the decision reversed.  If the Democratic Left Deputies really want to change the decision they have an opportunity to do so by supporting the Fianna Fáil motion.  Henry Ford put wheels under America, but the wheels changed many of the Democratic Left policies.</P>
    <P>The Government has spent a fortune analysing the problem of unemployment. The vocational training opportunities scheme was one of the few programmes to make a real impact in this area.  I call on the Minister, therefore, to reverse her decision and show that she does not want to be remembered as the Minister for elite education, which is how she is perceived.  I realise that in Government tough decisions have to be made and that it is important for a Cabinet to stand united.  However, I question the Government's priorities.  The unemployed have been neglected by the system for a great many years.  Thousands of them were prepared to enrol on VTOS courses and many found doing so very worthwhile.  We were getting real value for money.  The decision to reduce funding by £5 million is despicable.</P>
    <P>Last night my colleague, Deputy Martin, spoke about the manner in which this cutback was relayed to the chief executive officers of the vocational education committees, with the Minister advising them to deal confidentially with the matter.  When we make popular decisions we love to have press conferences and razzmatazz, but we hate to have to give bad news.  It says much about the Government and its opinion of chief executive officers when such conniving goes on that it expects them to treat their boards in that fashion.  We on <Col N="1931" /> this side of the House have made a strong case for the retention of places on the scheme, as have a number of organisations around the country.  I hope the Minister listens to our call.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy to support Deputy Martin's motion.  Had Deputy Martin not tabled this motion this week, I would have tabled it next week because this matter should be debated. Perhaps it is because of the match being played this evening, or perhaps it is just lack of interest generally, but I am sorry that this debate does not seem to have generated the amount of interest it warrants. I am glad the spokepersons were reported in the media today because it is important that people should be aware what is going on.</P>
      <P>The action taken by the Minister to reverse the decision to offer 1,000 additional VTOS places is extraordinary, particularly considering the view expressed in the section on further education in chapter IV of the White Paper on Education.  At the beginning of that chapter it is stated that there is a need to ensure the future development of vocational education and training, most of which is under the aegis of the Department of Education, takes place in a more cohesive and systematic manner and in a way which is responsive to the needs of students and society.  The Minister has turned that on its head. Practically everything we have heard from the Minister underlines the need for an approach such as that outlined in the White Paper.  This makes her actions in this regard much more difficult to understand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has been operating a policy of stepping in and stepping out again in regard to education.  Her original decision to curtail the promised 450 additional places in the Youthreach scheme was rescinded, thanks to the political and public outcry.  The same uncertainty was evident regarding the child care assistant scheme.  Originally 100 new posts were approved, but it was decided to limit the increase to 70. <Col N="1932" /> Then, thanks to pressure on the Minister, she changed her mind and sanctioned the 100 posts.  The result is wholesale confusion.  One has to wonder who is making the decisions and on what basis.  What about people who were told first that they had and then that they had not a post?  Even as I speak legal cases are pending in relation to this.  If the Minister is causing such confusion in a relatively minor part of education policy and management, how can we have confidence in her overall management and policy?</P>
    <P>Regarding management &mdash; perhaps I should say mismanagement &mdash; why were the chief executive officers of every vocational education committee only informed on 23 August of this year of the reduction in the number of places, and why were they told this matter was to be worked on confidentially?  Why were they not informed until that late stage?  What kind of planning by the vocational education committees would allow their expectations to be dashed? This is an extraordinary and inefficient way to manage education policy.</P>
    <P>I often referred to the success, of which I am sure the Minister is aware, of the VTOS in the Dún Laoghaire constituency. A total of 240 VTOS places were sanctioned for that area this year but, unfortunately, because of the cutback, only 180 could be offered.  I am sure many people believe Dún Laoghaire is a relatively prosperous area but in large parts of it the unemployment level has reached 87 per cent and many unemployed people are long term unemployed.  There is an air of deprivation and hopelessness in many parts of my constituency.  I assure Deputy Brian Fitzgerald that the extra places would have been taken up.  The scheme offers an incredible range of subjects and training and has been an enormous success.</P>
    <P>The so-called Government of renewal document states that the vocational training opportunities scheme will be expanded from its current level.  That is part of the stated policy agreement <Col N="1933" /> between the three parties in Government who are now reneging on it.  It is incredible that at a time of increasing unemployment such a sensible programme is not being given the additional 1,000 places promised by the Minister for Education in the wake of the budget.  That does not make sense.</P>
    <P>The success and achievements of the vocational training opportunities scheme are widely recognised in the White Paper on Education and Members on all sides acknowledge that. In its evaluation of the Community Support Framework from 1989 to 1993, the Economic and Social Research Institute described the scheme as a high quality programme which attempts to build a bridge to allow the long term unemployed back into the education and training system.  That was further confirmed by the 1993 NESC's Report on Education and Training Policies for Economic and Social Development.  We are not talking about anecdotel evidence from our constituents and the long term unemployed who were given hope under the scheme.  The evidence is well documented by the Department and many other organisations.  It is no wonder, therefore, that organisations such as the INOU and the Irish Trade Union Trust are outraged at the Minister's about-face on this issue.  Using strong language the INOU stated last night:</P>
    <P>The cuts on the VTOS programme present a blatant attack on unemployed people.  The cuts also highlight the fact that the Minister for Education is not interested in providing an escape for unemployed people from long term unemployment and poverty.  When members of the Dáil vote on the motion to reverse the cuts tomorrow evening, it is important that parties like Democratic Left whose representatives have openly and rightly condemned these cuts, actually nail their colours to the mast in opposition to these cuts.</P>
    <P>That is straight talking by members of that organisation who today stated:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1934" /> Members of the Coalition Government are preaching in favour of ending the jobs crisis but, in practice, they are voting and acting in favour of a pro-unemployment society.  Before entering into Government, Democratic Left, Fine Gael and Labour outlined their commitment to tackling unemployment.  The real test of this commitment will take place in the Dáil tonight when politicians vote on whether or not to reverse the cuts on the Vocational Training Opportunities Scheme.</P>
    <P>The INOU is putting it up to those who claim to be the protectors of the unemployed and to be the ones who want to reverse trends.  It is putting it up to Members to vote in favour of the motion before us and against the Minister's backclapping amendment.  The Irish Trade Union Trust also voiced its opposition to the attack on education opportunities for unemployed people. The stong words of such groups underpin the absolute rage felt by those working directly with the unemployed, especially the long term unemployed. They are aware of the psychological effect on those who do not get a place on the scheme, their helplessness and hopelessness.</P>
    <P>The cutbacks will further alienate people, frustrate their efforts and force them to remain on the dole.  We need to maximise the return on our educational resources.  Why not, therefore, invest in what has proven to be a successful scheme, in other words, invest in people?  This scheme is arguably one of the most cost effective ways of getting a qualification.  We are engaged in human &ldquo;set aside&rdquo; at a time when the number unemployed stands at almost 350,000.  It is extraordinary that the Minister intends to embark on a huge bureaucratic transformation of our schools and universities, the cost of which is as yet unknown but must be enormous.  She will not publish the costings produced by the Department of Finance.  If she did, we could make considered judgments on her proposals.  The cost of <Col N="1935" /> many of the Minister's proposals to control education rather than on education, will make the savings under the VTOS look like loose change.</P>
    <P>The Minister should get her priorities right.  I criticised her on a previous occasion for prioritising free fees at third level at a time when we do not have genuine free education at primary level and when it is necessary for parents to hold cake sales to help with the running of schools.  The Minister should reverse her decision on this important scheme.</P>

      <P>I welcome this opportunity to contribute to the debate on the vocational training opportunities scheme and on the wider issue of catering for the disadvantaged, particularly disadvantaged adults.</P>
      <P>The Government is committed to the VTOS and the evidence of the Minister's commitment to it has already been recorded in the debate.  I again place on record the fact that the numbers participating in the VTOS have doubled in the last two years, from 2,000 in 1992 to more than 4,000 this year and that is an incontrovertible fact.  This is clear evidence that the scheme is held in high regard by the Government and its policy is to continue, as resources permit, not only to develop the scheme but to improve it in terms of support to participants.</P>
      <P>There was a reference last night to the evaluation report on VTOS carried out on behalf of the Department by Work Research Co-operative &mdash; a firm of social and economic consultants. There is no question, as suggested last night, of &ldquo;suppressing&rdquo; this report.  As indicated, the question of its publication is being considered, but that is not the important issue.  What is important is that the findings of the report and its recommendations are carefully considered, taken on board and put into effect according as the VTOS is developed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1936" /> As the Minister said, the recommendations of the report include such things as pre-VTOS provision, guidance and counselling, training for those working in the area of adult education and certification. All these aspects will form part of the planning process aimed at improving the effectiveness of the scheme.  In this way the evaluation report will form, and is forming, an important aspect of policy input in relation to the VTOS.</P>
    <P>I again remind the House that the vocational training opportunities scheme is but one measure in the Government's policy of combating disadvantage among adults.  There was a reference to the adult literacy and community education scheme which was designed to provide basic literacy and educational skills for adults who either did not acquire them at school or subsequently lost them.  This scheme operated by the vocational education committees has been operating for some ten years, but has received a major boost by the Government through a doubling of the financial provision for it from £1 million previously to £2 million in 1995.</P>
    <P>The scheme, as the title suggests, involves two strands &mdash; one of community education and the other relating to literacy.  The community education aspects involve some important courses, such as parenting, personal development and life skills and health studies. The literacy programme also involves aspects of numeracy.</P>
    <P>A striking feature of the adult literacy and community education programme is the involvement of women.  Figures produced recently suggest that women outnumber men on the programme to a considerable degree, particularly on the community education aspect of it.</P>
    <P>The White Paper on Education proposes that an important consideration in developing policy on adult education will be the recognition of the central importance of adult education for personal development, updating knowledge and skills and overcoming disadvantage suffered during initial education.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1937" /> The White Paper provides that a policy priority in the area of adult education will be to ensure that suitable and effective programmes are in place for those with literacy and numeracy problems. This is not a pious platitude.  The Government's commitment to this scheme, a most important one in helping disadvantaged adults, is borne out by the doubling of the funds available for it this year.</P>
    <P>I now wish to deal with some of the issues raised during the debate.  There was a reference to ESF funding in respect of the VTOS.  The position is that ESF funding will support expenditure of £13 million on the scheme.  At 75 per cent, this will leave the ESF contribution at £9.75 million.  That is the extent of ESF funding and any sum in excess of that amount will have to be and is being found from the Exchequer. I have already dealt with the question of the publication of the WRC report.</P>
    <P>Several Deputies referred to the VTOS course in metal sculpture which was planned to be held in the North Strand vocational college.  It was stated by Deputy Haughey last night that during the summer, applications were made, interviews were organised and places offered for the course.  The Deputy read a few letters from his constituents. Let me now say what I understand the position to be.</P>
    <P>Discussions concerning this course between the VTOS centre and the City of Dublin vocational education committee are continuing.  These are in the context of the centre not having filled the 80 places allocated to it.  Only 67 have been filled to date.  The vocational education committee will not be allocating additional places until these are filled.</P>
    <P>The opportunity is there to provide the metal sculpture course instead of another group if the centre wishes, that is, within the 80 places available.  I understand, too, that the vocational education committee considers it will be able to find a way of providing for the course if there is sufficient demand for it but there may well be a question mark over this.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1938" /> There are two other matters to which I wish to refer.  In relation to the Youthreach programme, there was some public agitation based on inaccurate reports that it was proposed to make cutbacks but there was never any intention to cut back on the scheme.  Therefore, the question of restoring the cuts did not arise.  There was a reference to child care assistants.  The intention was to increase the number of such assistants by 70 from a base of 129, an increase of 54 per cent.  The Minister, however, succeeded in having the number increased by 100, bringing the total to 229.</P>
    <P>In the whole area of combating disadvantage the Government can stand proudly behind its record and will continue to discriminate positively in favour of the disadvantaged at every available opportunity.</P>

      <P>As someone very much involved in the introduction of the educational opportunities scheme some years ago, I am glad to have this opportunity to contribute to the debate on the VTOS.  I would like to clear up one matter. When my party left office at the end of last year there were approximately 4,000 participants on the scheme.  The Minister mentioned the figures of 2,000 and 4,000, but this has only confused the issue, even for her own backbenchers.</P>
      <P>There were between 5,500 and 6,000 participants on the educational opportunities scheme.  These figures, however, included the number of participants, approximately 2,000, on the third level allowance scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My party is calling on the Government to reverse its decision to reduce the number of participants on the VTOS during 1995-96 from 5,000 to 4,000.  This is a mean and retrograde step as 900 long term unemployed people and 100 lone parents &mdash; it was <Col N="1939" /> agreed that lone parents should account for 10 per cent of participants on the scheme &mdash; will have their hopes dashed as they strive to re-enter the workplace. It is only when one sees the scheme in operation that one realises just how effective it has been.</P>
    <P>On 23 August the vocational education committees were informed by fax that, because of the Government's decision to curtail public expenditure, the number of places on the VTOS was to be reduced by 1,000 or 20 per cent. This was a blow to a group of people in a most vulnerable position and least able to represent themselves.  It was a blow especially for Dublin where almost half the participants on the scheme live.</P>
    <P>Colaiste Íde in Finglas has been particularly successful.  I am surprised that the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa, who is aware of its success did not make his presence felt and exert his influence in the interests of helping the long term unemployed whom he claims to represent.  It should be remembered, however, that he granted old age pensioners and others an increase of only 2.5 per cent this year, which was extraordinary.</P>
    <P>The educational opportunities scheme was introduced because studies showed that the long term unemployed lacked the necessary training and educational qualifications in their search for a job.  The best thing to do was to provide them with an opportunity to undergo training.</P>
    <P>There has been a tremendous response to the VTOS which has proved most successful.  I deny what Deputy Crowley said as the long term unemployed are seeking opportunities to re-enter the workplace, and they are successful. Since its introduction more than 5,000 people have completed the scheme and that is encouraging.  A few years ago no one would have believed that almost 2,000 people would participate in third level education.  The Minister picked the most vulnerable section of society when making the cutback which will result in a net saving of £2.5 <Col N="1940" /> million.  I asked where was the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa and the Tánaiste, Deputy Spring, when the unemployed needed them.  Will Democratic Left and the Labour Party go through the lobby and support this unkind 20 per cent cut which is a cruel blow to the unemployed?</P>
    <P>I call on the Minister to reverse this disgraceful and cowardly decision and support Deputy Martin's amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Mr. Browne (Wexford) Mr. Browne (Wexford)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Wexford):</i> The Minister's decision to decrease by 1,000 the number of places under VTOS is a disgrace and an insult to the long term unemployed.  Every report over the last five years has shown that early school leavers who lack educational qualifications have little chance of getting a job.  The VTOS is the essence of second chance education.  It is highly recommended for those who wish to secure an educational qualification.  The success of the courses speak for themselves.  In 1989, some 250 people participated in the courses and this increased to 4,000 in 1994.  In County Wexford, 200 people participated in ten courses.  If the 20 per cent cut is implemented the number of places will decrease by 40.  That is a disgrace in a country with one of the highest unemployment rates.  Many people who attended the courses sat the junior certificate and leaving certificate examinations. This year three people will attend regional colleges and others are participating in City and Guild courses.</P>
      <P>Why is the Minister targeting the most disadvantaged in society?  It is unfortunate at a time when the Minister introduced a reduction in fees for the sons and daughters of millionaire and well heeled parents that she is abandoning the unemployed.  Where is the voice of Democratic Left?  Last year Deputy De Rossa and others were vocal on behalf of the long term unemployed and they are given recognition for that. However, when they got the ministerial perks such as a car they abandoned the less well off and went silently to ground on this debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Minister to reconsider her <Col N="1941" /> decision.  We are talking about a net saving of £2.5 million.  It is a small amount in the context of her Department's budget but it is an important amount to the long term unemployed who want to participate in second chance education. They want to better themselves and secure a job.  Unfortunately if they do not have an educational qualification their chances of gaining employment are practically nil.  The Minister should stand up and be counted on behalf of the less well off in society and not allow the Fine Gael-dominated Government to spoon feed the rich at the expense of the unemployed and the poor.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am profoundly disappointed that the Minister for Education and the Government have not made any meaningful response to this well meaning and constructive motion designed to reverse the cutback and provide the extra 1,000 places.  I am somewhat taken aback that Democratic Left did not contribute to the debate.  We can take that to mean a number of things.  Either it is a silent expression of that party's opposition to the cutback or the Deputies could not bring themselves to contribute to the debate without criticising and condemning the decision of the Minister for Education.  They did that in their party bulletin.  Yesterday their chairperson issued a statement to the effect that the decision should be reversed.  I have often taken silence to mean acquiescence. There is little point in them saying that they do not approve of this cutback and consider it to be shameful if they are not prepared to do something concrete &mdash; put their participation in Government on the line and vote against the decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Woods said that when he was Minister for Social Welfare he was involved in the initiation of the educational opportunities scheme and VTOS and when Deputy Ahern was Minister for Labour he was primarily responsible for introducing Youthreach. Long before the Minister for Education, Deputy Bhreathnach, came to office <Col N="1942" /> Fianna Fáil was committed to the disadvantaged and to schemes and programmes designed to help those who, for whatever reason, were alienated from the mainstream education system. Youthreach was introduced as an intervention programme for teenagers and VTOS was developed to help the long term unemployed return to education and ultimately to employment and, in the process, restore their self-confidence and self-esteem.  I am extremely disappointed that the Minister did not respond to the motion.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gregory quoted alarming statistics and spoke eloquently about the number of people who could benefit from this scheme.  Democratic Left and the Government could have chosen other options.  In a full year £35 million will be realised from the abolition of tax covenants.  The Minister for Education has that resource at her disposal.  She tried to fudge and play games by saying it was put against undergraduate fees.  It did not all have to be used that way.  The Minister said she is saving £2.5 million net by going ahead with the cutback. That is not much money in the context of the £35 million that will be spent on the free education proposal.</P>
    <P>Major funding is being advanced for the construction of a third level college in Dún Laoghaire.  If one reads the steering committee's report it is clear that the area of greatest educational need is North Dublin.  There is no dispute about that but having a Minister in your constituency overrides the studies and research carried out in the compilation of that report.  I have been inundated with faxes from various unemployment centres expressing support for the motion and frustration at the fact that the Minister is not listening and that no concerted effort was made by the other parties in Government, particularly Democratic Left, to try to force a change and reverse the decision.  It is extraordinary that Democratic Left did not contribute either tonight or last night.</P>

      <P>I take that as a rather weak expression of disapproval.  It is not good enough and that is how it will be seen outside the House.  Deputy Currie's comment on the WRC consultant's report is insulting.  He denied the report was suppressed.  It was on the Minister's desk in February 1994 and its publication is still being considered.  If the Government wishes to be open, transparent and facilitate Opposition Deputies who want to contribute to the education debate, why should that report not be made available?  Why should it not be published so that all the people involved in the provision of VTOS can have access to those courses?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remind the Minister that Fianna Fáil was in power with her until last December and played an active role in <Col N="1944" /> securing additional resources for Ireland during the negotiations on the Maastricht Treaty and the extra money from the Structural Funds which has made many of these schemes possible, as the Minister outlined yesterday.  It also played an active role in the negotiations which led to the publication of the national plan and the allocation of resources on a continuing basis for an increase in the number of places on VTOS.</P>
    <P>I commend the motion to the House and I appeal to Deputies on the Government side, particularly those in the Democratic Left party, to vote in accordance with their consciences on this matter and follow their public philosophy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for selecting this topic for debate tonight and the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy O'Shea, for coming in to respond.  The issue which I raise is the application of food hygiene regulations to small indigenous industries in the food sector.  I appeal to the Minister to put in place without delay a set of modern food hygiene regulations which will take account of the initiatives, enterprise and innovation of small food producers in contemporary Ireland.  Many such producers are being pushed out of business by the application of the Irish regulations of <Col N="1949" /> 1950 or the fear of impending regulations based on a more up-to-date EU Directive on the matter.</P>
      <P>Two weeks ago an enterprising Cork woman was taken to court and fined a hefty sum with costs.  Her crime was that she sold scones baked in her family kitchen in her shop.  Three months ago a family of cheese makers from Leap near Skibbereen in west Cork closed down their thriving stall in the English Market in Cork city.  The reason they gave for so doing was their fear that impending food hygiene regulations would be of such severity as to put them out of business. Their handmade cheeses were among the most sought after by discerning restaurateurs and shoppers in Cork city and its environs.  Indeed, the availability of this specialised type of food product is part of the overall appeal and success of good Irish restaurants and their appeal to the home markets and the tourist trade.</P>
      <P>Clearly, these developments give rise to grave concern and ironically, they are beginning at a time when substantial amounts of taxpayers' money is being spent through Leader programmes and county enterprise boards in an effort to generate economic activity and create jobs in the regions.</P>
      <P>The Minister must admit a conflict is developing here between regulations on the one hand and State approved incentives on the other.  All right minded people will admit that if we kill off the spirit and skill of small food producers who want to make cheeses or breads, sell ungraded eggs or home made jams in the local shops, we are sounding the death knell of rural Ireland.  Moreover, we are doing inestimable damage to our tourist industry and killing off the charm, variety and distinctive vitality of different regions throughout the country. It is interesting to note the manner in which the French can nurture and promote different wines in different regions of their country.  Why cannot we strive to promote different food products in different regions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Minister apply his energies <Col N="1950" /> and good sense to putting in place a set of regulations that will on the one hand meet acceptable health protection criteria and on the other, not inhibit a burgeoning native job creating industry?</P>

      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this important issue and for giving me the opportunity of responding to this question.</P>
      <P>All premises used for the manufacture or preparation of food for sale to the public are required to be registered with the local health board under the Food Hygiene Regulations, 1950-89. Such premises must meet the standards specified in the regulations before they can be registered.  The primary objective of registration is to ensure that food which is sold to the public or is offered or kept for sale is fit for human consumption.</P>
      <P>I know there has been a significant growth in the number of small scale food enterprises in recent years, many of them being family owned.  I also know that those charged with enforcing the food hygiene regulations share my view that such enterprises should be encouraged where possible.  However, the obligation to protect public health must always be paramount.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that in a recent case which came before the courts, the health board in question sought to achieve a balance between the need to encourage enterprise and to protect public health and it acted reasonably in the matter.</P>
      <P>The food hygiene regulations are currently being revised to facilitate the implementation of an EU directive in this area.  The opportunity presented by this review will be taken to consider the special needs of small enterprises.  I would, however, like to emphasise that I will seek to ensure the new directive does not impose any additional burdens on small scale food enterprises.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, a Cheann <Col N="1951" /> Comhairle, for allowing me to raise this matter on the Adjournment and I also thank the Minister for coming here to deal with this issue, which is a matter of serious concern.</P>
      <P>There has been a deterioration in road conditions as a result of the exceptionally hot weather during the summer; the hottest on record.  There is an increased risk of death and injury on our roads because of that deterioration. The problem is not confined to one county and involves a number of stretches of road.  The last recorded figures show that 103 people were killed in July and August of this year on our roads.  Only 60 people were killed in 1994.  Has any research been done into these accidents and those that have occurred since to see how many occurred on these stretches of road?</P>
      <P>There are accidents occurring on these stretches of road where the surface is as smooth as the top of a table as a result of the damage caused by the heat.  The tar used for roads here is designed for a cold climate.  Because of the exceptionally hot weather, the tar came to the surface and the normal road grip disappeared.</P>
      <P>There is a problem with a number of sections of our national primary, regional and county roads.  After a long dry spell, a road can be dangerous when it rains.  Although temperatures have become cooler, these sections of road will cause problems when it rains and the cars will aquaplane much easier than they would normally.  The problem will also be aggravated by frost, assuming we get some &mdash; it is seldom that we do not have frost in Cavan and Monaghan in winter &mdash; and will lead to further accidents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The solution is to surface dress the roads but we accept that this is not practical at this time of year and that it might not be money well spent.  People will be exposed to danger this winter. There are a number of solutions.  One is to put down a tarmacadam overlay.  In his reply yesterday, the Minister referred to planning or overlaying the <Col N="1952" /> road surface with a bitumen bound material and gritting.  Warning the people would also be necessary.  Will funding be provided as a matter of urgency so that tarmacadam overlay, salting and gritting can take place to ensure our roads are made safer?  Will the Minister warn the people of the dangers posed by these sections of road this year by setting up a national programme, perhaps through the National Safety Council or through his Department, as well as encouraging the local authorities to warn the people?  They are unaware of this great danger.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Howlin) Brendan Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy O'Hanlon for raising what is an important subject. Through this debate, we might alert people to the dangers he outlined. While we have all enjoyed the exceptional summer weather, the unusually high temperatures have caused some problems on our roads.  The surface temperatures experienced were considerably higher than those normally associated with Irish summers.  This resulted in the softening of the road binders which, in certain areas, caused the &ldquo;fatting up&rdquo; of the binder and the embedment of the chippings; in effect, the chippings sink below the surface with which vehicle wheels come in contact. As a result, there can be a loss of skid resistance and a need for action by the road authority.  The solutions naturally depend on the extent of the problems and may include gritting, surface dressing, planning or overlaying the surface with a bitumen bound material.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a result of the special circumstances which occurred this year, the National Roads Authority &mdash; which has responsibility for the strategic management of the national roads programme &mdash; is initiating a scrim survey of as much as possible of the network of national roads and the output will assist in determining the 1996 surface dressing programme.  The authority normally surveys the entire national primary network annually and national secondary roads on a three year cycle.  The results <Col N="1953" /> are conveyed to the local authorities who still carry direct responsibility for maintenance works.</P>
    <P>Road safety is of paramount importance and every effort must continue to be made to ensure that we all travel on safe road surfaces.  However, it is a matter for the individual local authorities to decide how best to address specific local problems and to determine and implement appropriate remedial action in the circumstances of each case.</P>
    <P>With regard to the road accident statistics mentioned by the Deputy which, following six months of continuing downward pattern, increased during July and August, I have asked the Garda authorities and my Department to carry out what analysis they can to determine the cause of that unfortunate and unwelcome increase.</P>
    <P>Funding for carrying out maintenance works of all kinds on non-national roads is provided by local authorities from their own resources and is heavily supplemented by grants paid by my Department. The Deputy will be aware that I have provided record State funding this year for non-national roads.  This amounts to almost £123 million, which exceeds by almost 15 per cent the previous highest total.</P>
    <P>Last July I announced that the Government had approved my proposals for a major ten year restoration programme for regional and county roads and I provided an additional £20 million for an immediate resurfacing programme to implement the initial phase of that programme.  Qualifying works were to include surface dressing and overlaying existing road pavements with bound or unbound materials.  All the indications are that this additional money is being spent productively and well by local authorities and over 1500k of road will benefit from the expenditure involved.  This progress is a significant step towards improving the non-national road network.  It will result in real benefits to local communities across the country and, I sincerely hope, in greater road safety.</P>
    <P>Of the £20 million extra provided last <Col N="1954" /> July, £3 million was set aside for maintenance works.  The provision would also be of special relevance in considering the problems with which the Deputy is concerned.  I hope to announce further details of the restoration programme later this year, including the arrangements for the administration and supervision of the programme.</P>
    <P>The Deputy and the House can rest assured that this Government is firmly committed to bringing the condition of regional and county roads up to a satisfactory and safe standard, dealing not only with the problems caused by this year's exceptionally fine summer but also with the serious backlog of improvement work which faced us on assuming office.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the Ceann Comhairle's giving me the opportunity to raise this important matter on the Adjournment.  I also thank the Minister for dealing with it tonight.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Garda on seizing the dogs in question, I assume as a result of a tip-off from a member of the public. If that is so, I applaud the person or persons who took the trouble to report the matter.  The catalogue of injuries to three of the dogs was truly horrific. There were severe injuries to the lower jaw and inside the mouths.  The dogs' faces were torn as a result of the activities in which they were involved.  Eyes were severly damaged and some of them were almost gouged out.  If the Garda had not seized the dogs they would still be enduring great suffering. Indeed, the Dublin Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals has become involved and, regrettably, has had to put down three of the dogs because of the horrific nature of their injuries.  The DSPCA has also indicated that the other three dogs will also probably have to be put down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the Wildlife Act, 1976, badger baiting is illegal but it appears that a significant number of people travel <Col N="1955" /> between the United Kingdom and this country to participate in what appears to be badger baiting and dog fighting events.  This is the opinion of people who are involved in studying the problem of cruelty to animals.  John Bryant, the wildlife officer of the British League Against Cruel Sports, says that many of the people who engage in these activities and who travel between the two countries are known to the authorities. If that is so, what are we doing about it? It is right and proper that known soccer hooligans are being targeted by the UK authorities and, as a result of the recent terrible events in Lansdowne Road, by ourselves.  These hooligans are being excluded from this country in the interest of public safety.  The same policy should be applied to those people who, according to the Garda and others who understand the problem of illegal badger baiting and dog fighting, are travelling between the UK and this country.  We should exclude them.</P>
    <P>There is also a customs and excise aspect to this issue.  Were the dogs imported?  If so, at what point did they enter?  How were they brought in?  Are people free to move animals which have been bred to be highly dangerous between countries?</P>
    <P>The most sickening aspect of this event was the sight of the three men involved running from our courts, free to continue their desperate activities. Why were they not rearrested and questioned at length to obtain information on where the activities that led to the dogs' serious injuries took place? We can safely say that these badger baiting and dog fighting events were organised in this country.  I do not understand why further efforts were not made by the Garda on the collapse of the case, to tackle the issue and not let the men simply run free from the court and go to the harbours to leave the country.</P>
    <P>Were the UK authorities contacted or will they be contacted?  We have the alleged names and addresses of the three men concerned.  Are they known <Col N="1956" /> to the UK authorities?  Have they been charged in the UK?  If not, does the Minister for Justice intend to take the matter up with her counterpart in the United Kingdom in order to bring these people, who have committed atrocities in this country, to justice?  What is being done to seek out those currently engaged in these cruel practices?  People on this side of the water organised the events that led to the dogs' horrific injuries.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned a number of important issues.  Many people were deeply upset by the photographs of the injuries to these unfortunate dogs.  They were also deeply upset by the pictures of men running free from our courts to engage in these activities again, possibly here and certainly in the United Kingdom.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen) Nora Owen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Flood for raising this issue.  Like everyone else I regard what happened to the animals concerned as a deplorable act of cruelty.  Given the way the Deputy put down the matter, my answer will deal essentially with the collapse of the court case.  I will contact him later on the issue of badger baiting. I have also asked for a full report on the background to this case.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that on 9 October last the Garda, acting on information received, searched a United Kingdom registered vehicle at Dublin Port and found seven dogs housed in wooden boxes on the floor of the car.  They also found equipment which is usually associated with the practice commonly referred to as badger baiting.  When questioned about the condition of the dogs the three men in the vehicle gave conflicting answers. I wish to pay tribute to the Dublin Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals for taking over the task of looking after the dogs, some of which had to be put down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The three men were arrested under the Protection of Animals Act, 1965, and held in custody in the Bridewell Garda Station.  They appeared before <Col N="1957" /> Dublin District Court No. 4 on 10 October and evidence of arrest, charge and caution was given by the arresting garda.  When making the charge under the Protection of Animals Act, 1965, the gardaí were unable to specify the location of the cruelty but they knew, from the condition of the animals, that the injuries arose from activity elsewhere. The three men gave conflicting answers and no information as to where the cruelty might have taken place.  On hearing legal submissions from the solicitors for the men the presiding judge agreed with the arguments made by the defence on the grounds that he was not entirely satisfied with the charges preferred in that they did not adequately describe the location where the alleged offences took place.  I understand that the judge stated that as far as he was concerned the cruelty could have been in another jurisdiction.  The arresting garda argued that the charges were adequate in substance and urged the judge to exercise his power of amendment to read that the alleged offences occurred within the State if he was not satisfied.  However, he refused the garda's application and struck out the case.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy will appreciate, the courts are independent in the exercise of their functions and, accordingly, it is not open to me to make any further comment on the matter.  As to why the Garda did not immediately rearrest the men, I will forward that information to the Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I applaud the initiative of the students of Queen's University, Belfast, in taking a case against the Government and the Law Society to ensure parity of esteem with students of southern universities. However, I view with disbelief and dismay the position in which the students have been put as a result of the failure of the High Court to afford them any remedy, the court having found that the <Col N="1958" /> Government was in breach of European law.  The Government has now placed southern graduates in an extremely difficult position.  It was the Law Society which applied to the court to strike down the entire exemption regime which applied to southern graduates.  It is time for the Government to take on the Law Society, unless it is running the Government, which may be closer to the truth than the Minister for Justice or the Taoiseach would like to admit.</P>
      <P>At a time when we are seeking peace and reconciliation on this island the failure of the Government to act in this matter is deplorable and serves only to insult northern Unionists and Nationalists alike.  The Government stands accused by its behaviour in this matter of displaying a separatist mentality. Southern universities are also concerned at the Government's obduracy. When the previous Minister for Justice, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, was requested to look into this matter she ordered the Law Society to carry out a full review of the application of the Belfast students.  The review was not undertaken and the Minister for Justice must account for her failure to act in this matter.  I deplore the decision of the Government to apply for costs against the Belfast students, effectively punishing them for daring to assert their rights under European law by successfully challenging the legality of Government legislation.</P>
      <P>I agree with the leader of the Ulster Unionist Party, Mr. David Trimble, MP, who has described the actions of the Government in this matter as absurd and ridiculous.  There is deep disappointment in Northern Ireland at the way in which the people there and their university have been victimised by the Government.  There is also deep disappointment in southern universities at the way in which their degrees are being devalued by the Government.  I understand an appeal has been lodged by the students of Queen's University, Belfast and that it will be heard by the Supreme Court on 12 December next.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very important to put on record <Col N="1959" /> that the students of Queen's University, Belfast, strenuously argued before the High Court that the appropriate course for it to take was to declare, as it found, that the students were victims of wrongful discrimination and were entitled to equal treatment with graduates from universities in the South.  It was the contention of the Incorporated Law Society of Ireland that if there was wrongful discrimination then the only course open to the High Court was to disenfranchise the graduates of universities of the Irish Republic by striking down the entire exemption regime.  Counsel for the students strenuously argued in the High Court that knocking down the entire exemption regime would be grossly unfair and would do a wrong to the people of the South and that the purpose of the Law Society in insisting that the court should do this, if it found that the students were victims of wrongful discrimination, was to destroy the entire exemption regime.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs Owen Mrs Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to Deputy O'Donoghue for giving me the opportunity to comment on this matter.  My comments will be brief because the matter is under appeal and it also concerns the rights of other persons who are not entitled to state their views in this House.</P>
      <P>The position is that students of Queen's University Belfast, took an action in the High Court against the Law Society of Ireland and the Attorney General arising from certain regulations made by the Law Society under the provisions of the Solicitors' Acts.  These regulations relate to exemptions for certain law graduates from the Law Society's entrance examination to its law school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that the plaintiffs were seeking a declaration that law graduates at Queen's University Belfast were entitled to similar exemptions from the society's entrance examination as those enjoyed by certain law graduates in the <Col N="1960" /> State, that the society was guilty of wrongful discrimination as regards Queen's University, Belfast, law graduates and damages against the Law Society.  The High Court did not grant any of these reliefs.  However, if effectively toppled the society's exemptions regime.</P>
    <P>I would point out that the State's role in the action was limited.  The principal defendant was the Law Society and the regulations in question were made by the society under its statutory powers. The Minister for Justice was not a defendant in the action.  The legal advice to defend the action against the State was given by the Attorney General. I understand that there were compelling legal reasons for giving that advice, not least that the constitutionality of a statutory instrument was being impugned.  In accordance with the instructions of the Attorney General I understand that Counsel for the State indicated at the commencement of the hearing that the State would not dispute any matters of substance not involving the State and that these were entirely a matter between the principal parties, that is the plaintiffs and the Law Society.  The advice given was vindicated by the fact that the plaintiffs dropped two of their three claims against the State.</P>
    <P>I have been informed that the students appealed the decision of the High Court not to grant any of the reliefs sought by them and that the appeal is due to be heard by the Supreme Court on 12 December next. In all the circumstances I do not consider that it would be appropriate to comment any further on the matter pending the outcome of the court proceedings. The Law Society is examining the impact and import of the High Court decision in the case taken mainly by plaintiffs from Queen's University against it.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.30 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 12 October 1995.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 27, 64, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 128 and 147 together: The Irish Government made submissions to the EU Commission on the extension of the disadvantaged areas and the reclassification of certain areas from less severely to more severely handicapped area status in November 1993 and October 1994 respectively.  The Commission asked for clarification of some aspects of the submissions and for some additional information to assist in its examination of the proposals, and our response was transmitted to the Commission on 14 April 1995.  A number of meetings have since taken place at offical level to discuss various aspects of these proposals.</P>
      <P>The current situation is that the Commission services have completed their analysis on the reclassification dossier and expect to make a proposal on this to the Agricultural Structures and Rural Development (STAR) Committee in the near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Commission services have raised a number of technical issues concerning the extension dossier.  These issues have been the subject of detailed discussions between officials from my Department and the Commission.  Arising from these discussions, some further work needs to be done, both within my Department and in the Commission services, before a formal proposal is made to the Commission for approval of a list of areas for disadvantaged status.  On approval by the Commission, the list will be submitted to the European Parliament and the <Col N="1810" /> Council of Ministers.  I have had a number of meetings with Commissioner Fischler at which I stressed the urgency of a decision, and he has assured me of his desire to reach a decision on this dossier as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>As discussions with the EU Commission on the proposals are still ongoing, I cannot comment on the inclusion or otherwise of specific areas in either of the submissions.  When final approval has been received from the Commission, a complete list of new and reclassified areas will be published. Given that the current proposed extension is the fifth review of disadvantaged areas, it is not considered that proposals for further extensions could be credibly put forward to the Commission or indeed financed within the Structural Funds allocations which have been fixed for the period in 1999.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 31, 54 and 146 together. A review of the scheme for the control of farm pollution has been completed. The results of this were announced by me on 6 September last.  Following this review adequate financing is now being made available, over the next few years, for payments to be made in respect of all 18,500 applications received under the scheme.</P>
      <P>The new funding arrangements involve the use of the overall inflator under the operational programme, an internal transfer of some funds from another element of the operational programme and the bringing forward of substantial funds, already available in the operational programme, into 1996 and 1997 from later years.  This will result in the funds previously earmarked for the scheme, in those two years, being increased from about £20 million to £60 million.</P>
      <P>In addition and with a view to speeding up the processing of applications new procedures are being introduced. Under these each applicant is being given up to six months to submit detailed drawings of the proposed developments together with a list of existing farm facilities or, where appropriate, local authority planning approval.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards works to be completed the <Col N="1812" /> position under the scheme is that applicants are advised in writing at the date of approval of the specification of works to be completed.  Where an applicant completes less work than that approved the grant is based on the cost of the completed work provided this is of approved standard.  Where the works completed exceed those provided for in the approval grant payment remains as provided for in the approval.</P>
    <P>Where an applicant has a change of circumstances, such as those arising from the purchase of additional lands or additional quota, and where the applicant requests, in writing, a change in the approved investment before work commences, my Department is prepared to examine and, where appropriate, amend the approval and specifications to take this change into account.  In these circumstances the applicant will be advised in writing of the changes to the initial approval.</P>
    <P>The applications received up to December 1994 have now been processed in nearly every county.  Every effort is being made to have the applications in these counties cleared and then move to applications received in January 1995.</P>
    <P>I have set out on the tables which I am circulating the statistical information requested by the Deputies.</P>

      <P>The procedures in relation to payment of cattle and sheep headage and premia payments to the next of kin of farmers who die are as follows: (1) If a solicitor informs my Department that only one person is the beneficiary of the deceased farmer's will, then that person will be paid any outstanding headage or premia claimed by the deceased farmer and can claim and be paid headage and premia in the future pending the taking out of probate on the will.  (2) The same procedure is applied where the deceased farmer has died without making a will and where a solicitor informs my Department that only one person is a beneficiary of his or her estate in Irish law.  (3) Where the deceased farmer leaves the holding to more than one beneficiary or dies intestate and where the solicitor involved tells my Department that a number of persons are beneficiaries of the deceased person's estate, my Department will pay outstanding headage or premia jointly to all those beneficiaries or to any one beneficiary provided all the beneficiaries consent to the nomination of that one person as the payee. Likewise, all the beneficiaries or one person nominated by them all can claim and be paid headage and premia in the future.  (4) In disputed cases where executors of wills, usually solicitors, name to my Department the beneficiaries who, in their opinion, are entitled to receive the headage and premia payments, my Department pays any premia or headage claimed by the deceased farmers or by the persons nominated by the executors as the successors of such deceased farmers to those named persons. Such payment, however, is subject to the executors indemnifying my Department against any possible claims from any other possible beneficiaries.</P>

      <Quest>the reason a fine of £18,457 million pounds imposed on Ireland in respect of alleged malpractice in beef tendering procedures was imposed on the State rather than on the traders concerned; whether his Department in any way, facilitated the breaches of procedure that led to this substantial disallowance; if he will explain the breaches of procedure that are alleged by the Commission to have taken place; if there was any reduction in the penalty after the final conclusions of the Conciliation Body became available; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates)</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposed disallowance is based on the EU Commission's view that the beef intervention tendering system was not properly implemented in Ireland in 1991 and 1992.  The Commission services take the view that the provision in the relevant EU regulation which prohibited the submission of several tenders by the same company for the sale of beef into intervention should have been interpreted so as to exclude tenders from companies which were linked commercially to other tenderers.</P>
      <P>My Department is satisfied that the manner in which the tendering procedure was operated was fully in accordance with the relevant EU regulations in force at the time.  It should be noted that these regulations were subsequently amended in 1993 to provide for the rejection of tenders from linked companies but this amendment cannot be applied retrospectively.  A number of member states applied these provisions in a similar manner and are facing disallowances on the same basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department submitted this matter to the EU Conciliation Body which has made its recommendation to the Commission.  However, the Commission services have informed my Department that, having considered the conclusions <Col N="1816" /> of the Conciliation Body on the issue, they cannot agree to reduce the penalty at this stage.  The issue &mdash; including the conclusions of the Conciliation Body which are confidential &mdash; has yet to be considered by the Commission itself and may not be finalised for some months.</P>

      <P>The position is that the Turkish authorities recently lifted restrictions on imports of Irish bovine meat and cattle.  The lifting of the restrictions, which had been pursued actively by my Department for some <Col N="1817" /> time, opened up an important new outlet for Irish producers.</P>
      <P>Discussions have been held with the Turkish authorities, in order to agree the necessary health certificates to accompany exports of meat and cattle. Health certificates have been agreed in respect of bovine beef (bone-in and deboned).  However, the details in regard to a health certificate for live cattle have not yet been finalised.  Discussions are continuing on that issue.</P>

      <P>The normal work practice at the meat plant concerned is that sheep slaughtered throughout the day must be loaded and exported outside normal working hours to meet export shipping deadlines.  An officer of my Department must be on hand to supervise such exports.  The officer concerned is not obliged to work overtime and does so on a voluntary basis.  The other officers of the plant are not prepared to work the same hours.  A charge of £5 per officer per hour worked is currently being levied on all plants engaged in overtime loading of sheepmeat.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 41 and 61 together. Statistics from the World Health Organisation indicate that there were a total of 198 human rabies cases in Europe between 1977-94, of which 20 occurred in the European Union.  In addition there were 8,812 confirmed cases of rabies in animals in Europe in 1994 alone of which 1,582 were in the European Union.</P>
      <P>I have no immediate plans to relax the strict quarantine laws at present in force for the importation of pet dogs and cats into Ireland from countries other than Great Britain, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man.  I am, however, keeping the position under regular review in consultation with the UK authorities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 43 and 46 together.  EU legislation provides the option for member states to change from a system of Regional (or National) Base Area to an Individual Base Area system.  Under the latter system IBAs would be allocated to farmers who produced eligible arable crops or who had land in set-aside during the base years 1989, 1990 and 1991.</P>
      <P>The introduction of an IBA system could not be undertaken without suitable amendments to the rules in particular to cater for those who were out of production in the base years or who commenced production in the meantime. These matters have already been brought to the attention of the EU Commission and my Department will shortly be discussing with them possible changes in the EU regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have raised with the EU Commission the difficulties which cereal producers in this country experience as a result of the declining availability of eligible land and the Commission will look <Col N="1822" /> at this in the context of the study of the arable system due to be carried out at the end of the year.  In the meantime I have introduced changes to the eligible land rule, to apply from 1995-96, under which a farmer will be able to transfer eligibility from eligible land to ineligible land within a holding.</P>
    <P>I should add that it is not my intention to introduce the IBA system unless the rules in regard to eligible land are relaxed or abandoned and there is a real risk of an overshoot of the national base area which would trigger penalties for producers under the existing National Base Area system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates)</NameTxt>
      <P>The arrangements for the import of lamb into the European Union are set out in the basic regulation governing the common market organisation for sheepmeat and various international agreements between the Union and its trading partners.</P>
      <P>New Zealand had traditionally a GATT right of unlimited access to the Community market subject to a 20 per cent rate of duty.  Under a long standing voluntary restraint arrangement New Zealand agreed to limit its exports to the Community market to specified quantities (e.g. 205,600 tonnes in 1994) in return for the waiving of the levy. This was in the interests of both parties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>New arrangements for the lamb imports from New Zealand have been <Col N="1823" /> fixed under the Uruguay Round for the period up to June 2000.  These give New Zealand access for 216,150 tonnes at zero levy.  Quantities above that level would attract a tariff fixed at 20 per cent plus 3,664 ecu per tonne for boneless frozen, which in normal circumstances would be prohibitive.  This agreement cannot be renegotiated at this stage. However, there is an informal agreement between New Zealand and the European Union under which New Zealand has undertaken to market chilled lamb in a manner which will not disturb the market in the European Union. They have also agreed to have annual consultations with the EU Commission.</P>
    <P>During my recent visit to New Zealand, I went to great lengths to ensure that the New Zealand authorities were made fully aware of the importance of the lamb export market for Ireland and the difficulties which imports of lamb from third countries posed for our processors and exporters.  I am satisfied that the New Zealand authorities are now better informed of our concerns and that they are fully committed to the orderly marketing of their lamb on the European Union Market.</P>

      <P>The basic rules governing the EU milk quota system including the level of national quotas assigned to each member state, are set <Col N="1824" /> out in EU regulations.  Individual member states must operate the quota system in accordance with these regulations.</P>
      <P>It was decided in a 1992 review of the regime that the existing quota system would apply until the year 2000.  There are no proposals at present for a fundamental review of the system, nor have any member states presented definitive views on the matter.</P>
      <P>An Irish Dairy Board-Teagasc study of a range of policy options in the dairy sector is currently under way.  I will obviously take the results of this study into account in assessing the correct approach for Ireland to adopt in any future debate on EU dairy policy.  I am, of course, in favour of the maximum flexibility being available to Irish producers, where it is profitable to do so, to exploit on export markets our comparative advantage in milk production.</P>

I refer the Deputies to the Government decision of 6 June which decided that with effect from 9 June 1995 there will be no recruitment to any additional <Col N="1827" /> posts paid for directly or indirectly out of public funds, unless specifically approved by the Government in advance.</P>
      <P>The staffing needs of Teagasc are at present the subject of ongoing discussions between that organisation, my Department and the Department of Finance with a view to the preparation of a memorandum for Government on the matter.</P>
      <P>I should mention that prior to the June decision 44 new permanent staff had been appointed to Teagasc as well as 28 temporary staff for work relating to REPS and in addition sanction has been given for the appointment of a number of extra staff on a self financing basis.</P>

      <P>Properly regulated <Col N="1828" /> field sports pursued in this country are part of the traditional fabric of rural life and have the support of a broad cross-section of people in rural communities. The welfare of the animals and the prevention of any unnecessary suffering and cruelty are an important factor and these aspects have given rise to some concern in recent years.  As a result certain safeguards have been applied to hare coursing and I am at present examining issues related to fox hunting.  Furthermore, the fine for cruelty under the Protection of Animals Acts, 1911 and 1965, has been increased to £1,000.</P>

      <P>A total of 2,500 <Col N="1830" /> farms are involved in pig production in 1995, compared with 68,000 in 1970, 25,000 in 1975 and 13,000 in 1980.  A figure of 1.3 million pigs were delivered for slaughtering at meat export plants up to the end of June 1995.  The figure for the full year in 1994 was 2.8 million.  Comparative figures for each full year 1970, 1975 and 1980 were 1.9 million, 1.4 million and 2.2 million respectively.  Separate statistics are not available for poultry farms.  In the year to August 1995 total poultry placings amounted to 38 million.  This compares with 20 million in 1970, 24 million in 1975 and 31 million in 1980.</P>
      <P>Pigmeat prices are satisfactory in contrast to the situation which prevailed at the end of last year.  The improvement in prices followed a number of measures which I took to assist the industry.  An Bord Bia earlier this year launched a programme for the promotion of pigmeat on the domestic and export markets. An important priority is to expand the export performance of the sector.</P>
      <P>In January of this year I launched the new development strategy for the poultry processing sector.  The strategy recognises the major challenges facing the Irish industry from increased imports in the context of the liberalisation of markets.</P>
      <P>The pig and poultry sectors are highly integrated and major consolidation has taken place at farm level.  The further development of pig and poultry farming depends on improving efficiency at production level and on having a competitive processing sector.</P>

It is, of <Col N="1831" /> course, absolutely necessary that this trade takes place in accordance with strict animal welfare guidelines and also the EU rules on export refunds are fully observed.  I, therefore, introduced new animal transport legislation in April 1995 setting down strict standards in regard to loading and unloading of animals, stocking density levels, feeding and watering, use of trained and experienced personnel and other matters. Further detailed requirements regarding the shipment of cattle from Ireland are currently being prepared in line with expert advice and in consultation with the interests concerned.  I hope to be in a position to make an announcement on this matter in the very near future.</P>

      <P>Irrespective of the quality of the land involved, the use of agricultural land for forestry is a matter for the landowner in question.  In so far as privately-owned lands are concerned, 71 per cent of new planting is undertaken by farmers themselves.  This <Col N="1833" /> equates to almost 50 per cent of all new planting.</P>
      <P>In so far as afforestation by Coillte and other non-farmers is concerned, the constitutional rights of landowners to use and dispose of their private property as they see fit must be respected.  It must be assumed that where a farmer or other landowner sells land to a forestry company for afforestation purposes it is because this offers the most beneficial option.  Afforestation is subject to appropriate environmental controls which are at present being renewed.</P>
      <P>I would accept that from time to time local difficulties have arisen in relation to the afforestation of certain agricultural lands.  I am assured that, for its part Coillte Teoranta operates a policy of seeking to facilitate, wherever possible, local interests.</P>

      <P>Following inquiries by Dublin Corporation in March of this year, the Chief State Solicitor was requested to investigate the position in relation to the site referred to by the Deputy.  He confirmed that, following dissolution in 1989 of the company registered as owner, this site now vests in the Minister for Finance by virtue of section 28 (2) of the State Property Act, 1954. Under section 31 of that Act it is open to the Minister to waive his interest in this site.</P>
      <P>However, before initiating such action it is necessary to clarify whether or not the former directors of the company wish to avail of their right under section 311 (8) of the Companies Act, 1963, to petition the courts for restoration of the company to the Register of Companies.  If the company were to successfully make such an application, reinstatement would be retrospective to the date of dissolution and the involvement of the Minister for Finance in the matter would therefore be at an end.</P>
      <P>The Chief State Solicitor is currently in communication with the former directors of the company registered as owner in order to ascertain their intentions in this regard.  As soon as this point is clarified, the question of waiver in favour of Dublin Corporation can be pursued at an early date.</P>

      <P>The information requested in relation to the CSF and its operational programmes and sub-programmes is not compiled in this Department in the detail and format required by the Deputy; it is compiled at the level of the implementing Department.  Since a similar question has been put by the Deputy to each Department, the required information should be contained in the answers to those questions.</P>
      <P>The Department of Finance, however, has compiled aggregate data under CSF 1994-1999 in relation to the drawdown of funds.  Up to the end of September 1995 the total drawdown of funds under CSF 1994-1999 was £380.3 million; the forecast of receipts included in the 1995 budget under CSF 1994-1999 was £766.3 million.  The latest estimate of Exchequer matching funding for the CSF for 1995 is £226 million.</P>
      <P>Under CSF 1994-1999 the Department of Finance has responsibility for one operational programme i.e. the CSF Technical Assistance Programme.  Since this programme is still under discussion with the European Commission no funds have been drawn down this year. The net Exchequer matching funds for this programme in 1995 is £75,000.  This programme does not contain any sub-programmes.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I am advised that solicitors, <Col N="1840" /> and appointed personal representatives, can readily obtain information on the state of a deceased customer's balances from his or her bank.  Banks also variously provide an effective &ldquo;tracing&rdquo; service for solicitors or personal representatives seeking to establish whether or not accounts exist in the names of deceased persons, by means of which the whole of a bank's network may be checked.  As a general rule, branches endeavour to draw the attention of the next-of-kin to the existence of an account.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to inform the House that I have signed an Order bringing the following 44 sections of the Child Care Act into operation with effect from 31 October 1995: sections 4, 6 (3) and (4), 12 to 48, 68 and 70, and 75 to 78.</P>
      <P>Sections 12 to 48 constitute the whole of Parts III, IV, V and VI of the Act. These deal with the protection of children in emergencies, care proceedings and the powers and duties of health boards in relation to children in their care.</P>
      <P>The commencement of these key provisions will greatly strengthen the powers of the health boards and the gardaí to intervene quickly to protect children who are being abused or neglected.</P>
      <P>They will also provide the courts with a range of new options in proceedings involving children who are not receiving adequate care and protection, including the power to make supervision orders authorising health boards to monitor children in their own homes.</P>
      <P>I might mention that I have also signed three sets of new regulations governing the placement by health boards of children in foster care, residential care and with relatives.  These new regulations, which are required to give full effect to Part VI of the Act, will also come into force on 31 October next.  They require health boards to visit, supervise and review children in their care on a more systematic basis than before.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): The first-mentioned patient is on the waiting list for orthopaedic surgery since earlier this year. The hospital authorities are unable to give a precise admission date at this stage.  As you are aware, the scheduling of such admissions is a matter for the hospital consultant concerned and each case is assessed to determine medical priority.  Should the patient feel that his condition has deteriorated, he should return to his general practitioner who is in the best position to emphasise the urgency of his case directly to the consultant. The second-mentioned patient was scheduled for admission on 10 October 1995.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that, under the 1995 waiting list initiative, the Government has committed £8 million to continue the reduction in waiting times which was achieved under previous initiatives in 1993 and 1994.  Since the first initiative commenced in June 1993, overall in-patient waiting list figures have been reduced by over 40 per cent in the period to December 1994.  A target of 10,394 additional procedures, including 1,785 orthopaedic procedures has been set for 1995.</P>
      <P>The Adelaide Hospital was allocated £377,500 under the 1955 initiative to undertake an extra 240 orthopaedic procedures. It was also allocated an additional £350,000 in 1995 to facilitate the opening of extra beds in medicine and orthopaedic surgery.  The result of these measures will be to reduce overall waiting times for patients awaiting orthopaedic treatment in Dublin.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): As the Deputy will be aware the provision of services for drug misusers in Dublin is a matter for the Eastern Health Board in the first instance.  The board already has a satellite clinic in Ballyfermot which would provide a service including counselling for patients from the Cherry Orchard area.  A ten bed detoxification unit has also been opened at Cherry Orchard Hospital.</P>
      <P>The opening hours at the satellite clinic have recently been extended to provide methadone maintenance for patients on the waiting list.  I am aware, however, that a waiting list still exists for patients at the clinic and the Eastern Health Board is examining the options open to it with a view to further reducing this waiting list.  The resources necessary to expand the range of services available to drug misusers in the Dublin area have been made available to the board.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): EU structural funding is provided to my Department in respect of vocational training of people with disabilities. The measure is part of the ReIntegration of the Socially Excluded sub-Programme of the Human <Col N="1847" /> Resources Operational Programme. The 1995 allocation to people with disabilities under this sub-programme is £40.493 million which comprises £17.993 million ESF funding and £22.500 million Exchequer funding.</P>
      <P>The sub-programme &mdash; Measures to Improve the Quality of Training - under the Human Resources Operational Programme provides capital funding to support the development and improvement of vocational training centres for people with disabilities.  The 1995 allocation in respect of this element of the programme is £4.2 million of which £2.8 million is European Regional Development Funds and £1.4 million Exchequer funding.</P>
      <P>No funding has been provided by the private sector, although voluntary agencies providing vocational training to people with disabilities would devote a portion of fundraising income towards their training activities.</P>
      <P>It is expected that there will be a full draw down of funds in 1995 under both elements of the programme.  In addition, in order to ensure that there is no reduction in overall vocational training services to people with disabilities as a result of a reduction in ESF funding under the operational programme, my Department made available a further £5.171 million Exchequer funding in 1995 for vocational training of people with disabilities outside the operational programme.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 81 and 82 together. The procedure for the reporting of suspected cases of child sexual abuse to the health boards is set out in the guidelines issued by my Department in 1987. These guidelines have been extensively circulated to all relevant agencies, both statutory and non-statutory, involved in the area of child welfare.  I am satisfied that the existence of these guidelines is widely known to those who are likely to be professionally concerned with all forms of child abuse and neglect.</P>
      <P>Earlier this year, I launched a booklet containing a new procedure for the notification of suspected cases of child abuse between health boards and the Garda Síochána.  This document amends the 1987 guidelines in relation to the circumstances in which the health boards and the gardaí are to notify one another of such cases and in relation to the consultations that should take place following a notification.  Some 20,000 copies of the booklet have to date been circulated to health services personnel and members of the Garda Síochána.</P>
      <P>The new notification procedure is in line with a recommendation of the report of the Kilkenny Incest Investigation. It also gives effect, on an administrative basis, to another recommendation of that report relating to mandatory reporting &mdash; in so far as health board personnel and gardaí are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I explained to the House on the Adjournment last Wednesday, 4 October, child sexual abuse is one of the most serious crimes that can be committed and every citizen who has reason to believe or suspect that such a crime has been committed should have no hesitation in reporting the matter to the gardaí.  I am actively considering whether specific provisions are needed <Col N="1850" /> to ensure that cases of child sexual abuse are brought to the attention of the appropriate authorities.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): I propose to take Questions Nos. 83 and 84 together.  There is a commitment in the policy document, <i>A Government of Renewal,</i> to bring forward a programme to replace existing incinerators for the disposal of clinical and hospital waste with new non-incineration technologies.  My Department proposes to implement this commitment by arranging for tenders to be invited from specialist waste disposal contractors for the provision of a collection and non-incineration disposal service.  The tendering process will be in accordance with the EU tendering procedures for public procurement.  Consultations with the health agencies are continuing and contract documentation is in course of preparation.</P>
      <P>There are several alternative technologies to incineration available and others are being developed.  In essence they each consist of a shredding operation followed or preceded by the application of heat to achieve disinfection. The heat may be applied by means of steam, microwaves, or dry heat.</P>

      <P>As the Minister for Health explained to the House on 25 May last in reply to the previous parliamentary question regarding this case, the chief executive officer of the Western Health Board has appointed an independent team to report to him on that board's involvement with the child and her family.  The publication of the report is accordingly a matter for the Western Health Board, in consultation with its legal advisers.  I understand that the inquiry team has completed its deliberations and that its report is being finalised.</P>

      <P>My Department has had a Health Promotion Unit since 1988.  The unit has a dual remit:</P>
      <P>a policy formulation function within the Department concerned with strategic planning, priority setting, research and evaluation and the development of a multi-sectoral approach to health issues at national and local level;</P>
      <P>an executive function concerned with the development and implementation of national and local health promotion programmes independent or in conjunction with statutory and non-statutory agencies.</P>
      <P>The Unit has built up an important liaison with health boards and non-statutory agencies in the course of its work. The Health Promotion Strategy, which I launched last July, contains a commitment to the establishment of a National Consultative Committee on Health Promotion. I will chair the committee which I intend to convene shortly.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): As the Deputy will be aware the provision of services for drug misusers in Dublin is a matter for the Eastern Health Board in the first instance.  The majority of drug misusers reside in the Eastern Health Board, which is engaged in expanding its range of treatment services in order to cope with the demand for these services. Funding has been allocated to the board to allow for this expansion.</P>
      <P>At present methadone maintenance is provided to drug misusers through satellite clinics at Baggot Street, Amiens Street and Ballyfermot and also at the Drug Treatment Centre, Pearse Street. The Eastern Health Board is in the process of establishing a further three treatment centres in Dublin and preparations are at an advanced stage.  Staff are currently being recruited and it is hoped to have these clinics up and running soon.</P>
      <P>In light of these developments the board will be keeping the situation under continuous review to ensure that it is in a position to respond to needs as they emerge.</P>

      <P>The Garda authorities are responsible for the detailed allocation of Garda manpower to individual areas.  They have informed me that the present opening hours of Killybegs station are 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. daily.  When the station is unmanned a direct communication facility linked to Ballyshannon Garda station comes into operation.  A &ldquo;call forwarding&rdquo; system is also in operation at Killybegs station where telephone calls to Killybegs station outside the opening hours are automatically put through to Ballyshannon station.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the current manpower strength of Killybegs is one sergeant and <Col N="1871" /> four gardaí and this has been the position for the past number of years.  There is a patrol car allocated to the station and both foot and mobile patrols are carried out in the locality into the early hours of the morning.  These patrols are augmented as required by the gardaí at Donegal station which is open on a 24 hour basis.</P>
    <P>I am also informed by the Garda authorities that provisional crime figures for the first eight months of this year show a significant downward trend in the Killybegs Sub-District when compared to crimes reported in 1994.  The Garda authorities also point out that the difficulty with extending the opening times of any Garda station is that it would absorb manpower on indoor administrative tasks which could be employed to better advantage on outdoor patrol and crime duties.</P>
    <P>I understand from the Garda authorities that they have no plans at present to extend the opening hours of Killybegs Garda station.  The Garda authorities report that they are satisfied that the current policing arrangements are adequate to meet the needs of the area but the position will be kept under review.</P>

      <P>Kilmainham sub-district covers an area of approximately four square kilometres which extends from Dolphins Barn to the top of Bluebell/Kylemore Road and from the River Liffey to the Grand Canal.  The population of the sub-district is estimated to be in the region of 24,000.  This figure is based on the most recent census figures and also takes account of subsequent building development in the locality.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities who are responsible for the detailed deployment of Garda manpower to individual areas that the current strength at Kilmainham Station is 80 members.  There are two patrol cars and a motor cycle allocated to the station.  The Kilmainham area is regularly patrolled by both foot and mobile units from the local station.  These patrols are augmented as required by mobile units from the District Headquarters at Kevin Street.</P>
      <P>I would also refer the Deputy to my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 105 of 5 October 1995 in the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Proinsias De Rossa)</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter was raised by the Deputy by way of priority question last Wednesday and was the subject of a full debate at that time.</P>
      <P>I have used every opportunity to influence our German and United Kingdom counterparts to progress the fourth EU Poverty Programme, both directly at meetings of the Council of Social Affairs Ministers' meetings which I have attended, and indirectly through the Commission both on my own part and through my officials.  Nothing has been left undone that could reasonably have been done by the Irish Government to advance this issue.  Both I and my officials have been to the forefront in the last year in pressing for agreement on a fourth EU Proverty Programme. At the Social Affairs Council in June, I forcefully stated the Irish Government's position in this matter, a position I again restated at the meeting of Social Affairs Ministers in Luxembourg last week.  At that meeting I put forward a specific proposal to break the log jam on advancing this matter which was supported by both the Spanish Presidency and a number of other countries, including some of the Nordic Countries.  As a result, the Commission have been asked to look again either at the current proposal or an alternative proposal which might find acceptance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The matter has also been pursued vigorously by the Taoiseach and his Department.  My own officials are in frequent contact with their counterparts in Germany and the United Kingdom, and indeed all other member countries, appraising them of the Irish Government's position and attempting to find a way forward.  I have recently appointed a permanent representative to the Irish <Col N="1877" /> delegation is Brussels to enhance our capacity to impact on the social affairs brief at European level.</P>
    <P>However, the crux of the matter is, that, under Article 235 the proposal for a fourth EU Poverty Programme requires unanimity and until such time as the German and United Kingdom Governments can be persuaded to support the proposal, or an alternative, it cannot go further.  Nonetheless, I will continue to avail of every opportunity, formal or otherwise, to ensure that social exclusion is kept as a central part of the agenda at European level.</P>

      <P>Persons in receipt of incomes from the United Kingdom by way of pensions or otherwise can experience either gains or losses depending on the ongoing exchange rates between sterling and the Irish pound.  Those in receipt of such pensions have experienced for some considerable time an improvement in income, as their pensions gained in value during the period when the Irish pound remained below parity with sterling. It is only in recent times that this advantage has been eroded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any person in receipt of a United Kingdom retirement pension whose means have changed as a result of the change in value of Sterling may be entitled to an old age non-contributory pension from my Department provided their means do not exceed IR£66 per week.  A United Kingdom pensioner who is already in receipt of an old age non-contributory pension and whose means have dropped as a result is entitled to request a review of his or her means assessment at any time.  In either case, if current unfavourable sterling/ <Col N="1878" /> punt exchange rates persist, these will be incorporated in an average exchange rate system used by my Department to assess means.</P>
    <P>People in receipt of United Kingdom pensions who are experiencing difficulty as a result of their income falling below the appropriate rate of supplementary welfare allowance for their family size should also contact the community welfare officer at their local health centre.</P>
    <P>Having regard to this I have no plans to introduce any scheme in relation to this matter.  Indeed it is not yet clear if the current exchange rates between sterling and the Irish punt are a temporary phenomena or are likely to continue in the medium to long term.  The matter in so far as it pertains to social welfare pensions is being kept under review.</P>

      <P>To date over 3,450 applicants have been approved for pension under the scheme.</P>
      <P>Expenditure in 1994 was £5.47 million and to date in 1995 is £19.03 million. Total expenditure will be about £100 million up to 1997 with additional funding available after that date.  Currently the average pension is £9,128 per annum.</P>
      <P>The farm retirement scheme is designed to contribute significantly to the general structural improvement of farms and at the same time help to maintain the rural population.  It will help redress the two main structural defects in Irish farming viz. farm size and the age profile of farmers.  So far over 3,500 young farmers have received land as a result of the scheme and many of these may also benefit from the scheme of installation aid for young farmers.  Of the farms released to date under the retirement scheme the average farm size was 31ha.  The average farm size created after participation in the scheme is 49.4ha.  This in itself is a significant agricultural reform.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 126 and 127 together.</P>
      <P>The appropriate response to the rise in the value of the Irish punt in relation to sterling is to improve competitiveness and to intensify marketing, both in the United Kingdom and in other markets. In this regard there is generous financial assistance available to the food industry under the Structural Fund food sub-programme.</P>
      <P>I am keeping under close review the resources provided under the appropriate headings of the food sub-programme to ensure that they are adequate for this purpose and, if necessary, and subject to the consent of the Minister for Finance, will consider augmenting these resources by transfers of resources from other headings within the Sub-Programme.</P>

    <P>Notes:</P>
    <P>(i)  European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Funds (EAGGF) are drawn down by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry and European Social Funds (ESF) are drawn down by the Department of Enterprise and Employment.</P>
    <P>(ii)  Drawdown of EU funds under Operational Programme is based on a system of advances and consequently EU funds received in any one year are not exactly related to the national and private expenditure which takes place in that year.</P>
    <P>(iii)  Payments are made by the Commission in ECUs and are related to the exchange rates in operation at the time payment is received.</P>
    <P>2.  Food Sub-Programme</P>
    <P>No funds will be drawn down in 1995 under this sub-programme as expenditure in 1995 will not have reached a sufficient level to warrant claiming funds beyond the advance already received in 1994.  The sub-programme was not approved until late 1994.</P>

      <P>To date in 1995 a total of 28 confirmed sheep scab outbreaks have been reported to my Department as compared with a total of 56 for the year 1994.  Since the abolition of compulsory sheep dipping there have been unverified reports of a rise in the incidence of sheep scab.  I have, accordingly, introduced a confidential phone-line service to assist with the reporting of suspected outbreaks.</P>
      <P>While the onus rests on individual flockowners to protect their sheep against scab, I have introduced a package of measures, following consultation with flockowner representatives, to highlight the need to control and eradicate the disease.  I shall keep the eradication programme under constant review.  It is important to note that sheep scab is still a notifiable disease and outbreaks must be dealt with by compulsory treatment of the affected and contiguous flocks until the outbreak is controlled.</P>

      <P>There is no doubt that one-year private leasing of land, particularly when it involves high prices, can be detrimental to the temporary leasing scheme operated at dairy-cooperative level.  It could also have adverse effects on the longer-term on-farm cost structure of the Irish dairy industry.  At the same time, the matter cannot, for legal reasons, be dealt with as the Deputy suggests.</P>
      <P>In order to restore better balance between the various mechanisms, I have introduced a measure which provides for the clawback of 10 per cent of the quota involved in all private leases entered into for a period of less than three years.  It does not apply to temporary leasing.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 139, 140 and 141 together.</P>
      <P>Under the Community Support Framework for Ireland, 1994-99, it was agreed that an independent evaluation of the compensatory allowances scheme would be carried out &ldquo;to examine the balance between income support and development measures with a view to ensuring that farming can become more self-reliant and integrated into the rural economy&rdquo;.  This evaluation was requested by the Commission as it felt that the share of funding being devoted to this scheme was very high &mdash; £642 million &mdash; as against a total of £1,122 million in the Operational Programme for Agriculture, Rural Development and Forestry as a whole.</P>
      <P>The consultant's report is currently under examination in my Department, prior to discussion with the farming organisations and the Commission.  It is not envisaged that the report would be published.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of whether the scheme has achieved its main objective <Col N="1902" /> of maintaining the population in the less-favoured areas, the consultant states that it is possible that the widespread rural population decline in the 1980s would have been even greater if compensatory payments had not been available.  He also points out that the scheme has made a significant contribution to increasing farmers' income levels and that this must have had the effect of at least slowing down the rate of decline in population.</P>
    <P>I understand that the horizontal study envisaged by the Commission across all member states has not got under way.</P>

      <P>Cowparks or cow-plots are administered under deeds of trust by trustees representing the local communities in which the cowparks are <Col N="1904" /> situated.  While the Land Commission has no general proposals to transfer such lands to local authorities it will, in situations where the lands are no longer used in accordance with the terms of the trust, dispose of those lands in accordance with the provisions of the Land Purchase Acts.  In such cases, the merits of transferring the land to the local authority will be considered.</P>
