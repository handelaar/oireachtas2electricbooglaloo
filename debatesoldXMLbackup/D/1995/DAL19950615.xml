      <P>The ICC and the ACC banks were set up under legislation. Based on the proposals that seem to be emanating from Government on the amalgamation in some form of these organisations and the sale of 75 per cent of TSB, when will the legislation be brought before the House?  Let me remind the Taoiseach that back in February he said proposals would be brought before the House immediately after Easter.</P>

      <P>I am glad the Deputy <Col N="1119" /> asked that question.  The reason the Bill is not being taken this week is that one of the Opposition parties indicated that it did not wish it to be taken this week. Perhaps the Deputy could consult whichever of the parties requested the deferment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Proinsias De Rossa)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Constitutional reform is one of the most important objectives this Government has set for itself during its term of office.  In addition, in our programme, <i>A Government of Renewal,</i> we clearly underlined the need for reform of the law and the practice of Government itself, including such issues as Cabinet confidentiality, the provisions relating to bail and reform of the Ministers and Secretaries Acts.</P>
      <P>The focus of this second Social Welfare Bill this year is the proposed holding of a referendum later this year to remove the constitutional ban on divorce. One of the key issues which arose during the last referendum campaign on divorce was the extent of public disquiet and uncertainty about the implications of divorce across a wide range of issues, including social welfare entitlements for spouses and children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government is determined to avoid a recurrence of that uncertainty. The programme, <i>A Government of</i><Col N="1123" /><i>Renewal</i>, commits us to the preparation of a detailed paper dealing with all the relevant issues and the putting in place of all necessary legislation.  This Bill seeks to achieve that in the social welfare area.  It is the latest in a series of legislative changes designed to provide clarity and security for families and individuals in the event of marriage breakdown. It is also a further indication of the Government's determination to place the fundamental human and social rights of all citizens at the top of its agenda of social reform.</P>
    <P>Specifically the purpose of this Bill is to provide for the necessary changes in the social welfare code so as to ensure that no one &mdash; either spouse or child &mdash; will be disadvantaged in terms of their social welfare entitlements, as a result of their legal status being changed from married, separated or deserted to divorced. In this regard, the main areas of the social welfare code where protection is being provided are: widow's and widower's pensions; lone parents and deserted wife's schemes; occupational injuries benefits; family income supplement and prisoners wife's allowance.</P>
    <P>I want to emphasise that what we are doing in this Bill is to guarantee no loss of rights under the social welfare system arising from a change in legal status from married, separated or deserted to divorced.  We are not conferring new or additional rights.</P>
    <P>The main elements of the Bill may be summarised as follows.  The contributory pension scheme for widows and widowers is being extended to enable a divorced person who has not remarried to qualify for pension on the death of their former spouse.  This means that on the death of a divorced person, his or her former spouse will be able to qualify for a contributory pension on either their own insurance record or that of the deceased even if the deceased has remarried.  Where the deceased had remarried, their second spouse may also qualify for a widow's/widower's pension. Under the present arrangements, a married person whose spouse dies as a <Col N="1124" /> result of an occupational accident or disease can qualify for a pension or a gratuity, depending on the circumstances, under the occupational injuries benefit scheme.  These benefits are being extended to the former spouse of a divorced person who has not remarried as well as to the existing spouse if the deceased has remarried.  A woman in receipt of deserted wife's benefit or deserted wife's allowance who becomes divorced may continue to be regarded as deserted for the purposes of the deserted wife's benefit and allowance schemes.</P>
    <P>A divorced parent caring for children will be recognised as a lone parent and may qualify for a lone parent's allowance. A woman receiving prisoner's wife's allowance who becomes divorced will continue to qualify for this allowance provided the other conditions continue. A divorced woman whose former husband is imprisoned may also qualify for the allowance.  A divorced person in employment who is supporting his or her former spouse and children may qualify for family income supplement if their pay is below the relevant income thresholds.  A divorced person supporting his or her former spouse may receive an adult dependant allowance in respect of them.  They may also receive an additional adult dependant allowance if remarried or cohabiting.</P>
    <P>The cost of the provisions in the Bill are minimal in the context of overall social welfare spending.  It is likely to rise to £1 million over the next five years.  Total spending on social welfare support to widows, widowers, lone parents and deserted wives at present is of the order of £630 million a year.  The additional cost, therefore, will have no appreciable impact on the public finances.</P>
    <P>During Question Time on Tuesday I was asked if I could indicate the cost which would arise over a ten year and longer period.  I pointed out that it would be impractical to indicate costs over a 30 year period but I undertook to indicate the cost in years ten when introducing this Bill.  The main element <Col N="1125" /> of cost relates to survivors' pensions. The costs of paying survivors' pensions to divorced people, who have not remarried, in year ten following the introduction of divorce have been estimated by the statistics unit of my Department at £2 million.</P>
    <P>The main sections in the Bill are those dealing with survivor's pension, section 3, deserted wife's benefit, section 4, and widow's (non-contributory) pension, section 5.</P>
    <P>Section 1 deals with the definitions used for the purposes of the Bill. Section 2 deals with death benefit which is a payment available under the occupational injuries benefit scheme to the dependants of a person who dies as a result of an accident at work or an occupational disease.  It includes payment of a widow's pension and a dependant widower's pension or gratuity.  The purpose of this section is to allow a divorced person qualify for death benefit when her former spouse dies as a result of an occupational accident or disease.  Under existing provisions, a widow who remarries or who cohabits with someone as a husband is not entitled to death benefit.  This section extends those provisions to widowers.</P>
    <P>Section 3 is central to the thrust of this Bill.  Its purpose is to ensure that a divorced person may qualify for survivor's pension on the death of his former spouse provided he has not remarried or is not cohabiting with someone as a husband.  In addition, this section extends to divorced persons a number of provisions relating to widows and deserted wives.  For example, it is not necessary for a widow or widower to satisfy the contribution conditions for entitlement to survivor's pension if the deceased spouse was entitled to an old age (contributory) pension or retirement pension which included an increase in respect of an adult dependant. Similarly, a woman in receipt of deserted wife's benefit is not required to satisfy the contribution conditions for survivor's pension on the death of her husband.  Both of those provisions are <Col N="1126" /> extended to divorced persons under section 3.</P>
    <P>Section 4 provides that a deserted wife who becomes divorced may continue to be regarded as a deserted wife for the purposes of the deserted wife's benefit scheme.  A similar provision in relation to deserted wife's allowance is included in section 6.</P>
    <P>Section 5 provides that a divorced woman who fails to qualify for survivor's pension on the death of her former husband may qualify for widow's (non-contributory) pension, provided that she has not remarried or is not cohabiting with someone as a wife and, of course, that she satisfies the other conditions such as means.  In addition, this section also provides that a divorced woman in receipt of deserted wife's allowance shall, on the death of her former husband, be entitled to receive a widow's (non-contributory) pension at the same rate as her deserted wife's allowance.</P>
    <P>A similar provision is included in section 7 in relation to prisoner's wives. A woman in receipt of prisoner's wife's allowance who becomes divorced may continue to be regarded as a prisoner's wife for the purposes of this scheme.  In addition, this section also enables a divorced woman whose former husband is imprisoned to qualify for prisoner's wife's allowance.</P>
    <P>Section 8 performs a similar function in respect of lone parents by ensuring that the definition of a lone parent for the purposes of the lone parent's allowance is extended to include a divorced parent.  This will give proper recognition in social welfare legislation to divorced parents.</P>
    <P>Section 9 extends the definition of a family for the purposes of the family income supplement scheme by including a former spouse where he or she is wholly or mainly maintained by the claimant.  The effect of this change is to enable a divorced person who is maintaining his or her former spouse and children qualify for family income supplement.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1127" /> Section 10 contains a number of changes to existing practices in relation to adult dependants, as follows: the definition of an adult dependant is being extended to include a divorced person, a similar extension is being made to the definition of a spouse in the old age pension scheme which is used to determine entitlement to an increase for a spouse, and provision is being made for regulatory powers under which a person may receive more than one increase in respect of an adult dependant and for determining the circumstances in which a person is or is not to be regarded as wholly or mainly maintaining another person.</P>
    <P>Section 11 contains the usual provisions relating to the short title and the construction of the Bill.  It also provides that the provisions of the Bill will be brought into force by way of a Commencement Order.</P>
    <P>The thrust of these legislative proposals is to ensure that neither divorced persons nor their children will be disadvantaged in terms of their social welfare entitlements.</P>
    <P>This required us to look critically at the level of additional protection that will be necessary following the introduction of divorce.  I am satisfied that we have approached it in a straightforward and comprehensive manner.  All the changes which require to be made in legislation are made in this Bill.  In order to give full effect to the `no loss' principle, it will be necessary to make some adjustments to the treatment benefits scheme and the free schemes to which many pensioners and others are entitled.  As these provisions are governed, respectively, by regulations and by administrative measures, the required adjustments do not involve changes in the primary legislation.  I intend to introduce them, as appropriate, at a later date.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, I am fully satisfied that this Bill represents a just, comprehensive and caring approach to securing the rights of all adults and children <Col N="1128" /> directly affected by marriage breakdown. I, therefore, have no hesitation in commending it to this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an important Bill which deserves close critical consideration. The preamble to the explanatory memorandum states:</P>
      <P>The Bill provides for the necessary changes in the Social Welfare Code so as to ensure that no spouse will be disadvantaged in terms of his or her social welfare entitlements as a result of his or her legal status being changed from married, separated or deserted to divorced.</P>
      <P>It is essential that the Bill provides for all the necessary and essential changes in the social welfare code and it is critical that it is as carefully, correctly, expertly and effectively constructed as possible.  As the Bill was constructed in the light of and will have fundamental implications for divorce it is no harm to consider Article 41 of the Constitution. I will quote sections of the Article which are relevant to the debate.</P>
      <P>Article 41.1. states:</P>
      <P>1º  The State recognises the Family as the natural primary and fundamental unit group of Society, and as a moral institution possessing inalienable and imprescriptible rights, antecedent and superior to all positive law.</P>
      <P>2º  The State, therefore, gurantees to protect the Family in its constitution and authority, as the necessary basis of social order and as indispensable to the welfare of the Nation and the State.</P>
      <P>Article 41.2. states:</P>
      <P>1º  In particular, the State recognises that by her life within the home, woman gives to the State a support without which the common good cannot be achieved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>2º  The State shall, therefore, endeavour to ensure that mothers <Col N="1129" /> shall not be obliged by economic necessity to engage in labour to the neglect of their duties in the home.</P>
    <P>While bearing these in mind, we must also bear two other words in mind &ldquo;divorce&rdquo; and &ldquo;reality&rdquo;.  Recent statistics show that 75,000 people are living with the tragedy of a broken marriage.  In the 1991 census, 55,000 people declared they were separated.  Judging by the rise in demand for judicial separations and the single person's allowance that number has increased by thousands.  It is obvious there is a growing need to deal with the many aspects and consequences of marriage breakdown.</P>
    <P>Marriage breakdown is a fact of life. More is involved than the issue of getting a divorce.  It necessitates the introduction of sensible and effective legislation relating to marriage, children, maintenance, legal aid and family courts.  We should aim to help people live their lives in dignity and without pointless financial and legal harassment. Above all else, we need to remove the sense of threat which, as we know from the last referendum, is very real.  People suffer enough stress and we should not add to it.  On the last occasion marital breakdown became a national issue a sense of threat prevailed. Families, married couples, separated people and women felt threatened and no doubt these feelings were passed on to children.  We should aim in the Bill to remove any sense of threat, be it perceived or real.</P>
    <P>Our national regard for marriage and the family as set out in the Constitution will help us in formulating a response which protects the vulnerable and does not punish people who suffered the trauma of irretrievable marriage breakdown. Marriage breakdown can be emotionally crippling and we must ensure that it is not financially crippling. On the last occasion people, having considered the practical effects of divorce, concluded it would be financially disadvantageous to them and voted against it. We must reassure those people on this occasion, without minimising the <Col N="1130" /> adverse effects of martial breakdown or sweeping aside unpalatable facts.  Marital breakdown is a growing problem which needs to be dealt with in a sympathetic way.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil Party will support the amendment of the Constitution to allow for remarriage.  It is determined to uphold in a positive way the primary role of the family in society.  It regards the protection of children and vulnerable spouses as particularly important. In other words, we want to give every assurance to the people left behind, so to speak, as a result of marital breakdown. All necessary outstanding legislation should be expedited and any constitutional challenges decided before the referendum.</P>
    <P>Our desire to deal with this matter in a correct, timely and considered manner has led us to establish a committee on family law and marriage breakdown under the chairmanship of Deputy Michael Woods, the Fianna Fáil spokesperson on equality and law reform.  This committee will have available to it all the expert legal advice necessary to ensure that the most comprehensive report possible is drawn up.</P>
    <P>As this Bill is part of the legislative process steering us towards the introduction of divorce it is essential that we give a considered and timely response to its contents and implications.  The vast majority of people who marry live together in a life long union.  However, a minority of people have their hopes and expectations of a permanent union dashed.  Marriages break down and couples separate.  Some of them arrange a legal separation by way of a separation agreement, others get a judicial separation, a number get divorced abroad &mdash; many of these divorces are not recongnised here &mdash; and a very small number get civil annulments.</P>
    <P>The breakdown of marriage brings with it painful emotional, psychological and financial problems, with both spouses having to make substantial changes in their style and standard of living.  Arrangements must also be made to look after any children.  Fianna Fáil <Col N="1131" /> supports the principle that the spouse and children left behind, so to speak, as a result of divorce are not disadvantaged or discriminated against in any way in terms of social welfare entitlements.</P>
    <P>While I totally accept the need to substantially amend social welfare legislation to cater for the possible enactment of divorce provisions, I am dismayed at the minimalist nature of the suggested amendments to the Social Welfare Act, 1993, and the poor quality of the Minister's homework on this vital matter.  The so-called explanatory memorandum throws very little light on the implications of the Bill and the Minister's press release on the day the Bill was published was an insult in terms of elucidation &mdash; it was plagiarised from the explanatory memorandum.</P>
    <P>If we are talking about clarity and security, we must let people know the precise implications of the Bill.  When I queried some matters during Question Time yesterday I was fobbed off by the Minister who said there was no such thing as an explanatory and financial memorandum.  That is not true.  I have with me the Maternity Protection Bill, 1994, and the Stillbirths Registration Bill, 1994, both of which have an explanatory and financial memorandum. Given that we are talking about clarity and security there should be an explanatory and financial memorandum to this Bill.  What is worse is that the Minister said in the House that there was no such thing as an explanatory and financial memorandum.</P>
    <P>I accept the need to substantially amend the 1993 Act but there are some odd and contradictory themes running through this Bill.  For example, the Bill deals with social welfare payments as if the recipients were still married.  Section 6 provides that a deserted wife who becomes divorced may continue to be regarded as a deserted wife for the purposes of the deserted wife's allowance. The same applies in the case of the deserted wife's benefit scheme.  Anomalies abound throughout the Bill which <Col N="1132" /> was obviously hastily cobbled together. While reference is made to deserted wife's benefit and lone parent's allowance there is no reference to unemployment or disability benefit.  It is significant that there is no reference in this Bill, which will have severe implications for children who will suffer the consequences of marital breakdown, to the status of the child.  Neither is there any reference to the costs of the payments provided for and the consequent implications for the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>The Minister has said in the media and the House that the cost will be £1 million over the first five years.  Today we were told the cost will be £2 million over the first decade.  This is not a true reflection of the cost of marital breakdown on the social welfare system.  I ask the Minister to tell us the real cost to the taxpayer over ten, 15 and 20 years. Have the provisions in the Bill been thoroughly costed?  People want assurances and there is little point in saying the cost will be £200,000 per year over the first five years and a similar amount over the next five years.  The introduction of divorce will undoubtedly exert a substantial influence on the socio-economic fabric of our society, with those already financially deprived most at risk.</P>
    <P>A plethora of problems come to mind.  For example, there is likely to be a substantial increase in the number of lone parents.  In many cases the State will have to provide extra housing.  The Minister tried to fob me off yesterday by saying that the Department of Social Welfare has no responsibility in regard to housing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>These allowances are paid by his Department and have to be taken into account.  The demand for the family income supplement will escalate and a sum of £200,000 per year will not be adequate to meet these increased demands.  A recent publication entitled <i>Divorce in Ireland</i>&mdash;<i>Who Should Bear the Cost</i> reminds us that successive Governments have been reluctant to admit that we share, in common with the rest of the western world, the phenomenon of rapidly changing family structures and the associated problem of widespread poverty among lone parents which has not been costed in this case. It signalled the dearth of research that went into this matter when we did not have a proper explanatory memorundum and a press release to go with the launch of the Bill.</P>
      <P>There is a grave responsibility on any Government implementing divorce facilities to ensure that the next consequence of its availability is not increased economic deprivation.  A minimal requirement for the Government, particularly for the Minister for Social Welfare, is to carry out the necessary preparatory analysis to identify the specific nature and extent of supplementary support which will be required to counter the economic side effects of divorce.  Regrettably and inexplicably this has not been done to date. The Minister has shown a consistent response to any form of criticism or highlighting shortcomings, he simply blames Fianna Fáil.  The fact that he is responding to comments on what are his policy decisions does not seem to matter.</P>

      <P>He blithely abandons all responsibility for decisions good, bad or indifferent, he just blames Fianna Fáil or his predecessor.  While that mode of behaviour might be understandable from the Opposition benches &mdash; where he did so to good effect for many years &mdash; it is totally unacceptable from a Minister holding the key portfolio in Government with responsibility for the people he is supposed to be looking after.  I strongly appeal to the Minister to seriously address the many vital social welfare issues requiring immediate attention.  In particular, he must comprehensively assess the wide-ranging socio-economic implications of the possible introduction of divorce legislation, many of these consequences will have direct relevance to his Department.</P>
      <P>In relation to the details of the Bill there are myriad ambiguities and the people need precise answers.  There is no point in holding a second referendum if people do not know what they are voting on.  In the Bill &ldquo;husband&rdquo; is defined a number of times.  The words &ldquo;family&rdquo;, &ldquo;spouse&rdquo; and &ldquo;couple&rdquo; get new definitions.  Is the definition of the family, as defined in the Constitution, to be amended by section 9 of the Bill, without a referendum?  Where will this redefinition end?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 7 outlines an absurd situation where a divorced woman whose former husband is in prison is entitled to apply for prisoner's wife's allowance.  In section 9 the definition of &ldquo;spouse&rdquo; not only means a man and woman living together as husband and wife but also means a party to a marriage that has been dissolved, an ex-spouse.  It is unclear from the Bill what rates of payment will operate.  People want to know precisely what rates will operate.  Will some lone parents, deserted wives and prisoners be treated differently from others?  Will the social welfare system categorise women into different groups of divorcees?  What will be the position of those who are separated and do not wish to be divorced?  How will they be categorised in the social welfare system? <Col N="1135" /> This potential group is not mentioned in the Bill.  Will they have to declare their relationships to receive benefit?</P>
    <P>The concept of dependency and its negative consequences for women not only persists in this Bill but is strengthened even when a woman is divorced. For the purposes of social welfare she is still classified as part of her husband's status.  Section 6 provides that a woman who has been deserted by her husband continues to be a deserted wife even where her marriage has been dissolved. Instead of moving to a position of individualised rights, this Bill is introducing the concept of derived rights whereby an ex-wife has an entitlement to an allowance as a result of her ex-husband's contributions.  For the past 70 years we have been trying to move away from that situation.</P>
    <P>Entitlements are discussed in this Bill as opposed to rights.  Entitlements are conditional in nature.  In this case they are dependent on a woman's relationship to a man and rather than payment being an individual right, awarded on the basis of need, running through this Bill is the concept of conditionality.  This is the weakest form of protection possible for women.</P>
    <P>The Social Welfare (No. 2) Bill highlights the short term approach taken towards social welfare.  Instead of adapting to present and possible new family structures it has made the position more complex and confusing.</P>
    <P>If both parties get divorced a number of times what will be the cost be to the Exchequer?  We are told it will be minimal &mdash; £1 million over five years and £2 million over ten years.  I believe it will be much more than that, for the reasons I outlined.  Will the taxpayer be willing to bear the brunt of these costs?  What constitutes cohabiting?  Does it mean staying a certain number of hours of staying overnight?  How will the Department monitor this?  Will guidelines be prepared in relation to it?  There is no mention of alimony.  The Minister appears to have forgotten his new plans with regard to a lone parent's allowance <Col N="1136" /> which was announced with great fanfare many months ago.  Are we witnessing the rainbow Government with its &ldquo;publicity over substance&rdquo; syndrome?  What happened to the plans to abolish means testing contained in his mid-February announcement regarding the new lone parent's allowance?  These are some of the questions and there are many more which need to be answered.  One relates to the issue of children's allowance. Which spouse will get it, in what circumstances and for how long?</P>
    <P>We must never lose sight of the fact that very often marital breakdown involves an adversarial relationship which could well cause problems, particularly when financial records need checking with respect to social welfare problems.  The question of availability and adequacy of counselling services needs to be addressed.  There is no reference in the Bill or in the explanatory memorandum to counselling.  Surely the provision of finance for counselling is an essential requirement.  Where there is an adversarial problem the woman may have to get free legal aid to ensure she is properly advised.  What will happen in the interim between a referendum and the granting of divorce after, say, five years?  We do not know from the Bill or the explanatory memorandum what transitional arrangements will apply. The people need to know what transitional conditions will apply.</P>
    <P>If, for example, a referendum is held and a five year waiting period for divorce applies, beneficiaries will not see any changes until the next century.  Will people have to claim supplementary welfare allowance in the meantime?  If this is the case it will reverse decades of progress in social welfare but we want to know.  The people will not vote for a pig in a poke.</P>
    <P>While reading through the Bill I kept at the back of my mind the Combat Poverty Agency report 1990 on the financial consequences of marital breakdown which highlighted the uncertainty of payment of family maintenance, <Col N="1137" /> despite a court order to do so.  This survey found that 60 per cent of maintenance awards by the court, in support of a spouse, were for amounts less than supplementary welfare allowance.  In a further 21 per cent of cases, the amount awarded was less than the maximum personal rate of deserted wife's benefit and in 20 per cent of cases only the wife was awarded more than she might receive if she qualified for the highest relevant social welfare payment.  In 6 per cent of cases no award was made. The Combat Poverty Agency report confirmed the experience in other countries, which have a similar modern code to ours in relation to family maintenance, that long term reliance on State support is the inevitable consequence for many couples who separate.  Has any thought been given to ensuring that delinquent spouses who leave vulnerable people behind are made to pay maintenance or will the taxpayer have to pick up the tab in all instances?</P>
    <P>In discussing the contents of and omissions from the Social Welfare (No. 2) Bill we must not forget that the Minister for Social Welfare has treated vulnerable people badly.  They have been granted an increase of 2.5 per cent only. Will those who are vulnerable following marital breakdown have confidence in a Minister who has betrayed and treated people so shabbily?  Despite all the bluster both inside and outside the House the truth has come out.  People are now being paid an extra £1.50 per week but the extra £9 they will receive as a result of the increase being paid six weeks earlier than normal will not carry them very far.  It is of consequence that the Minister was enlightened at his national conference and was forced to admit that the figure of 2.5 per cent was grossly inadequate.  He gave the same response to a parliamentary question yesterday.  I am pleased that it has now dawned on him that he has let these people down in an uncaring way.</P>
    <P>It is alarming that people will not be convinced, because of the failure to conduct any quality research in preparing the Bill, of how they will fare following <Col N="1138" /> marital breakdown.  They need reassurance. As I have said many times before, aspirations and sympathy are of no value to those in receipt of social welfare payments when they have to go to the credit union or a loan shark on a Thursday or Friday evening to obtain funds to see them through the weekend. They need a reasonable income to maintain a reasonable standard of living.</P>
    <P>This Bill has been badly researched. There is vagueness, ambiguity and omissions from each section.  We should ensure clarity and security before people are asked to make a considered decision in a referendum.  Social welfare recipients and those who are emotionally and financially drained following marital breakdown need the support of the entire community if they are to survive and be asked to make a momentous decision.  Their dependant children also need adequate support payments.</P>
    <P>Following the last referendum we know what such people will be demanding.  They are entitled to comprehensive answers to their questions.  I sincerely hope the questions I have raised will be answered.  I will be tabling a number of amendments on Committee Stage.  On the evidence to date, regrettably they will not receive the information or support to which they are entitled from the Minister and the rainbow Coalition.</P>

      <P>The battle lines are now being drawn for what promises to be yet another protracted, bitter and divisive debate on an amendment to the Constitution. As we address the issues that must be addressed in dealing with divorce legislation, certain facts must be acknowledged.  In common with every other western country, Ireland has seen a fundamental and, it would appear, permanent shift in the way family relationships are structured.  It is a sad fact but marriage breakdown occurs and we know the figures.  It is occurring more frequently and the fact that there is no legal provision for divorce has not had any effect on the trend.  The fact <Col N="1139" /> that Irish levels of marital breakdown have not yet reached the rates in other countries, notably the United Kingdom, has little to do with the absence of divorce and far more with the fact that Irish society remains more stable and cohesive than many other western countries. Irish people value the family and family relationships more than any other country in Europe, if not the western world.</P>
      <P>In the approaching debate it should never be forgotten that these values which place the family at the centre of Irish life are important and should be fostered and preserved.  There is no contradiction in valuing the family and being in favour of divorce.  While healthy families are at the heart of a healthy society, when a marriage breaks down people must be allowed to make arrangements in an ordered and dignified manner for the division of property and the care of children.  This has not received enough attention in the emotive debate on the divorce issue.</P>
      <P>If any society so wishes, it should afford people a second chance.  If it decides that separated people or those who wish to separate should have a second chance, they should have the opportunity to remarry.  The Progressive Democrats since their foundation&mdash; they were almost alone at the time&mdash; have favoured the introduction of divorce.</P>

      <P>Before the last referendum we campaigned vigorously for a positive outcome.  We support the Government in its wish to hold a referendum but this does not mean that we will stay silent or tie our hands if we believe it is going about something in the wrong way; we will not be led down a cul-de-sac just because we happen to agree to a referendum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While we have always favoured the introduction of divorce, we oppose the <Col N="1140" /> proposal to write the conditions under which divorce would be granted into the Constitution.  We should all realise by now that no good came of the 1986 abortion amendment.  I am amazed that the Government does not seem to have learned anything from that debacle.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Equality and Law Reform has come up with a number of arguments on why the conditions under which divorce would be granted ought to be written into the Constitution.  It appears that his latest argument is that it is necessary to do this in order to avoid any internal conflict in the Constitution having regard to the terms of Article 41.3.1º which states that the State pledges to guard with special care the institution of marriage on which the family is founded and to protect it from attack.  That argument is a red herring and one born of desperation.</P>
    <P>The Minister states that this formula is necessary in order to be in harmony with article 41.3.1º.  In doing so, he is buying into a conservative, anti-divorce agenda, as the argument contains within it an acceptance that divorce is an attack on marriage.  This is an extraordinary stance for any Minister to take.  This is about as logical as proposing constitutional regulations for the conditions under which funerals are undertaken on the grounds that funerals are an attack on life.  Regardless of whether we have divorce it is undeniable that marriage breakdown occurs.</P>
    <P>The Government's policy on divorce is being driven by the Labour Party and its policy agenda can be boiled down to a principle: they wish to go to the people at the next election as the party which brought in divorce and free third level education.  I do not know if the people will fall for this.  The Minister's latest justification for this wholly unjustifiable intention to write the conditions under which divorce would be granted into the Constitution has nothing to do with the internal textual harmony of the Constitution because if that were the case, on any logical analysis, a simple deletion would be more likely to result in harmony than the insertion of a complex <Col N="1141" /> formula of words has have not yet been published and the import of which, is entirely uncertain.  The Minister is falling into the trap of demonstrating his determination to do anything he thinks will increase his chances of advancing his policy agenda.  In doing so he is diminishing the status of the Houses of the Oireachtas by implying that we legislators cannot be trusted with the task of legislating for divorce.  More fundamentally, he is insulting the Irish people by debasing the Constitution to the level of a glorified opinion poll and by interfering with it to further his own political agenda.</P>
    <P>In recent years the Minister for Equality and Law Reform has engaged in a programme of legislation&mdash;I participated in it to a great extent&mdash;the stated object of which has been to put in place, prior to the introduction of divorce, a comprehensive legal code so the electorate will know exactly what it is voting for in the referendum.  That is a sensible and necessary approach to adopt but, unfortunately, it has not measured up.  From the beginning the legislative programme followed by the Minister, first in partnership with Fianna Fáil and now as part of the new coalition, has been <i>ad hoc</i> and piecemeal, characterised by minimalism. Unfortunately, this Bill is no exception to that general rule.</P>
    <P>It is nine years since the report on the Commission on Social Welfare was published. That report recommended that the social welfare system be reformed as a matter of priority and that the guiding principle to be followed in any such reform must be adequacy, redistribution, comprehensiveness, consistency and, above all, simplicity It is more than two years since the Second Commission on the Status of Women recommended that the social welfare code be amended to establish a system of individual rights and payments in the social insurance and social welfare systems.  It is three years since the Labour Party in Government promised a comprehensive review of social welfare legislation.  The Fianna <Col N="1142" /> Fáil-Labour Programme for Government stated: &ldquo;The administrative requirements of the social welfare system will be simplified and will be made more compatible with human dignity and the system of payment will be streamlined&rdquo;.  The Government went so far as to appoint the Minister of State, Deputy Burton, to oversee that process. Three years later the Labour Party, the only party that has been continuously in Government since the last election, has still failed to deliver on that promise.</P>
    <P>Despite the provisions of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1993, which introduced some reforms, the social welfare code is still as complex, convoluted and opaque as ever.  If the Government, particularly the Labour Party, was serious about reforming the social welfare system, that review would have been completed and we would have not only this minimalist Bill but a package of social welfare reforms of which the measures contained in the Bill could have formed a part.  We could have had a Bill, the product of lengthy, measured and proper consideration, addressing many other issues that need attention.  Instead this Bill addresses one narrow requirement, only the desire to reassure social welfare recipients that the introduction of divorce will not impoverish them.  We all agree it is essential that the introduction of divorce should not further impoverish the poorest and most marginalised sector in society.  We are not opposing that principle, or the provisions in the Bill, but they should be implemented as part of a package of reforms of the social welfare system.</P>
    <P>The Government should be more honest about the implications of divorce for the taxpayer.  A financial memorandum should have been introduced with this Bill; it is extraordinary that was not done.  The measure will be expensive and we need to know how expensive. We do not want the potential expense on the Exchequer to be used as an anti-divorce excuse.  I am critical of the Minister in this regard because it <Col N="1143" /> leaves room for the anti-divorce lobby to create argument.</P>
    <P>We have no objection, for example, to the proposal that deserted wives and prisoners' wives should remain entitled to the same benefits in the event of divorce, but the House must reflect on the implications of the extension, through this Bill, of survivor's pension to divorced persons.  The effect of the Bill will be that where a couple marry, perhaps in their early 20s, separate after a short period and 40 or 50 years later if one partner dies the other will be entitled to a survivor's pension.  When will the Minister be in a position to give the projected cost of the measure ten, 20 or 50 years down the road?</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>We should be absolutely clear about the implications of divorce. We cannot comment on the overall cost of the provisions from the short explanation given by the Minister this morning. I am trying to be helpful, and I believe that this is one of the sticks that will be used to beat the Government.  It is indicative of the rushed way the Minister approached this matter that he seemed to give as little information as possible when, to confound critics, what one must do is give as much information as possible.</P>
      <P>Spouses living together form an economic unit.  The wife who stays at home to look after the children is, in economic terms, making a very real contribution to what might be termed the family's GNP and she should be entitled to the benefit of the contribution her husband makes during the marriage.  After separation or divorce where a woman stays out of the workforce to care for the children the same argument applies, but what happens where there are no children or the children have grown up?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Commission on the Status of <Col N="1144" /> Women noted in its report that home-makers are excluded from the social insurance system.  It recommends a system whereby women working full time in the home can make their own contributions to build up their personal entitlement to a pension.  There is a forceful argument for permitting women, whether married or divorced, to benefit from their husband's contributions while engaged in full time home-making.  Perhaps the argument loses some force in circumstances where the couple are divorced and the children are grown up.  The Minister should consider the possibility of women in those circumstances making their own contributions.</P>
    <P>In the presentation of this Bill the Government is doing what it believes it needs to do to make the introduction of divorce more acceptable.  However, there are other issues that need to be addressed.  Obviously the objective of the legislation is to ensure that those on social welfare should not be further impoverished by the introduction of divorce, and I accept that, but there is another pressing issue that has not been addressed by the Government.  Experience has shown that marital breakdown leads to a reduction in income levels of family members.  That is an unpalatable pill for the Government to have to swallow in the run-up to the referendum but it is a fact that must be faced.  It must be remembered that it is not divorce that causes the financial hardship consequent on marriage breakdown; it is marriage breakdown itself&mdash;we should not confuse the two issues.  That is why the Minister needs to spell out the cost implications of divorce separately from those involved in marriage breakdown.  If the Minister for Equality and Law Reform wishes to fulfil his stated ambition to guard the institution of marriage, he should do so by providing real practical support for those in healthy marriages.  That relates to the area of mediation and counselling for those experiencing difficulties who want to save a marriage.  The Minister will not provide real practical support for <Col N="1145" /> healthy marriages by writing provisions into the Constitution.  The Government should focus on the need to prevent persons whose marriages have broken down from falling into the poverty trap and reduce the need for them to enter into the social welfare system.</P>
    <P>Experience reveals that a hugely disproportionate number of those on social welfare are lone parents, particularly women.  I ask the Minister for Social Welfare and his colleague, the Minister for Equality and Law Reform, what measures they propose to introduce to assist lone parents to get out of the poverty trap and return to work.  As long ago as 1986 the Commission on Social Welfare noted that lone parent families, headed mainly by women, relied to a significant extent on social welfare benefits rather than earnings, something of which we were all aware.  The factors which contribute to that are the concentration of women in low-paid employment, employment-related costs, such as travel to and from work, and, most importantly, the cost of child care.  Lone parents want to work as much as everybody else, but are prevented from doing so because of the cost of child care and low wages after tax, the inevitable result of tax and spend economic policies.  Has the Government any proposals to free separated spouses from the poverty trap so as reduce dependency on social welfare?</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the issue of maintenance. If divorced families are to be kept out of the poverty trap and are not to be dependent on social welfare, an efficient and effective means of fixing a fair and equitable rate of maintenance, backed up with proper enforcement regulations, is of central importance.  At present the level of maintenance paid by one spouse to another is fixed at the judge's discretion. That means that an unwelcome element of uncertainty and inconsistency is introduced into the issue of spouse and child support.  Judges often make their decisions in a vacuum because the courts have not been given the type of powers they need to compel both parties to make a full disclosure of <Col N="1146" /> their incomes.  It is all too easy for husbands &mdash; and it is usually husbands who are the main earners&mdash;to conceal their earnings from the judge.  When this occurs not only the wife and children suffer, but the taxpayer has to pick up the tab.  As a taxpayer, I am not happy about picking up the tab which results from failure to address that problem. We had a long and convoluted discussion on that issue during the debate on the Family Law Bill.  It is crucial that those who evade their responsibilities should be made accountable.</P>
    <P>I do not like this Bill, but its provisions are necessary.  We all agree that this is one of the building blocks in an edifice designed to ensure a successful divorce referendum and I am reluctant to stand in the way of anything that is helpful in that regard.  I hate buzz words like transparency and openness, but it is not helpful to give minimal information particularly regarding matters we are discussing here.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that a financial memorandum was not published with the Bill.  On Committee Stage we will have to tease out many difficulties.  I am concerned about some of the provisions and definitions in the Bill.  I am also concerned about the assumption that once one is married, one is always married. That seems to reflect on the position of women in Irish society, but we can tease that out on Committee Stage.</P>

    <P>Other issues need to be addressed. We have discussed social welfare in relation to the tax system and we need to consider how the provisions of the Bill will affect the tax system.  For <Col N="1147" /> example, can husbands claim tax relief for two or three wives?  The principle that people need to be reassured that they will not be disadvantaged is correct, but we must ensure also that they are not disadvantaged.  I will be tabling amendments to improve the Bill.  It is minimalist legislation.  It is unfortunate that we are providing <i>ad hoc,</i> piecemeal legislation when we should be addressing this issue in a wider context.</P>

      <P>Those of us interested in achieving a successful amendment to our Constitution and allowing people to remarry will resist the temptation to use this debate as a means to discuss the broader issues and social welfare reform, issues only marginally relevant to the debate.  It is important to emphasise that this is straightforward legislation which achieves a simple task. People who walked the streets of Dublin and other parts of the country during the last referendum campaign realise this Bill is necessary and welcome.</P>
      <P>The Bill addresses one of the key issues, the extent of public disquiet and uncertainty about the implications of divorce across a wider range of issues, including social welfare entitlements for spouses and children, than during the last referendum campaign.  That was one of the critical issues of great concern to separated mothers with children.  While people understood the reality of marital breakdown and were broadly sympathetic to providing people with a second chance, they would not vote for something that would worsen their economic circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The issue of private and social welfare pensions is a critical one.  I do not know if there is sufficient public knowledge about private pensions.  This was largely dealt with in the judicial separation Bill. Pension entitlements can be considered at the point of separation when decisions are made on property and other settlements.  This Bill will clarify the private pension area and remove one of the causes of the shift in position in the last referendum from 60 per cent <Col N="1148" /> in favour to a major defeat.  During that referendum campaign people concentrated on those issues.</P>
    <P>I listened to Deputy Walsh with interest and irritation.  I was reminded of Deputy Woods' contribution during the debate on the last referendum when he was a key figure as spokesperson on either social welfare or health.  His party's official position was that it was not opposing the referendum, but he depicted the introduction of divorce as the release of Frankenstein on the nation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Walsh was trying to find some lesser monster than Frankenstein to allow his party to engage in the same type of treble talk it engaged in on the last occasion.  He claimed the Bill would change the position of cohabiting couples, lone parents and the custody of children, all of which are provided for under other legislation.  This Bill does not interfere with the position of such people.  Deputy Walsh is trying to confuse the issue and at best his contribution could be described in terms favoured by his party Leader, as a great deal of waffle.</P>
    <P>I find it difficult to understand the failure of both Opposition speakers to accept the costings in the Bill.  Deputy Keogh correctly stated that divorce is not the point at which a marriage breaks down.  People separate and marriages break down much earlier.  A large number of people cope on their own and some even choose to start families. Lone parents and separations are part of society irrespective of whether we have divorce, which will allow couples to formally end one marriage and establish another if they wish.  It is not surprising that the major costs in terms of marriage breakdown are already provided for in our social welfare system in the form of payments to deserted wives, lone parents and so on.  Like others, I was initially surprised that the estimated figures were low but, when one reflects on the matter, it is not so surprising.</P>
    <P>The Minister identified the narrow range of pension entitlements that will be affected by the Bill, namely, pensions <Col N="1149" /> to widows and widowers, the lone parent's and deserted wife's schemes, occupational injuries benefits, family income supplement and prisoner's wife's allowance. While in European terms our social welfare system may not be very generous, in world terms it is, particularly in the context of economies in the Pacific.  We are already providing for the majority of families where marriages have broken down and, in limited circumstances, the additional provisions of this Bill guarantee that two persons may receive certain rights currently available to one.  Costings under the Bill will not be substantial.  While I can understand Deputy Walsh making the most out of this matter, Deputy Keogh should be more forthcoming.  If we want to successfully amend our Constitution, allow people the right to legal second relationships and establish a second family unit, we should agree that the costings in the Bill are realistic and that its provisions will ensure that women, in particular, in voting for divorce do not jeopardise their existing social welfare rights if they divorce their former partner and form a new legal relationship.  It is important that Members on all sides of the House do not play politics with this matter and seek to cause confusion where it does not exist, particularly those who have declared this matter the core of their party policies since its foundation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Keogh made a rather unfair criticism of the Minister for Equality and Law Reform by suggesting that he was engaged in narrow political self-serving activity in his endeavour to put conditions relating to divorce into the amendment rather than into legislation. Before coming into the House I checked the Tenth Amendment to the Constitution Bill, 1985, introduced by Deputy Taylor which reflects the Labour Party thinking in this area.  It is obvious that the Minister, Deputy Taylor, and the Labour Party have been committed to divorce for some time and neither he nor I would have difficulty in voting for the simple removal of the ban on divorce. Deputy Keogh, and indeed members of my party, believe we should <Col N="1150" /> fight on the high ground of principle on this issue and avoid repeating mistakes made in the context of other constitutional amendments.  I would adopt a much more pragmatic approach than those who wish to put forward a straightforward amendment which would inevitably mean holding another referendum if the terms of divorce are written into the Constitution, as a result of the forthcoming referendum, and we wish to change them.  It is a question of tactics rather than objectives and deciding the most appropriate way to provide an opportunity for the majority of those whose marriages have broken down, particularly those who already have second families, to establish legitimate second relationships and remarry in the eyes of the State.</P>
    <P>We are a unique society with strong family traditions, although recent events in our courts highlighted the sad reality of family life for some.  However, for most children, and indeed adults, the family is the centre of their life and the source of much happiness.  Children's confidence is assured in family life. Therefore, marital breakdown is regrettable and the need for divorce is an indication that an original relationship has failed, and children may be affected. Accepting divorce in a society that is so wedded to the family is not a simple matter.  Those who claim it is a human right and something we must introduce must accept that others do not hold such strong views.  We must pitch our attempts at their level and not at the level of those who have been convinced for some time that divorce should be introduced.  This is the approach adopted by the Minister, he is not seeking a narrow political win.  It would not be a win for politicians, it would mean a change in our society and give people in second relationships an opportunity to legalise them.</P>
    <P>There is constant analysis of the economic impact of divorce.  If one or two incomes which supported one family is divided between two households, it <Col N="1151" /> leaves everybody worse off unless very particular circumstances obtain.</P>
    <P>Accepting that marriage breakdown has been a feature of life here for some time past and its incidence is steadily increasing unaffected by non availability of divorce, if we are to have a culture of remarriage we must inquire whether there has been any international study of the economic consequences of second marriages.  Has there been any assessment of the number of people within new family units, who regain similar or improved economic circumstances? Would not the ability to remarry be an element of the inevitable poverty inherent in the breaking up of a family unit regardless of the household income?</P>
    <P>This Bill is a simple one, to achieve a simple objective, involving a small but important element essential in allowing people to remarry in this country in the knowledge that, in so doing, women's pensions and other rights will not be affected, and ensuring that the cost to society of this additional right will be relatively small in circumstances in which it might be appropriate to have two pensions paid, be it a widow's pension, a deserted wife's allowance, a lone parent's allowance or family income supplement.  At least in theory, there is all-party support in the House for this Bill and we will achieve our objective to have a referendum successfully carried next autumn or as soon as possible, depending on the outcome and timing of court cases.</P>
    <P>I warmly welcome the Bill which effectively tackles one of the major issues of concern to women and should send out a very simple message that it is being done at no great cost to the State. We should endeavour to confine this debate to that issue, leaving the total reform of the social welfare system to a more appropriate time.  If we do that, as Deputy Keogh said, we shall put in place one of the foundation stones for a successful referendum on the issue later this year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with my colleague and spokesman on social welfare, Deputy Joe Walsh, when he says this is a Bill of the utmost importance.</P>
      <P>I must make it clear that the Fianna Fáil Party decided unanimously to support the principle of changing the Constitution to allow for remarriage but, in taking that decision, is determined to uphold positively the primary role of the family in society.  The Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party considers particularly important the provisions for the protection of children and vulnerable spouses. Our decision is in accordance with that adopted by my party when in Government, faced with a growing social problem needing to be addressed in a careful, balanced and sensitive manner, upholding the institution of the family.</P>
      <P>Deputy Flaherty mentioned the 1985 to 1986 period and quoted the references to Frankenstein by Lord Campbell who, after the introduction of divorce in Britain without adequate and comprehensive preparation, and having seen what had happened there said he had released a Frankenstein throughout the land.  The point being made was that in 1985-86 the Government went ahead with a referendum without regard to our all-party Committee on Marriage Breakdown, whose recommendations were set aside by Fine Gael and Labour in what was, in effect, an attempt at political deception.  None of the legislation about which we now talk had been enacted.  The all-party committee had indicated that a whole raft of legislation was necessary to prepare the ground before the electorate is asked, possibly on 30 November next, to decide on the removal of the ban on divorce from our Constitution.  Incidentally, that issue fell within the remit of the Department of Justice at that time, the Department of Equality and Law Reform not having been established.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All Members have been endeavouring to adopt a balanced, sensitive approach to this often divisive, social issue.  Most of the requisite legislation is now in place but some remains to be completed, this Bill being one of the <Col N="1153" /> final major ones to be passed.  It is an important component of the total package receiving the support of the House.</P>
    <P>I warn Members on the other side of the House not to muddy the waters, not to engage in cheap political gibes which might damage the cause almost everybody supports.  When we consider the implications of legislation on divorce for the social welfare code we must first resort to the Constitution.  The Minister referred to constitutional reform, contending that is what we are about today. It is what we are about and this Bill represents important constitutional reform.</P>
    <P>The Constitution guarantees to protect the family, in particular, recognising that, through her life within the home, a woman givens the State support without which the common good cannot be achieved.  In this context we must consider the measures to be taken to meet the needs of those whose marriages have broken down irretrievably while respecting and supporting the family in our developing society.</P>

      <P>On a point of order, the Minister will be unavoidably absent because there are Estimates which have to be dealt with today also.  The Minister cannot be in two places at one time and I wanted to explain that to the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>We are aware of the Minister's limitations in that respect. Prior to 1974, women in the public service were forced to retire on marriage. They could not continue to participate in the social welfare system.  Since then, the marriage bar has been removed and women are no longer forced into a state of dependency on marriage.  In recent years, we have sought to provide options for women in the home.  The approach we adopted was that women who wanted to take up various options <Col N="1154" /> should be entitled to do so and the social security system should support them in taking those decisions.</P>
      <P>We began to redesign our social welfare system to reflect those new needs. It was our objective to provide social welfare support for those who worked full-time in the home, for those who worked part-time or full time outside the home, or any combination of those. We introduced social security arrangements for part-time workers and a number of other measures to support women and allow them take the options they chose.</P>
      <P>For older women we proposed to work towards making payments to them from the age of 66 onwards.  More recently, the National Pensions Board published a report on this in which it also took that view and recommended that the Government pursue that approach.  If such an approach was adopted, it would eliminate the present dependent status of most women over the age of 66 whose spouses reside with them.  We are inclined to forget that women over the age of 66 also wish to be independent and have their payments made to them in an independent way.  That is something which we must work towards and develop.</P>
      <P>For younger married women we proposed a system of credits and voluntary contributions to allow for choices and for specific periods of time out from the workplace to look after children, especially during their pre-school years. I do not intend going into the details of any of these proposals because they were comprehensively worked out and much of their detail is contained in the report of the National Pensions Board. It is necessary to understand the steps we are taking in the context of the overall social security system and the support it provides for the family within the requirements of the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In preparation for a &ldquo;divorce jurisdiction&rdquo;, it was decided that no spouse would be disadvantaged in terms of his or her social welfare entitlements as a result of his or her legal status being changed from married, separated or <Col N="1155" /> deserted to divorced.  The draft proposals for this new scheme had been well developed before the rainbow Coalition took office.</P>
    <P>The package we were putting forward was comprehensive, progressive and met the real needs of families and especially women in the 1990s.</P>
    <P>Let us look at what the Democratic Left Minister for Social Welfare has done.  First, through the miserly 2.5 per cent increase in 1995 he has devalued all pensions &mdash; old age, invalidity, widows and deserted wives'.  The Minister now admits this was totally wrong and reduced the status of those who depend on social welfare, particularly older, senior citizens who are least able to protect themselves.  They have been treated particularly badly by the Democratic Left Minister for Social Welfare.  Yesterday when responding to Questions Nos. 43, 49 and 53 he said: &ldquo;I am not satisfied with the adequacy of social welfare rates generally.&rdquo;  This is the type of approach he uses to avoid saying directly &mdash; as he has said elsewhere&mdash; that the 2.5 per cent increase was wrong, was demeaning and unfair to senior citizens, invalids, deserted wives, widows and many other contributors.</P>
    <P>Second, he has dropped the proposals for home-makers, young or old.  This Bill contains no measures to support the family and provide for &ldquo;time-out&rdquo; and pensions for women who want to spend time with their families in critical periods. This is a real and growing need and one that should be recognised and catered for.  The Minister has not done this and has left it aside.  It would have been preferable to deal more comprehensively with the position of the family as has been proposed, but the Minister is not doing that.</P>
    <P>Third, he has made no provision for payment of pensions in their own right to women over 66.  He is continuing the concept of female dependency.  That is a mistake.  In all of these I believe the Minister is unimaginative and woefully wrong.  He is also in conflict with the clear intention of the Constitution to <Col N="1156" /> support and protect the family.  As Minister for Social Welfare he had a glorious opportunity at this time, and I believe a responsibility, to bring in wider protections to the social welfare system in the interests of the family generally.</P>
    <P>Let us look at what the Minister for Social Welfare and his colleagues in the Fine Gael and Labour parties have done.  They have simply done the minimum they can get away with.  They have taken a cold and calculated decision to go for the minimum.  Deputies Keogh and Joe Walsh described the Bill as minimalist and they are right.  The Bill provides for what is essential but the minimum.  Now was the time to proceed with the wider issues which have a bearing in my view on the family in the changing situation that could arise from the divorce referendum.  This is the time to do something about it and not next year of after the referendum.  It is particularly important to send a clear signal to families throughout the country that we are supporting the family and are aware of the deficiencies.  It is time to begin at least to put them right. One cannot wave a magic wand and put them right all at once and we know that. Some steps were taken previously but now is the time to approach these issues in a more comprehensive way.  The Minister should have done so.</P>
    <P>The Bill extends survivor's pension to include divorced people.  It also brings divorced people into deserted wife's benefit, prisoner's wife's allowance, deserted wife's allowance, occupational injuries benefit and family income supplement.</P>
    <P>I remember, probably towards the end of 1993, when my then programme manager, Catherine Hazlett and I sat down in the booth with one of the officials, who shall remain nameless, but Ó Broin would not be far from the name, to discuss the detail of how we would go about these technical provisions which would be essential.  We drew out on a piece of paper exactly what was necessary and it was then given to the Department to flesh out and fill in the rest of the detail.  It is not <Col N="1157" /> that hard to say what needs to be done to provide the essential cover to do what is at least the minimum.  That has been done in this Bill and a few items have been included to round it off.</P>
    <P>What the Minister for Social Welfare has failed to do is bring these questions further.  On 19 February this year the Minister, Deputy De Rossa, announced in a press release that he would do away with the existing means testing scheme for lone parent's and deserted wife's benefit and replace it with a new payment which would be earnings related. He has not done so.  We were waiting to see what would happen, but he did not do it.  He said also he would do away with the need to prove desertion and bring equal treatment into deserted wife's benefit.  He has done neither&mdash; he has retained the concept of desertion and has not provided equal treatment for co-habitees.</P>
    <P>This is not a good Bill.  It is neither imaginative nor progressive, but narrow and restrictive.  It seems to be consistent with the Government's cutback mentality. It is barely adequate to meet the needs of the projected &ldquo;divorce jurisdiction&rdquo; and the pending referendum. An opportunity to enhance the status of the family and support married women has been lost.  This I believe is a mistake at a time when we are asking those same people to liberalise our family laws.  It is consistent with the mentality of the Minister and the Government which once again took the shilling from the old age pensioner through its miserly 2.5 per cent increase this year.</P>
    <P>In reply to a parliamentary question the Minister said the cost of divorce would be about £1 million in the first five years but that on Second Stage he would give us a more accurate figure. He has not done that.  As there is a need for openness and transparency in this regard, the Minister should give us an estimate so that we will know where we are going.  The Bill is worthy of support because it does what it set out to do, but it is too narrow.  The Minister is building on a narrow foundation.  Perhaps on Committee Stage he will consider a <Col N="1158" /> broader approach.  The Bill is appropriate and adequate but does not tackle all the issues it should have done.  I regret that and believe the Minister has made a mistake.</P>

      <P>I am glad Deputy Woods has clarified his position and that he did not mean what he said as I interpreted it.</P>
      <P>This is a very technical Bill, merely another stepping stone to ensuring a basic civil right, the right to divorce and, if people want it, a chance to remarry or to regularise a second relationship.  As legislators we have a duty to legislate for the people, as we find them, which is often not as we would like them to be. The unpalatable reality is that marriage breakdown is increasing at an unprecedented rate but, as in so many areas of society, constitutional reform has lagged behind social change.  Many people find it uncomfortable that we move at a pace that is not fast enough. but I find it a great comfort because it means society has been firmly set in a particular mode by the time legislators get around to instituting constitutional reform.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1993 there were just 15,000 marriages. In the same year there were 3,000 applications for barring orders and 1,000 separation applications.  A minimum of 4,000 marriages broke down, some irrevocably and some not &mdash; not all barring orders lead to the permanent breakdown of a marriage but may indicate a mere hiccup in a relationship. Despite the current constitutional ban on divorce, marriage breakdown is as prevalent here as it is in other liberal jurisdictions.  In holding a referendum to remove the prohibition on divorce the Government is merely acknowledging a reality.  There is not a family in Ireland today that has not been affected by marriage breakdown, if not directly then at its outer fringes.  Marriage breakdown is a painful reality which no Government can alleviate, but it can help alleviate other realities such as the financial hardships that often accompany it.  That is all this Bill proposes to do.  It proposes to ensure that women who are financially dependent on the State do no lose <Col N="1160" /> because of the breakdown of their marriages.</P>
    <P>This Bill is just one part of the package designed to safeguard the wellbeing of family members in the wake of a divorce in so far as that is possible. Statistics clearly show that all women suffer in the event of marriage breakdown. If we continue to ignore that fact we are fooling ourselves, but we are not fooling the people caught up in marriage breakdown.  There are peculiar statistics on women who suffer financial hardship from marriage breakdown. Women who are sufficiently qualified to take up a job or who have worked outside the home can regain the financial ground lost within a relatively short time, approximately 18 months.  Women who remain in the home looking after their families are never able to regain the ground lost.  It is they, the people who most need our protection, who most need the reassurance that they do not have to continue in their situation because of financial constraints, who will gain most from this Bill.  Financial strain arises both during the separation process and after it.  In 1993 three times as many women sought barring orders as sought judicial separations.  The reason is it is cheaper to obtain a barring order.  For some people obtaining a barring order is their form of separation.  A barring order must be renewed continuously and this is unsettling for spouses and family members.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the progress made by the Minister for Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Taylor, in preparing the legal aid system for the introduction of divorce.  Nevertheless, we must be conscious of the deficiencies in the system and ensure people are not excluded from the divorce process as a result of them or of financial hardship.  We have a two-tier system at present &mdash; one where those who can afford to do so obtain a divorce abroad or a judicial separation here and the other where those who cannot afford to do so obtain a barring order and who continue to live in misery.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1161" /> I hope the referendum will be carried and that there will not be any hiccups. If it is, we will no longer have such a system.  Those who need it will have swift access to the legal aid system.  It is up to us to ensure that divorce is a last rather than a first resort.  I hope the increased attention being paid to the need to expand family mediation services will ensure families have access to a variety of support systems.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to go from the state of being married to being separated.  There are few mediation or reconciliation processes available.  Nobody wants their marriage to fail.  People usually go through a long, tortuous process in private before seeking a barring order or judicial separation.  If professional help were available many marriages would not end in separation or divorce.</P>
    <P>Deputy Walsh spoke about the possible introduction of divorce legislation. I hope the referendum is successful and that all parties will unite in providing citizens with what should be a basic civil right.  When it is carried I hope there will be a similar unity of purpose of ensuring families experiencing the emotional trauma of marital breakdown are not subjected to financial strain. When a marriage breaks down those involved experience a feeling of personal failure.  The last thing that should be felt is financial strain.</P>

When the referendum Bill is introduced we will have the opportunity to deal with the issue of divorce.  We are talking about a possible referendum for which the Government has set a target date but the date could be altered.  Noone knows if they will be alive tomorrow, never mind next November.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Lynch said divorce is a civil right.  That is one point of view.  The people will decide that issue.  The ultimate form of democracy is asking people to decide on issues put before them.  The people must decide between individual rights and what is good for <Col N="1162" /> society.  Legislation denies me some of my civil rights.  The speed I drive at, the time of day I drink alcohol, how I dress or if I dress at all is governed by law. The House tries to balance the rights of the individual with the greater good of society.  The people must decide whether maximising individual civil rights is for the good of society as a whole.</P>
    <P>The legislation is a welcome part of the process.  However, we are jumping the gun.  We do not know the wording of the proposed referendum and whether one must be separated for three years or five years.  We do not know if it will help those who made a bad mistake in their life and locked themselves into a marriage which did not work or whether it will be a licence to obtain as many divorces as one likes. There is not much discussion on that aspect.  If a couple must be separated for three years, having been married for one year, theoretically at age 40 one could be divorced four times.  People will want to know if it will help those who made a sorry mistake or if it will be a licence to change partners as often as one changes cars.  What will be the cost implications if one goes on that merry go round every few years?  The Minister estimated that in a few years time the cost will be £1 million.  When people who have been married five or six times die the State will incur considerable costs in the payment of benefit to their partners.  This will not be a problem in the next few years but will be in the long term.</P>
    <P>The Minister said:</P>
    <P>The contributory pension scheme for widows and widowers is being extended to enable a divorced person who has not remarried to qualify for pension on the death of their former spouse.  This means that on the death of a divorced person his or her former spouse will be able to qualify for a contributory pension on either their own insurance record or that of the deceased, even if the deceased had remarried.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1163" /> Many applicants for social welfare benefit are told they do not have adequate contributions.  Will people who have been married a few times be able to aggregate their contributions?</P>
    <P>The Bill ensures that divorced people will not be discriminated against and that their benefits under the existing schemes will not be reduced.  Deputy Walsh quoted from the Constitution Article under which the State is obliged to look after the family.  We need to strike a balance between these aims.  We should not discriminate against separated or divorced people but neither should we glorify marriage breakdown or make it more financially beneficial. Many social welfare schemes, for example, the lone parent one, are being abused.  In reply to a parliamentary question the Minister said that more than 40,000 people were in receipt of a lone parent allowance.  A recent study carried out by Dublin Corporation found that more than 50 per cent of people in receipt of a rent allowance were not living in those houses.  Many people claiming a lone parent allowance are living in a private flat with their partners who are in receipt of a rent allowance.  These people are much better off than a married couple who do not rip off the system.</P>
    <P>We should not discriminate against anyone but neither should we be seen to favour them.  We have gone too far in the opposite direction and now seem to be encouraging people to break up. Women on unemployment assistance who visit my clinic know they would be better off if their husbands were not living at home and either kick them out or arrange for them to leave.  A person on a community employment scheme gets an extra £15 per week while a person in receipt of a lone parent allowance can get an extra £40 or £50 per week.  A work ethos in the home is important from the point of view of children who benefit from seeing their parents make a meaningful contribution to society. However, it is very difficult to understand why a person on a scheme who <Col N="1164" /> has managed to keep their marriage together should only get an extra £15 per week while a lone parent can get an extra £40 or £50 per week.  The system is not fair and we seem to have gone too far in one direction.</P>
    <P>The Minister said:</P>
    <P>A divorced person supporting his or her former spouse may receive an adult dependant allowance in respect of them.  They may also receive an additional adult dependant allowance if remarried or cohabiting.</P>
    <P>Does this mean that divorced people must support their spouses even if they are on social welfare and that the man can claim for his former spouse?  Why is the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; used?  This provision could lead to extremes in either direction. Does it mean that a social welfare female recipient will not have any entitlements in her own right, that her husband must still claim for her?  This provision should be made clear as it is open to difference interpretations.</P>
    <P>People must adopt a more responsible attitude to marriage.  Some people leave a relationship when the going gets tough, thus leaving their spouses or partners dependent on the State for handouts.  The Minister said that approximately 41,000 people were in receipt of a lone parent allowance and that the number examined for recovery against spouses and partners since 1991 when these provisions were brought into effect was 13,700.</P>
    <P>It is a joke that 183 people only are contributing while a total of 41,000 receive payment.  We have made a skit out of this.  By all means the State must support people who need support but there are many men who father children and walk away from their responsibilities. This is not on.  Some 41,000 lone parents are receiving benefit and 183 only are contributing anything per week.  The Department of Social Welfare must be very decent and kind if they are dealing out money to everybody. I accept these people cannot all be traced but many of them could be <Col N="1165" /> made to pay.  It is ridiculous that people walk away from their responsibilities and leave it to the State to pick up the tab.  That attitude must cease.</P>
    <P>I note Deputy Lynch has left the Chamber.  Democratic Left Deputies seem to turn every argument around and say that Fianna Fáil was in power for so long it should have done various things.  That argument probably stood up for a couple of weeks after the new Government took office.</P>

      <P>In the context of political life six months is long enough to lose a new boy tag.  At this stage the Government cannot look across the room and blame somebody else for everything.</P>
      <P>My contribution is geared more to the Minister than to the Minister of State. The Minister for Social Welfare, a constituency colleague, has been pontificating for 14 years, saying all the things he would do if he got his hands on power. He is in office now and it is about time he stopped turning around every argument and blaming Fianna Fáil.  I am disappointed that the Minister who introduced the legislation this morning is absent.  I realise the Social Welfare Estimates are being debated this afternoon. I am disappointed also that more Members are not present.  The Minister blames Fianna Fáil for everything. When I consider his position over the years I pity him rather than praise him. He has moved from one party to another in an effort to be boss of his own house.  Even now he seems to be a prisoner of the clique within his own party&mdash;the Rabbitte, Heffernan clique. He is not even master of his own little house no matter how small and he does not seem to get anywhere.  I am disappointed that he had to leave to be briefed on the Estimates.</P>
      <P>If this debate is to continue, I call for a quorum before the next speaker stands up.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Social Welfare (No. 2) Bill, 1995.  I have been listening to the Fianna Fáil speakers and am struck by the tone of their contributions which is critical of the Bill. Theirs is an ambivalent approach, in the context of Fianna Fáil supporting the divorce referendum.  This legislation deals with many of the anxieties and concerns raised during 1986.  These anxieties are raised by some of the most vulnerable people dependent on social welfare who had concerns about the implications of introducing divorce.</P>
      <P>Deputy Woods referred to the lost opportunity.  It is ironic that he, a former Minister for Social Welfare for many years, did not deal with the issues of dependency, which he raised only towards the end of his contribution. Instead he said that the Government&mdash; in six months&mdash;should have sorted out the concept of dependency, an issue he failed to address in his many years as Minister for Social Welfare.  This Bill cannot address the broader social welfare issues and reform of the social welfare system which the Government is determined to tackle including the issue of individual rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the context of the changes needed, if we are to put the issue to the people in a referendum and introduce divorce, this Bill is an important building block in that process.  It deals with difficult financial issues.  When a couple decide to separate or if they have the option to seek a divorce, the issues which remain to be resolved are broad.  They include emotional, parenting and financial issues.  The links between partners who decide to separate are dealt with in the <Col N="1167" /> Bill which recognises that ongoing financial arrangements need to be made and what the State needs to do to provide ongoing financial security for those in receipt of a range of allowances from the State.  It lays out clearly their rights in those circumstances.  This is extremely important.</P>
    <P>I say &ldquo;well done&rdquo; to the Minister for introducing this legislation but I equally say to him that it will be necessary to conduct an information campaign to make people aware of its provisions.  It seems that people are not yet clear on how they would be affected financially. There is, therefore, a need for more information.  The Bill deals with a number of categories who may be affected by divorce.</P>
    <P>During the last referendum campaign there was much anxiety about the way people would be affected in a range of areas if divorce was introduced.  On this occasion, the debate seems to focus on the position of children.  The Bill outlines clearly what the position will be for a divorced couple in relation to widow's and widower's pension, lone parent's allowance, deserted wife's allowance, occupational injury benefit, family income supplement and prisoner's wife's allowance.</P>
    <P>I hope there will be a positive outcome to the divorce referendum later this year.  We need to recognise the reality for thousands of separated couples and provide financial support for those who find themselves in this position.  At the same time, we should attempt to truly support the family.</P>
    <P>That is the tone we should adopt in this debate instead of sending ambivalent messages like Fianna Fáil.  I do not know to whom Deputy Ahern was referring when he mentioned that couples were on a merry-go-round, in and out of relationships.  I was amazed and thought he was very insulting to the many couples who have separated.  Having worked with families over a long period, it is my experience that couples do not take these decisions lightly and it is a very painful time for all involved.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1168" /> The Deputy adopted an unhelpful cavalier approach.  It would be much better if we were to talk realistically about how we support families under stress.  That is what the Government is trying to do and the facts speak for themselves.</P>
    <P>The family mediation service has been extended.  A number of years ago it was under threat of closure by a Fianna Fáil Minister.  It was saved and developed and its financial allocation has been greatly increased in an attempt to provide a nationwide service to families. This is extremely important.  I would like to see far more couples using this service instead of becoming embroiled in complex legal disputes which are difficult for everybody concerned.</P>
    <P>The Government is committed to placing the various building blocks needed to support families in difficulty or who have separated.  It has shown its commitment by improving the free legal aid service.  That there have been major improvements is the message which should go out to the public.</P>
    <P>Deputy Woods is correct that there is a need to reform social welfare but I am surprised that only at the end of his speech did he begrudgingly offer his support.  This is an important Bill. Although it may be narrow in the sense that it does not tackle all the areas we know as in need of reform, it deals clearly with the various groupings I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>The question of pensions has been an extremely difficult one and caused grave anxiety.  People ask what will happen to their pensions if they divorce.  The provisions in the Bill will apply equally to men and women.  In the case of survivor's pension, a divorced man will be able to qualify for a pension on the death of his former wife in the same way as a divorced woman will be able to qualify for a pension on the death of her former husband.  In the case of women in receipt of deserted wife's allowance, it is stated clearly that they will also continue to receive this allowance.</P>
    <P>There are some anomalies in terms of <Col N="1169" /> the language used in the Bill.  It is inevitable because of the social welfare system we operate&mdash;Deputy Keogh referred to this matter&mdash;that the dependency concept is reflected in the language used.  I hope we will move to rights for individual men and women as opposed to continuing the dependency concept, but that is not what this Bill is about; it is about ensuring that couples and individuals who may find themselves in this position will not be at a loss.  Lone parents are also catered for in the Bill.</P>
    <P>For all those claiming allowances, this Bill is reassuring.  It outlines what their financial status will be if, and when, divorce is introduced and they have the right to remarry.  It does away with the worries people had in 1986.</P>
    <P>We have paid lip service to the need to support the family and have not been good at putting mechanisms in place. We have the second worst record in Europe when it comes to providing publicly-funded child care facilities.  On the fundamental issue of the status of women in society, it has been said that divorce makes women poor.  I am not sure if that is true as the reality is that many Irish women have no income in their own right and do not have an opportunity to work outside the home. Many women cannot be included on the live register while training opportunities are limited.  Although I recognise that great efforts are being made and the Government is committed to providing child care facilities, if we want to raise the status of women, children and families, we will have to address all these issues.  For that reason I welcome the Bill.  It is an important building block and should be recognised as such.  It is only one measure to deal with the complex circumstances that arise when divorce is introduced and people have a right to remarry.  It is a very important Bill and I congratulate the Minister on its introduction.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimKemmy" hpid="Mr. Kemmy Mr. Kemmy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kemmy</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the calm, logical, intelligent approach adopted by Deputy Fitzgerald.  It is a pity we do not <Col N="1170" /> hear more contributions such as that. There have been too many flights of fancy, with some people getting carried away on this issue.  Deputy Fitzgerald addressed the contents of the Bill and did not indulge in make-believe.  I accept on Second Stage contributors are entitled to elaborate on issues, as Deputy Ahern did.  Deputy Woods, a former Minister for Social Welfare, gave a historical background of social welfare legislation which was very informative and educational, but the Bill is concerned with five main areas of social welfare reform: widow's and widower's pension; lone parent's and deserted wife's schemes; occupational injury benefits; family income supplement and prisoner's wife's allowance.</P>
      <P>Some of Deputy Ahern's reflections on marriage were bizarre.  His main point was that when the divorce referendum is passed, as I hope it will be, there will be a mass exposition of marriage madness and we will become a race of Mickey Rooneys.  Mickey Rooney walked down the isle about a dozen times.  For a small man he certainly had plenty of energy in that regard.  He seems to be in love with the idea of marriage, although he was not married very long to any woman.  I do not forsee that happening here.  We are not going to change our characteristics or our attitude to life because divorce legislation is introduced.  To adopt that attitude is to treat people in an infantile way, as if we were a nation of irresponsible delinquents.  The Deputy did not deal in a realistic way with the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many issues have been swept under the carpet in the past.  For example, child abuse always occurred, but for various reasons it was swept to one side. We are not a nation of paragons but of human beings.  This Bill is a compassionate and civilised response to marriage breakdown.  I welcome the extension of social welfare rights to people in those circumstances.  The Bill proposes a change in the legal status of separated and deserted people.  It confers no additional rights but is a response to the needs of people whose marriages have <Col N="1171" /> broken down.  I hope the dire, grim predictions of Deputy Ahern are not realised.</P>
    <P>This is a Bill of rights, particularly for women who are very often vulnerable in the case of marriage breakdown.  In the past women had no financial independence. When one has financial independence it is easy to be resourceful and to avail of services, but all too often in the past people in unhappy marriages could not do very much about their circumstances because they did not have the financial wherewithal.  This measure is a framework for people who find themselves in that position.</P>
    <P>To listen to some of the speakers one would think the Bill will force people into marriage break-up, but that is a travesty of its intention.  Those of us who have worked as public representatives over the years are well aware that marriage breakdown is endemic in our society and is on the increase for a variety of reasons such as economic pressure and incompatibility.  Some people grow apart after a number of years of marriage and nobody is to blame. Nobody in their right mind envisages that, on the introduction of divorce, people will marry on multiple occasions. That would be a form of insanity.  We have heard nothing about the pain, suffering and hardship caused by marriage breakdown.  Those of us who know people whose marriages have broken down are well aware there is no such thing as a clean break from a marriage. There is often a great deal of pain and trauma involved, and that position will not change on the passage of this Bill.</P>
    <P>This Bill will not force people into marriage breakdown or to marry again if they do not wish to do so.  No law in the world can force people to live together if that is not their wish.  People in unhappy marriages cannot be forced to live together.  This Bill is not an encouragement to marriage breakdown or to marry again; it merely deals with reality.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ahern referred to abuses of <Col N="1172" /> the social welfare code.  We are not concerned with encouraging social welfare abuse but with ending such abuse.  This Bill is not a charter for social welfare abuse; if it was I would say so.  If there are abuses in social welfare and in other areas of society such as taxation, they should be stamped out.</P>
    <P>A sensible attitude should be adopted to people seeking information on this matter.  Sensitive counselling is necessary, but sometimes the physical layout of employment exchanges is not conducive to privacy.  In rural Ireland people often have to sign on at Garda barracks and so on.  It is important that proper facilities are made available in employment exchanges for people who qualify for these extended benefits.  It should be possible for them to receive counselling and information in private from an official qualified in that area.</P>
    <P>The Bill is an attempt to face reality. It represents a just, comprehensive and caring approach to securing the rights of all adults and children directly affected by marriage breakdown.  It is very important that it be implemented in full and that we put an end to the poor law mentality that influenced so much legislation in the past.  Deputy Woods outlined some of the welcome changes and measures in social welfare legislation down though the ages, but the attitude that people are receiving charity must be changed.  This Bill is a compassionate, caring and civilised response to marriage breakdown and should be dealt with in a sensitive, intelligent way. I hope there will be an improvement on the debate we have heard so far.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Ms M. Wallace Ms M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Ms M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>In recent years there has been a broadly constructive consensus in this House on the various subsidiary measures introduced to deal with marriage breakdown.  There has been a move from the previous uncompromising polarisation of the debate, which is welcomed by people in the House and by the general public.  That move has been evident since the acceptance by a Fianna Fáil Government of an Opposition-initiated Family Law Bill which <Col N="1173" /> resulted from the public rejection of the last referendum in 1986.  The reason for such rejection was that, while a range of vital issues remained unlegislated for, the public was unwilling to place blind faith in the future actions of a presumptive and pre-emptive Government.  I can understand that, and at the next referendum the same fear will exist if proper legislation is not put in place.  The result of the last divorce referendum was firmly related to the fact that legislation had been dealt with inappropriately and sufficient legislation was not in place. People will vote only for what they are certain will be a clear reality in this important matter.</P>
      <P>The nonsense started again this morning when the Minister referred to the cost of the provisions of this Bill.  He said that they are minimal in the context of overall social welfare spending, but most people know that is not so.  He went on to say that the cost is likely to rise to £1 million over the next five years and compared that to the total spending on social welfare support to widows, widowers, lone parents and deserted wives, currently in the order of £630 million per annum.  He claims that if divorce is introduced it will cost an extra £1 million over a five year period &mdash;£200,000 per annum.  I do not believe the Minister is dealing with realistic figures. The public will not accept them as realistic.</P>
      <P>While the basic approach in the 1991 White Paper on Marital Breakdown was attacked by the present Government parties when in Opposition, it worked well in setting an effective agenda for dealing with these areas.  Its most important issues will be to allow for a much more constructive debate when the issue of divorce is next placed before the people in a referendum. Great credit is due to those who prepared the White Paper on Marital Breakdown for setting out the important issues that need to be addressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the most significant issues raised during the 1986 referendum was a genuine fear that divorce would <Col N="1174" /> impoverish women.  Those campaigning against the referendum were justly able to point to the uncertainty which would face non-earning spouses after a divorce. That will always be a concern for women unless legislation clearly sets out their standing in the case of a divorce. It was one of the key factors which led to the above average rejection of proposals in less affluent areas, especially in Dublin.  Large numbers of women were not willing to put themselves and their children in a position of potentially severe financial hardship.  They need to know their financial standing in such circumstances. It is essential in dealing with that fear that the Bill is relevant and should be assessed in terms of how far it goes towards protecting the interests of women and children affected by divorce, if introduced.</P>
    <P>The Bill largely succeeds in meeting its objective in terms of the existing social welfare code.  It conforms to the approach adopted by the previous two Fianna Fáil-led Governments and the preparations undertaken by Deputy Woods in the Department of Social Welfare.  Fianna Fáil strongly supports the core principle that no spouse should be disadvantaged in terms of his or her social welfare entitlements as a result of separation, desertion or divorce.  Difficulties arise due to the process by which the Bill has been presented to the Oireachtas for consideration, specifically the minimalist approach adopted by the Minister in outlining his justification for the specific provisions of the Bill.  That must be a matter of concern to us all.  Surely we have learned from the 1986 example that all issues must be clarified by the Ministers responsible. People will not buy a pig in a poke.  A number of areas must be clarified before the Bill is passed and the Government's intentions concerning associated issues will need to be addressed before the intent of the Bill becomes a reality.</P>
    <P>Given that a Bill like this must be clearly explained, I was surprised at the lack of information supplied with it.  The <Col N="1175" /> social welfare code is difficult to understand at the best of times, and when extensive technical changes such as these are proposed, surely it is reasonable to expect that proper background information would be circulated to Members and relevant bodies.  The provisions of the Bill must be made clear to relevant bodies and the public.  Many questions may arise because of the brevity of the explanatory memorandum and the lack of background briefing documents. As the Bill is not crystal clear there may be much unnecessary debate and the raising of unfounded concerns for those affected by its provisions.</P>
    <P>One basic omission is that there is no indication in any of the documents circulated with the Bill of the numbers who are likely to be affected by the proposed measures.  The lack of that information must have given rise to the unrealistic figure of £200,000 as the cost of the introduction of divorce.  The Minister must have assessed the likely impact of the proposals and the information available to him during his preparations should be made available to all. He may be afraid such information will frighten people, but it should be available and if it is crystal clear it will help the public, especially women, who will be mainly affected, to understand the impact of the legislation.</P>
    <P>As with all measures which go before the Government, the Bill must have been examined in terms of its likely cost to the Exchequer and the House should have been given that information.  The result of the lack of information provided by the Minister and the speed with which the Bill has come before the House is that interested groups did not have an opportunity to focus properly on the Bill and constructively study its proposals.  While it will not affect the result of the vote on this Bill, the Government has failed to work in a spirit of consensus-building which we are all endeavouring to achieve.  Worse still, if the Government is not crystal clear in explaining legislation such as this it is <Col N="1176" /> likely to result in a reptition of what happened in 1986.</P>
    <P>There has been no indication from the Government how it considers the social welfare code should be developed to move away from the idea of dependence and towards stressing the concept of the rights of the individual.  In the short time members of the Council for the Status of Women had to read the Bill, they raised an issue related to section 6.  They are concerned that a divorced woman may continue to be classified as a deserted wife.  We understand the intention is to stress that the woman would be protected from the loss of any benefit, but that is essentially a clumsy way of addressing the issue.  In the absence of an explanation we must assume that is the logic behind it.  After marriage breakdown women work hard to reconstruct their individual indentities. While we are willing to support the proposals as short term measures, we believe the Minister should bring forward proposals which reflect the independence of women in the social welfare code, specifically regarding section 6.</P>
    <P>Assuming there is not some potentially explosive issue being hidden, this minimalist approach to background information should be abandoned in the interests of maintaining an open, informed and consensus-building debate on the Social Welfare Bill and any other necessary legislation which must be in place before the proposed referendum. The Minister should immediately publish all advice he receives regarding the cost and effects of the Bill and other amendments to the social welfare code considered during its preparation, thus ensuring an open debate.  People would understand what we are doing and it would assist them in the lead-up to a divorce referendum.</P>
    <P>It is vital that we seek the opinions of women's groups.  Because of the speed with which the legislation was introduced, women's groups did not have an opportunity to study the Bill at length. The Council for the Status of Women <Col N="1177" /> had very little time to submit recommendations on the Bill.  The Minister should invite the members of the Council for the Status of Women to contribute to the discussions on this Bill.  That would follow the precedent set during the passage of the Finance Bill when professional bodies made formal submissions. If Government parties are not agreeable to that suggestion, as chairperson of the Joint Committee on Women's Rights I am prepared to invite members of the Council for the Status of Women to address that committee and I propose that the committee should use its powers to question the Minister on the issues.</P>
    <P>I make that suggestion in the interests of openness and helpfulness, to give women's groups an opportunity to participate in an important area and to ensure there is open debate in the public domain.</P>
    <P>An initial reading of the Bill reveals that a number of areas require clarification. Eligibility for various benefits is generally adjudicated by the source of support for a spouse at a particular time. In the case of survivor's pension, death benefit and widow's pension eligibility is limited to cases where the woman has not remarried or is not cohabitating at the date of death of her former spouse. In cases where the second relationship ends, particularly where it ends through the death of a spouse, it may happen that the various entitlements arising from the second relationship are significantly lower than those arising from the first.  The potential effects on the ability of the surviving parent to support a family arising from the first relationship could be significant.  This is something which must be considered.</P>
    <P>The definition in the Bill of what constitutes a family comprehends cohabitation between an unmarried couple living together as husband and wife.  This has caused considerable uncertainty and concern for a number of groups.  The Minister must explain how that definition will be applied in practice.</P>
    <P>A number of other potentially grey areas must be addressed.  How will the <Col N="1178" /> entitlement of orphans be affected by the existence of a stepparent or guardian? What about children's allowance payments?  How does the Minister propose to deal with cases where one of the parties does not live in the jurisdiction? Do our existing bilateral social welfare agreements cover the proposed changes?  Will it be necessary to alter the manner in which qualification for additional benefit, on the basis of the number of dependants, is defined through the social welfare code?  Many questions remain unanswered, but they must be answered to ensure clarity.</P>
    <P>Even if the final version of the Bill succeeds in satisfactorily amending the workings of the existing social welfare code, it may not have a practical effect. Wider issues need to be addressed to ensure that happens, the most important of which are access to information and the appeals process.  Most cases comprehended by the Bill will by definition arise in the context of an antagonistic relationship.  Therefore, it will be important for an individual to have sufficient access to information on their former spouse's financial position to enable them to apply for the right benefits.  In cases where there is entitlement to contributory benefits it will be vital for the Department to inform the surviving children and former spouse of their entitlements.  Bearing in mind the antagonistic nature of most cases, we must adopt an open approach.</P>
    <P>The points made regarding the need for advice on legal affairs apply also to social welfare matters.  In a recent presentation to the Joint Committee on Women's Rights, FLAC stressed that the delays and costs faced by women seeking legal redress in marital disputes seriously undermines the effect of statutory protection.  There is no reason to believe this will not be a factor also in social welfare appeals.  Therefore, the Minister should introduce proposals to ensure that independent and objective advice is readily available.</P>
    <P>The Department of Social Welfare must also ensure that full information on entitlements is made available.  As <Col N="1179" /> evident in the take-up on many schemes, in particular the family income supplement ignorance of entitlements can often lead to exacerbated hardship for families.  A large number of families are not aware of their entitlements under the family income supplement scheme.  If the Department does not make specific efforts to target such people, a serious difficulty will arise. This would be particularly important in cases involving a change of status because of the death of a former spouse.</P>
    <P>If the Minister makes up for his minimalist approach to background information and facilities by having an open debate on the Bill, necessary and welcome changes will be made to the existing social welfare code and in doing so he will allay public fears about the issue of divorce and remarriage.  We must learn lessons from the 1986 referendum. All new legislation should be clear and concise and time should be allowed for public debate among interested groups. This would be a major asset to the public in the lead-up to the proposed referendum and I ask the Ministers responsible to note that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on this legislation which is crucial to the divorce referendum. I congratulate my colleague, the Minister for Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Taylor, for having the wisdom and foresight to ensure that the Minister for Social Welfare introduced this Bill.  I was Opposition spokesperson on social welfare at the time of the 1986 divorce referendum and noted the swing from a 60 per cent in favour and 40 per cent against to a 60 per cent against and a 40 per cent in favour.  That reversal was not a result of the efforts of the anti-lobby campaign and those who were against divorce.  It resulted from the stories young and old people were told on the doorsteps.  This Bill takes account of many, if not all, of the major difficulties experienced at that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1986 the people were taken for granted, emphasis focused on divorce, <Col N="1180" /> the division of family property and access to children, very few reflected on what would happen later.  There have been many changes since then and the concept of the family has altered dramatically.  Members witness this on a daily basis in their constituency clinics where we have become second line barristers or solicitors in endeavouring to resolve the difficulties created by separations, many of which are social or in the social welfare area.</P>
    <P>It is a simple matter for a person to leave his or her spouse and live with another person, but the after-effects are the main problem.  Thankfully, I have had a happy married life and after 35 years I will not be contemplating a divorce. The Bill will not affect me but I, and I am sure the Minister, wish everybody could say the same.  However, that is not the case and in parts of my constituency, particularly in urban areas, 50 per cent of the lower income group are separated.  I have no doubt that the electorate will have learned in the intervening ten years that our laws must reflect the times in which we live.</P>
    <P>The electorate voted overwhelmingly in favour of joining the EEC, participating in the Single Market, the Maastricht Treaty and now the European Union, which means that our laws must be aligned with European law.  Our officials and representatives in Brussels look after our country's interests.  It is logical to conclude that, if we do not bring our legislation into line with Europe voluntarily, we shall be obliged to do so, which is recognised by the present Government and Opposition parties.</P>
    <P>The forthcoming referendum on divorce will be the first on which all the parties in both Houses will be on the same wavelength.  That said, it would be awful to have to contemplate an anti-divorce lobby attempting to influence the electorate against the overwhelming opinion of their elected representatives. That could be brought about only in the manner done on the last occasion, for example, telling old age pensioners they would lose their entitlement to free electricity, travel, fuel or television <Col N="1181" /> licence or telephone rental.  On the last occasion it was impossible to counteract the dissemination of such propaganda on the doorsteps, as the then Government had not done its homework which it discovered too late.  There is now a positive, planned, controlled effort to prepare the electorate for holding this referendum on divorce, constituting one of the most fundamental changes in our history to bring our laws in line with conditions at the end of the 20th century.</P>
    <P>A large part of the education of people on their entitlements, or what entitlements they might lose, must rest with the Department of Social Welfare, the Government and Opposition parties, which must be well prepared and advertised.  The electorate must receive answers to many questions that may not be covered in the provisions of this Bill. For example, Deputy Mary Wallace referred to the family income supplement. When replying perhaps the Minister will say what will happen to the family income supplement of a divorced couple who had been in receipt of it before separating and subsequently divorcing.  For example, would the wife receive any portion?  Would it be divided between both parties if the former family was split, some of the children remaining with the father and the remainder with the mother as happens in the case of some divorces?</P>
    <P>It is difficult to measure the implications of such circumstances without full knowledge of the terms on which divorce will be allowed and-or based, and subjecting them to the most rigorous examination.  I am confident that my colleague, the Minister for Equality and Law Reform, will strike the right balance. We do not want, nor would we expect, divorce on demand; certainly I would be opposed to that concept.  The correct balance must be struck but, in the meantime, the electorate's questions must be answered.</P>
    <P>Apart from furnishing leaflets to beneficiaries of social welfare, many people will be in the twilight zone, they will not be divorced, but contemplating it or <Col N="1182" /> have it in train, wondering if they divorce, what their entitlements will be. The rights of people already divorced will be very clear from the provisions of this Bill.  They can simply go to a post office or to the Department of Social Welfare, request a leaflet on whatever benefit in which they are interested and get details.  Additionally, I recommend the establishment of a panel of experts within the Department of Social Welfare with a free telephone service to the community generally so that anybody, young or old regardless of their views, can make telephone inquiries about their prospective entitlements.</P>
    <P>We must remember that in the dying weeks of the 1986 divorce campaign the 60:40 majority in favour disappeared virtually overnight.  It was too late before the then Government realised what had been happening, too late to answer the questions or to counteract the propaganda then being circulated.  It is very easy to engage in a propaganda campaign within, say, a housing estate. You need only tell one woman living there that if she votes in favour of divorce she will lose her benefits.  In such circumstances there will be no need for the distribution of any leaflets, she will represent the best leaflet or information service because not alone will she have changed her own mind but will have influenced many others, possibly imparting misleading information.</P>
    <P>Limited information was available on the occasion of the last referendum but not enshrined in any legislative measure.  This meant that the relevant points could be argued forcefully by the anti-divorce lobby who did a good hatchet job.  Nonetheless, there was a certain logic in what that lobby was saying because the then Government had not done proper preparatory homework.</P>
    <P>This Bill is one necessary legislative measure in advance of the forthcoming referendum on divorce, on which I congratulate both Ministers involved.  On behalf of my parliamentary party I warmly welcome it, as it provides the necessary changes in our social welfare <Col N="1183" /> code to ensure that no spouse will be disadvantaged in terms of social welfare entitlements resulting from marital and-or legal status being changed, whether from married to separated, deserted or divorced.</P>
    <P>The main social welfare benefits protected under its provisions are, first, a survivor's pension, which extends entitlements to divorced persons on the death of their former spouse, an important provision, provided that person has not remarried or is not cohabiting with another party.  On the death of an insured person who has married more than once, the spouse and former spouse may qualify for a survivor's pension on their own insurance record or that of the deceased.</P>
    <P>The widow's non-contributory pension was a very important issue on the last occasion in respect of which this Bill provides that a divorced woman, who fails to qualify for a survivor's pension on the death of her former husband, may now qualify for the widow's non-contributory pension, which provision I also welcome.</P>
    <P>The matter of death benefit was widely discussed before the last referendum on divorce.  Under existing provisions, the widow or widower of somebody who dies resulting from an occupational accident or disease may qualify for death benefit under the provisions of the occupational injuries benefit scheme.  I am pleased the Bill extends these entitlements to divorced persons.</P>
    <P>The main question at that time concerned payments to deserted wives. While the level of desertion in 1986 was lower than it is now, it was on the increase.  Under the terms of the Bill, a deserted wife who is divorced may continue to be regarded as deserted for the purpose of deserted wife's benefit.  That is to be welcomed and it will discourage any propaganda on the issue, which was a feature of the 1986 referendum.  Since 1986, that category of social welfare recipient has increased substantially.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1184" /> The number of women receiving prisoner's wife's allowance has increased substantially also because of the increase in crime.  The Bill provides for continued entitlement to prisoner's wife's allowance where the recipient becomes divorced and entitles a divorced woman, whose former husband is imprisoned, to this allowance.  That will be welcomed by the unfortunate women who find themselves in those disastrous circumstances.</P>
    <P>The lone parent's allowance is adequately covered in the Bill.  It also extends the definition of lone parents for the purpose of the lone parent's allowance to include a divorced parent. This is a clever move because it will cover a number of circumstances in that category.</P>
    <P>I wish to return to the topic of the family income supplement and I ask the Minister to expand on that when replying. I understand the Bill extends the definition of a family, for the purpose of a family income supplement, to include a former spouse where he or she is being wholly or mainly maintained by the claimant.  I am not too clear about what that means.  Does it mean that regulations will be issued under that section of the Bill setting out in detail the method by which the benefit would be distributed in the case of separation or divorce?</P>
    <P>The Bill extends the definition of an adult dependant to include a divorced person and provides the powers under which a person may receive more than one increase in respect of an adult dependant.  I congratulate the Minister for Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Taylor, and the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa, on a good team effort in respect of the Bill.  It will be the rock on which this referendum will be won and the measures contained in it will help the unfortunate men and women who find themselves facing a divorce.  I welcome the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I too welcome this Bill which allows us to pave the way for divorce. In 1986, when the people were <Col N="1185" /> asked to vote on the issue of divorce, a considerable amount of confusion was generated.  It is our duty as parliamentarians, regardless of the side of the House on which we sit, to clarify all aspects of this issue when it is put to the people before the end of this year.</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil debated this issue and adopted a particular stance on the question of divorce.  We have decided to support the principle of changing the Constitution to allow for remarriage and that the constitutional ban on divorce should be removed.  In doing so, we are conscious of the thousands of people whose marriage break down &mdash; a figure of 75,000 has been quoted during this debate.  It is important, therefore, that we get it right when addressing this issue.  Many of my colleagues raised questions about some of the details of the Bill but it is clear that in 1986, the Government of the day did not give the issue the attention it required.  I am pleased that we are now discussing all aspects of it in detail.</P>
      <P>We must ensure that spouses are not disadvantaged in terms of their social welfare entitlements as a result of a change in their legal status from being married, separated or deserted to divorced. In doing that, the Bill must provide for all the essential changes in the social welfare code.</P>
      <P>It must be pointed out that essentially this is a Fianna Fáil Bill.  People are inclined to attack Fianna Fáil on social issues and, perhaps, we are an easy target at times, but we cover a wide constituency.</P>
      <P>As a proud member of the Fianna Fáil Party I admit that I might differ with some of my colleagues on certain issues but we have had many lengthy debates at parliamentary party level and I respect&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I would like to be a fly on the wall at some of the Fine Gael meetings because I am sure Fine Gael <Col N="1186" /> would hold the same position on many issues.  Having a wide range of views promotes a healthy democracy.  On social issues some of my colleagues differ from me but at least we go to the trouble of debating them at length.  I respect that diversity within the party. We have publicly stated our position on this issue.</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil contributed much to this Bill.  The previous Minister, Deputy Woods, put considerable time and effort into ensuring that it would be a good Bill.  Ministers De Rossa and Taylor brought it forward but we were very much involved in its preparation.  When he was Minister, Deputy Woods was anxious to broaden the terms of the Bill and to deal with a long standing issue, namely, the position of women in the home.  Many years ago, the then Minister, former Minister of State Nuala Fennell, who shared my constituency of Dublin South, endeavoured to deal with this issue and made certain commitments to cater for women in the home. What was proposed then was admirable, pensions for women in the home on a phased basis.  I regret that this Minister did not take the opportunity of dealing with that issue.</P>
      <P>According to the 1991 census, 55,000 people declared themselves to be separated. I am sure that figure has substantially increased in the past four years and we should deal with that issue.  Following our meeting on the question of divorce we underlined in particular the position of children.  I welcome the fact that Deputies from all sides of the House have mentioned this.  We want to remove the threat that exists for many people who find themselves in vulnerable situations following marital breakdown and this Social Welfare Bill should comprehensively remove any sense of threat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Council for the Status of Women is unhappy with the way women are presented as dependants in this Bill.  I share their view.  It is essential that women are recognised as independent in their own right and that must be done in this Bill.  Section 6 provides that a <Col N="1187" /> deserted wife who becomes divorced may continue to be regarded as a deserted wife for the purpose of the deserted wife's allowance scheme or the deserted wife's benefit scheme.  The Minister should address this issue and ensure that the woman's independence in these situations is recognised.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil Party supports the principle that the spouse and children will not be disadvantaged or discriminated against in any way in terms of social welfare entitlement as a result of divorce.  This brings us to the question of cost.  In his speech the Minister said:</P>
    <P>The cost of the provisions in the Bill is minimal in the context of overall social welfare spending.  It is likely to rise to £1 million over the next five years.  Total spending on social welfare support to widows, widowers, lone parents and deserted wives at present is in the order of £630 million a year.  The additional cost, therefore, will have no appreciable impact on the public finances.</P>
    <P>I question this figure of £1 million and ask the Minister to have another look at it.  The precise cost is important.</P>
    <P>We have raised questions as to the circumstances in which the children's allowance will be paid to the spouse. The Minister should address this issue. We have also raised the question of the availability of counselling services and which need to be addressed also. Clearly what is needed is to provide support structures.  This Bill is one element of a larger debate and I speak as someone who supports the thrust of what the Minister is doing.  My party has always recognised the need to provide support structures.  I am proud to look at the history of my party, which provided this support structure through the social welfare code.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Social Welfare in many ways sounds as if he is still a backbencher and is scathing in his comments on Fianna Fáil's genuine criticisms.  He seems to be hurt by references to the famous 2.5 per cent increase in social <Col N="1188" /> welfare payments.  This will mean an increase of £1.50 weekly for old age pensioners, approximately 20p a day.  It is legitimate that the main Opposition party should remind the Minister again and again of this derisory increase.  If we cannot care for that sector in our society, it is a poor reflection on the Government, in particular a Government that claims to represent the disadvantaged.</P>
    <P>I have outlined the Fianna Fáil position on divorce.  I am anxious that we introduce the right legislation in preparation for the divorce referendum.  The Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act is in place and it is our duty to ensure that we introduce a caring Bill.  We have legitimate questions on the detail of the Bill and I ask the Minister to address them.  I am anxious that the position of children will be catered for.</P>
    <P>The argument has been made that the floodgates will open if divorce is introduced but nobody is forced to get divorced. The argument that children will suffer from divorce is not valid.  Children suffer from marital breakdown and I speak from my experience as a teacher.  We as politicians have to live in the real world and deal with this very sensitive issue.  I know that each and every one of us through our contact with the public is conscious that this is a real issue.</P>
    <P>I suggest that if we put all the legislation in place &mdash; and obviously this Bill is a central part of that &mdash; we will get a caring response from the public.  I believe the people will allow for the introduction of divorce in particular circumstances and my party's position is quite clear on that.  We must provide support structures, face up to our responsibilities and allow for divorce in particular circumstances.</P>
    <P>We are asking the Minister to spell out precisely the costings and what exactly the Government has in mind in regard to the question of property, the position of children and all other aspects of this debate.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the Minister for Equality and Law Reform, Deputy <Col N="1189" /> Taylor, who in a methodical and quiet way has dealt with this issue.  He has not looked for headlines but sought consensus. It is admirable that he has acted in this way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the speakers opposite that this is important social legislation.  Nobody would say otherwise. It is a vital part of the jigsaw we must put in place before holding the referendum when we will ask the people later this year if they wish to remove the constitutional ban on divorce.  Much has been said about the mistakes of 1986, the absence of information and the unaddressed problems.  I do not wish to deal with that now because everything in that regard has been said by Deputy Bell and others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is of great importance to underline the need to provide information.  We cannot overestimate the need for parliamentarians and the relevant State and Government agencies to ensure that proper and adequate information is available to the people between now and the holding of the referendum.  It is a huge task and I hope the Minister for <Col N="1190" /> Equality and Law Reform does not underestimate it.  Recent surveys have shown that the people know little of the legislative improvements in the area of family law that have been made since 1986; and the legislation piloted through this House has not been read to any great extent by the citizenry.  It is vitally important to institute a proper and adequate process of information.</P>
    <P>I am particularly pleased the Minister for Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Mervyn Taylor, has embarked on a countrywide programme of seminars. Just yesterday we heard reports from the first of these seminars which was held in Ennis, County Clare.  Further seminars are planned for other regional centres and I hope these seminars will continue to take place throughout the summer so that people in every county will have an opportunity to have their many queries dealt with by a panel of experts.</P>
    <P>I accept the Government will do everything in its power to ensure that if we have divorce legislation next year there will be no loss, financial or otherwise, for the parties involved.  However, we must be realistic and acknowledge that there will be loss, trauma and suffering by virtue of the change in the marital status.  Women, children and, in some cases, men will suffer, but it will not be possible for us as legislators to eradicate that suffering.  Our job is to minimise the suffering.  It is our duty to ensure that women will not suffer needlessly and that the position of children and women will be of prime importance in passing legislation.  This Bill relates directly to the position of women who may be in some way involved in marriage breakdown and subsequent divorce.</P>
    <P>There is a number of questions on the legislation that I would like the Minister to address now or on Committee Stage. The first relates to an anomaly in our social welfare code which has pertained for quite some time and which is not justifiable. When is a divorced person not a divorced person?  There are numerous <Col N="1191" /> women in my constituency whose husbands have disappeared to England or some other foreign jurisdiction and who have served divorce papers on their spouses in this country.  If such a spouse takes no action because she does not wish to accede to the divorce or engage in the divorce proceedings, a divorce is granted to the husband.  If the husband, having been granted his divorce, remarries in England and, some years later, dies, under Irish law his first wife will not be regarded as a widow for pension purposes.  I hope this issue will be addressed under this or other legislation as it places an extraordinary burden on women, many of whom are elderly.  A woman may have a photograph of a headstone in a graveyard in Newcastle-on-Tyne on which is inscribed the fact that her lawful husband died some years ago, but the Department of Social Welfare does not regard such persons as widows for pension purposes.</P>

      <P>The decision by the Government, on the recommendation of Shannon Development, to approve grant support of IR£12 million to Shannon Aerospace for restructuring its operations was based on the implementation by the company of a viable business plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1192" /> As the House is already aware, the restructuring is designed to secure the future of the company, safeguard existing employment of about 700 highly skilled workers and is projected to result in an increase in employment to 855 by the end of the decade.</P>
    <P>The company's restructuring plan also involves large scale private investment, strengthened marketing and technical back-up support and future workload commitment.  In this context, it includes substantial workload commitment by the shareholders, including Lufthansa, over the next two years as well as over the following years to the end of the decade.</P>
    <P>The workload commitment, with projected business from the third party market and the grant and other elements of the support package, should ensure the future of the company which is recognised as being among the most efficient in Europe in the aircraft maintenance sector.  Shannon Development is finalising the necessary legal documents with Shannon Aerospace and the shareholders which embody the commercial terms agreed by the parties.</P>
    <P>As regards the Deputy's reference to the European Commission's investigation of the promised investment, the Commission sought details from the Irish authorities about the proposed aid to Shannon Aerospace to assess the aid in relation to Articles 92 and 93 of the EC Treaty which deal with State aids. This information was forwarded recently to the Commission and it was indicated that the aid was being provided under Ireland's approved existing framework of regional aids to industry. I am confident that the Commission's assessment will not adversely impact on the project.</P>

I understand that the money will <Col N="1193" /> be given in two tranches.  Will the Minister give the money in view of the statement made by Lufthansa?  If so, when? Why did the Minister fail to answer Question No. 109 in which I asked about the claw-back based on definite employment targets?  Why is the Minister keeping that secret to himself and Shannon Aerospace?  If taxpayers' money is used the public is entitled to that information.</P>

      <P>The reports in the newspapers are inaccurate.  Lufthansa has committed work in 1996 and 1997, not just in 1998.  The money will be paid, if and when the final legal documents are agreed, in four phases this year and next year.  There are clear claw-back terms related to the job target of 855.  It is not common practice to give the details of contractual arrangements between SFADCo and any company in answer to parliamentary questions.  This matter is confidential.</P>

      <P>While it may be confidential, public money will be given to a private company and the public have a right to know the performance targets of any firm in receipt of a State grant. The Minister thought it a good idea a year ago to publish firms' job performance targets.  It is not good enough to say it is a private matter when public moneys are involved.  The Minister said the newspaper reports are wrong.  It was reported in <i>The Irish Times, Irish Independent</i> and <i>The Cork Examiner.</i>  Why did the Minister's office not correct those reports?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>There are clear job performance targets.  Current employment is 700 and the job target is 855. The claw-back arrangement relates to the 855 jobs.  Claw-backs form part of the IDA and SFADCo agreements.  If a company does not achieve its targets the Government claws back moneys which have been advanced.  It is inaccurate to say there is not any commitment to a workload in the following two years.  I am clarifying that for the Deputy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">

      <P>No.  Part of the agreement, in the light of the business circumstances of the industry which changed considerably in recent years, was to revise the target to the present one of 855.  The employment projection was revised downwards and the claw-back clause relates to the present job target of 855.</P>

      <Quest>the latest arrangements worked out between himself, his Minister of State, his Department, management and workers at Packard.</Quest>

      <P>In the unique circumstances of this industrial relations dispute and when it became clear that an acceptable settlement to both sides was remote and closure a very real probability, my involvement and that of the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, was to invite both sides in the Packard dispute to my office on the evening of Thursday, 1 June.  We afforded both sides the opportunity to discuss the differences between them.</P>
      <P>Over that evening, we heard from them both jointly and separately on their points of difference and on the obstacles to a resolution of the dispute. Those exchanges and the points of difference or difficulty that they identified were, of course, confidential.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, as a result of those contacts, we gave each side a suggestion for bridging the gap between them on the following morning.  The suggestion that we provided was given to the parties in the dispute for their assistance.  While they based their final settlement on it, <Col N="1195" /> they amended it, I believe, in several material respects in the ensuing period of bilateral discussion.  They finally came to a mutually satisfactory agreement bilaterally.  That agreement is a matter between both sides and neither the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, nor I was party to its evolution or terms.</P>
    <P>I understand that the main issues are already known and include the following separate but interrelated matters: redundancy terms for 41 workers already laid off for more than a year; adherence to the January agreement; terms affecting those going on temporary lay-off and investment in the plant.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that this dispute has been resolved.  The company has, I understand, committed itself to the future of the plant and it is now important that both sides work together, in the most co-operative spirit, to achieve productivity and costs that will assist the plant to regain business and return to full capacity utilisation and employment in the shortest possible time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the Minister's sense of relief at the resolution of the dispute.  I put down this question because the Minister neglected to tell me that last January Mr. Schramm had written him a letter in which he said there would be 400 layoffs in the middle of the year.  He subsequently said he had received that letter.  I understand from people within the company that the deal brokered by the Minister and the Minister of State on 1 June and put to the management and workers has been varied.  Is the Minister satisfied that the workers know about this change or has he now embarked on a path where one side say one thing and the other side do not know what the changes are?  The deliberate withholding of facts by the Minister and his Department last January played a part in the crisis which arose in April-May.  I fail to understand why the Minister told me on that occasion that he had not heard of the <Col N="1196" /> figure of 400 when he had received a letter referring to this figure from David Schramm and had replied to it.  On what day will 400 workers in Packard be let go?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The date for the 400 layoffs was 23 June.  I roundly reject the suggestion that the Minister of State or I deliberately withheld facts from the workforce.  That letter was totally out of context in terms of our discussions.  I told the Deputy I had roundly rejected the letter in the first instance and had clearly explained to the management that if that was their interpretation they would have to explain this to the workforce, otherwise they would mislead them.  The figure of 400 was not part of the discussions or arrangements and did not surface during the course of later discussions.</P>
      <P>We indicated a certain basis for an agreement which we thought would be mutually acceptable.  The agreement reached by the unions and the management in bilateral discussions, to which we were not privy, was along the lines of our agreement but it differed in material respects.  Obviously the company and unions would be in the best position to explain this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not particularly concerned about the hierarchies of the management or unions, I am concerned about the workers.  When I asked the Minister if he had received a letter from David Schramm last January which stated there would be 400 layoffs he categorically said he had not.  When I asked him the same question two weeks later he said he had received a letter from him and had replied to it.  I do not understand how the Minister could have forgotten he had received a letter which said there would be 400 job losses when he had replied to it.  I am not concerned about the context in which the Minister received that letter or the way in which he roundly rejected the suggestion in it; rather I am concerned that in reply to a question from me the Minister said he <Col N="1197" /> had not received a letter which referred to a figure of 400 layoffs.  I am also concerned about the trust between the workers and management.</P>

It is very important to rebuild trust between both sides which we have been endeavouring to do.  There is a basis for trust and I am sure the Deputy heard the statement by the shop steward that the workforce is committed to the future of the plant and to winning new business.  This commitment by the workforce is a good foundation on which to build trust in the plant.</P>

      <QRef>[10971/95]</QRef>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 and 16 together.</P>
      <P>I refer the Deputies to the conclusions of the Competition Authority in its interim report on the newspaper industry, in particular, the conclusions in regard to predatory pricing.  As the authority pointed out, this has a specific meaning.  In order to sustain a claim of predatory pricing, it is first essential to establish that the alleged predator is dominant.  The authority concluded that none of the UK newspapers could be said to have a dominant position in any newspaper market within the State.  It was, therefore, of the view that there is no evidence to support claims that UK newspaper groups have engaged in predatory pricing of newspapers within the State.  It said that in order to establish that predatory pricing has taken, or is taking, place the strict criteria which are required had not been met in the case of UK newspapers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Predatory pricing has a precise definition. It is a policy of price cutting by a firm in a dominant position which is designed to reduce or eliminate the competition which it faces so that it can reap higher profits at a later stage as a result of the elimination of its competition. In order for pricing to be regarded as predatory profits are reduced for a period of time in order <Col N="1200" /> that the long term effect on the market will ensure that these profits can be higher at a later stage when competition is eliminated.  To demonstrate predatory pricing it is necessary to show that the objective of price cutting is to reduce the number of competitors by eliminating one or more of them or to weaken them to a point that they can no longer offer effective competition.  Another criteria in order to benefit from a predatory pricing policy is that the firm should be able to earn supra-normal profits in the future arising from the elimination of competition.  However, where there are low barriers of entry to a market the elimination of competition may only serve to attract other competition into the market, rendering the business of predatory pricing pointless.</P>
    <P>The Competition Authority distinguished between predatory pricing and aggressive price competition and its conclusion was that Irish newspapers may have suffered due to aggressive competition from UK newspapers. However, aggressive competition in the market place is not illegal.  The authority was of the view that predatory pricing was not taking place in the Irish market in regard to UK newspapers since the objective of the pricing policy of the UK newspapers was not to eliminate competitors or to defer them from competing aggressively.</P>
    <P>The Competition Authority indicated that given the nature of the Irish newspaper industry and the large number of titles on the market, predatory pricing by one foreign newspaper could not ensure with certainty that consumers would switch to its titles.  Therefore, the title accused of predatory pricing would not be able to earn the supra-normal profits necessary to make predatory pricing worthwhile and it would not also eliminate the competition.  Arising from this, therefore, the Competition Authority was of the view that predatory pricing by UK newspapers was not taking place.  I have accepted the Competition Authority conclusions.  Therefore, there is no action to be taken in regard to the pricing policy of UK newspapers.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1201" /> As regards the <i>Sunday Tribune,</i> it may well be that their recent decision to reduce its cover price selectively in certain areas of the country is part of a strategy to improve market share.  It has the appearance to date of a short term strategy.  It remains to be seen whether this policy is to be sustained or widened for a longer period.  The action to date appears to be a marketing drive in selective areas and I will monitor the position in the medium term to establish whether, in the light of their actions this may constitute anti-competitive behaviour.  I note that this selective action runs counter to the trend in Irish newspapers and the fact that three Irish Sunday newspapers increased their prices to consumers last December.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that the Competition Authority dealt with the cost structure of the Tribune Group in its recent report and the Independent Group's continued involvement in the <i>Sunday Tribune.</i>  This question will be considered in the context of my overall response to the Competition Authority's report.</P>
    <P>Section 6 of the Competition Act, 1991, allows firms who are aggrieved by alleged anti-competitive action to initiate action in the courts should they so wish.  Ultimately decisions in such matters are for the courts to determine.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's response is extraordinary.  First, he quotes the Competition Authority's report which was produced before <i>The Sun</i> engaged recently in what I can only describe as the beginning of a price war.  Now two newspapers in the News International Group have scratch cards which are in contravention of the Gaming and Lotteries Act, 1956, yet the Government had not done anything about it.  Will the Minister accept that if we have a price war here none of the Irish newspapers will be able to withstand it, with the possible exception of the Independent group?  Second, will the Minister accept there is no control here on below cost selling except in the grocery trade?  Has the Minister any plans to introduce <Col N="1202" /> legislation to prohibit below cost selling in this market?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The existing law is precise as to what predatory pricing means.  The basis of the Competition Authority report is that price cutting by a newspaper, such as the one referred to by the Deputy, would not constitute a breach of competition law.  Certainly, I would be concerned about a price war and its impact on newspapers.  This issue was raised in the course of the discussions I had in this regard.  The Deputy is right in saying there are no controls on below cost selling, except in the grocery trade.  The National Newspapers of Ireland are examining the question of whether there should be a below cost selling provision in relation to newspapers.  I will assess any proposals put to me in that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister seems to be adopting the position that if other people think it is necessary he might do something but he does not appear to have any initiative of his own in mind. Does the Minister believe there is a need to introduce legislation to ban below cost selling?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is one of the issues we have to assess carefully.  The Deputy is probably aware that a number of Governments, including the Government of which the Deputy was a member, was of the view that the Grocery Order was not a satisfactory vehicle and that the existing controls on below cost selling effectively were not operable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am examining the issue of below cost selling.  It would raise considerable problems in an administrative sense in that one would have to define prices which would be quite difficult. There is no simple straightforward answer; I could respond to a parliamentary question indicating that I am or am <Col N="1203" /> not in favour.  This would be a significant change in relation to Irish competition law and would need to be considered further before I would be in a position to say whether I would support such legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Minister does not sit by, as he did in the case of the <i>Irish Press</i> group, and wait until all the newspapers cease publication before considering introducing legislation when it is too late.  The Minister should give serious consideration to the urgent implementation of legislation in this area which many people feel is necessary. Will the Minister accept that the scratch cards in the <i>News of the World</i> last Sunday and in <i>The Sun</i> yesterday are directly in contravention of the Gaming and Lotteries Act, 1956?  Why has the Government not taken action on this matter?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>

      <Quest>the reason he has failed to allocate the £6 million in his budget for local area projects to help the jobless in view of the growing number of long term unemployed.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to the £6 million allocated in this year's budget for the establishment of a local employment service.  As this is a new service the legal authority for expenditure under the relevant subhead must be obtained from the Dáil before it can be incurred.  I expect the formal motion for the approval of my Department's Vote will be put before this House in the near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1204" /> The local employment service is in the process of being set up and will operate initially in the existing 12 <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> area partnerships plus two other areas.  Local management committees have been put in place in the 12 area partnerships and they are presently drawing up plans for the establishment of the local employment service in their areas.  As the Deputy is aware, the deadline set for the submission of the plans by the task force on long term unemployment is end June 1995.  I am currently awaiting receipt of these plans. Until I receive them and have had them evaluated it is not possible to allocate funding.  I can assure the Deputy, however, that there will be no undue delay in allocating funds when the plans are agreed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will be aware that the percentage number of long term unemployed has grown during the past six months.  In that context it is alarming that the Minister, having been allocated £6 million in the budget, has failed to pass on that money to help those who need it most, the long term unemployed.  It is unbelievable that five months into the year the Minister has £6 million resting in some repository and that he is awaiting proposals to spend it when it was specifically allocated by the Minister for Finance to assist the long term unemployed.</P>

      <P>I am sure it was the Minister who set the deadline for the submission of plans by local committees. Was the deadline set by the Minister for Finance or by Europe?  The Minister set the date.  There is no urgency or compelling force about the Minister in regard to employment.  He should have told the local committees they had one month in which to submit their proposals as he wished to give the money, where it was required, to aid the jobless.  Is it not a shame, considering that the Minister said his priority was to tackle long term unemployment that the number has increased considerably during the past six months?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 5, 6 and 10 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In considering what action to take on the Competition Authority's interim report of its study of the newspaper industry with the assistance of legal advice, I have considered all the options open to me, including an investigation under section 14 of the Competition Act, 1991.  Legal advice is that using section 14 is not a realistic option. Section 14 provides that, where the Minister is of the opinion that there is, contrary to section 5 of the Act, an abuse of a dominant position he may request the Authority to carry out an investigation.  Given that the Authority has already concluded in its interim report that the Independent's investment in and loans to Irish Press constitute a breach of sections 4 and 5 of the Act, it is unlikely that the Authority would reach different conclusions under a section 14 investigation.  The section 14 investigation could be open to challenge on the grounds that the Authority was biased, since it had already reached a conclusion on the matter in its recent report, and on the grounds of natural and constitutional justice.  A further disadvantage with a section 14 investigation is that it would be limited to the issue of abuse of a dominant position contrary to section 5 of the Act and could not deal with a breach of section 4, anti-competitive agreements.  A <Col N="1208" /> section 14 investigation would also be a lengthy process.</P>
    <P>I have deferred taking a decision on the recommendations of the Competition Authority's report in the light of the recent decision by the board of Irish Press Newspapers to convene an extraordinary general meeting of shareholders on 28 June for the purpose of appointing a liquidator to the company. The board has also decided to convene a meeting of creditors pursuant to section 266 of the Companies Act, 1963. There is no role for me as Minister in the process on which the company has embarked.</P>
    <P>I have already expressed the view, and I repeat it that the situation the <i>Irish Press</i> finds itself in is essentially a business situation compounded by industrial relations problems.  The Irish Press titles have been suffering radically declining circulation over a long period. The relaunch of the <i>Irish Press</i> in tabloid form in 1988 did not assist the decline in circulation.  The group has also had unhappy investment experiences with the Ingersol group which have gone seriously wrong, which has led to protracted litigation.  The recent Supreme Court judgement represented a further serious setback for the Irish Press group.  The industrial relations record of the company over a long period has been far from good and the current difficulties are a further indication of that.</P>
    <P>My decision on the alleged breaches of competition law has nothing to do with the current situation in the <i>Irish Press.</i>  The key issue for the group is new, additional investment.</P>
    <P>A decision on whether the Independent group's investment in and loans to the Irish Press group are in breach of sections 4 and 5 of the Competition Act, 1991, can only be made by the courts on foot of what would undoubtedly be a lengthy court action.  A decision to pursue such an action at this time would not offer any immediate solution to the current situation facing the Irish Press group.</P>
    <P>I am, however, keeping the evolving <Col N="1209" /> situation under continuous review and taking appropriate legal advice.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable that the Irish Press group has decided to pursue the option of liquidation rather than seek new investors on the basis of a viable business plan.  The question of seeking new investors rests primarily with those involved, the new investors or the <i>Irish Press</i> as it currently exists.  It is up to shareholders to look to possible future scenarios.  I have no direct role in that. The country would be a better place if a revitalised <i>Irish Press</i> could have a viable, vibrant and commercial future.</P>
    <P>In regard to the industrial relations issues, the Labour Relations institutions and in particular the Labour Court remain available to provide whatever assistance the parties might require.  I again urge the management and unions involved to use the interim period to resolve their difficulties.  I would remind all parties that the consequences of the overall situation facing the <i>Irish Press</i> are very serious, especially for the 600 employees and their families.</P>
    <P>The forum on the future of the newspaper industry which was held on 8 May was attended by a wide range of interests, including proprietors, journalists, editors, trade union representatives, academics and politicians.  The purpose of the forum was to stimulate a genuine public debate about newspaper ownership and competition in the industry. The main topics addressed were &ldquo;Newspapers in the Democratic Market Economy&rdquo; and &ldquo;Employment in the Newspaper Industry; Meeting the Competitive Challenge&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The forum was additional to a series of meetings I held with newspaper owners and editors and the social partners, the purpose of which was to give the major interests in the newspaper industry an opportunity of making their future plans and intentions known to me following the report of the Competition Authority.  I regret that the management of Irish Press group chose to stay away from the forum.</P>

As the Deputy will be aware, there was an industrial dispute followed by the Supreme Court's finding in respect of relations between Ingersol and the Irish Press.  The directors of the <i>Irish Press</i> decided to put the company into liquidation as a consequence and are proposing to hold meetings to conduct that business.</P>

      <P>I find the Minister's attitude extraordinary.  He is taking this view because he does not want to get tough with any of the newspaper interests.  Although I agree he was not the cause of the problem, he has added to it.  Does he accept that under the Competition Act he could have made an order, the effect of which would have been that the Irish Independent group would have had to divest itself of its interest in the <i>Irish Press</i> and that it is only in those circumstances there is any possibility of attracting new outside investors?</P>

      <P>The only way I can deal with the issue to which the Deputy referred is by initiating a High Court action.  Under section 14 there is the power to initiate an investigation leading to the making of an order.  It would not be feasible to make an order without adopting a section 14 approach.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The issue of initiating a section 14 report is not a viable option. Legal advice is that such an option would be open to considerable challenge in the courts, involving a very lengthy process with a delay before the matter could be considered by the Minister. A difficult court case would ensure because issues would arise not only of competition law but also of constitutional and natural justice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister accept this hands-off approach has left everybody in the dark?  To suggest that he must stand back for the shareholders to meet and to allow for the process of liquidation is reneging on his responsibility. Traditionally Ministers in the same position as he would have adopted a much more hands-on approach to this matter.  This is a broad issue about the future of the <i>Irish Press.</i>  Surely the public, particularly the 600 workers involved, should expect a hands-on approach.</P>
      <P>The Minister talked about his wish for additional investment in the company and the need for a revitalised <i>Irish Press,</i> but we would much prefer to see a proactive Minister making decisions in regard to the Competition Authority and showing the way as suggested by many commentators and parties involved in the dispute.  Rather than simply making statements, the Minister should become involved in bringing the parties together to ensure the future of the <i>Irish Press.</i></P>

      <P>The Deputy misunderstands the scope of a Minister.  I cannot create new investors or a viable business plan for the <i>Irish Press.</i>  I am not privy to the financial circumstances that led to the decision to liquidate the company.  I do not have the powers to deal with those matters; it is up to private shareholders to find investors to back business plans for their company.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister seems to adopt the attitude that if somebody is big and strong enough to threaten legal challenge it has the effect of neutralising the Minister.  If Governments were to behave like that they might as well not exist.  When the Independent group sought to increase its shareholding in <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> from 29.9 per cent to 53 per cent, one of the Minister's predecessors was threatened with legal action and although a plenary summons was issued it never materialised.  I urge the Minister to have the courage to do the job for which he was appointed and make a decision in this matter.  If he does not, there will be no new investors in the <i>Irish Press.</i></P>

He requested the Competition Authority to produce a report under the most minor provision &mdash; section 11 &mdash; of the relevant legislation while he could have requested it to produce a report under <Col N="1214" /> section 14.  Even when he received the report, he set up a forum and then did not honour his own commitment to make a decision within a month.  Now we are told there is no point in making a decision because there might be a legal challenge to it.  The Minister is acting in a cowardly way.

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The broad thrust of current policies is succeeding in increasing employment and reducing unemployment.  I expect a further significant rise in employment in 1995 following on from employment growth of 2.6 per cent in 1994.  The Central Bank forecasts that non-agricultural employment could grow by 37,000 persons in the period to April 1995.  Unemployment continues to fall.  Measured unemployment is edging downward.  While not as quickly as we would all wish, the trend is still going in the right direction. The number of persons on the live register declined by some 11,200 in the first five months of this year.</P>
      <P>Government policy on employment has many facets.  As a first step it is clearly necessary to maintain appropriate macroeconomic policies which encourage sustainable economic and employment growth.  Business confidence and investment depends on a positive macroeconomic framework and this Government is strongly committed to maintaining and building such a framework.  The recent measures announced by the Minister for Finance are clear testament to this commitment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is also essential that we promote measures which help ensure that the fruits of economic growth manifest themselves in increased jobs.  The <Col N="1216" /> Government in its recent budget introduced a number of measures designed to lower the cost associated with job creation.  Among the measures introduced were: the annual income threshold below which the lower rate of employer's PRSI of 9 per cent applies has been increased from £9,000 to £12,000; the employers' PRSI exemption scheme is being extended to include all first time workers under the age of 23 who meet the conditions; the standard rate of corporation tax has been reduced from 40 per cent to 38 per cent and we plan to push it down further in line with European norms, as resources allow.  These budget measures, now in force following the adoption of the Finance Act, 1995, should result in increased employment by lowering the costs of employing people as well as improving the profitability of Irish businesses.</P>
    <P>With the right economic conditions in place the goal of my Department and the development agencies is to help firms to increase their competitiveness, thus create and maintain jobs.  I refer the Deputy to my detailed reply to Deputy Bertie Ahern on 15 March 1995 in this House on the measures being taken by the development agencies designed to attract foreign industry and to increase the employment potential of indigenous firms.  The Operational Programme for Industry 1994-99 which I launched earlier this year sets clear targets for jobs and sales.</P>
    <P>While these measures will create additional jobs, I am conscious of the need to ensure that all members of our society, especially the young and unemployed, have access to these new opportunities.</P>
    <P>I am committed to pursuing a range of active labour market measures to improve access to jobs which include the provision of work and the development of job-related skills.</P>
    <P>Community employment is a measure of particular relevance to tackling long term unemployment.  This programme <Col N="1217" /> will provide an average of 40,000 opportunities throughout 1995, which represents a significant increase over the average participation level of 30,960 in 1994.  The achievement of this higher level of participation was approved by Government last month and is a testament to our commitment in this area.</P>
    <P>Training, involving an upgrading of skills, is also a further important measure in improving employment opportunities.  This year training is being provided by FÁS for 16,000 persons.  In addition to maintaining and increasing the momentum of existing policies which, as I outlined, are working well, work on the development of new initiatives is also in progress.</P>
    <P>A new unit has been established in my Department to oversee the putting in place of the local employment service as recommended by the Task Force on Long-Term Unemployment.  As I indicated, the new service will be established initially in the 12 partnership areas.  Management committees have been established and implementation plans are being developed by the committees. The new unit will also come forward with policy proposals for initiatives to reduce the number of long term unemployed and to better co-ordinate the delivery of State services to the unemployed.</P>
    <P>My Department is also working on a comprehensive White Paper on Human Resource Development and Training. This will address important policy issues such as the skills gap, in-company training and ensuring maximum value from the training budget.  As part of the preparation of the White Paper, extensive consultations with the social partners and other interested parties are taking place and these are at an advanced stage.  The White Paper will be published as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>It is clear that it will require a strong and sustained national effort to remedy the unemployment problem.  No single solution can solve such a complex and multifaceted problem.  I am committed <Col N="1218" /> to reviewing our policies in this area in the light of changing trends, opportunities and threats to ensure that the solutions we pursue remain the best strategy for the future.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  I preface my remarks by saying that my question was much broader, but parts of it were disallowed.  Like the Minister, I have a particular interest in the northside of Dublin.  Given that Dublin is an unemployment blackspot, will the Minister indicate what measures will be introduced to address its problem? This morning Members will have heard my party Leader, Deputy Ahern, talk about the merger of the ICC, the ACC and the alliance with the TSB and we hear of job losses.  When we hear of the package for Aer Lingus we hear of job losses, and the same applies to the package for TEAM Aer Lingus.</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely" hpid="Mr. Callely Mr. Callely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>Every issue to which the Government refers involves a penalty clause in terms of job losses.  Will the Minister indicate the measures he proposes to introduce to address unemployment in Dublin and to reduce the number of unemployed, particularly in the northside of the city?  He referred to community employment and we are all aware of the curtailment in that area. He referred to small firms&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I will reply to the questions in the order they were asked. I reject the Deputy's suggestion that the Government's record regarding community employment is anything but of the highest quality.  As the Deputy should be aware, the Fianna Fáil caretaker Government provided Estimates which would have resulted in a decrease <Col N="1219" /> to 26,000 in the community employment figures by the end of the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>On two occasions the Government made funding available to deal with this issue by introducing an extra £23 million in the budget and subsequently introducing an additional £10 million.</P>
      <P>The Government clearly recognises the unemployment blackspots many, but not all, of which are in Dublin.  The local employment service to which I referred is being established in the partnership areas.  They will include much of the Deputy's constituency in the northside and other areas in which there are unemployment blackspots, particularly Tallaght, Finglas and Ballymun, areas with an established unemployment problem which that service has been extended to cover.  I reject the Deputy's suggestion of a penalty clause in respect of employment in this Government.  If the Deputy checks the notified redundancy figures, it is clear that since the Government took office there has been a considerable drop in the number of redundancies.  Employment is increasing and the challenge is to find measures to ensure that those who are unemployed, not only new entrants to the labour force, gain access to it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not an exaggeration to say that the Minister's reply was a model of gobbledegook.  I thought he would put his slant on answers and give straightforward replies, but he has fallen swiftly and comfortably into the trap of relying on the answer produced for him. Does he accept that we have the worst unemployment record of all OECD countries?  Does he understand that in his and other constituencies the Department of Enterprise and Employment and the title of the Minister for Enterprise and Employment no longer holds any coinage or respect because the number of long term unemployed as a percentage of the total number unemployed has increased during the past six months and he has done nothing constructive about it?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy read the Central Bank report she would realise it believes there will be a reduction in community employment which led it to revise its figures downwards, but the Government dealt with the issue by reversing the threatened reduction in community employment.  It has long been advocated that we need a better designed local employment service attuned to the needs of the long term unemployed.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8, 14 and 59 together.</P>
      <P>Responsibility for overall trade in the context of GATT and the newly-formed World Trade Organisation is primarily the responsibility of the Minister for Tourism and Trade.  That Department represents Ireland in the decision-making process at official and ministerial level with appropriate back-up from other Government Departments, including the Department of Enterprise and Employment.  The Uruguay Round is a major boost for the world economy and should have positive benefits for Ireland, as an export oriented country, in terms of output and employment. The achievement of a stable world trading environment and the benefits of ongoing liberalisation of world trade should by far outweigh any adverse sectoral specific impacts of the agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The agreement provides challenges to some sensitive sectors, including clothing and textiles.  During the GATT negotiations particular account was taken of the fact that the clothing and textile sectors could experience difficulties. My Department ensured that particular attention was paid to the sensitivity of these sectors for Ireland.  Our objective was to ensure that the integration of the Multi-Fibre Arrangement &mdash; MFA &mdash; into GATT would be gradual and linked to a strengthening of GATT rules and disciplines.  The latter would address the question of lower tariffs, fewer non-tariff barriers, more transparent anti-dumping provisions, restrictions on the use of subsidies and <Col N="1227" /> greater protection of intellectual property rights.  This overall objective has largely been achieved in the agreement finally adopted in April 1994 which came into effect on 1 January 1995.  A ten year integration period &mdash; in three phases &mdash; for clothing and textiles, beginning on 1 January 1995, was agreed.  This is designed to allow these sectors time to restructure and reposition themselves to concentrate on the higher quality segment of the market. The overall opening up of new markets under the Uruguay Round will facilitate this process.  I should add that arrangements for the first phase of the integration have been agreed at EU level. My Department took an active role in ensuring that this phase of the transition period does not include products which are sensitive for Ireland.</P>
    <P>As regards the broader issues raised in the questions relating to the current state of the clothing sector, I am anxious to ensure that the publicity arising from recent specific problem cases does not detract from the overall performance of the sector where output continues to increase.  I want to state categorically that this Government, and in particular my Department, is fully committed to supporting the efforts of the clothing sector to restructure and develop with the objective of maintaining the maximum number of jobs possible.  I met the representative body for the clothing sector, the Irish Clothing Manufacturers Federation, to discuss the issues facing the sector.  In addition, regular meetings are held with the federation at official level.  I am well acquainted with the environment in which this sector operates arising from my contacts with the ICMF and individual companies.  I reiterate that there is no let-up in support or no policy change in relation to the clothing sector and clothing companies continue to benefit from a wide range of schemes operated by the various industrial promotion agencies.  In addition to these incentives, a number of sectoral specific initiatives have been taken.  Two special schemes <Col N="1228" /> covering research/development and training were introduced; FÁS has drawn up a comprehensive training programme encompassing 12 separate training initiatives ranging from management training to multi-skilling; my Department assisted the ICMF in securing EU funding for a special training scheme which is designed to train &ldquo;in-house&rdquo; instructors, and clothing companies have also been significant beneficiaries under the European Commission RETEX scheme.</P>
    <P>Clothing companies will also be in a position to benefit under a new programme to help Irish manufacturing firms to adapt to changing internal or external conditions.  ICTU and IBEC have been involved in drawing up a scheme to give effect to this programme. This is aimed at indigenous and traditional manufacturing sectors with a need to adjust to increasingly demanding conditions of competition.</P>
    <P>On a more general note, I should mention that labour-intensive, low income industries like the clothing sector benefited from the PRSI and income tax changes introduced in this year's budget.  This shows the Government's commitment to address the key issue of cost competitiveness vital for the future of the sector.  I know from my contacts with the industry that this has been a major help in tackling this issue.  The changes in the budget earlier this year are part of an ongoing process of tax reform aimed at increasing the incentive to work and reducing the tax wedge.</P>
    <P>A major study of the sector was commissioned by FÁS in 1991 which comprehensively identified the issues which need to be addressed.  My Department carries out regular policy reviews of the sector in consultation with the State agencies.  My Department and the development agencies are working closely in a co-ordinated and focused manner with the main industry associations with a view to securing an agreed approach to tackling the problems facing the sector, thereby improving the competitive position of the industry. This process is already well under way <Col N="1229" /> and it is intended to meet all bodies who have expressed concerns about the sector. Therefore the main players will be involved in charting a way forward.  I believe that the process should proceed rather than delay it further through the establishment of a separate initiative.</P>
    <P>Ireland is not unique in experiencing problems in the clothing sector.  Other EU member states have not been immune from the effects of increasing competition.  I assure the House that our policies are geared towards building strong companies that can compete in both the domestic and international markets.  I am satisfied that every effort is being made to ensure that the sector will have a viable and secure future.</P>

In the case of Sunbeam, the moneys provided for its relaunch in Cork did not come from this fund but from Forbairt.

The Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, may smile as much as he likes but he was very much more energetic in relation to Packard than to Sunbeam.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that the scheme Deputy O'Rourke mentioned was designed to foresee problems, to allow for early intervention and prevention of crisis.

Unfortunately, despite that, Sunbeam was unable to turn the corner and restore profitability to its operations.  Following those renewed difficulties Forbairt engaged in a number of consultations, deployed consultants and worked with the then owners and other potential investors.

That does not mean we can prevent every potential job loss; inevitably there will be changes within industry and job losses will occur, as has been the case in this sector over recent years.  What is important is that we endeavour to maximise jobs through policies that will allow us invest in a timely way in restructuring those businesses, giving them a long term future, with the maximum possible employment content.</P>

Its failure to introduce the market development fund for export purposes, with the high 9 per cent PRSI levy on employers, compared with 5 per cent in the case of their British counterparts, are the main causes of the problem within that industry, putting jobs like those in Sunbeam Wolsey in Cork in jeopardy where 200 people will be thrown on the scrapheap thus reneging on the promise of a Member of the House in the last by-election in Cork.</P>

      <P>Thank you.  I wish to make one further point on this important legislation.  We must provide the public with the appropriate information on all aspects of the changes envisaged consequent on the successful passage of a divorce referendum.  We suffered in this regard in 1986.  The people did not have sufficient information and they voted accordingly. Unless an appropriate level of detailed information is provided, the request to the people to lift the constitutional ban on divorce will be rejected.  In this regard I am pleased with the progress to date.  The Minister and the Minister of State have given a lead by ensuring that full and detailed information will be provided to the public.  The seminars arranged by the Minister for Equality and Law Reform are to be welcomed and I hope they continue on a widespread basis.</P>
      <P>I draw attention to the complexity of the social welfare code.  In a small State of 3.5 million people, we have succeeded in building up a complex system of social welfare despite attempts at consolidation.  It will come as no surprise when I draw attention to the complexity of our social welfare code.  We have succeeded in building up a most complex system of social welfare in spite of attempts to consolidate it.  The most frequent issues people raise at my constituency clinics are social welfare matters. People are not looking for benefits to which they are not entitled but are seeking information to ensure they can avail of various schemes.  I was not surprised that the Ombudsman in his report drew the attention of the Government to the complexity of our social welfare code.  He states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1276" /> Because of the complexity and inaccessibility of some of this legislation, it is not surprising that complainants are frequently not in a position to articulate a reasoned legal argument in support of their complaints.</P>
    <P>The appendix lists the numbers of complaints by way of query on the social welfare code.  There were 677 queries over the spectrum of social welfare from unemployment assistance to pre-retirement allowance, carer's allowance and maternity benefit.  Compare this to the 79 complaints on education, 24 complaints about the Department of the Environment and 145 complaints about the Revenue Commissioners.  By and large &mdash; without having read the 82 page report &mdash; one can see that complaints about social welfare matters exceed those in any other area.  That tallies with what I am hearing at clinics and how I represent my constituents in the course of my duties as a public representative. Far too much of my time is taken up dealing with queries on behalf of people who should have an alternative source of information.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa, and his Minister of State, Deputy Durkan, who have taken it upon themselves to provide a proper information service by setting up the citizens advice bureaux; at this stage there is one in almost every county town and there is a programme in place to develop that service.  This is a very worthwhile service to the community. The National Social Services Board, through its good offices, has embarked upon a programme of providing information throughout the community. Publications by the Department of Social Welfare in the form of information leaflets has improved substantially in recent times and credit should be given to the public relations section in the Department which has begun the process of providing easily read, concise and detailed information.  That is extremely important and should continue. Until we have a proper and <Col N="1277" /> adequate system of citizens advice bureaux throughout the country the public representatives will carry the burden of dealing with day-to-day social welfare queries many of which should be dealt with other than by public representatives.</P>
    <P>This is worthwhile legislation.  Deputy Tom Kitt asked to whom the children's allowance will be paid.  I do not wish to pre-empt the Minister's reply but I am sure he will confirm that the children's allowance will be paid to the guardian of the child in the residence where the child or children are living.  It would be preposterous to think otherwise.  I do not know the point Deputy Kitt is making in that regard.  The paying of maintenance by a divorced person to his former wife and children is always going to be difficult.  The basis of maintenance payments is to ensure that his former wife and family are adequately looked after but the reality in a western industrialised society is that the remuneration for employment does not allow for the upkeep and maintenance of a second home.  That is the difficulty and it will be extremely hard to address it in the context of our support systems.  The State will have a responsibility to ensure the security of the former wife and children, however, the primary responsibility in my view will rest with the person who has entered into a maintenance agreement.  It will be extremely difficult for any individual to make adequate payments to keep two families.  I am pleased to see that the family income supplement scheme has been extended. I look forward to teasing out many of the complex issues on Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>This Bill has the support of my party.  However, it strikes me that it was hastily put together. Many of its provisions, particularly the wording, are insulting to women.  The last thing a modern woman needs to be told is that she is a dependant but throughout this Bill there are references to this.  Women need and demand to be independent and we should ensure <Col N="1278" /> there is provision for this in our legislation. The archaic mechanism for putting Bills through the House often does not take cognisance of this.  In this instance several phrases are in need of fine-tooth combing.</P>
      <P>Women need to be independent, not categorised as dependent.  That is important for the well being and emotional stability of the individual.  In this Bill entitlements are discussed as against the rights of the individual, particularly the rights of the women. There are conditions attached to entitlements, and I am certain the Minister did not have that in mind when framing this Bill.  A woman is dependent for her rights on her relationship to a man.  In section 7, for example, a divorced woman whose former husband is imprisoned is entitled to apply for a prisoner's wife's allowance.  The word &ldquo;spouse&rdquo; not only covers a husband or wife but also a party to a marriage which has been dissolved.  There are myriad ambiguities in the Bill which requires closer attention.  The word &ldquo;husband&rdquo; is defined in different ways. The word &ldquo;family&rdquo; seems to be getting a new definition, and the word &ldquo;couple&rdquo; gets a new definition in this Bill.  In regard to family, one must ask if the definition in this Bill is in line with the definition in the Constitution which deals with the preservation of the family.</P>
      <P>I mean no disrespect to the Minister of State, Deputy Durkan, because I recognise him as an able and hardworking Minister, but this Bill is of such fundamental importance that the Minister responsible in this area should have presented himself before the Dáil today irrespective of any other committee meeting in the House.  It is an insult to the House that he has not done so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1991, 55,000 people were declared separated and this figure is rising. Recent estimates indicate it is now about 75,000 people.  Under the Constitution we must do everything possible to preserve the family as a unit in our <Col N="1279" /> society, and we must ensure that mechanisms are in place to help, exhort and encourage people to continue in stable relationships.  That must be emphasised before dealing with this Bill.  However, we cannot ignore the 75,000 people separated and experiencing difficulties in their marriage and we must legislate for it because it seems this phenomenon will increase in the next few years.  Marriage breakdown is a reality and, in putting legislation together, we must take into account the upheaval and trauma that results for the affected parties and their children.  We must also be careful not to leave threats hanging over people &mdash;in the run up to the last divorce referendum it was the uncertainty that upset people and prevented that referendum from being carried.  I welcome this Bill in that it removes some of the threats, but I am not certain it provides for the financial well being of the individuals who will be involved in divorce proceedings, particularly the spouse who is left to care for the children.</P>
    <P>I am particularly perturbed by the Minister's costings which he estimates at about £1 million over five years.  If divorce is introduced that will not be nearly enough.  When I speak of removing threats and alleviating fears I remember the Minister, Deputy De Rossa, in Opposition when everything seemed rosy to him, making promises as to the well being of the marginalised in our society.  However, in this Government's first budget the Minister for Social Welfare gave only a 2.5 per cent increase to widows and others and, as we have already seen, inflation will far outstrip that.  Costs in many areas have increased alarmingly, but pensioners and others are getting 20p a day to see them through the rise in inflation and other costs.</P>
    <P>If I was separated or contemplating separation I would have to seriously question the intentions of this Minister and his powers to produce the type of revenue that will be needed to meet the costs entailed in this Bill, because there <Col N="1280" /> will be major problems in getting funding from the State.  A vital question is what the State must pay.  What happens in the case of people who are already legally separated for five or ten years? If the referendum is carried, can they be deemed to have served the sentence of separation specified in the divorce legislation? Will we have to continue to pay people who have been divorced not once but twice or three times?</P>
    <P>The Minister should indicate if there will be a limit on State spending.  He should examine the accommodation facilities which exist for lone parents and separated persons.  In future it will probably be impossible to provide sufficient housing as, by and large, two houses will be needed to house members of the same family.  That is another cost the State must bear.  Many people are happy to live in private rented accommodation and receive a weekly supplementary welfare allowance. The Minister should look at the economics of leaving them in such accommodation instead of transferring them, against their will, to local authority housing.  The housing list could be cut as a result.</P>
    <P>I mentioned the responsibility on house owners who receive supplementary payments from health boards to declare them for tax purposes.  If the State were to receive the tax returns due to it from such payments it might make good economic sense to allow people remain in private rented accommodation. The Minister should consider that proposal seriously.</P>

      <P>I do not have any difficulty with the general thrust of the Bill.  It is right to clarify the position concerning social welfare entitlements in advance of the referendum.  I was very surprised at the relatively low cost outlined by the Minister. There were concern that, as a result of the introduction of divorce, there would be a substantial increase in the cost of social welfare payments but if the Minister's figures are correct that will not be the case.</P>
      <P>This Bill is better than the previous social welfare Bill which drew the ire of many people.  Social welfare recipients were disappointed with the level of increase given to them by the Minister. Political cynics say the matter will be redressed in 1996 or 1997 in advance of a general election and social welfare recipients can look forward to an increase of 6 per cent or Democratic Left leaving office.</P>

      <P>Unfortunately that serves to reinforce the poor image of politicians.  The parties in Government try to paint Fianna Fáil as demons. Efforts were made by Government speakers to misrepresent what was said by my party colleagues.  Those whose image of Fianna Fáil was formed by the ever efficient and busy spin doctors must have been surprised.  It reflects poorly on the speakers and on the house to misrepresent what was said on an issue on which there is broad agreement and co-operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said the last referendum threw up a number of disquieting issues. Irrespective of the right to remarry there are many issues which need to be addressed legislatively.  One of these relates to private pensions.  We are famous for paying lip-service to the family. We must face up to the fact that divorce <Col N="1282" /> will not alleviate the pain and loss suffered by the family as a result of marital breakdown.  However, the State has a role to play in easing that pain and many issues need to be teased out in advance of the referendum.</P>
    <P>I welcome section 9 which deals with the family income supplement which has been extended to include the former spouse.  The Minister said it also includes a former family, if it exists, but that is not written in the Bill.  We all know of cases of marital breakdown where a huge financial burden is placed on the second family as a result of the spouse maintaining the first family.  An attempt was made in this Bill to address the social welfare area.  However, there are many other areas which also need to be addressed.</P>
    <P>The Minister said the cost of the benefit paid by the State to widows, widowers, lone parents and deserted wives is £630 million.  The Government must ensure it is in a position to meet its obligations in this regard.  I am disappointed at the signals given by Ministers in recent days.  The Government signalled its welcome for foreign investors but some Ministers indicated their opposition to them.  The Government must get its act together as regards wealth creation and speak with one voice on this matter.</P>

      <P>I support the points made by Deputies Joe Walsh and Woods, recognised as an authority on social welfare issues.  Most of the relevant points have already been made but nevertheless it is important to put down a number of markers.</P>
      <P>I am glad to note that the Government is dealing with the issue of social welfare benefits before the referendum on divorce and the likely implications of a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote on social welfare recipients. I am glad it intends to eliminate the uncertainty which prevailed during the last divorce referendum campaign by putting in place the proper structures to ensure that any such uncertainty is removed.</P>
      <P>The main areas of the social welfare code where protection is being provided are in regard to widows' and widowers' pensions, the lone parent and deserted wife's schemes, occupational injury benefits, the family income supplement and the prisoner's wife's allowance.  The Minister clearly indicated that there will be no loss of rights under the social welfare system arising from a change in legal status from married to separated, deserted or divorced.  People whose spouses have obtained a divorce in another country will find themselves in the divorced category.  Will the Minister outline the timescale for the implementation of the structures proposed in the Bill and the implications for people in that category?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said that on the death of a divorced person his or her former spouse will be able to qualify for a contributory pension either on their own insurance record or that of the deceased, even if the deceased had remarried, and that where the deceased had remarried their second spouse may also qualify for a widow's-widower's pension.  If a person has had a number of spouses will multiple payments be <Col N="1284" /> made out of his or her contributions? The Minister referred to the second spouse and I would like to know the position where there are two or more spouses and a number of dependants. The Minister said the cost of the provisions in the Bill is likely to rise to £1 million over the next five years.  Taking into account the points I made, will the Minister say how this figure was calculated?</P>
    <P>I welcome the extension of the benefits to the former spouse of a divorced person who has not remarried as well as to the existing spouse.  It is also proposed that a woman in receipt of the deserted wife's benefit or allowance who becomes divorced may continue to be regarded as deserted for the purposes of the deserted wife's allowance schemes.</P>
    <P>During question time on Tuesday I asked the Minister what innovative, radical or wide-ranging measures he intends to introduce in the social welfare system.  I am disappointed that he does not appear to have any proposals in this area.  It is appropriate in a Bill which deals with changes in the social welfare code to provide for a likely change in the Constitution.  Total spending on widows, widowers, lone parents and deserted wives is £630 million and the Minister expects that sum to increase by only £1 million.</P>
    <P>There is potential for further development in other areas of the social welfare code.  I was disappointed in the Minister's reply to my question regarding wide-ranging and radical measures and innovative schemes.  There has been no flexibility in certain conditions regarding free travel.  The Minister of State will be aware that free travel could be extended by one hour morning and evening with little or no financial burden on the Government, yet whenever I have raised this issue he has always said it must be examined in a budgetary context.  The Minister has no innovative measures, policies or proposals.  Is he waiting for a prompt from Fianna Fáil?</P>

      <P>I wish to raise the matter of the parking of heavy vehicles in residential areas.  The introduction of regulations to prevent the overnight parking of heavy vehicles in these areas has been a bone of contention at local authority level in Dublin for a number of years.  Progress has been painfully slow and the ball has always been thrown back to the local authority.  For a couple of years the local authority of which I am a member was told it would have to provide alternative parking spaces before such a regulation could be implemented.  It is only because of the persistence of public representatives that the matter has got to this stage. Specific limited areas, mainly roads in industrial estates, have now been designated for parking purposes.  It is expected that private entrepreneurs will set up commercial lorry parks on the outskirts of the city and provide parking security, secretarial, telephone and fax services, cafes, etc.  I think one such park already exists in the city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At one time we were told that the delays were partly due to problems with the Attorney General's Office but that problem was solved a year ago.  I understand that final approval will come from the Garda Síochána.  After I raised the issue with the former Minister for Justice last year progress was made.  It appears however, that in the past few months there has been a reversal.  A <Col N="1287" /> recent letter from the Garda Commissioner's office to the Fine Gael chairman of the traffic committee of Dublin Corporation was similar to the letter issued three to four years ago.</P>
    <P>I do not know if this is a problem in Cork city but it is a major problem in Dublin.  Neither do I know if the Minister of State's Department is responsible for this matter &mdash; I am surprised to see him here &mdash; but I would like to see someone take a personal interest in it and try to ensure that progress is made.</P>

      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising the issue and wish to outline the progress being made in bringing the various provisions of the Road Traffic Act, 1994 into operation.</P>
      <P>The provisions in the Road Traffic Act, 1994 are extensive and far-reaching. The Act dealt with a range of measures, including drink driving, other enforcement issues, driving licences, speed limits, the regulation of traffic and parking and a number of other miscellaneous changes.</P>
      <P>A variety of arrangements, including consultations with the Garda Síochána and other Departments, are necessary to ensure a smooth and effective implementation of the various measures in the Act.  Regulations are required to give effect to some sections and, for these reasons, it was decided to commence the provisions in the Act on a phased basis, as necessary arrangements were completed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To date, three separate commencement orders have been made and most of the provisions in the Road Traffic Act, 1994 are now in force.  Work is continuing to finalise the arrangements <Col N="1288" /> needed to commence the remaining sections.</P>
    <P>Section 35 which empowers the Minister for the Environment to make regulations for the general regulation and control of traffic, including parking vehicles in public places, has not been implemented.  Comprehensive regulations will be required to give effect to the section and work on the preparation of those regulations has commenced.</P>
    <P>There has been no delay in this work. The regulations under the section will, in effect, result in a whole new statutory basis for our traffic and parking code. The regulations will replace all existing road traffic general by-laws and all local traffic and parking by-laws.  This is a major undertaking and will take some time to complete.  It is the Minister's objective to complete the work in the current year.  The regulations under section 35 will be wide-ranging and the question of controls on the parking of heavy vehicles in residential areas will be considered in their preparation.</P>
    <P>Pending the commencement of the provisions of the Road Traffic Act, 1994, controls and parking of heavy vehicles could be introduced on foot of local traffic and parking by-laws or temporary rules which the Commissioner of An Garda Síochána may make under sections 89 and 90 of the Road Traffic Act, 1961.  While the consent of the Minister for the Environment is required to any such by-laws or temporary rules, no proposals have been submitted to him in relation to the matter in question.</P>

      <P>In January the Government transferred responsibility for the administration of the grant fund <Col N="1289" /> for voluntary organisations which provide health-related services from the Department of Social Welfare to the Department of Health.  There is approximately £1.5 million in this fund but to date there has been no sign of any plans for its distribution.  This has led to financial difficulties for many voluntary organisations while many valuable projects and services have been threatened because of the lack of progress.</P>
      <P>The Carer's Association has received no funding since last March for its programme, under which respite care and home care assistance is provided to carers in the home, and which continues to operate only because of the fund-raising efforts of the Carer's Association itself. If funding is not provided urgently the programme will collapse leading to a number of redundancies and, worse, the collapse of a most essential service in the community.  This is occurring despite the fact that the Minister for Health and the Taoiseach have acknowledged the excellent contribution it has made.</P>
      <P>The delay of five months in the distribution of the fund is unnecessary and unjustifiable.  It appears there was a lack of planning.  It would have made more sense to make arrangements in the Department of Health for the administration of the fund prior to making the decision to transfer it, but this did not happen.  The transfer took place in January and the Department of Health is still trying to come to grips with it.  It is imperative that arrangements for awarding grants is made as soon as possible.  In addition, the Government must ensure this problem does not recur.</P>
      <P>I call on the Minister to give an undertaking that grants awarded under the scheme will not prejudice other forms of funding which the organisations have already received or any such funding they may apply for in future from the Department of Health.</P>

      <P>I confirm that <Col N="1290" /> responsibility for the respite care grants scheme and the scheme of grants to voluntary organisations has been transferred from the Department of Social Welfare to the Department of Health. The decision to transfer these schemes was made following a review of funding for voluntary organisations by the Minister for Health and the Minister for Social Welfare.  Following this review it became clear that there was an overlap between my Department and the Department of Social Welfare in terms of funding voluntary organisations involved in the health care area.</P>
      <P>In line with the commitments outlined in the health strategy, <i>Shaping a Healthier Future,</i> in relation to funding for health care services, it has been decided that funding for the respite care grants scheme and the scheme of grants to voluntary organisations will be administered by the health boards. Accordingly, health boards have been advised today of their indicative allocations for these schemes and of the criteria to be used in selecting projects for funding.</P>
      <P>Funding of over £3 million for the voluntary sector is being provided and the purpose of these schemes is to provide once-off grants to voluntary organisations for community-based projects. The maximum grant payable in any particular case is 90 per cent of the cost of the project and funding is being targeted at the following areas: physical disability services; mental handicap services; psychiatric services; services for the elderly; women's refuges; child care services; personal social services, including information and counselling services.</P>
      <P>I am confident that the new procedures being put in place will simplify procedures for voluntary organisations seeking funding and ensure closer co-operation and coherence between health boards and voluntary and community groups.  Voluntary organisations and community groups applying for funding under these schemes should apply to the health board in whose functional area they are located.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanKenneally" hpid="Mr. Kenneally Mr. Kenneally">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenneally</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to raise this extremely important matter for the school concerned. Not only does it deserve the services of a full-time remedial teacher it should be designated as disadvantaged. The provision of a home-school liaision teacher should also be considered.  A number of schools in the area have been granted full-time remedial teachers and disadvantaged status, and I do not begrudge them that because they are in areas of need, but similar needs exist in the case of Scoil Lorcáin boys' national school.  I cannot understand why this school still has only a part-time remedial teacher.  That teacher was placed in 1980, before two local authority housing estates comprising about 300 houses were built in the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I first became involved in this matter when I was approached on 19 September 1990.  At that time 36 pupils received tuition from the part-time remedial teacher.  A further 33 pupils needed assistance but that was not possible, and the position has deteriorated since then.  In 1990, 78 per cent of pupils in the school came from an unemployment background.  That figure rose to 117 per cent in 1994.  The number of pupils from unemployed and single parent families was 49 per cent in 1990, 50 per cent in 1991, 55 per cent in 1993 and 63 per cent in 1994.  Almost two out of every three students in the school come from such a background.  In addition those from families with five or more children comprise 17 per cent of the total number, 65 per cent of whom come from local authority houses.  Two out of every three pupils come from local authority houses.  I do not have the 1980 figures of pupils from those categories, but they were significantly lower than at present.  Considering that a part-time remedial teacher was appointed in 1980 when the need was not nearly as great as it is now, it defies logic that a full time post cannot be sanctioned.  Will the Minister ensure that in the appointment <Col N="1292" /> of remedial teachers, Scoil Lorcain should at the very least get the services of a full time remedial teacher?</P>
    <P>I have further information on the school and background of some of the children but I am not at liberty to disclose it in public.  However, if the Minister wishes I will give it to him privately. When teachers in this school hear announcements about other schools in Waterford city they believe they are being treated unfairly in that they cannot provide the same opportunities for their students.  Accordingly, there is a case for those services to be made available to this school.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Allen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is no doubt aware that the staffing of national schools for a particular year is determined by the enrolment in the school on 30 September of the previous year.  This is in accordance with an agreement on staffing entered into between the Government, the INTO and managerial authorities of primary schools.</P>
      <P>The enrolment of Scoil Lorcáin boys' national school on 30 September 1994 was 285 pupils which warrants a staffing in the 1995-96 school year of a principal and nine assistants.  Additionally, the school has the services of a remedial teacher on a shared basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deviations from this agreement are permitted if a school is in breach of maximum class size guidelines.  I am introducing new maximum class size guidelines effective from 1 September 1995 which are as follows: 35 in the case of single grade class group, 34 in the case of a class group with two consecutive grades and 31 in the case of a multi-grade class group.  Additionally, a maximum class size guideline of 29 applies in schools which are designated as disadvantaged and a maximum class size guideline of 28 applies in the case of one teacher school.  Deviations are also permitted when a school achieves a substantial growth minimum of 25 pupils in the case of schools with an enrolment <Col N="1293" /> below 298 and 30 in the case of a school with an enrolment of 299 or over.</P>
    <P>If the board of management of Scoil Lorcáin boys' national school consider that its school fulfils the criteria I have outlined in 1 and 2 above, it is open to the board to make a direct application to my Department for additional staffing.</P>
    <P>As has been indicated to the House in the past, remedial education at primary level is a matter in the first instance for the ordinary class teachers.  The majority of pupils with remedial needs would, therefore, be helped within the scope of the normal teaching service. However, it is acknowledged that remedial teachers constitute the main additional resource for addressing the problem of under achievement in primary schools.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, sanction was recently given for an additional 55 remedial posts.  Of the 75 ordinary national schools in County Waterford, 54 now have the services of a remedial teacher, either on a full-time or shared basis.  The post recently allocated means that 82 per cent of pupils attending ordinary national schools in County Waterford currently enjoy a remedial service.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the school in question has applied for inclusion in the disadvantaged areas scheme.  Under present arrangements schools are selected for inclusion in the disadvantaged areas scheme on the basis of a range of socioeconomic criteria agreed some years ago between my Department, the managerial authorities of primary schools and the Irish National Teachers' Organisation. Factors taken into account include the incidence of unemployment, local authority housing and medical card holders among the parents of the children concerned.  Account is also taken of the views of my Department's inspectorate on the relative levels of need between applicant schools and the prevailing pupil teacher ratio.</P>
    <P>Data under these headings is collected from applicant schools and, having regard to available resources, schools are then selected for inclusion in <Col N="1294" /> the scheme.  The criteria used to determine eligibility for inclusion in the disadvantaged areas scheme is the subject of a study being carried out at my request by the Combat Poverty Agency. The problem outlined by Deputy Kenneally has been ongoing for the last eight or nine years.  The Deputy expressed amazement that the school has not been treated the way he believes it should, but I remind him that a Fianna Fáil Minister was in office for seven of those years.  We are now trying to deal with this matter and I expect to receive a report on the outcome of the Combat Poverty Agency studies by the middle of this year.  That will provide a basis for the development of future approaches in this area.  This matter will be given priority.  The needs of all applicant schools will be considered in the context of any extension of the disadvantaged areas scheme.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom buíochas a ghlacadh leis an Aire Stáit as ucht teacht isteach agus éisteacht leis an gcás atá le déanamh agam.  Tá an-iontas orm nach bhfuil an tAire Stáit don iarthar anseo chun éisteacht leis an gcás seo.  Inishbofin, Inishturk and Clare Island are three islands off the west coast, one off the coast of County Galway and two off the coast of County Mayo.  Every winter access to and from the islands becomes a problem.  Based on the 1991 census, there is a population of 181 people on Inishbofin, 137 on Clare Island and 78 on Inishturk.  There is a primary school on each island and thankfully the population on the islands is relatively stable.  It has become clear in recent years that one of the main factors in determining whether people are likely to live on offshore islands is the availability of reliable access to the islands in the winter and summer. Access to these islands during the summer is not usually a problem, but in the winter regular access to them can be difficult, particularly for people returning <Col N="1295" /> from school and work at the weekend and returning home for Christmas holidays. School going children are particularly affected especially as it is difficult to secure seven day boarding accommodation. For those living permanently on the islands the lack of a regular transport service in the winter and the rough seas can be a major problem, particularly for old people who used to go to the mainland to shop, to visit hospitals, doctors and so on.</P>
      <P>In recent years a subsidised helicopter service has been provided to Tory Island off Donegal by Údaras na Gaeltachta. A similar service is required for other islands.  The old difference between Gaeltacht and non-Gaeltacht island should be abolished and there should be equality of services for all.</P>
      <P>I accept that in the long term the most cost effective answer to the question of access to the islands would be to build airstrips on them.  I understand Aer Aran is interested in providing such a service, but that it is not likely to be provided in the near future.  In the meantime it is vital that the Government decides to provide an annual helicopter service to those islands from October to March.</P>
      <P>As subsidised transport services are provided throughout the country to towns and villages and as most Gaeltacht islands also have access to subsidised transport services, it is amazing that those who do not benefit from such subsidised services are non-Gaeltacht island communities.</P>
      <P>The Minister should take steps to correct this matter and ensure that some of the smallest and most vulnerable communities are given the lifeline they need.  I look forward to a positive response from the Minister.</P>

      <P>It is coincidental that I met a delegation from Clare Island yesterday regarding a transport problem and they made me aware of the many difficulties they experience living on the island.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the difficulties that can be experienced by island communities in the winter in maintaining contact with the mainland.  Of course this problem cannot be looked at only in relation to the islands identified by the Deputy, nor should it be considered in terms of helicopter services only.</P>
      <P>The problems of the islands should properly be seen in the overall context of western development and rural renewal.  The Taoiseach indicated the priority he attaches to the development of a strategy in this whole area by appointing my colleague, Minister of State, Deputy Carey, as Minister of State with responsibility for co-ordinating the Government's commitment to western development and rural renewal. Minister of State Carey is examining all of the issues by pulling together the relevant expertise which resides in a number of Government Departments.</P>
      <P>In the case of access transport to all offshore islands there is a special committee reporting to the Minister of State on island development and I will ensure that the concerns and comments I have heard today from Deputy Ó Cuív are passed to the committee for urgent consideration and attention.</P>

Among the conditions listed by the group are the requirement on directors to make a signed statement acknowledging their statutory responsibilities in relation to accounts and certifying eligibility to avail of the exemption; the right of shareholders holding a minimum of 10 per cent of the voting rights to <Col N="1236" /> require an audit; and the exclusion of companies in regulated industries such as banking or insurance, and members of a group of companies from the proposed exemption.

These studies broadly come up with similar conclusions.  These include: lack of training in industry, particularly small and medium size companies; need to develop a training culture in industry; skills gap does exist; management training crucial; TSS programme successful but needs to be targeted more at particular sectors and small companies; problems created by lack of resources in TSS; and need for proper system of certification.</P>
      <P>The conclusions in the various reports produced are currently being considered in the context of the proposed White Paper on training which, as the Deputy will be aware, will outline the Government's future strategy for all areas of training.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13, 50 and 54 together.</P>
      <P>A report on the implications of Sunday trading for the retail trade, commissioned by my predecessor last October, was given to the Department of Enterprise and Employment on Monday last.  I made the report public on Tuesday evening and its findings have been widely reported.  Copies are available from the Department of Enterprise and Employment.</P>
      <P>As I told the House during the Adjournment debate on Tuesday evening, I intend to give this report detailed and careful consideration.  I am also anxious to hear the views of the public on the Sunday trading issue, arising from the report's publication, before making final decisions in this area.</P>
      <P>The report showed that despite major change in the pattern of retailing over the past number of years, there has been an increase in overall employment. There has been a 7 per cent increase in the employment of full-timers, and a 33 per cent increase in the employment of part-time workers in the sector.  The report concluded that Sunday trading is likely to result in only a marginal increase in the number of workers employed in the retail sector and these are likely to be predominantly part-timers. There are two issues at the centre of the debate on Sunday trading &mdash; the regulation of trading hours, and the protection of vulnerable workers.  Retail workers are particularly vulnerable, as many are part-time and casual, and only a quarter are members of a union.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am preparing legislation which will transpose the EU Directive on Working Time into Irish law.  That directive provides for minimum weekly rest breaks for workers which should in principle include a Sunday.  Detailed discussions are taking place with the ICTU and with IBEC on how exactly to translate the complex provisions of this Directive <Col N="1240" /> into Irish law.  In my detailed preparation for this legislation I am particularly conscious of the need to protect vulnerable workers.</P>
    <P>The only legislation we have on regulating hours of trading goes back to 1938, and has never been brought into force.  Nobody on any side of the debate expects the revival of this 57 year old piece of legislation, in a greatly changed trading environment.</P>
    <P>Extended week-day trading hours has become an accepted practice in the retail sector.  Sunday opening in the pre-Christmas period is now well established. Outlets such as DIY stores, furniture stores and garden centres open on Sundays, as do smaller convenience stores.  Many of these changes have been in response to changing lifestyle and family life patterns, and they are well accepted.</P>
    <P>I am aware that there are concerns about seven day opening and unlimited trading, for quality of life.  There is a view, and I have a certain sympathy for it, that there should be at least one day in the week which is publicly signalled as a rest day and a day when the family can be together, if they so choose.</P>
    <P>Regulating Sunday trading is a complex legal issue.  Few people would seek a ban on all Sunday trading, and any partial regulation for example to cover the clothing and grocery sector over a certain square footage raises issues on which I am seeking legal advice.</P>
    <P>Any action I propose to take will result from the fullest consideration of all the issues involved.</P>

This particular function was subsequently devolved to Forbairt and the Forbairt &ldquo;inventions programme&rdquo; addresses this requirement by providing a range of services to inventors, including assessment of the commercial viability and marketability of an idea and advice and assistance with patent applications.</P>
      <P>Financial support for this is provided out of the Forbairt annual grant-in-aid. Forbairt are allocating some £300,000 for this activity in 1995.  The amount has been increasing progressively over the past five years, from a level of about £90,000 in 1990.</P>
      <P>I understand that Forbairt is currently supporting 45 on-going projects, of which 27 have reached the production stage and the remainder are at various stages of technical and &mdash; or commercial development.  In any one year, Forbairt receive a large number of applications for support under the inventions programme and only a very few of these are found to merit support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following a recent review of its role in the inventions area, both in the context of the new agency structures and of the report of the Science, Technology and Innovation Advisory Council, Forbairt is increasing its involvement with the allocation of extra staff to create a specific intellectual property unit.  It is intended that this unit will be in place by the end of this year and I believe that this improved and pro-active service will <Col N="1242" /> create a greater awareness of intellectual property issues in general, and the importance of patent protection as part of the general development of innovation and entrepreneurship.</P>

      <P>I am indeed aware of the report by the Dublin Inner City Partnership entitled Community Employment Options and Opportunities which I launched last February. At the time of its publication I welcomed the positive results of the survey for both sponsors and participants.  The <Col N="1243" /> report indicated that the majority of the community employment participants surveyed considered that the training and work experience they had received would enhance their job prospects. However, the report highlighted the need to improve linkages with the jobs market for community employment participants and for improvements in guidance and counselling services.</P>
      <P>Since the report was launched the Government has announced the establishment of the local employment service which will focus on the needs of the long term unemployed.  The new service will be established initially in the 12 <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> area partnerships and two other areas.  Management committees have been established in the 12 partnership areas and implementation plans are being developed by the committees.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the community employment programme is providing worthwhile work experience with training for community employment participants and that the establishment of the local employment service concentrating on the needs of the long term unemployed will assist greater numbers of the long term unemployed including community employment participants find employment.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware the Task Force on Long-Term Unemployment is currently examining the range of employment options to be available to the long term unemployed in the light of Government policy on special employment measures as set out in the policy agreement on the formation of this Government <i>A Government of Renewal</i> and the recommendations of the National Economic and Social Forum.  I have no doubt that the Task Force will examine community employment, and all other options, in this context and will take account of reports such as that prepared by the Dublin Inner City Partnership.</P>

      <P>A Council Directive, 93/104 EC, on the organisation of working time was adopted in November 1993 and provides for minimum standards in relation to working time and rest time to protect the occupational safety and health of workers.  The directive applies to all sectors of activity with the exception of air, rail, road, sea, inland waterway and lake transport, work at sea and the activities of doctors in training.</P>
      <P>Member states are required to ensure that the provisions of the directive, with certain exceptions, are implemented in national legislation by November 1996. In line with a commitment given in the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work,</i> my Department is engaged in ongoing consultations with the social partners and other interested parties with a view to formulating legislative proposals to implement the terms of the directive.</P>
      <P>In regard to the sectors which are excluded from the Directive on the organisation of working time, the European Commission has indicated in its Medium Term Social Action Programme, 1995-97, that discussions with the social partners and &mdash; or studies will continue on how best to ensure that those sectors are appropriately covered. The Commission has also indicated that, if necessary, it will consider bringing forward proposals to complete the working time directive in 1996-97.</P>
      <P>In view of the above position, the question of an Irish submission to the EU Commission does not arise. However, my Department will continue to monitor developments in this area on an ongoing basis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>The cost of operation is a crucial competitive factor for industry in Ireland and in particular for industries like Packard Electric.  The need to improve the environment for business and to improve competitiveness was highlighted by the Industrial Policy Review Group, chaired by Mr. Jim Culliton on &ldquo;Industrial Policy for the 1990's&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Against this background, in its last two budgets the Government has brought about reductions in PRSI for the lower paid.  The Government has also recognised the need to lower the cost to the employer of recruiting and employing staff.  By applying a lower rate of employers PRSI rates to higher earnings levels and further reducing the tax wedge i.e. the difference between the value of take home pay and gross labour <Col N="1250" /> costs, this Government is endeavouring to make labour-intensive industries more competitive.</P>
    <P>In addition, a priority of this year's Finance Act has been to focus on the plight of the lower paid and to further reduce PRSI on their earnings.  All of these changes have a significant impact on the cost competitiveness of labour-intensive industries.</P>
    <P>I have also established a new Task Force for Industry Adjustment to identify areas of business at risk from competitive forces and to propose competitive strategies.  This task force has commenced a process aimed at bringing about changes &mdash; particularly in its traditional manufacturing sectors &mdash; to encourage firms to prevent job losses and secure existing employment.  The Task Force, which includes ICTU and IBEC as well as the State agencies, is developing a targeted initiative aimed at areas where avoidance of job losses requires major change and adjustment.  I hope that they will have completed their process in the coming months.</P>
    <P>In addition, IDA Ireland and Forbairt already work closely with their existing clients to identify at an early stage Irish or Irish based companies which are in danger of becoming uncompetitive.</P>
    <P>There are a number of ways in which IDA Ireland and Forbairt can help companies improve their competitiveness including: working with companies to achieve ISO accreditation; introducing World Class Manufacturing standards; establishing R &amp; D functions; working with companies to keep overheads down to ensure that the cost of manufacturing can compete internationally; close intervention with companies who wish to become sub-suppliers to major multi-national enterprises.  Forbairt also provides significant support to indigenous companies under the Management Development Programme.</P>
    <P>I would urge all labour intensive companies which are experiencing competitive pressures to review these IDA and Forbairt measures and to contact these agencies with a view to using them to increase their cost competitiveness.</P>

      <P>I welcome the recent submission of the Society of the Irish Motor Industry and, in particular, its suggestions aimed at reducing the frequency of accidents involving new and young drivers.  Most of these suggestions are for consideration by my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, and will be brought to his attention.</P>
      <P>With regard to the issue of age discrimination raised by the society and the divergence of premium quotations offered to young drivers, I would point out that insurers authorised to operate in this State must meet their statutory reserves and solvency requirements.  In order to meet these requirements and to operate on a viable basis, insurers must be allowed to set their premiums for young and more experienced drivers, respectively, by reference to their underwriting experience.</P>
      <P>The Motor Insurance Advisory Board in its 1993 Annual Report concluded, on the basis of its own evaluation of claims data obtained from insurers, that young drivers constitute a high risk category and that the premiums charged to young drivers do, in fact, reflect the claims experience of such drivers as a category.</P>

      <P>The recent report of the Science, Technology and Innovation Advisory Council, in dealing with science parks, recognised that such parks could make an important contribution to industry &mdash; third level interactions, the exploitation and knowledge for national benefit and the promotion of capability and competitiveness in industry.  It also recognised, however, that the experience in relation to such parks was not uniformly good and that some science parks had failed to live up to the expectations of their promoters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provision of science and technology parks has to be seen in the context of the prioritisation of the various national science and technology activities and their funding requirements.  In this regard, the Advisory Council made a number of institutional recommendations concerning how such priorities could be established and these, along with the other recommendations of the council, are currently being considered <Col N="1253" /> by the Travers Task Force established by the Government for that purpose. My attitude to the provision of science and technology parks will be determined in the light of the Government's considered response to the deliberations of the task force.</P>

      <P>The Casual Trading Bill, 1994, which is currently before the Select Committee on Enterprise and Economic Strategy, provides for the devolution of the licensing function from the Minister for Enterprise and Employment to the local authorities and enhances their powers to administer and regulate casual trading in their functional areas.</P>
      <P>Section 6 (2) of the Casual Trading Act, 1980, requires a casual trader to display his-her casual trading licence or a copy of it so as to be clearly visible and easily legible to members of the public when he-she trades at a place which is not a casual trading area.  The selling of ice cream is currently exempted from the provisions of the 1980 Act and is not, therefore, currently regulated under the Act 4.  However, under the Casual Trading Bill, 1994, I propose to limit the list of casual trading activities excluded from the scope of regulation, including the selling of ice cream, and to empower the local authorities to decide what should be exempted in their own areas.</P>
      <P>In regard to classes of trading which are currently regulated under the 1980 Act, it is a matter for the local authorities to decide how to regulate, supervise and administer casual trading in their own functional areas.

    <P>In 1995 the Department of Foreign Affairs has employed the following consultants: Mr. Dennis Driscoll has been employed as Consultant with the legal division.  His salary costs to date since 1 January 1995, inclusive of PRSI, amount to £25,536; Mr. Declan Fitzgerald has been retained to assist in the technical aspects associated with the introduction of a new computerised financial management system.  The cost of his consultancy fees and withholding tax since 1 January 1995 amount to £7,800; and <Col N="1256" /> Ms Mairead Mullaney was appointed to upgrade the Department's library.  The total cost of her fees and withholding tax amounted to £4,000.</P>
    <P>Under the Irish Aid Programme, a number of consultants are employed on a short term basis to assist the audit and evaluation unit of the Department to carry out reviews on aid projects.  The rate for consultancy fees is on average £250 per day.  Consultants carrying out field trips are entitled to claim expenses at current departmental rates.</P>
    <P>The Office of the Tánaiste recently engaged consultants, Fitzpatrick and Associates, to carry out research on matters relating to long term unemployment, on behalf of the Task Force on Long-Term Unemployment which is chaired by the assistant secretary in the office.

It was founded in 1971 by the Hospitaller Order of St. John of God which operates the service on an agency basis for the Eastern Health Board which is responsible for the provision of psychiatric services in the south east area.</P>
      <P>The service at Cluain Mhuire encompasses a comprehensive range of community-based components including day hospitals, day centres, training centres, but-patient clinics, liaison services, together with community-based residential accommodation.  The acute component of the service is provided by the purchase of in-patient beds in St. John of God Hospital, Stillorgan, which is a private hospital.</P>
      <P>There has been no reduction in funding to the St. John of God service.  The budget for the overall service in the current year is approximately £4.7 million which on a <i>per capita</i> basis compares favourably with other Eastern Health Board psychiatric services.</P>

As a result the total expenditure in 1994 was £0.7 million and the carryover to 1995 in respect of these commitments was £3.3 million.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware, projects under this scheme are undertaken by voluntary community groups and sports clubs and it is not always possible to accurately determine the number of projects which will claim grants in a particular year.  The £2 million provided for the scheme in 1995 was agreed in the context of the Estimates and was based on the pattern of expenditure for such projects in previous years.</P>
    <P>The preparation of the information requested by the Deputy in respect of the list of projects approved in 1994 and those where payments were made in 1994 is under way and will be sent to the Deputy without delay.  My Department is also currently in the process of identifying projects which will be in a position to claim grant payments in 1995 as well as those projects which will not proceed this year.</P>

      <Quest>whether it is intended to extend the school transport system to Manin, Ballyconneely, County Galway, in view of the fact that there are eight children under ten years of age from this area attending Ballyconneely school and the manner in which the school bus service is now run means that these children have to walk a considerable distance.</Quest>

      <P>I understand that there is a school transport service currently in operation to Ballyconneely national school.  A spur off this main route to the <Col N="1263" /> Manin area was withdrawn some time ago, due to falling numbers of eligible children offering for transport from the area.  The local Bus Éireann office is not aware of any application having been made to extend the current service to Manin.  My Department will, however, investigate the matter with Bus Éireann on receipt of the names and addresses of the children concerned.  The Deputy will be informed of the outcome as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>The superintendent in question was employed by my Department, and paid for her services, in 1990. She claimed payment of overnight subsistence allowances on the ground that her residence was more than 15 miles from her examination centre and that, as required by my Department in such circumstances, she had stayed at a temporary residence within two miles of the centre.  Inquiries made by my Department through the local postal authorities indicated that the superintendent's home was less than 15 miles from the centre and the claim for overnight allowances was refused on this basis. Instead, the superintendent was paid mileage rates on the basis of travelling from her home to the centre each day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The superintendent did not raise this matter again until 1995.  My Department is now satisfied, following the receipt of further information, including a certificate from the local Garda authorities dated June 1995, that her home is in fact <Col N="1264" /> located more than 15 miles from the examination centre to which she was assigned in 1990.  Arrangements are now being made to pay the balance of remuneration due to the superintendent.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the difficulties being experienced by older long term unemployed persons in obtaining employment and consequently my Department has put in place a number of measures to assist such persons in obtaining employment.</P>
      <P>The FÁS Community Employment (CE) Programme provides temporary work experience together with some training for long term unemployed people and other special categories, the purpose of which is to assist those concerned in obtaining mainstream employment.  In recognition of the difficulties being experienced by older long term unemployed people in obtaining employment, persons over 45 years of age who are long term unemployed and who live in a local development area may participate on CE for up to three years.</P>
      <P>In addition, the new Local Employment Service (LES), which is currently being set up, is specifically targeted at those who are long term unemployed and who would not otherwise obtain employment.  Under LES a comprehensive guidance, counselling and placement service, capable of responding to the specific needs of individuals, will be provided and should have a considerable impact in assisting the older long term unemployed back into the workforce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Legislation administered by my Department also makes special provision for the protection of older workers.  The unfair dismissals legislation, which provides protection for <Col N="1268" /> employees from being unfairly dismissed, specifies that dismissal on grounds of age will be regarded as being automatically unfair and provides redress, including reinstatement, for employees dismissed on grounds of age.</P>
    <P>The Redundancy Payments Acts make special provision for the protection of workers aged 41 or over by ensuring that they receive higher compensation than that paid to younger workers if they are made redundant. Under these Acts an employee who is over 41 years of age is entitled to statutory redundancy based on a full week's pay for each year of employment whereas an employee who is between the age of 16 and 41 is entitled to statutory redundancy based on a half week's pay for each year of employment.</P>
    <P>I should also mention that legislation which is currently being developed by my colleague, the Minister for Equality and Law Reform, will take account of the need to protect older workers from discrimination in employment, including discrimination in relation to access to employment.  That legislation, which is due to be published later this year, will prohibit discrimination on a wide range of grounds including age.</P>

      <P>Under the control of farm pollution scheme, no special conditions apply to farmers with less than 15,000 gallons milk quota.  Permanent milk quota is one of the criteria taken into account to establish the number of farm enterprise units on a farm. These units determine whether an applicant is eligible for the higher 60 per cent &mdash; enterprises with 80 units or less &mdash; or lower 30 per cent rate of grant &mdash; enterprises with more than 80 units &mdash; and corresponding investment ceilings. Milk quota is calculated at 1 unit per 400 gallons.  Under the scheme of investment aid for up-grading of on-farm dairying facilities applicants with a permanent milk quota of up to 15,000 gallons are eligible for grant at a rate of 60 per cent.  Lower rates apply above this level.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The sectors for which my Department has responsibility are facing major change and require certain expertise to be available to the Department beyond what currently exists within the Department's own resources.  Over recent years a number of consultancy firms have carried out work on behalf of the <Col N="1271" /> Department, and it is likely that this will continue.</P>
    <P>At present the following consultants are retained by my Department: Andersen International, Coopers &amp; Lybrand, B. McKenna, Knight' Piésold and Partners, Indecon, Nera, the Bill O'Herlihy Communications Group, WFX O'Sullivan, RTZ Consultants.</P>
    <P>The issues on which these consultants are working cover the three major sectors covered by my Department in addition to consultancies on public relations and safety for the Department. The remuneration of consultants varies depending on the company and the task to be carried out.  These consultancies are ongoing at the moment so the total fees for the projects have not yet been paid.  In all cases, the level of funding has been approved by the Department of Finance.</P>

      <P>The Dún Laoghaire Harbour Management is proceeding with the introduction, on a trial basis initially, of a fore and aft mooring regime in the Old Harbour, Dún Laoghaire Harbour, for the current sailing season thereby increasing, for the first time in many many years, the number of moorings avialable.</P>
      <P>Advertisements were placed in the national media at the beginning of May 1995 inviting applications for the moorings to be created as a result of this initiative for craft of upt to 5.5 metres. Those interested in obtaining a mooring were required to submit an application to the Harbour Master by 22 May 1995. Those who had already made applications in the past were asked to reconfirm their interest on this occasion given the size and nature of the moorings available.</P>
      <P>The named applicant did not make an application at that time but if he submits relevant details of his craft to the Harbour Master it may be possible to accommodate him in the new fore and aft trial mooring regime.</P>
      <P>The names of all applicants for moorings are held on file pending the availability of an appropriate mooring which is allocated on a first come first served basis.</P>
