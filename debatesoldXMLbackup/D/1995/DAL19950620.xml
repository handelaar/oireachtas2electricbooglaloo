      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The survey in question was commissioned by the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation and thus, it is a matter which should properly be considered by all the participants there.</P>
      <P>I believe that matters, such as those raised by the Forum survey, are likely to arise in the course of all-inclusive talks and naturally, the Government would give them the most careful consideration in that context.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach share the broadly held opinion that the Forum has served its purpose, that it is running out of energy and that the sooner it is brought to a conclusion the better for everyone?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I dealt with questions on that matter last week.  The question <Col N="1298" /> the Deputy has put to me here today concerns a survey commissioned by the Forum.  I will be more than happy to answer questions about the survey but I have already given an answer to the question in regard to the future of the Forum.  I believe the Forum is doing valuable work and will continue to do so for some time to come.  I understand that a drafting committee has been set up within the Forum to look at detailed issues on which agreement might be reached.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>Everyone will acknowledge that the Forum has performed a useful purpose but the belief that it would, in time, attract the Unionist parties from Northern Ireland has been jettisoned; no one believes that any more. Does the Taoiseach share the view that the Forum, therefore, has no purpose if all parties on the island of Ireland cannot be brought together and that another kind of forum should be examined?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not.  Significant elements of unionist opinion &mdash; with a small &ldquo;u&rdquo;&mdash; have appeared before the forum.  The Churches representing almost all the relevant religious groups which normally support Unionism within Northern Ireland have presented carefully argued viewpoints to the Forum.  It is important to recognise that the Forum brings together a much wider range of opinion, stretching from the Alliance Party which effectively supports the Union across to Sinn Féin, than, for example, the forum in the 1980s.  There is a significant learning process to be undertaken by all the parties in coming to an understanding, if not a complete acceptance, of the views of those with whom they have traditionally had an antagonistic relationship. That is proving to be a very useful purpose of the Forum and is stimulated by the individual submissions made to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that the single most important fact <Col N="1299" /> about public opinion, North and South, is that they value peace and want to see Governments and political parties make a real effort to overcome the obstacles and enter talks sooner rather than later?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That question was not posed specifically in the poll which concerns obstacles as seen north of the Border to better understanding with the South and obstacles as seen south of the Border to better understanding with the North.  A wide spread of concerns are identified in the responses.  I can give the Deputy more details but no doubt, as a member of the Forum, he has access to them.  I do not think the construction he put on it can be put on the survey because that question was not asked, but he is correct when he says that people in Northern Ireland very much value peace and the absence of violence, want to see their politicians build on the peace process and move towards a greater understanding.  This requires effort on all sides.</P>

      <Quest>the number of meetings of the steering committee that have been held to monitor the programme A Government of Renewal; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The progressive implementation of the provisions in the programme <i>A Government of Renewal</i> is monitored by the meetings of programme managers which have been taking place on a weekly basis since 25 January last.  They report, as appropriate, to the party Leaders who also meet on a weekly basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that progress has been made on less than 10 per cent of the 100 or so proposals in the Programme for Government?  Does he agree that the <Col N="1300" /> meetings need to be much more effective if he is to secure a better rate?  A figure of less than 10 per cent is hardly sufficient for this Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept that and I suggest the Deputy tables questions about individual aspects of the Programme for Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach consider that many more meetings are required given that the finances are off the rails, crime is escalating, policy on semi-State companies is in disarray and there is a worrying lack of urgency in regard to Northern Ireland?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The public finances are being dealt with in an effective way. Crime is not escalting and is also being dealt with in an effective way.  The Garda Síochána and other forces of law are being given support perhaps on a scale they did not receive from the previous Government.  The semi-State sector and all its strategic problems are being dealt with effectively and expeditiously at Cabinet level. Decisions which were deferred or not taken by the previous Government are being taken by this Government.  On all four measures adduced by the Deputy progress is being made.  In framing the question this way he is displaying a certain distance from the facts.</P>

      <P>As I said to Deputy Brennan, the most appropriate way for the Deputy to raise questions about individual aspects of the Programme for Government is to table questions.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach answered questions some considerable time ago when he said that the Government would examine the issue with a view to holding a referendum later this year.  I tabled further questions but, unfortunately, they were ruled out of order under the six months rule.  If the Taoiseach could enlighten me any further I would appreciate it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that the Deputy seeks another way of raising the matter.  I would be happy to provide information but I am not in a position, in the time available, to go through each individual recommendation in the Programme for Government in response to this question.  I suggest that the Deputy tables another question, raises the matter on the Adjournment or deals with it in one of the many other well tried and known ways Deputies have for raising matters of interest to them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 and 4 together.</P>
      <P>I have repeatedly stressed that matters relating to decommissioning, wider security issues and political progress will need to be addressed in an imaginative, but pragmatic way with a view to advancing the peace process to an agreed political settlement.  All these issues are the subject of ongoing dialogue, at the political and official levels, with the British Government.  I have taken and will continue to take every available opportunity to move matters forward in direct discussion with the British Prime Minister and with representatives of all the political parties in Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>As far as decommissioning and remission rates in particular are concerned, I do not believe that it would be helpful to elaborate further beyond what I have already said in the House, including in reply to Questions on 28 March and most recently, on Wednesday last, 14 June.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach think that Sinn Féin should be allowed to participate in all inclusive talks before the decommissioning of arms?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Our objective is to reach a position where all inclusive talks can take place.  I recognise that there has been movement on this issue both on the part of Sinn Féin and the British Government.  For example, in his interview with <i>The Irish Times</i> on 14 June Mr. Adams said that his party had discussed and examined closely the British Government's views on the modalities for decommissioning and that this may be an effective and acceptable approach to the practical aspects of the issue of decommissioning.  On the other hand, Mr. Ancram made the remark: &ldquo;There is an illogicality there which can only be met not by surrender &mdash; we all understand the fear of the term `surrender' &mdash; but by showing that they, Sinn Féin, are sincere in their commitment to peace by beginning the process of decommissioning.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1304" /> There is movement on both sides towards a view where some agreement might be found.  Admittedly, it is quite subtle but significant just the same.  That is probably the best way to approach the matter rather than making the black and white distinction that is perhaps implicit in the Deputy's question.  I have always recognised that the decommissioning of arms is very important from the perspective of many of the parties whose participation is essential to agreement in Northern Ireland.  There cannot be all-encompassing agreement unless some parties who are currently unwilling to sit down with parties associated with entities that still have arms unless those parties are satisfied on the decommissioning issue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree there has been movement on both sides and people should read more into what Mr. Adams said in the interview in <i>The Irish Times</i> in which he made some interesting points.  Did the Taoiseach note that the British Government spokesperson this morning accepted the point I have made many times, that there was no mention of decommissioning, nor was it raised by the British Government, prior to the ceasefire on 31 August?  This is a central point if people are to believe there was not a breach of trust.  Will the Taoiseach agree that, by accepting that point, the British Government is moving closer to the statement by the Methodist Church to the Forum last week, that decommissioning should be high on the talks agenda but not a precondition?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy peruses the Downing Street Declaration he will find that the word &ldquo;decommissioning&rdquo; is not mentioned.  It did not arise as a live political issue at that time in the minds of some of the political parties in the way it did after the ceasefire-cessation of violence.  The concern of Unionists seems to be that the cessation is not durable or permanent unless there is some evidence that offensive weapons in particular are being put out of commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1305" /> Unless the ceasefire is durable or permanent some of the Unionist parties are reticent about sitting down with Sinn Féin.  That is not something being invented by the British or Irish Governments or by any other Government; it is a reality born of fear and suspicion during 25 years of violence, a reality that must be overcome.</P>
    <P>It does not serve the purpose of truth simply to present this as an issue that is being raised by Governments as an obstacle.  It is a problem in the minds of communities who have been the victims of violence &mdash; there are victims of violence on both the Nationalist and Unionist sides in Northern Ireland. Concern about weapons of death being put out of commission exists among families in the Nationalist community who have been the victims of loyalist violence just as it exists among families in the Unionist community who have been the victims of Provisional IRA violence.  It is a concern among the people in Northern Ireland primarily.  It is important to recognise that and not to present the issues exclusively as some governmental device for making the talks process more difficult.  That is not the case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with what the Taoiseach has just said.  Will he accept there is stalemate in the peace process and how does he believe it can be resolved?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept there is stalemate in the peace process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach say whether reports are true that the Dalton-Chilcott discussions have recommenced since a report was made to Government on this issue last January? Will he accept that the guns of death are in the hands of both communities, loyalists and republicans?  Both sides experience the same difficulty and have said that until there are inclusive talks they will not hand over their arms.  Four or five weeks ago we were at this stage and there was no disagreement between the <Col N="1306" /> Taoiseach and me on this issue, as there is not now.  It is the British Government that has allowed the issue of decommissioning to come back on the agenda. Prior to the Washington Conference it took the position that it could deal with this matter in a different way.</P>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach consider the Dalton-Chilcott discussions as a means of moving towards talks, with decommissioning the first item on the agenda? The Taoiseach agreed with me on that issue a month ago and I think the British Government would agree if it did not have its own political difficulties.  I am talking not about the views on the ground but those in Westminster.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There are four questions on decommissioning that must be dealt with: what is to be decommissioned, where it is to be decommissioned, to whom is it to be decommissioned and when.  There is considerable agreement on the first three of those questions; the difficulty arises as to when the decommissioning will take place.  The Government has been proactive in this matter.  We have been seeking to work out ways of breaking the deadlock on this issue &mdash; perhaps I should not use the term &ldquo;deadlock&rdquo; because there is no deadlock; there has been significant movement but it is movement which has not yet reached the point where there is a conjunction of views.  We have been seeking to accelerate that movement and it is in that context that the pace of the Dalton-Chilcott discussions has been speeded up.  The Dalton-Chilcott discussions on the modalities of decommissioning have been continuing and we decided to accelerate them recently with a view to making a proactive contribution to bridging the ever-narrowing but slowly narrowing gap between the parties on this issue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree that in this stalemate what is <Col N="1307" /> required is adoption by the Governments of a dramatic confidence measure?  The spokesman for loyalist prisoners, Mr. Colin Crawford, when making his submission to the Forum said that the single most important measure that would restore confidence in Northern Ireland among loyalist and republicans is a 50 per cent remission for all prisoners.  That is the sort of dramatic movement that would help break the logjam.  The argument on decommissioning is similar to a theological argument.  A confidence building measure is necessary to impact on the public at large.  Will the Taoiseach agree that the dramatic and meaningful suggestion by the loyalist spokesman to the Forum should be considered in this regard?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I raised on a number of occasions with the British Prime Minister the question of increasing the rate of remission of sentences of prisoners to the 50 per cent level.  I pointed to the case by case release policy we have successfully adopted in this jurisdiction and suggested that this would have considerable merit from the perspective of the British Government. It is important to recognise that this is a case by case approach and that any other measure would tend to engender fears among the victims of violence.  It is important to remember the feelings and views of victims and families of victims of paramilitary violence just as we speak frequently about the concern of victims of other forms of crime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The assuaging of the fears and worries of victims is also part of the peace process.  There are difficulties from the perspective of victims of violence.  It is problematic from their perspective if the perpetrators of violence are released, but the weapons used to kill their loved ones are still available for use.  I urge all in the House to consider this process in a holistic way, to consider the whole of the problem rather than one aspect of it, whether <Col N="1308" /> prisoner releases, decommissioning, constitutional progress or the talks process. All those processes interact.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Taoiseach rightly raised the matter that the issue of the release of Private Clegg should be tied in with overall prisoner releases, the Northern Ireland Office bluntly told him that whatever happened to prisoners in Britain was none of Dublin's business.  Does that response not indicate the British Government wants or appears to be satisfied with peace, but a political stalemate?  Does the Taoiseach consider it appears that the British Government's intention is to keep dividing the Nationalist consensus built up over time?  At the Forum last Friday a discussion on the political structures in Northern Ireland developed into a discussion on decommissioning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not believe that the British Government considers the approach should be one of simply accepting the <i>status quo.</i>  The Framework Document in which it made a number of clear and, in some cases, unprecedented declarations of policy towards the achievement of an overall settlement clearly belies that view.  That document was agreed to by the British Prime Minister in the face of substantial potential opposition from his back benches and showed courage and commitment on his part to the achievement of an overall settlement.  I do not agree with the Deputy's analysis which I consider unduly pessimistic.  I believe there is a need to accelerate rapidly moves towards bridging the gap on a number of issues, most notably, decommissioning and prisoner issues.  Those issues interact with the wider question of getting political talks under way because some parties are unwilling to take a bottom line on, say, the decommissioning issue without the prospect or a framework for political agreement being in place, but that prospect can only be delivered with the consent of certain parties like the Unionists for whom the decommissioning issue is vital <Col N="1309" /> as they represent many individuals and families who have been the victims of paramilitary violence.  All those issues are interrelated and we must seek to move them forward simultaneously.</P>

That applies also to prisoners as loyalist prisoners played a fundamental role in bringing about the loyalist ceasefire.

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will take Questions Nos. 5 and 6 together.</P>
      <P>I have had no communication from any other European Head of State or Government suggesting the postponement of the Intergovernmental Conference until 1997.  The Treaty on European Union provides that the Intergovernmental Conference will open in 1996.  The Italian Government has indicated its intention that the Intergovernmental Conference should commence during its Presidency in the first half of 1996.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The efficient management of the Intergovernmental Conference will be a major priority of the Irish Presidency. We will work to progress its work as constructively and expeditiously as possible during our Presidency.  It is too early to make any firm predictions about the date when the Intergovernmental Conference is likely to conclude. The work of the Intergovernmental <Col N="1311" /> Conference depends on a wide number of factors including the complexity and ambition of its agenda.  There has always been and remains a considerable possibility that the Intergovernmental Conference will run into 1997.</P>
    <P>The European Council meeting in Cannes will afford the EU Heads of State or Government an opportunity to discuss the preparation for the Intergovernmental Conference.  I look forward to hearing the views of Chancellor Kohl and other colleagues on that occasion.  A European Council, of course, also offers the opportunity for useful informal bilateral discussions with other members of the European Council.  As of now I have no plans for any informal bilateral meetings concerning the Intergovernmental Conference at Cannes.  The Deputy can, however, be assured that in the context of the Intergovernmental Conference all necessary bilateral contacts will be maintained by me, the Tánaiste and the Minister of State for European Affairs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach use the opportunity that will be presented next week when, I am sure, there will be much discussion regarding the future work of the Intergovernmental Conference to put down markers on a number of issues on which Chancellor Kohl has taken a very different view?  I refer particularly to the proposal to introduce majority voting in foreign policy decisions, the role of maintaining a commissioner for small countries, the fact that the position in respect of European Monetary Union appears to have changed and, not least, the raising of incorrect issues by Chancellor Kohl's Government colleague, Mr. Theo Waigel, which are damaging to the Irish economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not believe that anybody would regard the comments of Minister Waigel as damaging the Irish economy.  Our economy is extremely healthy and the European Commission has clearly indicated that Ireland is one <Col N="1312" /> of only three economies in Europe at present which qualifies for European Monetary Union membership.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The views of the German Government on that matter are the views of one member Government and do not accord with the facts.  I do not see any difficulty in dealing with that matter.  I have views as to why Minister Waigel made those comments. They probably have more to do with the situation of other member states and little or nothing to do with his perception of the Irish economy.  Regarding the other matters, I have made my views known on the question of a commissioner for small countries and on the other issues we will defend Ireland's interests effectively.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Under company law there is no mechanism under which the State can intervene in the market to stop a private company being taken <Col N="1315" /> over by or amalgamating with another provided the provisions of competition legislation are respected.  Furthermore, under European Union law, actions which would seek to discriminate in favour of national companies would be illegal.</P>
      <P>In order to realise the potential of the food industry and maximise its contribution to job creation and economic development within Ireland, it is essential to develop companies with increased scale.  Joint ventures, amalgamation and takeovers allow companies to develop such scale.  In fact, a number of Irish firms have themselves acquired companies abroad as part of their development strategy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the Minister of State's reply.  Green Isle has been a resounding success and was put forward as a prototype for the development of Irish food companies.  The report of the expert group on the food industry acknowledged that to encourage growth in this sector there is a need for multinational involvement and in that regard it referred to partnerships. Given that Green Isle was the strongest company in the fastest growing sector of the food industry and that its strategy dictated the loss of majority shareholding from Irish hands, does the Minister agree that a regrettable consequence of the development of similar food companies in the future will be that Irish majority shareholding will be lost?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that as a private company the ultimate decision on ownership is a matter for the company.  Since 1987 Northern Foods has owned approximately 36 per cent of Green Isle and assisted it in building up to market share and penetrating the British market.  I hope this arrangement will ensure it can penetrate European markets.  It is envisaged that Green Isle will handle the entire frozen foods sector of Northern <Col N="1316" /> Foods which will continue its mainstream activities in the chilled food sector. While I understand the Deputy's reservations, I am confident that this arrangement will maintain jobs and consolidate Green Isle's operations not only here but in Great Britain and on the Continent.  There is no conflict of interest.  Northern Foods and Green Isle will maintain their core work in the food industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I acknowledge that a decision on ownership is a matter for the company.  My concern relates to the implications this will have for the building of a strategy for our food industry. If the strongest indigenous company in this sector &mdash; the fastest growing sector of the food industry &mdash; believes that in order to develop it must lose its majority shareholding, is it not likely that most food companies that follow the developmental approach adopted by Green Isle will end up in the same position? As a regrettable consequence of our strategy for the building of the food industry, will the majority shareholding of many of our companies be taken out of Irish hands?  We all acknowledge that partnerships and joint ventures are necessary, but if the strongest company in a sector must give up a majority shareholding, what will be the position of indigenous companies in the future?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deehihan Mr. Deehihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deehihan</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the reasons for its being the strongest company in the sector was the input of Northern Foods. I refer the Deputy to the food sub-programme intended to strengthen Irish companies, which includes capital investment, research and development, marketing and promotion along with human resources.  The total expenditure under this programme will be approximately £640 million of which £283 million will come from public funds which should ensure Irish companies will remain competitive and become stronger.  We must not forget that a number of large co-operatives are taking over companies in other countries within and outside the European Union, so we cannot object to others coming in <Col N="1317" /> to take over companies here.  I hope this will prove to be a very rare occurrence and Irish food companies will go from strength to strength.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State will be aware that much of the Expert Report on Food outlined that in the period under review, 85 per cent of grant-aid for fixed capital investment was non-repayable.  Given the amount of money the Irish taxpayer has invested in this and other companies can he give the House any indication of what review is taking place within his Department so that a greater degree of such grant-aid is repayable assistance.  People who receive such grant-aid in their first phases of development should be obliged to repay in the event of developments such as occurred last week?</P>

      <Quest>the type of projects grant-aided under Leader I which are being excluded from Leader II by new guidelines; and the percentage of total funds in Leader I granted to such projects which are now deemed ineligible under Leader II.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>In general, given the requirement for innovation insisted on by the EU Commission, the projects eligible for aid under mainstream programmes and schemes cannot be aided under Leader II.  In addition, projects or activities which are prevented from being aided because of national or EU policy considerations may not be supported by Leader either.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Examples of the type of projects aided in Leader I which are not now eligible for aid are golf courses, farm relief services and horse breeding <Col N="1318" /> schemes principally because they are aided by other continuous schemes.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy knows, the central feature of Leader is that decisions on the projects to be aided are taken by the Leader groups.  Consequently, the detailed information on each Leader I project is with the groups, rather than my Department.  I am not in a position to make a definitive judgement in the 3,000 or so cases involved, as to whether they would or would not in whole or in part qualify for aid under Leader II.</P>
    <P>Extracting the very detailed information from the groups in order to answer the latter part of the Deputy's question would mean deferring more pressing and urgent work in the implementation of Leader II by my Department and could not be justified.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that sufficient worthwhile projects and capacity-building opportunities remain open to Leader groups to ensure the maximum effectiveness of the programme while also respecting the need to operate in a manner which is additional to other publicly-funded measures.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The reply is most unsatisfactory because, as the Minister knows, two meetings were held on 12 and 13 June in Athlone explaining the new guidelines his Department is imposing on these Leader groups.  I have asked what percentage of the total funds deemed to be eligible will not now be eligible under the provisions of Leader I.  That figure should be easily extrapolated given that the Minister and his officials have devised these new guidelines. I might remind the Minister of State that the Leader-type approach is based on the involvement of local communities charting their development.  Is he aware there is enormous conviction among those Leader groups that that vital ingredient in the success of the pilot programme is absent from Leader II; that there is growing dismay among Leader groups about the possible effectiveness of their proposals, which have had to be revised because of under-investment in Leader II?  Does he <Col N="1319" /> realise there is dismay at the imposition from the top which flies in the face of the philosophy of Leader I which entailed bottom-up development?  Is he also aware that there are meetings taking place to ascertain whether such groups can go ahead with this scheme established by his Department?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I reject the assertion that there is growing dismay.  Many groups are very enthusiastic about putting their programmes in place and anxious to go ahead with them.  We had to put these guidelines in place to protect the integrity of Leader.  I do not have to remind the House that the Comptroller and Auditor General, in many instances, was very critical of the manner in which some Leader schemes were handled.  All of us are aware of major examples of Leader groups who did not operate in accordance with the specified guidelines.  The main problem arose from the flexibility clause which allowed some groups to put in place schemes never intended by the European Union, leaving us no option but to remove that flexibility clause.  There remains major scope for innovation, capacity-building and for providing projects in rural areas under the scheme. Therefore, I am confident that Leader II will act as a catalyst for the rejuvenation and renewal of rural Ireland.  The objective of the programme, published by the European Union, is to stimulate innovative measures for rural development, to ensure that the programmes finances contribute to real value-added in relation to other operations part-financed by the operational programmes, and other forms of assistance under the Community Support Framework and do not serve to finance activities already being carried out by others engaged in the rural development process. When Leader I was established we did not have the ADMs or the county enterprise boards.  We want to prevent overlapping and ensure that Leader funding will be invested in projects that <Col N="1320" /> cannot be grant-aided under those programmes. That is very important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not true that the Minister's Department had no option but to remove the flexibility clause, because the Leader programme is being penalised on the basis of three groups in respect of which some modifications were suggested by the Comptroller and Auditor General, out of a total of 16 groups, under the pilot scheme?  Is the Minister aware that the independent assessment carried out by his Department under Dr. Brendan Kearney confirmed it had been the most successful rural community development programme within the European Union under that pilot scheme?  Furthermore, his Department appears to have obtained from its political masters an agreement that, because of some slight criticism, by the Comptroller and Auditor General in respect of a minority of those groups, the present increased number of groups should be penalised. Will he not reconsider this omission of the flexibility clause, which represented the only guarantee that the development thereunder would be a bottom-up type, enabling local communities rather than his Department to identify their needs?  Will the Minister not accept the independent assessment of Dr. Brendan Kearney under the aegis of his Department? Will he also accept that his attempt to blacken all groups because of a few problems under the pilot scheme was wrong, and the problem could easily have been dealt with without omitting this vital flexibility clause allowing local communities identify their needs?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Ewe premium payments are made in accordance with EU regulations and payment is made in three instalments.  The amount to be paid is fixed by the Commission and the regulations preclude payment of any of the instalments until some days have elapsed from the date of publication of that decision in the Official Journal.  The publication date is dependent on the smooth operation of the Commission's publication facilities involving translation.</P>
      <P>The overall value of the premium to Irish sheep farmers will be in the region of £80 million.  The final instalment is due to be paid soon after the end of the 1995 marketing year and is expected to bring total payments to around £123 million for the 1995 premium year.</P>
      <P>Since EU legal constraints will preclude publication of the decision fixing the second instalment until after 1 July 1995, indications at present are that the decision will be published early in July allowing payment of both instalments to commence no later than the second week of July.</P>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that my Department will facilitate the earliest possible payment of the first and second instalments consistent with EU regulations, and I might add that this will be the earliest date on which this payment has ever been made.</P>

He indicated it would be paid in the month of June.  Since then, lamb prices have plummeted even further. Despite the cosmetic exercise undertaken by the Minister during the Commissioner's visit, payment of the ewe premium will be made within a week or ten days of the date it was paid last year.</P>

Hopefully, payments will be made this year two weeks earlier and that is a considerable achievement on the part of the Minister.  We all acknowledge that the price of lamb is at an unacceptable level but the Minister is doing everything possible to help sheep farmers.

      <P>Sheep farmers will be waiting with open arms for those cheques to arrive.  What policies will the Department pursue to improve the income of sheep farmers?  It is quite clear that the APS scheme has not put one additional penny into farmers' pockets and there is now a 20 per cent reduction in lamb prices compared to last year.  Apart from engaging in cosmetic exercises on the front page of the <i>Farmers Journal,</i> will the Minister do anything to improve the income of farmers?  He should not insinuate that there is a crock of gold at the end of the rainbow when the rainbow has long since disappeared.</P>

      <P>In regard to the APS scheme, approximately 270 tonnes of lamb was taken out of the market and put into storage until the autumn.  Those negotiations were unprecedented because they took place over a period <Col N="1326" /> of 48 hours.  The Minister should be congratulated on that major achievement.</P>

      <P>This year to date average prices are down 6 per cent on last year's prices but they are not down to the level they were back in 1992.  As Deputies know, there are problems in the French market which takes about 75 per cent of our lamb.  The Minister spent two days last week in Paris at a promotional marketing campaign organised by An Bord Bia.  I spent a day in Madrid promoting Irish lamb and the response was very good.  Certainly the people of Inishowen have received further orders as a result of my intervention.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry has performed very well.  We will do everything possible in Europe to negotiate a top up premium.  The Minister has taken steps and is making proposals to effect this. Because of a mechanism put in place by a previous Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry in 1992 member states cannot have a national premium. All that is left to us to do is to try to get <Col N="1327" /> a top up premium and we are striving to do that.  I hope we will be successful and I am sure the Deputy will support our efforts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Compatibility of forestry development with the environment is an important element of our programme, and indeed is a basic condition of grant-aid.  A variety of measures are taken by my Department in this context, including prior consultation with relevant State agencies on listed environmentally sensitive areas, the publication of guidelines on forestry development and the landscape, fisheries and archaeology, grant incentives for diversity in planting, with a particular emphasis on broadleaves, and the development of amenity and recreation <Col N="1329" /> schemes.  A number of these pre-date the operational, as distinct from the legislative, establishment of the Environmental Protection Agency.</P>
      <P>Under section 52 of the Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1992, the main functions of the Environmental Protection Agency are: integrated licensing and control; monitoring of the environment; provision of environmental support and advisory services to local authorities; and promotion and co-ordination of environmental research.</P>
      <P>Section 55 also provides that the agency may provide information or advice to Ministers, on request or on its own volition, on environmental matters including: amendment or implementation of any international obligation; proposals for legislative change; guidelines, standards and other matters relating to environmental protection; and particular environmental issues or problems. It is also a function of the Environmental Protection Agency under section 52 to keep itself informed of policies and objectives of public authorities whose functions have or may have a bearing on its activities.</P>
      <P>My Department has not to date found it necessary to consult the Environmental Protection Agency in relation to our forestry programme, nor has the Environmental Protection Agency found it necessary to approach my Department requesting information or offering advice and &mdash; or recommendations on our forestry policy and practices. I have no doubt that such approaches would be made if in the future either party felt it desirable or necessary to do so.</P>

      <P>Will the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry give closer consideration to applications for planning between the road and the sea in environmentally sensitive areas, particularly areas of great scenic amenity, in the light of the fact that a development might obstruct the view when the trees grow?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a recurrent <Col N="1332" /> problem and opposition has been voiced previously about the proliferation of planting in scenic areas.  However, there must be a balance.  This matter will be addressed in the new strategy for forestry development because it is important to have a clear-cut policy for planting in scenic areas.  To date there have been contradictions where some forestry has been allowed whereas applications for contiguous planting have been refused.  There is an example of that in the Deputy's own constituency. We need clear guidelines for planting in scenic areas and developers must comply with restrictions because they too have responsibilities for the environment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 15, 43, 57 and 84 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware that the work level in the <Col N="1333" /> farm development offices has increased with the introduction of the farm retirement scheme and REPS and my Department is continuing its review of the allocation of personnel in this area.</P>
    <P>The overall staffing level in my Department is under consideration in the context of the Government decision of 6 June 1995 regarding Civil Service staff numbers.  Generally, I will be keeping this whole matter under review in consultation with the Minister for Finance and other Government colleagues.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has indicated that cutbacks will be made in the day to day running of the Department. Will this not affect the regional offices within the farm development service which are chronically understaffed? How can there be improvement in the services signalled by the Minister, Deputy Yates, when he announced a charter of rights for farmers, if no money is to be made available and there are to be cutbacks in front line services?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not expanded on precisely where these cutbacks will occur, and I do not intend to do so now. However, the Minister is determined to put in place a charter of rights for farmers and will do everything possible to ensure that it is effective.  I am confident he will provide the necessary resources, human and technological, to ensure full implementation over his term of office of the charter of rights for farmers.  The Deputy may not like to hear this, but we inherited a situation where offices such as those of the farm development scheme were undermanned despite these programmes being in place.  I am confident that the Minister will ensure adequate staffing levels and an efficient service for farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. H. Byrne Mr. H. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The charter of rights for farmers was announced with tremendous fanfare by the Minister a short time ago, but when will it be implemented?  Does the Minister of State remember that the Minister announced 100 people would be <Col N="1334" /> appointed to his Department?  How many have been appointed?  Was this just another promise made when all the media seemed to be on his back or is it the case, now that a dose of reality has set in, that this may not happen?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a number of other questions on the Order Paper today that address the question of the charter of rights for farmers and staffing levels.  However, I am confident that the Minister will implement the provision in the charter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. H. Byrne Mr. H. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Some of the proposals are already in place.  Others will be in place by September.  All the provisions will be implemented over a period of time as resources permit but the Minister is adamant that during his period of office the charter of rights will be implemented.  Farmers are grateful to the Minister for putting it in place.  As to other staffing arrangements, any commitments made by the Minister since he came into office have been fully honoured.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Will special provision be made to strengthen the staffing levels in local offices, such as those in Cavan, where there is a huge and unacceptable backlog in processing applications under the control of farm pollution and dairy hygiene schemes?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I met representatives from Lakelands recently in connection with the problem in the Cavan office.  I agree with the Deputy that applications submitted to the Cavan office were not dealt with expeditiously but this was due to understaffing.  One staff member was ill and unavailable for work.  I am examining the position in that office.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 16, 17, 27, 58, 69, 75, 88, 174, 194 and 195 together.</P>
      <P>Bovine tuberculosis in Ireland is at a low level and over 99 per cent of the seven million animals in the national herd are clear of this disease.  The remaining incidence is essentially residual infection.</P>
      <P>Progress in achieving a significant reduction in the remaining infection level has been slow, difficult and costly and I have instructed my Department to review the present eradication strategy with a view to increasing efficiency and effectiveness.</P>
      <P>EU funding has been approved for the 1995 TB eradication programme on the basis that testing of the national herd will be rotated between practices over the next two to three years. Rotation of testing within practices does not meet the conditions for drawdown of EU funding.  Negotiations have been ongoing with the Irish Veterinary Union for some considerable time on introducing revised testing arrangements to meet the conditions to secure EU funding and a ballot of union members is currently taking place on my Department's final proposals for rotation of testing and fees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am extremely disappointed that the executive committee of the union has recommended rejection of the proposals given the limited scale of the changes being proposed and the substantial increase in fees that has been offered. <Col N="1337" /> On 9 June the Minister wrote to all veterinary practitioners who undertake testing of behalf of this Department to outline the full facts of the case, to spell out the implications of non-acceptance of the package and to appeal for acceptance. I take this opportunity to renew the Minister's appeal for acceptance.</P>
    <P>I should make it clear that a continuation of the <i>status quo</i> is not an option. Thus non-acceptance of the proposals will leave me with no alternative but to proceed with unilateral measures and to take other appropriate steps.  The objective of reducing and eradicating TB from the national herd is the major animal health priority for me.  In addition, failure to secure EU funding or to implement the eradication programme approved at EU level would be most undesirable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a strike pending by veterinary surgeons which will have a serious effect on the industry.  This is the third time a strike by veterinary surgeons occurred under a Fine Gael Minister in the last three Fine Gael administrations. Administration of the scheme, for which £61 million is available, costs £18.5 million.  That compares with the £19.3 million paid to the veterinary surgeons who implement the scheme.  Why is 26 per cent of the money spent on administration?  What steps is the Minister of State taking to reduce that outrageous overspend?  Veterinary surgeons have conducted random sampling since 1989.  Why will the Minister of State not publish the results of those tests?</P>

I have given a commitment to it and to the IFA that if the proposals are accepted I intend to have regular discussions with the farming organisations, the Veterinary Union of Ireland and departmental veterinary officers on how best to administer the scheme, introduce cost savings and improve the scheme.  I agree with the Deputy that a hands-on approach was not adopted by recent Ministers but if given the opportunity I intend to take such an approach.  I hope our proposals will be accepted.</P>

Farmers receive compensation payments equal to half the amount paid to veterinary surgeons for implementing the scheme.  What is the Minister of State doing to continue the scheme?  The survey was designed to <Col N="1339" /> measure the performance of veterinary officers in the Department compared to veterinary surgeons in private practice. It was to be a dipstick to measure TB levels.  Will the Minister publish the results of the survey and tell us how departmental veterinary officers compare with those in the private sector? Why are there 3.5 reactors per 1,000 when in 1988 there were 2.7 reactors per 1,000?  Does the Minister of State share his Minister's view that tuberculosis cannot be eradicated, in other words this scheme should be called the tuberculosis minimising scheme?</P>

      <P>Immediately.  As regards the APT figure of 3.5 reactors per 1,000 cattle referred to by the Deputy, it is too early to say what the figure will be this year.  It is estimated at 3 per 1,000, a slight increase on last year's figure of 2.9.  The figures referred <Col N="1340" /> to at present are incorrect and inaccurate and we will have to wait until the end of the year to know the real figure.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister confirm that the incidence is, unfortunately, higher than in 1988 when we set up a body to eradicate TB?  Does he accept that diseased animals other than livestock were a contributory factor in individual cases where action was taken and that failure by the interests concerned to deal with this issue is of significant concern?  If, as seems likely from what their representatives said, vets refuse to co-operate in the scheme this year, what precise alternative arrangements does the Minister propose to put in place and will the people appointed have the ability and technical expertise to carry out TB testing?</P>

Does his alternative proposal mean that testing will be privatised and carried out by vets and farmers?  Will 50 per cent of the extra funding from Europe be used to pay more to vets and to meet administration costs?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Ms E. Fitzgerald)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take the three questions together.</P>
      <P>The dispute between Dunnes Stores and MANDATE is a matter of serious concern to the Government.  It is in everybody's interest that industrial peace resumes at Dunnes Stores as soon as possible for workers, suppliers and consumers.  I want to see talks get under way as soon as possible to resolve this dispute as, like any industrial dispute, it can only ultimately be resolved around the table.</P>
      <P>The strike action at Dunnes Stores arises from a dispute between the company and the trade union, MANDATE, about payment for Sunday working, about zero hour contracts and a number of other issues.  This is a long-standing dispute that gave rise to strike action in a number of the company's stores last year.  An agreement was reached at that time between the parties which resolved the problem for the time being.  More widespread introduction of Sunday trading, with its consequences for staff working conditions, has given rise to the current dispute.</P>
      <P>Dunnes Stores is a major employer. We need to have and to encourage more firms on this scale in all sectors.  It is, therefore, a matter of regret that this dispute has reached the stage where the company's workers are now on strike and many of its stores are closed.  The way forward in this case is to build on the model of national partnership and to seek a resolution of differences through discussion.  Everything will have to be and can only be sorted out around the table.  It is ultimately a matter for the parties concerned to resolve the industrial dispute with the assistance of the dispute settling services provided by the State, if necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Labour Relations Commission has offered its services to the parties. <Col N="1347" /> They are aware that the commission's offer of assistance still stands.  I understand the union is willing to attend talks at the Labour Relations Commission but that the company is not.  As I understand matters, the company tends not to avail of the assistance of the State's dispute settling services.  These services are voluntary and there is no compulsion or management or unions to use them. However, given the serious situation that has developed in this dispute and the effect the strike could have on others not involved, I call on the company to reconsider its position and to avail of the expert assistance of the Labour Relations Commission.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of my colleagues on this side of the House I echo the call by the Minister of State on Dunnes Stores management to avail of the Labour Relations Commission and to enter into a dialogue with MANDATE to resolve the differences, as it did in Northern Ireland with the worker's union there on outstanding problems.  What is the Minister doing to bring the parties together to save not only the jobs of the workers but of suppliers? When will the Minister introduce legislation to regulate Sunday trading which is, in effect, a central issue in this dispute?  Will the Minister accept that her colleague, the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Richard Bruton, promised such legislation during the Cork by-election campaign? The IPC report on Sunday trading is available and the Minister is in a position to produce this legislation as is every other EU member state.  If this legislation is introduced, will the Minister accept that it would clear the air on this issue and it would help to bring the parties together to resolve this dispute?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EithneFitzgerald" hpid="Ms E. Fitzgerald Ms E. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms E. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The central issue in this dispute is that the parties are not talking to one another.  I find it difficult to understand why one of our major companies has not come to the table to discuss the issues concerned with the <Col N="1348" /> union that represents the vast majority of its workforce.  I am available if either party wishes to speak with me.  As Dunnes Stores is aware, it can contact me at any stage if it is interested in a resolution of this issue.</P>
      <P>The issue of Sunday trading and Sunday working is a complex one.  Many of us would not wish to see the development of widespread Sunday trading with supermarket shopping and so on.  It is difficult to regulate this legally and I am taking legal advice on it.  It is difficult to devise a system where it is possible to regulate Sunday opening by the major stores in a way which would not close the small local shops which provide a service that is widely appreciated.</P>

      <P>There is little any Minister can do in this dispute.  The Minister can introduce legislation to regulate Sunday trading but there are difficulties involved.  Will the Minister agree with me and with &mdash; I assume &mdash; the majority of the people in condemning Dunnes Stores' management for the manner in which it has treated the workforce? A company which celebrated 50 years in existence with such aplomb and give-aways still does not have a pension <Col N="1349" /> scheme.  We can support the workers and we can bring pressure to bear in this dispute by continuously outlining the conditions under which these people are expected to work: zero hour contracts; no guarantee of work, having to report and be available and no pension scheme.  Some 10 per cent of the workforce are permanent after 50 years&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms E. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am anxious to see an early resolution to this dispute in the interests of workers, suppliers and consumers. It would not be helpful at this stage for me to comment on the issues involved in the dispute.  The way we do business in an industrial relations framework is through partnership and negotiation. We have long established voluntary mechanisms &mdash; the Labour Relations Commission and the Labour Court.  I call on both parties to come to the table to discuss their differences sooner rather than later in the interests of everyone concerned.  Any industrial dispute, ultimately, has to be settled through discussion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the Minister of State's call but does she accept that the IPC in its report on Sunday trading spells out clearly that collective bargaining is not enough?  It is clear legislation is required.  All our EU colleagues have legislated.  Does the Minister of State accept that in the absence of legislation workers are being exploited and are being coerced to work on Sunday?  Does she not feel obliged to ensure that employees work voluntarily and are properly paid?  The Minister of State should outline her thinking on this <Col N="1350" /> matter and the type of legislation she will introduce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EithneFitzgerald" hpid="Ms E. Fitzgerald Ms E. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms E. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two separate issues the first of which is Sunday trading and the other hours of work for individuals.  On the question of Sunday trading, there is legislation dating back to 1938 which has never been enforced. I do not think anyone would expect us to revise legislation dating back almost 60 years.  Most people are happy with the position where the corner shop is open on Sunday to sell bread, milk and newspapers and they can go to their local DIY store and garden centre.  In relation to the larger supermarkets and clothing outlets, there would be legal difficulties in regulating Sunday trading for one group and not for another.  No matter where one's sympathies lie in relation to keeping Sunday as a special day on which there is no large scale trading there would be legal difficulties which I am examining in my Department. I may be precluded from moving as I might wish for legal reasons.</P>
      <P>On the question of hours of work, we are examining the EU directive on working time which is due to be transposed into Irish law in 1996.  I am examining the issue of Sunday working hours in that context.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>As a Sunday shopper, I am delighted to hear the Minister of State is not necessarily going to ban it. I agree with her that there would be enormous legal difficulties.  In a free society we need to be careful and must realise that this company is unique in terms of the attitude it has adopted. Other companies play it well with the agreement of their workers.  With a view to bringing this dispute to an end has the Minister of State or her Department been in touch with the management of this company since the dispute arose? Does she agree, given the way the dispute has evolved, that it is very unlikely that the two sides will come together unless a third party such as the Minister intervenes?</P>

      <P>The first port of call in any industrial dispute has to be the established relations machinery.  If Ministers were to step in at the beginning it would be almost as if the parties concerned were being rewarded for not going to the table and using the established machinery which we are paying for as taxpayers and which works extremely well on our behalf.  Dunnes Stores management is aware that I am available if it wants to contact me.  I have contacted Margaret Heffernan's office and I am available if she wants to come back to me.</P>

      <P>I am concerned about the effects of this dispute not only on workers but also on suppliers and their employees.  Because we are dealing with a major company there is a widespread effect on employment.  That is the reason I am calling on the parties concerned to come to the table sooner rather than later.  At the end of the day they will have to do this if this dispute is to be resolved.  It is extremely important that our large and successful public companies follow the established pattern of industrial relations and the way we do business.  We have had a successful social partnership and have a good record when it comes to strikes because people have used the established machinery.  I call on this major public company to use the established machinery and come to the table.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Howlin) Brendan Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Publication of the Waste Bill, 1995, fulfils the commitment of the policy agreement A Government of Renewal that framework waste legislation would be published at an early date.  The essential purposes of the measures provided for in this Bill are to prevent and reduce waste production, to encourage and assist recycling and recovery of waste, and to reduce the risk to, and impact on, the environment from waste by strict control of waste collection, movement and disposal.  This Bill will provide a comprehensive and flexible framework for legislative support of these policies well into the next century. I look forward to a positive and constructive debate on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recent decades we witnessed a profound change in our attitudes to the environment.  Economic growth and development remain important goals, but we now appreciate more fully that proper care must be taken of the environmental resources on which economic activity and indeed human survival are based.  Sustainable development requires that in pursuing economic development to meet the needs of the present generation we do not compromise the ability of future generations to meet their needs.  Environmental protection and economic development <Col N="1459" /> must be mutually consistent and supportive. However, this simple concept is difficult to put into practice, and nowhere is this more so than in relation to waste management.</P>
    <P>Agenda 21, the most important product of the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio, stated that: &ldquo;human health and environmental quality are being continually degraded by the increasing amount of waste being produced, despite increasing efforts to prevent waste accumulation and to promote recycling&rdquo;.  The statistics underlying these comments are convincing.  The OECD area, comprising the world's most developed countries, generated some nine billion tonnes of waste in 1990, including more than 300 million tonnes of hazardous waste.  This pattern of waste generation is creating demands which are increasingly being recognised as going beyond the carrying capacity of the environment. The EU Fifth Environment Action Programme notes, as a disquieting trend, that despite increased efforts at waste prevention and recycling, waste produced in the Union increased by 13 per cent between 1987 and 1992.</P>
    <P>These patterns are also reflected in Ireland.  We generate annually an estimated 6.5 million tonnes of municipal and industrial waste in addition to even larger quantities of agricultural, mining and other wastes.  Municipal waste from the domestic and commercial sectors amounts to some 1.7 million tonnes and there are substantial costs associated with the safe management of these wastes.  In 1994 expenditure on waste management by local authorities alone exceeded £65 million.</P>
    <P>Waste is one of the most complex areas of present day environmental management.  Waste issues are inextricably linked with consumption, lifestyle, economic activity and industrial policy. Their solution requires acceptance of the principle of shared responsibility for the environment by everyone in the community.  It will also require radical <Col N="1460" /> changes to current waste management policies and adjustments of lifestyles.</P>
    <P>One very topical environmental issue illustrates the progress which has been made in terms of public awareness.  This Bill does not address the issue of dumping at sea, but the current international controversy over the proposed dumping of the <i>Brent Spar</i> oil rig in the north Atlantic is an indication that public attitudes have changed significantly.  The Government is very concerned that this proposal may represent a serious threat to the marine environment arising from the possible presence within the installation of PCBs, oily sludges and radioactive sludge.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>The topical issue of dumping at sea indicates the change in attitude of the general public to the environment.  Irish authorities have already raised this issue at the appropriate international fora.  We will continue to press, alongside many of our European partners, for a halt to this marine dumping proposal, pending a review at the Joint Oslo Paris Commission meeting next week of the rules governing the disposal of redundant offshore installations. I intend personally to raise this <Col N="1461" /> issue at a formal meeting of EU Environment Ministers to be held on Thursday and Friday this week in Luxembourg.</P>
      <P>EU legislation and policies now represent a major input to the approach to waste management in all member states. Both hazardous and non-hazardous wastes are controlled under the important Framework Directive on Waste which was updated in 1991. There are European Union legislative provisions also in relation to waste movement and export, packaging waste recycling, waste incineration and, prospectively, landfill of waste.</P>
      <P>The European Union involvement in waste issues is driven by the need to maintain a level playing field for industry and business, based on high environmental standards.  It is motivated also by the transboundary nature of many waste issues and by the need to ensure an integrated and adequate network of waste management facilities across the Union. Few countries are completely self-sufficient in this regard: it can be necessary to rely on facilities located elsewhere in the European Union both for specialised waste disposal and for recycling purposes.</P>
      <P>EU waste policy is based on a well known hierachy of principles: these give priority first to the prevention and minimisation of waste, then to their reuse and recovery and finally to the environmentally sound disposal of wastes which cannot otherwise be dealt with.</P>
      <P>Ireland too is experiencing many changes of attitude and practice in relation to waste management.  The public have become rightly more sensitive to the environmental hazards of waste disposal.  This is leading to increased public support for waste prevention and recycling, as well as insistence on higher standards for waste disposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Major changes on the ground are visible compared to only four or five years ago.  Nearly 400 collection points for recyclable materials have been established around the country.  New landfills have been provided which embody sophisticated leachate and gas control <Col N="1462" /> systems.  The price of waste disposal is rising substantially as a result of these higher standards.  This is economically onerous but environmentally progressive in so far as it makes recycling a more viable economic option.  There is a growing involvement of the private sector in Irish waste operations.</P>
    <P>There is also in place a Government approved national recycling strategy. An industry task force is responding to this strategy and has recently extended its work by the engagement of international consultants who will help to complete the report.  I regard the work of the industry task force as important and urgent and I look forward to receiving its proposals soon.</P>
    <P>A range of other measures and instruments is being developed to promote a more sustained and sustainable approach to waste management in Ireland. These include application of integrated pollution control licensing under the Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1992 for certain waste activities; development by the agency of criteria and procedures for the selection, management, operation and termination of landfill sites by local authorities; provision of EU co-financing &mdash; under the Operational Programme for Environmental Services 1994-99 &mdash; of some £30 million to assist better waste planning and the provision of waste recovery and hazardous waste management facilities; studies now in progress by the Economic and Social Research Institute on the economic elements of a strategy for optimal solid waste management in Ireland and for the use of economic instruments for environmental purposes, and a major project on waste statistics now being initiated by the Environmental Protection Agency.</P>
    <P>All these responses show that many changes have already taken place in Ireland to adapt to the more progressive and sustainable approaches to waste management which are increasingly being pursued in the developed world.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1463" /> The Waste Bill is a new and major contribution to this process.  It is a framework proposal which will provide the necessary enabling and regulatory powers to apply and adapt policy measures in the face of changing environmental, economic, technical and administrative conditions.  Fundamental principles are clearly established in the Bill.  Many of the specific measures and obligations provided for, with many detailed technical standards and administrative procedures, will remain to be applied by way of secondary legislation which will follow as a matter of priority after the Bill is enacted.</P>
    <P>The main objectives of the Waste Bill are to provide for a more effective organisation of public authority functions in relation to waste management, involving new or redefined roles for the Minister for the Environment, the Environmental Protection Agency and local authorities; enabling measures, designed to improve our performance in relation to the prevention, minimisation and recovery of wastes; and a comprehensive statutory framework for the application of higher environmental standards, in response to European Union and national waste management requirements.</P>
    <P>I would like first to give a brief outline of the structure of the Bill and then to describe some of its more important features.  I will be glad to respond at the conclusion of Second Stage to all points Deputies may raise.  A detailed explanatory and financial memorandum on the Waste Bill has already been circulated, with a more general policy statement and guide to the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Bill is structured in seven parts. Part I contains standard provisions dealing with such matters as interpretation, regulations, offences, penalties and other general matters.  There are also provisions regarding information, monitoring and inspection, and the powers of authorised officers.  Part II deals with waste management planning.  It provides for the making of a national hazardous <Col N="1464" /> waste management plan by the Environmental Protection Agency and for improved and systematic arrangements for local authority waste management plans.  Part III provides a framework for wide-ranging measures in support of waste prevention, minimisation and recovery.  Part IV provides for basic obligations on all holders of waste, including householders, to prevent environmental pollution, and for the control of waste collection and movement internally and internationally.</P>
    <P>Part V provides for the establishment of an integrated licensing system to be operated by the agency in respect of most waste recovery and disposal activities and for alternative controls in respect of other lower risk activities. Part VI contains provisions allowing various measures to be taken to prevent or mitigate environmental pollution caused by waste, similar to equivalent provisions under air and water legislation currently in place.  Part VII contains miscellaneous provisions, and deals in particular with policy directions in relation to waste licensing and the movement of waste, the authorisation of waste disposal under other enactments, and powers to give effect to further EU obligations on waste.</P>
    <P>The First and Second Schedules specify, respectively, categories of waste and hazardous waste.  The Third and Fourth Schedules specify, respectively, waste recovery and disposal activities which are licensable.  The Fifth Schedule deals with repeals and revocations.</P>
    <P>The scope of the Bill as defined in Part I is very broad.  The Bill relates to all types of waste apart from the specific wastes and waste activities excluded by section 3, which are already covered by other legislation.  These exclusions relate principally to sewage and sewage effluent, radioactive wastes and dumping at sea, all of which are controlled under other statutory codes.</P>
    <P>I should make it clear that the Bill will not extend either to the reform and updating of the law on litter, which is now contained in the Litter Act, 1982.  I <Col N="1465" /> am committed to this as a separate legislative proposal which I hope to publish later this year.  Litter is different from the generality of waste; for example, it is difficult to ascribe ownership to it and it does not present the characteristics of toxicity associated with the solid wastes which the present Bill will control.  It is dealt with separately from solid waste in a number of legislative systems, including that of the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>Part II of the Bill provides for a more rigorous waste planning system involving, for the first time, a formal procedure for public consultation and input.  The present position is that the major local authorities are required to prepare waste management plans, in respect of both non-hazardous and &ldquo;special&rdquo; wastes.  The Bill provides that the Environmental Protection Agency will be required to prepare a national hazardous waste management plan. Other public authorities having a function in relation to hazardous waste will be required to have due regard to provisions contained in the national plan; the agency will be empowered to issue specific recommendations to individual local authorities arising from the plan.</P>
    <P>The major local authorities will continue to prepare detailed waste management plans, either individually or jointly, to be reviewed every five years. These plans will deal primarily with non-hazardous wastes.  A formal procedure for public consultation is being introduced.</P>
    <P>The Bill specifies certain matters to be dealt with in waste and hazardous waste management plans.  In particular, all waste management plans will be required to focus closely on the scope for waste prevention and waste recovery, including recycling.  The Minister will have power to specify in detail the form and content of local authority plans, to require local authorities to coordinate their plans or to make joint plans, and to require that a local authority plan be varied.  These proposals are intended significantly to strengthen the function of planning for waste management.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1466" /> Section 28 in particular deals with waste prevention and represents the very significant new &ldquo;front end&rdquo; approach to secure the avoidance of waste.  It provides for support programmes in respect of research or development projects and for the imposition of a range of possible regulatory measures.  These may include requirements on service, commercial or industrial activity to carry out waste audits and waste reduction programmes, and stringent controls upon the import, production or use of problematic substances or products.  They may also include the publication of reports by businesses as to the steps they have taken to comply with these requirements.</P>
    <P>Section 29 provides for a range of measures to promote the recovery of waste.  For example, the Minister for the Environment will be empowered to introduce mandatory deposit and refund schemes, take-back requirements to be operated by producers or consumers and charges by retailers for items of packaging.  Section 29 also provides for a scheme of recycling credits to be operated by local authorities.</P>
    <P>An exemption from some of the mandatory provisions of section 29 may be given to companies which participate in voluntary recycling schemes which have been approved by the Minister. This combination of mandatory take-back obligations which are held in reserve and voluntary industry led arrangements is already operating successfully in a number of EU countries.</P>
    <P>I expect public authorities to lead by example in pursuing sustainable activity and demonstrating best environmental management practice, through good housekeeping and environmentally-sensitive procurement policies.  Sections 30 and 31 make appropriate provision in this regard.  Among other things, they require the Minister for the Environment to promulgate a comprehensive programme for the prevention, minimisation and recovery of waste by public authorities in carrying out their operations.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1467" /> Part IV relates to the holding, collection and movement of waste.  This Part contains some of the basic statutory provisions for environmental protection against irresponsible handling or disposal of waste.  Section 32 expressly prohibits any person from holding, recovering or disposing of waste in a manner which may cause environmental pollution.  It prohibits a person holding waste from handing the waste over to a person who is not properly authorised to deal with waste.</P>
    <P>Part IV also clarifies and expands the role of local authorities in relation to waste collection.  In general, local authorities will be required to ensure that there is an adequate household waste collection service within their functional areas and, if necessary, to provide, or arrange for the provision of, necessary services.  Local authorities will be empowered to provide collection services for non-household wastes at their discretion.</P>
    <P>Waste collection services are increasingly being provided by commercial operators.  In order to ensure that these operations are carried out in an environmentally sound manner, the Bill provides that commercial collectors of waste will require a permit from the relevant local authority.</P>
    <P>Local authorities will also be empowered to make by-laws controlling the presentation of waste for collection within their areas.  For example, by-laws could be used to regulate the time and manner for leaving out waste for collection, to reduce litter and to facilitate the segregation and separate collection of recyclable wastes.  The Bill confers wide powers on the Environmental Protection Agency and major local authorities to control the movement of individual waste consignments, both within the country and internationally.</P>
    <P>Part V of the Bill relates to the provision and licensing of waste recovery and disposal facilities.  The major local authorities will have a statutory duty to ensure there are adequate facilities for the recovery or disposal of domestic <Col N="1468" /> wastes arising in their areas and will be empowered to provide any other infrastructure considered necessary for good waste management.</P>
    <P>A major organisational reform proposed in the Bill is that the Environmental Protection Agency will be made responsible for the licensing of all significant waste recovery and disposal activities.  The present position is that the 34 major local authorities &mdash; county councils and county borough corporations &mdash; are responsible for the planning, organisation, authorisation and supervision of waste operations in their areas.  The larger local authorities are therefore in the position of being both &ldquo;gamekeeper and poacher&rdquo; in relation to waste disposal.  This does not foster public confidence in local authority landfills, some of which are known to be operating below acceptable standards.  It is more appropriate that waste disposal and recovery operations be licensed by a competent third party.  The Environmental Protection Agency is the appropriate body, having the necessary expertise, to fulfil this important regulatory role.</P>
    <P>Before granting a waste licence, the agency must be satisfied, among other things, that the best available technology not entailing excessive costs will be used to prevent, limit or reduce emissions from the activity concerned, that such emissions will comply with any relevant environmental standards and that the activity will not cause environmental pollution.</P>
    <P>The Bill sets out the criteria to be considered by the agency in determining BATNEEC for a particular activity. New facilities will generally be required to meet state of the art environmental standards.  In the case of established activities, such as existing landfills, additional criteria will apply.  Among these are the nature and age of a facility, its likely remaining operational lifespan and the cost of improvements in relation to the economic situation of the activity in question.  In other words, somewhat less stringent standards may be applied to existing landfill operations for which <Col N="1469" /> there is a definite programme of closure. The Environmental Protection Agency may also impose conditions regarding adequate financial provision for closure and aftercare of a facility.</P>
    <P>The agency will continue to operate the integrated pollution control licensing system established under the 1992 Act, where applicable, to control waste disposal activities.  Those activities which are already licensable under the 1992 Act &mdash; which include virtually all waste incineration &mdash; will not require a licence under the Waste Bill.</P>
    <P>The Bill's provisions for public consultation and the making of objections in relation to licensing decisions are similar to those applying in relation to licences granted by the agency under the 1992 Act and reflect the need for meaningful public participation while also facilitating the speedy processing of licence applications.</P>
    <P>The recovery of sludges and natural non-hazardous agricultural wastes will not need a waste licence.  The Minister for the Environment will also have power under section 39 to exempt other specified waste activities from waste licensing, so long as other appropriate controls are applied.  For all of these wastes, the Bill provides for the possibility of alternative regulatory controls to be implemented by local authorities.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the licensing regime provided for under this Bill will be rigorous and effective and will enable us fully to apply existing and prospective EU standards and requirements in relation to waste recovery and disposal in a manner which also engenders public confidence.  This I regard as very important.</P>
    <P>While compliance with waste licence conditions will be a matter for the agency, local authorities will be responsible for the day-to-day supervision of waste activities generally within their functional areas.  Offences under the Bill will carry maximum penalties of fines up to £1,500 and or imprisonment for six months on summary conviction and of fines up to £10 million and or <Col N="1470" /> imprisonment for ten years on conviction on indictment.  These penalties reflect the potential threat posed by improper waste management and are of an appropriate magnitude to act as a deterrent to any would-be polluter.</P>
    <P>Part VI of the Bill contains a range of provisions for various purposes.  I refer in particular to section 64, which relates to the provision of information in relation to the mass balance of substances used, consumed and released into the environment by particular processes. The &ldquo;mass balance&rdquo; approach provided for in this section will ensure that a comprehensive range of information may be obtained to facilitate the preparation of a national toxic emissions inventory by the Environmental Protection Agency, promised under the Programme for Government.  This is intended to improve the quantity and quality of information available to the public and to facilitate and encourage the progressive reduction of certain hazardous wastes.</P>
    <P>A requirement on companies to report on their waste production for the purposes of a toxic release inventory has been shown in the United States and some other countries to be a most effective means to promote waste reduction. It has gained widespread support, including support from companies many of which were initially surprised at the magnitude of their releases to the environment and the potential for cost savings by reducing waste at source.  Voluntary programmes, jointly established by government and industry, for the phasing out of problematic chemicals are now operating very successfully in some countries.  There is a significant body of international opinion that reductions of toxic waste at source can best be achieved through a combination of legislative requirements to secure good quality data on problematic substances and voluntary measures targeted at these substances and wastes.</P>
    <P>The Waste Bill will have economic and financial implications for industrial, commercial, agricultural and consumer interests, as well as public authorities.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1471" /> Increased costs will arise as a consequence of more stringent regulatory standards for waste treatment and disposal as well as recycling obligations.</P>
    <P>The Bill will therefore impact financially on all of us whether as taxpayers or consumers.  This is necessary so as to bring fuller pricing transparency to the impact of various consumer goods on the environment.  There is now widespread acceptance that the &ldquo;throwaway society&rdquo; is not sustainable.  I am confident that Irish householders, consumers and businesses will accept their responsibilities in this regard.</P>
    <P>We need a major conversion of public attitudes and behaviour to the need for waste prevention.  We need also a significant increase in recycling performance, accompanied and supported by an expansion and improvement of waste management facilities.  Finally, there is scope for significant development of the private waste sector and for a more systematic application of the principles of shared responsibility, producer responsibility and the polluter-pays.</P>
    <P>This Bill is comprehensive and in many respects radical legislation which will support all of these objectives.  I heartily commend it to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Waste Bill the Minister has introduced.  It demonstrates how lax we have been that such a measure has only just been brought before the House.</P>
      <P>I take issue with the Minister's statement that this is radical legislation which will support the objectives to which he referred.  The Bill is a minimalist measure with a number of flaws, not least of which is that it has been produced in isolation from many other connected policy areas.  For that reason, the Bill is disappointing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Key issues such as waste reduction, incineration and agricultural waste are either side-stepped or ignored in the Bill, which contains a list of duties which may be conferred by ministerial fiat on subsidiary agencies.  There was not any indication in the Minister's speech, to <Col N="1472" /> which I listened carefully, from where the money or the personnel required to implement all of the responsibilities placed on local authorities and on the Environmental Protection Agency would come.  The Bill confers a massive body of powers on the Minister but it burdens him very little with the responsibility for implementing them. This legislation will not pass the test of time.</P>
    <P>We should not be surprised or offended that the head of the United Nations working party on the development of sustainable products, Dr. Van Weenen, in an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> on 12 June, should describe the Bill as &ldquo;already obsolete even before it is enacted&rdquo;.  Dr. Van Weenen, noting that the Bill focused almost entirely on waste management, went on to say: &ldquo;It would be much more important to develop a waste prevention plan at every level and to look at landfill dumping as a last resort&rdquo;.  The Minister indicated in his speech that is the direction in which he will go, but this Bill does not go in the right direction.</P>
    <P>One of the most important recent contributions to environmental policy was the recycling initiative introduced last year.  &ldquo;Recycling for Ireland&rdquo; was published last year and the Bill builds on that initiative.  However, we have not had a proper waste policy here and that this Bill provides a general framework from which we might begin to address an increasingly serious problem must be welcomed.</P>
    <P>As the Minister has indicated, waste is the most visible symptom of an environmental malaise that has marked this century.  That malaise is manifested in a refusal to take responsibility for our actions as individuals.  Consumption, without heed to the cost, has characterised modern life &mdash; the Minister referred to the throwaway society.  In the past, if rain forests or other natural environments had to be destroyed, the approach was, &ldquo;so what?&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Rising concern for the environment has yet to be matched by personal choices.  We are all concerned about the <Col N="1473" /> environment but that concern is not reflected in our choices.  In a society geared towards capturing the market for each consumer, it is eventually the consumer who must exercise the most meaningful choices in relation to the environment.  The Bill is not sufficiently strong in pushing that approach and the omission to challenge the choices of consumers is a fundamental mistake.</P>
    <P>The Bill has some shortcomings.  The production and reduction of waste is almost entirely ignored.  Agricultural waste is not deemed worthy of consideration, except for a reference to the possibility of it being examined by other authorities.  The question of landfill is addressed in a minimalist way and the cost of the measures referred to could make it unworkable.</P>
    <P>Costs and bureaucracy will be increased by the Bill.  I do not hold the Minister directly responsible for a problem that has beset this House for many years, that is the problem created by undemocratically conferring powers on Ministers and on Departments.  Producing a Bill such as this and saying the various detailed regulations in it will be introduced later is essentially undemocratic.</P>
    <P>We intend to make a vigorous contribution to this debate on Committee Stage, which I presume will take place during the summer months.  We will try to address some of the Bill's shortcomings and I hope the Minister will be open to the sensible suggestions we will make, as he has been in the past.  We intend to be constructive in our approach to the Bill.</P>
    <P>There has not been any effort to focus Government policies as a whole on the environment.  The Government's environmental policy, insofar as it has one, is pervaded by the dangerous assumption by many Ministers that environmental policy can be left to the Department of the Environment.  Having listened to the Minister for the Environment during meetings of the Committee on Sustainable Development and during Question Time in the House, he has singularly failed so far to <Col N="1474" /> convince most of his colleagues that the Government's approach to the environment should pervade all policies and should not be confined to the Department of the Environment.</P>
    <P>The Bill is based on the dangerously outdated notion that the environment is a particular niche area.  Government policy does not address the simple truth that waste is already second generation pollution.  It has not begun to dawn on the Government that a meaningful environment policy should be an essential component of all policy areas.  The Government's programme commits itself to &ldquo;integrating environmental protection considerations into all policy areas and all levels of Government&rdquo;.  It further states: &ldquo;Major institutional reform and policy and legislative changes will have to take place&rdquo;.  There is not anything in this Bill to indicate they were nothing more than empty statements.</P>
    <P>If a waste policy is to be meaningful, it must have at its core the co-ordination of industrial, agricultural and other policies. There is no evidence of co-ordination in the Bill in relation to industry and agriculture seems to be almost specifically excluded.</P>
    <P>Continued economic growth means we are producing and consuming more goods and materials but there is an obvious downside to our increased consumption. Pollution has already occurred in primary production.  Natural resources have been used, energies have been expended and emissions have occurred.  In the disposal of waste we are again challenged by these problems. Ireland now generates approximately one-third more domestic and commercial waste than it did a decade ago.  As a nation we cannot sustain that level of growth.  We have a simple choice: either to curb or change production and the Bill almost ignores that central issue.</P>
    <P>Reducing waste means attacking the fundamentals of present production methods and involves a comprehensive co-ordination of wide swathes of Government policy.  Regrettably, the Minister has shied away from the issue <Col N="1475" /> of the production of waste and, until he deals comprehensively with the issue of waste reduction, other measures are only tinkering with the edges of the problem.  We should view our waste problem in a European context.  Much of this Bill is devoted to translating European directives into Irish law.  The standards against which we must necessarily measure ourselves are the European norm and that will decide the acceptability of our goods and services and how well we handle our waste problem. Nobody should be under any illusions: by European standards the Bill is minimalist.  The standards it proposes will be no more than an interim staging point on the way to European averages. Realistic and long term progress will not be realised by the measures brought forward by this Government.  We are only postponing a fundamental review of all our methods of production.  It is a measure of the mountain we must climb, that this Bill is seen as a measure of progress.</P>
    <P>It is proposed in the Bill to reduce the amount of waste going into landfill by 20 per cent over the next four years. This commitment arises from the European Union landfill directive of 1994. To put this proposal into the European context &mdash; in which the issue will be judged &mdash; the costs imposed by the EU landfill directive of 1994 offer a vital insight to the relative positions of EU member states.  According to a report prepared last year for European Union environment ministers, the Netherlands would incur no significant increases in landfill costs as a result of the directive. Its national regulations are already in conformity with or stricter than the EU directive and the same applies to a lesser extent to France, Belgium, Luxembourg, Denmark and Germany. However, for Ireland, the southern European countries such as Italy and Portugal, there will be significant costs.</P>
    <P>The Minister proposes or implies he will do a number of things simultaneously as a result of the Bill.  First, he will reduce the amount of waste going <Col N="1476" /> into landfill by 20 per cent; second, he proposes to reduce during the next five to ten years the present mix of some 120 public and private operational sites to approximately 50, but he fails to address the background of escalating levels of waste.</P>
    <P>He further fails to address the important political issue of where the 50 new super dumps will be located.  As the Minister knows, people find dumps objectionable for a number of reasons, not least of which is bad management by local authorities.  Nothing in the proposals of the Bill will do anything to improve the resources available to local authorities to properly manage their dumps.  If the Minister's proposals are to be credible, they should be fleshed out and their financing set out.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister specify how he intends to reach the minimum target of a 20 per cent reduction in the amount of waste going into landfill against the background of escalating volumes of waste?  How will local authorities get hold of the resources and expertise needed to ensure higher standards of management of landfill sites?  Nothing the Minister said provides answers to these questions.  It is proposed that a theoretical 80 per cent of our waste will go into less than half the current number of landfill sites and that simply does not seem possible.  I agree with the Minister's efforts to reduce waste by 20 per cent or more.  It is minimalist.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister will agree that in the European context our efforts to curtail landfill are derisory.  In Denmark in 1993 only 26 per cent of total waste was being disposed of by landfill; 23 per cent was being incinerated and 50 per cent recycled.  The situation in Denmark shows the distance we have to go and what is possible, if there is the will.  Our European neighbours have learned to put only the lowest types and least amount of waste into landfill which is grossly wasteful of resources.  The extent of landfill dumping here is a mark of a profligate society.  We not only waste what we have, we also pawn future resources by incurring future <Col N="1477" /> costs because of the long term consequences of landfill.  This approach is the antithesis of sustainable development.</P>
    <P>In addition, we are missing out on the great opportunities to be gained from doing the right thing, particularly on the jobs front.  For example, a few years ago the chemical and pharmaceutical industry was regarded as an international enemy of the environment.  Although there are still patches where the performance of the industry is less than perfect, the leaders of the industry, some of whom are represented in Ireland, have emphasised reducing waste to a very successful degree.  They have succeeded in reducing waste, making their operations more sustainable and saving money in many instances. With new technology it is not costing them money to reduce waste.  The savings created in an area like this make it less likely that the company has to look to staff cuts to effect savings.</P>
    <P>The Minister said radical legislation is needed, in fact, at this stage we need a revolution but, unfortunately, there are not many revolutionaries in the Labour Party.  Managing a problem is different from solving it.  In the Waste Bill the Minister instead of taking a revolutionary approach has settled for measures similar to moving the deck chairs on the <i>Titanic.</i></P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>What does the Deputy propose we should do?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>As I am always willing to be positive, I will come to that later. There are no provisions in the Bill to deal with the problems arising from contaminated land.  Perhaps if we had succeeded together we would have been sitting on the same side and I would been able able to prompt the Minister before the Bill was produced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>We approved the heads of the Bill together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>Most of the dumps the Minister proposes to close come under <Col N="1478" /> the category of contaminated sites.  If future problems with land use are to be avoided, it is necessary to register and clean up contaminated sites.  The safety of ground water, surrounding natural environment and the land itself depends on properly regulated approach to closure. The omission of appropriate regulations is of grave concern, but I presume the Minister will be introducing them at a later stage under the Bill.</P>
      <P>The Minister has chosen to ignore the question of incineration, and I can understand why.  It has the potential to be politically difficult and that potential difficulty has overtaken environmental concerns.  The technology of incineration has a bad name in Ireland and it has raised many serious concerns, not without reason, in view of some of the incineration operations we have had. However, we cannot ignore the issue. The Minister has drawn back from introducing a comprehensive waste reduction policy whereas the Bill proposes a reduction in the amount of waste going into landfill which is significant by Irish standards and rules out any involvement in incineration either by encouraging it or encouraging research into it.  One has to ask what it is the Government hopes for, and it appears the Government is hoping that private incinerators will be built to take up the slack, thus reducing direct political flak. There is a contradiction between the avoidance of reductionism as a serious policy option and the refusal to promote alternative methods of disposal.  This confusion in policy indicates that there is in fact no policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The disposal of waste in whatever manner is an important issue to be addressed.  It involves a huge economic and environmental downside.  Landfill is one of the most seriously abusive methods of disposal and the serious arguments against incineration revolve around the emission of dangerous gases. However, there have been advances in technology, for example, in Sweden where a number of new technologies and measures have been introduced over the past ten years which have led <Col N="1479" /> to significant reductions in the amount of dioxin emissions.  One plant in Hogdalen in Stockholm has five new gas treatment systems.  The plant's emission levels comply with the allowable levels laid down by the Government and it also makes a very appreciable contribution to energy needs.  The Minister's stance on incineration is disingenuous. On the one hand he is washing his hands of a politically problematic process and on the other, by failing to provide an alternative, he is effectively encouraging it by the back door.  There is a dichotomy there that should be explained.</P>
    <P>As a former Minister for Health, Deputy Howlin must be particularly aware of the problem that faces hospitals.  Approximately 50 hospital incinerators will close by October because they will not have the resources to run them to a proper standard. Hospital waste is highly dangerous and needs to be treated very carefully, and new methods of disposing of it will have to be carefully examined.  Microwaving is a process that has been introduced here in the recent past.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>There are probably seven places here that are now using it. To the best of my knowledge there are only three places using it in France where it was developed.  That must leave some question marks over the technology.  On the question of incineration, we should be ruling it out completely or examining it as a possibility and at least carrying out research into it.  We cannot continue to ignore it as it has been ignored.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of hazardous waste is dealt with in section 36 (2) of the Bill which includes a list of provisions from (a) to (q) which the Minister may enforce to control the movement of hazardous waste.  Entirely ignored is the imperative of self-sufficiency in hazardous waste disposal, again a tricky political question.  In 1990 we produced 66,000 tonnes of hazardous waste, 21 <Col N="1480" /> per cent of which was exported for disposal abroad.  The experience in other EU countries has been that when tighter regulations for disposal are implemented the amount of waste exported to countries with less strict regulations increases significantly.  We must address the major issue of disposing of our own hazardous waste because we will not be allowed to continue to dump such waste in other countries for the foreseeable future.  This brings us back to the question of eliminating or minimising that type of waste which should be the cornerstone of environmental protection policy on waste.</P>
    <P>One of the most conspicuous omissions from the Bill is that of agricultural waste.  It will be left to local authorities to introduce their own by-laws. However, given the impact of agricultural waste on our environment it was an amazing oversight not to make regulatory provision, even within a framework Bill like this, for the disposal of farm waste.  Agricultural waste is a huge component of our total waste and the number of outlets far exceeds any other form of waste production.  Animal effluent and silage effluent are deadly, and in the past few weeks we have witnessed quite a number of examples of that. Recently the South Western Fisheries Board warned that we are sitting on an environmental time bomb and the cause of that could be farm waste.  The rivers affected in the recent past could take up to five years to recover ecologically at a cost of over £100,000.  This is a very important area of waste control and waste minimisation which demonstrates one of the contradictions at the heart of Government environment policy.  On the one hand the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry has closed down the control of farm pollution scheme, bringing to a standstill progress on necessary environmental works which would improve and introduce the best practice in waste management and further endangering the £300 million in EU funds for the rural environmental protection scheme.</P>
    <P>The contribution of these two <Col N="1481" /> schemes over their intended short lifespan could be profound.  Government Departments are pulling in opposite directions.  The Minister for the Environment is committed to ensuring a safe and clean environment.  However, in the Seanad recently the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, speaking to a Fianna Fáil motion on farm pollution, said he intended to write to local authorities and fishery boards asking them to adopt a more sensitive approach to farmers served with section 12 notices. These notices are a measure of last resort served by local authorities on those who pollute the environment.  It is only after all other measures have failed that section 12 notices are served.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry asked the authorities to be less strict in their approach.  He is pressurising them into adopting a softly, softly approach to those whose farms are most likely to be a source of pollution.  I do not understand the logic behind that especially since the Minister for the Environment is pressing ahead with the £1.2 billion programme of end of pipe treatment works.</P>
    <P>Environmental protection and control is often perceived by industry as a threat to competitiveness and jobs.  However, that argument is more than counter-balanced by the opportunities that exist for the development of environmental protection services and the production of green products which will meet the needs of the rapidly growing green consumer market.  Most of the technology needed to reduce, recycle and dispose of waste will come from outside of Ireland. Jobs will be created in countries producing environmental protection technology whereas Ireland will only incur costs.  I congratulate the trade board which recently set up an environmental unit to promote Irish firms providing environmental protection products and services overseas.  Other agencies have little in the way of programmes to ensure that Ireland grasps the opportunities that abound.  It is clear that the Government does not have an integrated environmental policy &mdash; it must <Col N="1482" /> adopt one soon &mdash; when this Bill is introduced in isolation from its effects, costs and opportunities.  The Departments of Tourism and Trade, Enterprise and Employment and the Environment must work together to ensure we minimise costs and maximise opportunities. Environmental policy will give rise to an environmental protection sector as happened in other countries and this will cover numerous new activities and technologies.</P>
    <P>In the United States, a document, Towards a National Export Strategy, estimates that the current market for the environmental services industry is £252 billion and it is projected that it will reach £400 billion by the year 2000, growing at an annual rate of 6.7 per cent.  The US has 19 agencies helping export companies to compete for environmental markets.  The OECD estimates the figure at £200 billion for the year 2000, 30 per cent of which is concerned with water and effluent treatments. In Germany, the number of people employed in the environmental sector is 700,000.  The number of jobs in Ireland depending on a clean, green environment is in excess of 150,000. That is why it is important for the Government to have an integrated policy and that the opportunities are identified.</P>
    <P>The Bill notes the importance of the public sector leading by example through the use of best environmental management practice.  Will the Minister explain how this will be achieved?  Will he, as we suggest, encourage local authorities and public sector bodies to seek accreditation under the Irish IS 310 or international standard ISO 9000 or ISO 14000?  The agencies implementing this Bill should attain accreditation to a recognised environmental management system standard.  There is no point in preaching to industry or individuals if they do not comply with recognised independent standards.  Work carried out in the area of environmental management within local authorities in other countries has resulted in considerable cost savings.  Local authorities are <Col N="1483" /> often serious polluters.  The Government should ensure that Departments and agencies purchase recycled goods where possible and recycle waste.  We look forward to the public sector guidelines and criteria the Minister will publish under section 30.  He should do that as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>Our legislation enforcement record is poor.  This Bill is largely enabling legislation with little substance.  The best example of non-enforcement of legislation is the Litter Act, 1992.  Bord Fáilte claims it receives 5,000 letters per year from visitors complaining about illegal dumping of old cars and appliances.  Over half of all the letters received concern litter.  The &ldquo;war&rdquo; against litter is at a standstill and local authorities seem to have retreated. Some 21 county councils failed to record a single on-the-spot fine and ten did not achieve court convictions, 45 borough corporations or UDCs failed to record an on-the-spot fine or achieve court convictions.  Only 914 on-the-spot fines and 226 court convictions were achieved nationwide and the 89 litter wardens, working full-time and part-time, were responsible for the majority of those.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to down Limerick but it failed to record a single on-the-spot fine or achieve a court conviction during the year.  To the great credit of Limerick Corporation and county council, Limerick has developed in leaps and bounds over the past eight to ten years but I do not think it could be said that its streets are free of litter.  Many local authorities have the same problem.</P>
    <P>In its recent report the Environmental Protection Agency pointed out that the national budget for environmental research in 1993 was £91 million and that only 2 per cent of this came from the Government.  If we want to be taken seriously in terms of care and protection of the environment then the funding provided by Government for environmental research must be increased. Tackling the problems associated with waste will cost money and I ask the <Col N="1484" /> Minister to give me an estimate &mdash; I know he cannot give me an exact figure &mdash; of the cost of implementing the provisions of the Bill.  Local authorities which are seriously under-funded and the Environmental Protection Agency which already has heavy burdens will be further burdened by the costs created by the Bill.  I ask the Minister to give me a guarantee that the agency will be properly funded, otherwise it will be brought into disrepute.  More than anything else, an independent body like the Environmental Protection Agency must have the full confidence of the public.</P>
    <P>Ireland is at the bottom of the pile in terms of waste management and reduction and we cannot continue to depend on landfills.  To give an indication of the magnitude and urgency of the problem, the proposed municipal dump at Kill, County Kildare is estimated to have a lifespan of only ten years.  We are near the end of the road in terms of landfill sites not only because of a lack of available spaces but also because of the opposition to this type of dump.  We must address the problem of the production of waste in the first instance.  Waste issues and their resolution are inevitably linked to production and consumption throughout all stages of the life cycle of materials and the use of energy and unless the production cycle is included in an integrated waste policy little meaningful progress can be made.  Reducing waste at source not only minimises the impact of waste treatment and disposal but also enhances the efficient use of raw materials.  The proposals to be brought forward by the industry will be of vital importance in this regard.</P>
    <P>The single greatest challenge facing our political leadership is changing consumer preference.  People may be concerned about the environment but they continue to choose products wrapped in layers of non-biodegradable plastic, which are carried home in free plastic bags.  This problem needs to be addressed in a detailed and meaningful way.  The Minister and the House must try to change the public's attitude and I <Col N="1485" /> ask the Minister to outline how he proposes to educate all of us on how to reduce waste.  Fianna Fáil supports the principle of the Bill and will not oppose it on Second Stage.  However, we will debate it in detail on Committee Stage and put forward amendments which will improve it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>My party warmly welcomes this long overdue and comprehensive Bill.  All of the thinking behind it is correct and it has the potential to be exciting and effective legislation. However, as it is currently drafted the Bill is weak and essentially flawed in that many of its provisions will be implemented by way of later regulations. This approach fails to take into account the urgency of the problems of waste and our attitude to it.  On Committee Stage my party will put down very strong amendments which will seek to replace the term &ldquo;the Minister may&rdquo; with the term &ldquo;the Minister shall&rdquo; or &ldquo;the Minister must&rdquo;.  When it comes to putting in place modern waste legislation we are far behind other European countries and some of our competitors and we will have to run twice as fast if we want to make up the shortfall and be in a position to compete on economic and other fronts.</P>
      <P>There are many good and compelling reasons for attaching the highest possible priority to environmental protection. The economic arguments were well put by Culliton in his landmark report Industrial Policy for Ireland in the 1990s.  In his introduction to that report he says:</P>
      <P>Far from dragging our heels in the international movement for environmental protection it could be in Ireland's best interest even from the industrial standpoint to seek out opportunities for advancing ahead of other countries in the interest of promoting our clean green image and in positioning Irish industry for coping with even tougher legislation in the face of what seems to be an unstoppable trend.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1486" /> He then went on to say &mdash; Deputy Dempsey also made this point &mdash; that the development and application of environmentally friendly technologies and products offer notable opportunities for job creation.  In other words, environmental protection is no longer a matter of choice or an optional extra to be left to a discerning section of the public but is a matter of survival.  By facing up to this and putting in place and maintaining the highest possible environmental standards Ireland will not alone create new jobs but also maintain existing jobs.</P>
    <P>In one way or another all our industries depend on a clean environment. For example, the food industry is worth £9 billion annually to the economy with approximately 40,000 jobs.  This industry, with its enormous potential for growth in the export market, is totally dependent on the quality of our environment. Simply put, given the choice that the free market now provides consumers will elect to buy Irish food products only if they can be guaranteed that they are produced in a clean environment.</P>
    <P>Tourism is another environment dependent industry and a key industry in the generation of jobs.  In current terms it is worth £1.7 billion annually to the economy and provides approximately 91,000 jobs.  The target by the end of the century, which is only five years away, is for earnings of £2.5 billion with 126,000 jobs.  These targets will only be met if in the next five years we manage to make a reality of the image of a clean green Ireland.  At times and in places this image has a little of the smell of the leprechaun with the pot of gold about it and is sometimes at variance with the reality.  If these figures and the target in tourism are to be met by the end of the decade this clean green image must be a reality and put beyond question.</P>
    <P>It is crucially important for a country that has more than 300,000 people out of work and more young people and young graduates coming on the jobs <Col N="1487" /> market every year to advance and maintain the highest attainable environmental standards at every level if we are to provide jobs.  If we fail to do that we do so at our peril.  This is the message that must be put across every day.  It is in the interest of every family to play its part in bringing about a cleaner and better environment.</P>
    <P>To date Irish law in relation to solid waste concerned itself mainly with controls on waste disposal.  There has been a hefty reliance on the end of the pipeline solution as if there were no tomorrow. We create more waste in the belief that someone will take that waste and put it somewhere away from where we live and operate and that it will disappear underground.  That is not the way things happen or will happen in the future.  There has been far too much reliance in this country on landfilling. We landfill one tonne of waste per family per year.  This figures is unsustainable and is much higher than the proportion of waste landfilled in any other European country.  We cannot continue to do that and to expect other people to cope with our waste.</P>
    <P>We must take control and ownership of our own waste.  When we are required to do that I believe our attitudes will alter.  It is only when we are required to take more responsibility for our waste that we will think in terms of waste prevention as individuals in society.  That is what happened yesterday.</P>
    <P>This new Waste Bill gives ground for optimism because it proposes an altogether different approach and points in a different direction.  The main emphasis is not on control and waste disposal but on waste management.  The Bill provides a framework for waste prevention, reduction, minimisation, recovery and recycling.  The overall aim is to dispose of only the residue when all these processes have been fully exploited and exhausted.  This is the only way forward. However, it will take some effort to change people's attitudes, to break bad habits and to radically revise our former <Col N="1488" /> approach but it must be done.  There must be a national consensus that there is no other way.  Citizens, householders, industries and commercial enterprises have a role to play and must be challenged and motivated to play it. Governments must give leadership and there must be greater cohesion between Government Departments; I do not mean at the level of statements written into programmes for Government but at the level of action and delivery on the ground.</P>
    <P>The public are not likely to be convinced when the Minister for the Environment says one thing and his Cabinet colleagues often do the opposite.  This happened recently in the case of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry who suspended the farm pollution grants despite the fact that some of our most serious pollution with the greatest threat to our rivers, streams and lakes comes from farm slurry and fertilisers. If there is any one sector on which the most rigid and stringent controls must be in place it is the agriculture sector.  I understand and fully accept that it was a costly system.  Nevertheless, if our environment is to have priority the Minister will have to revisit that decision and his approach will have to be brought into line with that of the Minister for the Environment, otherwise the Government will lack credibility which means we are in a very weak position to make demands of other people.  There must be much better co-ordination and coherence between different Government Departments and an overall determination on the part of the Government to give leadership in the field of waste prevention.</P>
    <P>I raised an issue in this respect with the Minister on Question Time recently. I pointed out that it has become a habit in every Government Department in recent times to relentlessly issue press releases, statements, PR work of every kind and to literally overwhelm our pigeon holes and offices with paper, much of which we do not have time to read.  I fiercely resent when most days I <Col N="1489" /> take out my car in my own city and a commercial operator puts a handbill on my windscreen informing me that because I am not attending the night club down the road I am only half living. I fiercely resent being told that because, mercifully, I am living fully without attending that night club.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>I am entitled to park my car in the city street as I have already displayed a parking disc and paid for it. I resent some sharp operator, exploiting youngsters by giving them a few bob to litter a whole street with handbills about the activities of their night club and I would do much to stop it.  On occasion I have taken such handbills and handed them back.  If I am entitled to do that to some poor youngsters in the streets of Cork, who are trying to make a few bob, I am equally entitled to do the same to the Minister.  In future I will ask that the Minister has a bring back basket so that Deputies can return to him most of the documents issued from Government Departments which serve no useful purpose, which we do not have time to read and which do not add to our sense of understanding of what is happening in this House.  If the Minister were to create the conditions where that material could be returned he would give a headline and would put himself in a strong moral position to expect shopkeepers and traders to make similar provision in their premises.  Such a significant gesture would put him in a strong position to make demands of other bodies and create the atmosphere for the implementation and enforcement of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are producing far too much paper.  My letterbox is filled with paper every day.  Most of it I do not read and it goes into the basket and, subsequently, the bin.  For the most part it is dumped in landfill sites.  We cannot continue along that road.  We must start cutting back on the volume of paper we produce sector by sector, shop by shop, <Col N="1490" /> Government Department by Government Department.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture, Forestry and Food has suspended the farm pollution grants scheme.  I appeal to the Minister for the Environment to seek its reintroduction.  After our children, our clean water in rivers, lakes and streams is one of our most valuable assets.  We cannot treat it in this cavalier way.  In the past three weeks there were significant fish kills in my county in which there are three rivers in which all ecological life is dead.  That will be the position for at least the next five years.  A generation of small boys will grow up without having an opportunity to fish their local stream.  When they come to do their leaving certificate they will not have time to fish&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an indication of what can happen when all ecological life in a stream is killed off and this remains the position for a minimum of five years.  We must reintroduce the grants scheme, while Teagasc and the other agencies which have done so much good work in the past must intensify their efforts to bring the agriculture sector into line in terms of the aspirations and objectives of this Bill so that we all march to the same tune.  That is very important.</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned that litter is not covered by this Bill.  There may be sustainable reasons why it is not covered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>A separate Bill is to be introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>Nonetheless the volume of litter on our streets is an enormous indictment of society.  It indicates an attitude of mind and unless it is tackled and reversed we will go nowhere with the new Bill.  The attitude that it is our waste but other people can cope with it is a symptom of the malaise to which Deputy Dempsey referred in great detail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1491" /> I urge the Minister, even in advance of the enactment of this major Bill, to introduce the new legislation without delay, providing for a system of incentives on the one hand and penalties on the other &mdash; the carrot and stick approach &mdash; to get rid of the scourge of litter.  Very often it is the first thing seen by prospective investors, brought to this country by the IDA with a view to setting up a job generating industry.  They do not see the toxic waste that is more serious and damaging but they do see the litter.  This can prove damaging and be a factor in convincing them that they should consider locating elsewhere where the workforce takes a different approach to life.  This matter which is of crucial importance cannot be put on the long finger.  I implore the Minister to tackle it now.</P>
    <P>If the provisions of this Bill are to be effective, education has a key role to play.  When education works well it is amazing what it can achieve.  About two weeks ago a party of 59 school children from a primary convent school in Ballyphehane in Cork visited Leinster House.  I took them to the self-service restaurant for a can of Coca Cola while the teachers and I sat down to have a pot of tea.  When they had finished two of the little girls asked the head teacher if they should take the empty cans home with them.  This is an indication that they were well motivated and attentive to their responsibilities.  We must encourage young people to adopt this outlook.  In turn, they may be able to influence older people to do the same. The media has to be used if we are to educate the public about their responsibilities so far as this Bill is concerned.</P>
    <P>This is a solid waste Bill and comes in the wake of legislation already enacted covering water and air pollution.  There is a need to integrate all this environmental legislation.  Let me give an example of what may happen if this is not done.  If solid waste is converted into liquid or gas will it be exempt from the provisions of this Bill?  I may table an amendment on this issue on Committee <Col N="1492" /> Stage.  If that was to be the case it would discourage waste minimisation, one of the key objectives of the Bill.  The two existing Acts, the Water Pollution Act and the Air Pollution Act, and this Bill ought to be integrated.  We already have integrated pollution controls.  If we are to make progress we should also have integrated environmental legislation.</P>
    <P>The thinking behind this Bill is excellent. As it currently stands, however, it lacks clarity and certainty on a number of fronts.  We need to have a clear definition of what constitutes waste.  The term &ldquo;residue&rdquo; is used extensively in the Schedules, yet it is not defined anywhere in the Bill.  This Bill must distinguish more clearly between residues destined for recycling, recovery and reuse on the one hand and those destined for final disposal on the other.  I argue that only residues destined for final disposal should be defined as waste.  If an economic use can be found for a residue it ought to be subject to a different set of controls in respect of holding, transport and treatment.  I intend to revisit this area on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The Bill lacks clarity and certainty.  It is peppered with phrases such as &ldquo;the Minister may&rdquo; or for example, on page 36, &ldquo;producer responsibility may include...&rdquo; If the Bill is to be effective we have to be clear on what producer responsibility &ldquo;must&rdquo; include.  It goes on to state that the carrying out of waste audits by businesses may be introduced. They must be introduced.  It also states that provision of data to the Environmental Protection Agency for publication regarding the use, consumption and emission of specified toxic substances by an industry may be introduced. Legislation must be made of sterner stuff.  If the Minister is truly serious about achieving the stated objectives of this Bill, most of these &ldquo;mays&rdquo; will have to be converted into &ldquo;musts&rdquo;.  When the Bill is amended it should read &ldquo;the Minister shall&rdquo; or &ldquo;the Act will&rdquo;.  If we include provisions with &ldquo;may&rdquo; we will have a fine aspirational document which will not be effective.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1493" /> It is important that that matter be considered because if proper advance planning is to take place by industry and commercial activities they will need to know from the start what exactly is demanded of them, not what will probably be demanded of them next year or the year after.  Unless everybody involved knows the position from the outset it is unlikely they will carry out the advance planning that will ensure this Bill works.</P>
    <P>Key questions asked by overseas investors who wish to explore Ireland as a possible location for industry are: what is the nature of the environmental legislation and is it on a par with the environmental legislation in other competitive countries?  They need to know what our legislation is, not what it might be in three, five or ten years' time.  We must be specific from the outset with this legislation.</P>
    <P>Another area that lacks clarity to an alarming degree is the overall cost of implementation of the Bill in so far as it will be levied on different sectors.  There are several references to costs in the Bill but they are mere references.  The Minister fails to spell out in detail the cost on any sector, and this is a second major weakness in the Bill.  Inevitably there will be a significant cost on industry. Several sections require licensed applicants to cover the cost of the application and of assessing their licence application. That will be a significant cost. We must demonstrate to industry that the benefits will far outweigh the costs, but how can we do so if we are not prepared to spell out the costs in the first instance?  That must be done on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>There will be a significant cost on local authorities if they are to comply with the provisions of the Bill.  There is a clear onus on the Minister to bring forward a proper system of financing for cash-starved local authorities in advance of enactment of this Bill.  Unless that is done local authorities will put forward the argument that they do not have the money, they cannot raise it from its own resources and ratepayers, who will carry <Col N="1494" /> an additional burden as a result of the Bill, cannot afford it.  Unless the Minister introduces such a system this Bill will fail.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that while local authorities are required to provide facilities for the disposal of household waste there is no responsibility on them to provide facilities for the disposal of commercial and hazardous waste.  This requirement should be extended to the collection of waste from commercial premises where the composition of waste is similar to the composition of household waste.  Such a provision must be incorporated in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The establishment of waste management plans under section 32 is vague. The idea is good but is underdeveloped. There must be a determination to spell out more clearly what should be contained in those plans. Many local authorities are progressive and adventurous while others take the line of least resistance.  On the basis of that experience we must set out clearly what the management plans must contain and we must set a timeframe for the achievement of the targets in those plans.</P>
    <P>Section 36 which deals with hazardous waste states that the Environmental Protection Agency will be required to make recommendations, but it is imperative that the Environmental Protection Agency be required to issue directions rather than make recommendations in respect of management plans, particularly the management of hazardous waste.</P>
    <P>A number of people have spoken to me about the cost of implementation of the Bill as it affects their industries. Small and medium sized industries in particular are concerned that a hefty burden may be put on them.  The Minister should indicate that every possible assistance will be given by way of advice and that every feasible and affordable incentive will be provided to help smaller industries.  It would be a great tragedy if some industries felt they could not comply with the Bill or that the Bill was too bureaucratic and demanding in <Col N="1495" /> terms of form filling, the provision of information and so on.</P>
    <P>It is important that we utilise fully groups such as the clean technology department of the regional college in Cork.  That department played a key role in providing assistance to the chemical industry in Cork and as a result that industry was well prepared to comply with the requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency and the integrated licence.  It is invaluable that such a group be in a position to provide expert advice to industries.  We must develop that idea.  Industries must be encouraged in the most practical way possible and must be given advice and technical help.</P>
    <P>I read section 51 on a number of occasions &mdash; I tabled a question to the Minister on this matter &mdash; and I am unclear as to why agricultural wastes are excluded from the licensing requirements. That is a major weakness in the Bill for the reasons outlined by me and, more eloquently, by the previous speaker.  It poses a threat particularly to the quality of water, and this is part of the problem that arises where there is a separate Water Pollution Act.  I can see the rationale for consolidating these Acts.  If the disposal of blood, sludge and agricultural waste is excluded from the stringent requirements on industry, that will be a major weakness in the Bill and must be guarded against.</P>
    <P>The Bill is the basis of good legislation. There is ample scope for amendment on Committee Stage.  I am sure the Minister will be open to accepting reasonable amendments and I expect he will table some on the basis of the debate.  I hope there will be a number of varied contributions to the debate so that we will get different perspectives on this issue.  All Members are prepared to play a key part in putting in place legislation that will serve the country well not only in the next five years, but in the next 15 years.</P>
    <P>It is important that resources are provided for research.  Independent researchers should play a key role not <Col N="1496" /> only in providing policy makers with the best available up-to-date information, but in educating the general public on whose co-operation we rely if this Bill is to be effective.</P>
    <P>Additional resources must be made available for research and for the Environmental Protection Agency.  Our hopes rightly hinge on the Environmental Protection Agency because it has at its disposal up to date legislation that will stand up in any European country. It is grossly under-resourced and when this Bill becomes law it will need infinitely more resources which must be provided.  We do not want law which will not be fully enforced because that draws all law into disrepute.  When we enact law we must ensure that the necessary procedures and provisions are in place to facilitate the implementation of all its aspects.</P>
    <P>The attitude to waste is worrying, but people acknowledge that we can no longer adopt a spendthrift attitude and there is a willingness to change tack and put better procedures in place.  Women in my estate would be willing to segregate their waste if there was provision for it.  Women no longer want plastic bags foisted on them in supermarkets because they know the damage to the environment by the over use of plastic bags.  Women make up the majority of shoppers and they would welcome new procedures to minimise waste.  They know there is no other way forward. People who holiday abroad or who have lived abroad and see how effective are alternative systems are willing to change old bad habits.  We must not be afraid to challenge and motivate them to do that.</P>
    <P>The Minister should indicate his willingness to set a headline and give a good example.  He should ban some products including aerosol cans.  If he did that people would accept his seriousness about dealing with waste and would be more inclined to co-operate and be part of an environmental forward movement. He should also ban the use of detergents containing phosphates.  That could be done quite easily.  In Henkel <Col N="1497" /> in Little Island in Cork phosphate free detergents are produced.  Forty per cent of detergents in use at present are phosphate free, but detergents containing phosphates are a major element in destroying our waters.  Banning three or four key products like that would create the conditions in which there would be real compliance with the provisions of the Bill.  The enactment of this Bill and the implementation of its provisions is no longer a matter of choice, but one of survival.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and my party and I will support it.  We will table a number of key amendments on Committee Stage.  We hope the Bill will be passed speedily so that we can set about its implementation.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputies who spoke on this important Bill.  I regard it as one of the most important Bills I will have the pleasure of bringing before the House and I look forward to a long and detailed debate on Committee Stage. This is a framework Bill.  Like the earlier Environmental Protection Agency Act this is an enabling Bill which allows the Minister to bring forward a number of specific proposals by regulation after its enactment.  I know comments have been made regarding Bills such as this, that it is better to have as much detail as possible formalised in legislation rather than granting powers to a Minister to bring forward regulations by statutory instrument.  This Bill is quite complicated and the detail required will necessitate consultation with a broad range of sectoral interests.  It would be appropriate to have the views and the will of the House expressed in primary legislation before the enactment of regulations which will have to be placed <Col N="1498" /> before both Houses of the Oireachtas in due course.</P>
      <P>I thank the two parties in Opposition and Deputy Ahearn for the broad welcome for the measures proposed.</P>
      <P>Regarding the structure of the Bill, it is not true to suggest it is stand alone legislation.  I was involved in negotiating the Programme for Government and, as a member of the previous Government, I was aware of the genesis of this measure.  It dovetails into a sequence of legislative provisions, the Environmental Protection Agency Act and the integrated licensing system flowing from that which is incrementally expanding to encompass more elements of our society.  It dovetails into the Air Pollution Act and other environmental legislation.  Therefore, it is not true to say it stands alone.  It is also part of the Government's integrated sustainable development strategy.  Sustainability is a key objective of the Government and it will be driven not alone by the Department of the Environment but by a Cabinet subcommittee which will include all the major players involved in controlling pollution, including the Departments of Enterprise and Employment, Transport, Energy and Communications, Agriculture, Food and Forestry and Tourism and Trade.  Those Departments will be involved in ensuring that we adopt a co-ordinated approach to enhancing and maintaining our clean environment.</P>
      <P>I disagree with Deputy Dempsey that we are at the bottom of the heap in terms of waste control.  Many of our measures are leading the way.  Last week I attended meetings with representatives of the pharmaceutical sector who told me that environmentalists from as far away as Japan come here to examine our integrated licensing systems. We should not be shy in stating what we are good at.  We have a clean environment and a determined Government and population to ensure that is maintained and enhanced.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Proinsias De Rossa)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies for their contributions to the debate on this important Bill.  As I have indicated, one of the key issues in the referendum campaign on divorce in 1986 was the degree of uncertainty about how divorce would affect social welfare entitlements.  This Bill will ensure this does not happen on this occasion.  It will be clear to the electorate how divorced people will be treated under the code and they will recognise that there will be no loss of entitlements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of Opposition Deputies questioned the costs of implementing the provisions of the Bill which have been estimated by my Department at £1 million by year five following the introduction of divorce and about £2 million by year ten.  Deputy Joe Walsh expressed the view that £1 million could not be the cost of marital breakdown. Of course it is not &mdash; the costs of marital breakdown are already being met by the State and the social insurance fund <Col N="1500" /> under the existing provisions of the social welfare code.  These supports are provided primarily through the lone parent's allowance and the deserted wife's benefit and allowance schemes.  It is important to realise that, under the existing provisions, men or women who are separated from their spouses can qualify for survivor's pension on the death of their spouse, even though they may have been separated for many years.  This Bill will ensure that a divorced person whose former spouse dies will not lose entitlement to survivor's pension.  This does not give rise to additional costs as the person would have qualified for pension in any event, if they had not become divorced.  Some additional costs will arise, however, on the death of a divorced person who remarries and where his or her spouse and former spouse qualify for pension.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides that a deserted wife may continue to be regarded as deserted for the purposes of the deserted wife's benefit and allowance schemes.  These provisions will not give rise to additional costs as under the present arrangements divorce, in itself, does not affect entitlement to these payments. It was considered necessary, however, to include explicit provision for this in the Bill.  Similarly, a divorced person can qualify for lone parent's allowance under the present arrangements. They can do so on the basis of being an unmarried parent, but under the provisions of the Bill they will be recognised under the social welfare code as a divorced person.</P>
    <P>The Bill will also enable a divorced person on low pay who is supporting his or her former spouse to qualify for family income supplement.  In practice, however, it is extremely unlikely that a person on low pay would be in a financial position to maintain two households.</P>
    <P>It will be evident to Deputies therefore that, for these reasons, the additional costs arising from this Bill will be relatively low, hence the estimated costs of only £1 million by year <Col N="1501" /> five following the introduction of divorce and about £2 million by year ten. While £1 million is a substantial amount of money, it is important to put this figure into perspective.  Total social welfare expenditure this year will be in the region of £4.2 billion and the figure of £1 million represents just 0.02 per cent of overall expenditure.</P>
    <P>For that reason I am satisfied that the estimates my Department has provided for the costs of this Bill are accurate in so far as one can predict costs based on variables, such as the number of people who may separate in the next few years and the number who will subsequently remarry.  Many other issues were raised during the debate which would be more appropriately dealt with on Committee Stage, which I hope will take place soon.</P>
    <P>The sole purpose of the Bill is to ensure that nobody loses out in terms of social welfare entitlements in the event of getting divorced.  I could have broadened the matter considerably but I felt it was necessary to keep it as simple and straightforward as possible.  For that reason I heartily commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann, in view of</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&mdash; the fact that the underlying trend in unemployment has worsened since this Government came to office, with the adjusted total in <Col N="1502" /> May higher now than it was last January,</P>
    <P>&mdash; the fact that the rate of long term unemployment is the highest in the OECD and that over half the unemployed are now long term unemployed,</P>
    <P>&mdash; the fact that the Central Bank has upped its unemployment forecast for 1995 by 7,000 and that independent stockbrokers have said the Government will fail by a big margin to achieve its modest unemployment targets for this year.</P>
    <P>&mdash; the fact that there have been unprecedented major closures of industries throughout the country recently and that these crises will further add to the jobless total, and</P>
    <P>&mdash; the complete lack of planning for the county enterprise boards.</P>
    <P>condemns the Government and the Minister for Enterprise and Employment for failing to honour their commitment to make unemployment a priority and for failing to tackle unemployment in any significant way and calls on the Government to develop a coherent employment policy aimed at the maintenance and creation of employment as well as giving priority to measures to tackle long term unemployment.</P>
    <P>I am glad to head my party team in this debate on an issue on which this Government said it would make major changes.  It said we would see significant results on it and it would target all its objectives at a meaningful decrease in unemployment figures.  There are noticeable, significant differences between achievements in the terms of office of Governments in which Fianna Fáil are involved and those of others, including Coalition governments, without our participation.  When Fianna Fáil is in Government it appears to be in control of national issues, in particular <Col N="1503" /> the economy and other issues warranting extra attention.</P>
    <P>It would appear this Government blames everybody else when something goes wrong as we witnessed in the controversy over the Office of the Attorney General.  Somehow or other Fianna Fáil was blamed for the poor participation rate in the community employment programme, and our party was held responsible for the last budget and Estimates delivered by the present Minister for Finance.  In the six weeks interval between the change over of power to the present Administration, the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, appeared to have no responsibility for examining the allocation of funding despite the fact that on the day those Estimates were published I said the funds being allocated were inadequate and I was laughed at.</P>
    <P>That underfunding clearly demonstrated the hollowness of the Government's commitment to reducing unemployment or making that its absolute priority.  That commitment has not been honoured despite the Governments earlier claims.  I will not engage in rhetoric without the requisite back-up figures. Like markets, one cannot fake statistics, however inadequate.  Our unemployment figures clearly demonstrate that the underlying trend has worsened since this Government assumed office.</P>
    <P>Of course, the Government has endeavoured to disguise that fact by repeatedly announcing the same new jobs, as happened recently.  For example, in last week's debate on the Private Members' motion on the economy, in which the Minister for Finance participated, the gloss was also applied by the Minister and Ministers of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment.  Ministers are seeking to conceal the problem by referring only to the live register figures whereas we all know the seasonally adjusted total represents the real employment position. When in Opposition the Minister <Col N="1504" /> present always insisted that the seasonally adjusted figure was the one that should be used, with which I agree. Indeed, the Minister for Finance, when in the Department of Enterprise and Employment, also sought to use the seasonally adjusted figure.  The reason that figure is not now being used is that Ministers know the Government has not got to grips with the unemployment crisis and is endeavouring to hide that fact.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt but that the position has worsened by the month since the beginning of this year, to the extent that the steady economic progress made last year has been lost.  That was crucially reflected in the May unemployment figures, when the drop was negligible within he overall context of unemployment.  The underlying trend shows that the unemployment figure in May was higher than that in January last when this Government took office.  If, with economic growth of 5 per cent-plus this Government can achieve a tiny reduction only in unemployment, one must ask what will happen if growth diminishes.  The Government has been fumbling about with the unemployment problem and has put forward no coherent strategy, leading to the Central Bank raising its unemployment forecast for 1995 by 7,000.</P>
    <P>The warnings, including those of independent stockbrokers and economic forecasters, being issued are very disturbing emanating, as they do, against a background of closures, including The Irish Press group, Silver Lea, Pretty Polly, part of Sunbeam Wolsey and the 400-job layoffs at Packard Electric with effect from Friday next. These industrial crises have eroded the negligible reduction in the May unemployment total and will add significantly to that total in coming months.</P>
    <P>Those factory closures emphasise the contradictions in the Government's industrial policy, the crisis within the textile sector in particular highlights those contradictions.  Three months ago the future of the knitwear division of Sunbeam Wolsey was in jeopardy.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1505" /> Before the crisis arose in its socks and underwear division, the knitwear factory had full order books but needed approximately £300,000 to tide it over a difficult stretch.  That request was refused at the time by the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, resulting in the knitwear plant closing in March with a loss of 108 jobs.  Those jobs, with 75 others in the socks and underwear division, have been lost.  The same applied in the case of the Silver Lea jeans factory in Athlone, which needed the smallest of breathing spaces in order to preserve 150 jobs.  I did everything an Opposition Member could do, and more, but my pleas fell on arid ground. I am convinced that the Department of Enterprise and Employment has certain ideas about the textile industry.</P>
    <P>I am further convinced that the <i>ad hoc</i> incoherent way its industrial policy is managed means that today one industry is chosen to be saved and tomorrow another industry equally deserving of aid is allowed to go to the wall.  The Pretty Polly factory closed more than a week ago.  This treatment of the clothing sector is in sharp contrast to Government action on Shannon Aerospace and Packard Electric, the Exchequer putting up £12 million to protect jobs at the troubled aircraft maintenance facility. Two Ministers made every effort to save jobs at Packard Electric.  These interventions were welcome but have led to an air of confusion about the Government's industrial strategy and intervention policy.</P>
    <P>In future, does the Government intend intervening in the case of every company experiencing problems and, if so, what will be the criteria when deciding when and where to intervene?  For example, if the industry is located in a constituency represented by a Minister will that be the requisite muscle?  How can the Government stand over its job preservation intervention at Shannon Aerospace &mdash; I agree with the preservation of jobs &mdash; and its planned job-shedding within the ESB and Telecom Éireann?  How does that relate to the <Col N="1506" /> Government's failure to take a decision on the report of the Competition Authority in regard to the Irish Press?  I thank the Minister for sending me a copy of his statement to be delivered this evening but I cannot understand its contents.  The Minister continues to say that he cannot take a decision on the report of the Competition Authority, but that report was made available to him on 11 April last.  A ministerial decision taken in time would have helped avert the crisis in the Irish Press.</P>
    <P>The time has come for the Oireachtas to re-examine industrial policy and employment strategies.  What is happening now, particularly in the semi-State companies, does not make any sense if the national commitment is to take action on unemployment.</P>
    <P>I do not dispute the argument that change is necessary in some of the semi-State companies.  They must be positioned for the future and work practices must be in line with procedures elsewhere. However, at a time of high unemployment, it does not make sense to wantonly destroy jobs in commercial semi-State companies.  Under current plans it is proposed that, with the 3,000 jobs that are to go in the ESB, Telecom could shed up to 3,000 jobs and Aer Lingus, Bord na Móna and An Post will let go large numbers of workers.  That is a total of approximately 15,000 jobs. There should be a public debate on the rationale of such job shedding.  In the past 70 years, those companies have expanded and developed expertise and skills and they should be challenged to maintain and create new, self-sustaining employment.  It is morally, socially and economically foolish to wantonly shed jobs if we maintain that we want to address the serious unemployment crisis and maximise employment.</P>
    <P>The unemployment problem is primarily a medium term one and if demographic shifts and changes continue, jobs will be available in the next decade for those who want them, apart from the huge number of long term unemployed. We must debate our approach to public utilities and industrial policies.  Privatisation is not the appropriate route to <Col N="1507" /> take.  Wholesale privatisation, as evidenced in the UK, is not acceptable.  We must look at strategic initiatives and alliances for our public sector enterprises so that they are strengthened and can continue to make a contribution to employment.</P>
    <P>The Cabinet cannot ask a State company to get its costs into line and undertake massive job shedding when it is rushing in to prop up jobs in another enterprise.  That is a mystery to me and I would like the Minister to offer an explanation.  If this contradictory <i>ad hoc</i> policy of helping one firm but not another continues, the Government will spark industrial unrest that the economy cannot afford.</P>
    <P>The greatest failure of this Government is its failure to tackle long term unemployment, which is shameful.  Long term unemployment is our most serious problem.  We have the highest rate in the OECD and people who have been out of work for more than one year make up over half the overall jobless total.  That rate has risen from over 42.5 per cent of the total numbers unemployed in April 1991 to 50 per cent today and the future is bleak.</P>
    <P>Already this year, the Government has shown that the CEP is not a particular priority.  There was an embarrassing scramble for funds and there is an even more serious lack of commitment and lethargy on the part of the Government in relation to long term unemployment. The National Economic and Social Forum produced a worthwhile report.  It advocated allocating £30 million towards dealing with this problem but only £6 million was provided for in the budget of which not one penny has been spent.</P>
    <P>There is a great reluctance by the Government to begin an upgrade of the community employment programme. The previous Government updated the social employment scheme, provided for more meaningful training for longer durations and allowed for a wider use by voluntary sponsors of worthwhile projects.  The Department of Enterprise <Col N="1508" /> and Employment should set about making that community employment more meaningful now that the numbers are guaranteed and training facilities increased.</P>
    <P>There is much work to be done in the social economy in the areas of health, education and tourism.  If it is done in a structured way, this work could give meaning to the lives of those who are long term unemployed without undermining the competitive basis of the economy.  It is important, therefore, that resources for action on long term unemployment are given priority.  There is a social obligation to shift resources towards initiatives to help the long term unemployed, market forces alone cannot be allowed to determine their future.  There is a civic and social obligation on the Government and employers to play their part and a widespread recognition that only sustained, directed and monitored intervention will make inroads into this enormous statistic behind which lie thousands of blighted lives.</P>
    <P>We often talk about long term unemployment but those of us who make statements on the problem are employed.  We participate in radio programmes and discuss the problem as if it were one single statistic.  Behind that statistic, however, is a man or woman with a family, friends, dignity and motivation &mdash; which has been long lost &mdash; missed opportunities and diminished self confidence.  The people who talk about this problem, including Members of the House, economic commentators and those in the media, are in relatively comfortable employment.  The action we are taking to address the problem is a mere drop in the ocean.  In countries where the problem of unemployment is taken seriously it is constantly on the agenda of governments.</P>
    <P>We must set regional targets for dealing with the problem of long term unemployment.  That is done satisfactorily in Belgium, parts of Holland and Germany.  Targets give one something to work towards.  The rising boat will lift certain groups of people but it will not <Col N="1509" /> help the long term unemployed.  Spirits are crushed when people wake up every morning knowing they have nothing to do.  When Fianna Fáil is back in Government it will set realistic targets for reducing the number of long term unemployed.  If we do not reach those targets, we will try even harder to achieve them because that is the only way the problem can be addressed.  All fair minded people will accept that is the route to follow.</P>
    <P>A number of other initiatives must be taken.  We must obtain better unemployment statistics showing the gender, age, occupation, experience and level of training of people who are unemployed, in addition to the length of time they have been on the live register.  When we were in Government, the then Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Quinn, and myself took the initiative &mdash; I do not know what happened to it &mdash; of collating statistics from Department of Social Welfare offices throughout the country to obtain more meaningful information on the unemployed. I am aware that the UK figures give a breakdown of the various headings to which I referred.</P>
    <P>There is a sense of helplessness and hopelessness pervading the debate on unemployment.  Targets must be set in dealing with the problem to establish firm and positive thinking on the issue. I have spoken previously about the county enterprise boards, the Leader programmes, back to work schemes, area partnership companies, initiatives by the Department of Social Welfare, the Department of Enterprise and Employment, the Office of the Taoiseach, the Office of the Tánaiste, the NESC, the ESRI, Ministers with responsibility for rural development, the Central Bank, Forbairt, IDA Ireland and FÁS, all of which are engaged in the same task.  However, the person going to one of these agencies for assistance does not know which door to open. The Minister told me last week about the 1850 telephone number which was designed to point people in the right direction.  I wanted to call that number <Col N="1510" /> yesterday but it took 15 minutes to get it from the Department's information section.  I have not seen the number advertised anywhere.</P>
    <P>There are too many routes to enterprise and too much confusion.  It is high time to simplify the routes to enterprise rather than cluttering them up with well intentioned but confusing programmes.  Last week the Minister for Enterprise and Employment rushed to allocate moneys to county enterprise boards as the money they had been allocated in the budget had been used on projects already.  The county enterprise boards have to be put on a proper footing.</P>
    <P>I would like to see all memoranda for Government employment proofed &mdash; something I will insist upon if and when we get back to Government.  When we were in Government we were well on the road with employment protection legislation but where is it now?  The legislation on prompt payment would make a very real difference for small firms as it would give them cash in hand, enabling them to continue in business.</P>
    <P>I am very concerned about IDA reporting structures and will be moving to have the Dáil committee system amended so that the IDA, Forbairt, FÁS and FORFÁS can give regular reports on their work to the House.  At present they cannot appear and all we get are annual reports.  It is important to get full information on the value taxpayers are getting for their investment in new plants.  I would like to get a report on how many of the new jobs announced in the past 20 years were created and how many still exist.  This reporting procedure for the IDA should also apply to FÁS and other State agencies.</P>
    <P>Ministers of this Government do not answer parliamentary questions and even the most innocuous parliamentary question elicits the response, &ldquo;this has nothing to do with me&rdquo;.  What is most strange from a Government that sets out to be like a pane of glass is that the blinds are constantly drawn down on information that I am entitled to have <Col N="1511" /> on behalf of those whom I represent. Recently the Minister for Enterprise and Employment refused to give details on grant aid to companies, on job targets, job realisation and on the claw back if employment targets are not met.  All the questions draw a blank refusal.  Will we need more inquiries similar to the beef tribunal to get information?</P>
    <P>The ILO recently published a report warning that Irish unemployment will remain the highest in the industrialised world at the end of the decade unless policies are developed.  I am calling on the Government to set itself to this task and to honour its commitment to make employment a priority.  It must develop a coherent employment strategy.  It must report also on implementation of the Culliton report on industrial policy. When we were in Government we gave an up-to-date report each year on the implementation of the Culliton recommendations but I have not heard this year's report.  I do not wish to castigate the Minister about this because he may have it in his back pocket and perhaps the Minister will inform us about it in his reply.</P>
    <P>The Government must give priority to measures for the long term unemployed. If it is not willing to do so it should just step aside and let in others who are willing to meet the challenge.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my colleague, Deputy O'Rourke, for sharing her time with me.  I will take up the baton where she left off.  Economic stability requires clear-cut decisive policies.  Last week we in Fianna Fáil highlighted the problem in regard to public expenditure and this week we rightly identified the question of jobs which is central to Government's work.  We must deal with the problems of unemployment and the national debt. It is vital people have confidence in the Government of the day.  Sadly, in this Government there is nothing but confusion and chaos.  For example, the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, Deputy Lowry, has <Col N="1512" /> adopted a macho approach to the semi-States but in spite of the PR management he is continuously pulled back by the dominant left-wing influence in this Government and we see major U turns. A classic example of the confusion of the Government is the &ldquo;jobs for Leitrim&rdquo; initiative.  My colleagues rightly identified as disgraceful the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry's rush to announce the project, which was backed by my party in Government as an important project for the west.  The Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht jumped in to object and withdrew his objection shortly afterwards.  I would describe that as an act of political madness which would not instill confidence in this Government.</P>
      <P>The Government promised a third banking force but as far as I can see, it is back to the drawing board.  We see the lack of cohesion on many ideological issues but it is cleverly camouflaged by the expertise of the programme managers.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Rourke asked about the Irish Press and raised again tonight the reason the Minister for Enterprise and Employment did not express at the right time a particular view on the Competition Authority report.  We were told the Minister had no view, and the Government dithered again.  We now have the Dunnes Stores strike, with implications for jobs not only of Dunnes workers but also of its suppliers.  I am glad to see the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, is here.  I was pleased to see his appeal in the media but today another Minister of State, Deputy Eithne Fitzgerald, appeared.  What concerns me is who is actually in charge of that area.  This is a sincere question because there have to be clear demarcation lines when managing a Government. It is a peripheral issue but the Government should address it.  What we have seen is a series of Government Ministers who are not prepared to take action on the very basic issue of the protection of part-time workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I reread with interest the programme, <i>A Government of Renewal</i>, and noted <Col N="1513" /> the reference on the need to protect part-time workers.  Those words ring hollow when I see how this Government acts.  I have a problem in identifying who to blame because more than one Minister is involved.  The Government is letting the issue drift in the hope that it will be resolved.  Deputy O'Rourke and I have been in close contact with all parties and are anxious to see the dispute resolved.  We ask the Minister responsible to become more proactively involved and honour the commitment in the Programme for Government to ensure there is no exploitation of part-time workers and that they are protected. Should they be required to work on Sunday they should do so voluntarily and be paid accordingly.</P>
    <P>Yesterday the Minister for Finance was rapped on the knuckles by his German counterpart on account of our national debt &mdash; another worrying aspect with regard to confidence in this Government.  We are concerned about the muddled picture presented by this Government in the run up to our Presidency of the European Union.  The intergovernmental conference next year will have to decide on many crucial issues which have huge implications for our country.  We are asking the Government to set out a coherent policy.  If things are getting too hot, the Government should do the honourable thing and step aside.  There are huge EU funds coming to us now and we need to use them wisely.  I am concerned that they are not being used properly because of the ideological confusion that exists on the Government side of this House.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that enterprise alone can solve our unemployment problem. In speaking on this motion which condemns the Government and the Minister for Enterprise and Employment for failing to honour their commitments to make unemployment a priority I am acutely conscious of the fact that the Government does not directly create jobs.  Job creation is a task for businessmen, large and small, indigenous and multinational, in the public and <Col N="1514" /> private sectors.  These businesses produce the goods and services which are sold on home and export markets. It is the market which sustains the business, and the primary task of enterprise is to provide a product or service which is more attractive than that of competitors and so retain and expand the market base.</P>
    <P>Irish industrial policy has for many years concentrated unduly on endeavouring to solve our economic development problems by attracting overseas enterprises.  There have been many such examples in recent times.  It can be claimed with some validity that the multinationals have made significant contributions to our industrialisation in terms of skills development and access for their products to international markets. It must be recognised, however, that no multinational will locate in a country unless it is to its advantage.  In other words, a multinational must profit directly from international location.</P>
    <P>The profit arises from using the indigenous resources of the host country in terms of skills and material inputs.  It is valid to ask why a far greater emphasis is not placed on the development of the indigenous industry which, by definition, would give a far higher value in Ireland as the question of repatriation of profits would not arise.  The Government needs to be wary of falling into the trap of self-delusion by believing that the economy is thriving with a high rate of growth led by booming export sales. I am sure that the very large number of unemployed people are less than impressed by these statistics.  The reality is that over 17 per cent of the total of Irish merchandise exports represents profits repatriation by multinationals. This figure is currently well over £3,000 million per annum, and it should validly be deducted before arriving at the export figure.  The statistics regarding the performance of multinationals in Ireland need to be corrected to reflect the contribution of these countries to indigenous added value, because that alone sustains jobs and living standards in the Irish economy.  In case anyone <Col N="1515" /> thinks that Ireland is too small to sustain the development of large-scale indigenous companies, I emphasise that the top ten Irish subsidiaries of multinational companies in 1992-1993 employed just over 5,100 people here, whereas the top ten indigenous Irish companies in the same year employed more than 56,000 people.</P>
    <P>In an article in <i>The European</i> dated 9-15 June 1995, the leading role which Luxembourg plays in the investment markets in western Europe is examined. This article traced the economic development of Luxembourg over the past 100 years from being an agricultural country through the stage of dependence on the heavy steel industry, to the position today where it is a world-class banking and fund management centre and an emerging player in the sale of cross-border insurance products. These developments have taken place in Luxembourg not by accident but through a national recognition and acceptance that they would have to find market niche activities in which to excel. The point was made forcefully in the article that Luxembourg is surrounded by powerful and rich neighbours with whom it would not be possible for a small nation to compete on a broad basis so that specialisation in a small number of areas is essential.  The result of sound strategic economic planning and effective implementation of those plans is that Luxembourg enjoys the highest <i>per capita</i> income in the European Union, and it is worth noting that this is double the Irish <i>per capita</i> income.  Luxembourg also enjoys the lowest level of unemployment in the European Union which, at around 2 per cent, is one fifth of the European average.</P>
    <P>The concept of self-sustained economic development as practised by Luxembourg and other small successful economies formed part of the economic background to Fianna Fáil bringing together the social partners in 1987.  I mentioned Luxembourg as an example we should follow.  The Fianna Fáil <Col N="1516" /> approach of focusing on sectoral development was continued under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> in 1990-93, and Fianna Fáil in Government would have adopted a similar approach under the current <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i> I now call on the Government and the Minister for Enterprise and Employment to re-establish the sectoral development priorities for which the foundation was well laid by Fianna Fáil and, in doing so, to look at the lessons which can be learned from small successful economies such as Luxembourg within the European Union and Switzerland outside the EU.</P>
    <P>The EU &ldquo;information society&rdquo; agenda which I pursued as Minister of State for European Affairs should be central to this debate.  I am convinced that the EU Information Superhighway Initiative could provide thousands of new jobs here.  Information business is mobile and transportable and dependent on brain power.  We have high-tech university graduates and multilingual expertise, our costs are competitive and we are in a very strong position to carve out for ourselves thousands of value added jobs in information related industries. In regulating information and communications network at EU level, however, it is essential that we do not allow pure market criteria to dictate the pace and direction of change.  A regulatory framework must aim to reach out to citizens and provide access to a wide range of services at affordable prices.</P>
    <P>The French Government has a very progressive position on information and communications networks.  They are committed to promoting the necessary investment so that access is available to all users with special account taken of peripheral regions, thus avoiding the creation of a two-tier information society.  The professional working in Belmullet or Bohola should be on a level playing pitch with his or her counterpart in Brussels or Berlin.  The information revolution has already begun and I hope this Government and Telecom Éireann will become centrally <Col N="1517" /> involved in shaping its future.  Having attended the Communications Workers' Union Conference in Galway last month, I was very encouraged by the enlightened position being adopted by this union in regard to the challenges facing Telecom Éireann in the years ahead.  The Irish Government should align itself with the French in promoting an efficient, effective and equitable network of telecommunications for the 21st century and by so doing provide access to employment opportunities for our highly skilled and educated young workforce.</P>
    <P>The only viable long term way in which to develop a sustainable business base in the economy is through enterprise which, in turn, depends primarily on the skills, motivation and business acumen of individuals.  During my response to the budget speech of the Minister for Finance I challenged him on the validity of his budget in respect of each of his three stated objectives which were to reward work, promote enterprise and strengthen social solidarity. Sadly, his answers were very disappointing. The message from Government has become even more anti-enterprise since I last spoke about the issue in the House.  One of the major obstacles in the way of enterprise development at present is the anti-business culture which amounts almost to a criminalisation of those involved in business.</P>
    <P>In regard to long term unemployment, not only has the Government failed in its commitment to make the problem of unemployment a priority, long term unemployment here is now at the highest level not only within the European Union but among all the OECD countries.  Half of Ireland's unemployed are now classified as long term unemployed.  One of the most effective ways in which to help the long term unemployed is through education and training, and I am convinced that much more can be done in this area.  I call on the Government to look at the fundamental relationship between education and jobs.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1518" /> When I spoke in March on the interim report of the Task Force on Long-Term Unemployment I suggested that some of the money devoted to finance the abolition of university fees for full-time students might have been used much more effectively to enhance the job prospects of early school leavers so that they will not become the long term unemployed of the future.  I would have thought this approach would have appealed to a Government which includes the Labour Party and the Democratic Left, but I was mistaken.  I remind the Government that according to the National Economic and Social Forum almost half the long term unemployed are currently without formal educational qualifications and fewer than one fifth of them have a leaving certificate or higher qualification. Unfortunately this situation looks set to continue for many years because each year nearly 20 per cent of all students who leave the education system have either no formal qualifications or very poor qualifications.  The interim report of the Task Force on Long-Term Unemployment stated: &ldquo;It is almost inevitable that a large percentage of these will become long term unemployed&rdquo;.  More than three month ago I suggested to the Government that it was high time to address the problems of this group of disadvantaged school leavers rather than wait until they too become statistics in some future report.</P>
    <P>Governments do not directly create employment, but the Government has a fundamental duty to provide national leadership, and this includes economic leadership.  In the circumstances the need for economic leadership is paramount if Ireland is to solve the very serious problem of unemployment which has worsened significantly since this Government came into office.  In providing such leadership the Government should be vigilant and ensure that legislation is not anti-business.  The Government has not only failed to provide leadership but, through inappropriate legislation, has fuelled anti-business <Col N="1519" /> sentiment.  The Government, as custodian of national statistics, should take steps to ensure that the figures upon which policy decisions are based reflect real, indigenous activities.  The Government has failed to understand the relationship between education and jobs and continues to ignore the plight of more than half the long term unemployed who are without formal educational qualifications.</P>
    <P>I call on the Minister and the Minister of State to accept our bona fides in raising the issue of jobs and the plight of the long term unemployed.  He should try to present a coherent strategy and instil confidence into the public.  If he cannot do so, we are ready and able to take his place when the time comes.</P>

      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann, having regard to the Government's determination to promote additional employment, reward work and reduce taxation: the very positive projected growth in output of 6¼ per cent and in non-agricultural employment of 37,000 in 1995; the notable success of enterprise development agencies at both national and local levels; the growing success of the back to work allowance scheme; the reduction in notified redundancy figures of 25 per cent in the first five months of this year; the initiation of a local employment service to target long term unemployment; and the Government's commitment to maintaining an average of 40,000 people on the community employment programme, has full confidence in the employment policies being developed and implemented by the Government and the Minister for Enterprise and Employment&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1520" /> I propose to share my time with Deputy Boylan.</P>
    <P>Sometimes I need to pinch myself to recall that Fianna Fáil was in power for the past eight years.  When it complains of structural weaknesses in the economy such as long term unemployment it begs the question: &ldquo;what did it do for the last eight years to tackle this problem?&rdquo;. This is a threadbare effort to use any grounds possible to discredit the Government.  Anyone looking at the motion will see it is riddled with threadbare data.  The people will see through it.  I hope to demonstrate, even to the sceptics on the Opposition benches, the soundness of the Government's achievements and the good sense of the strategies we propose.</P>
    <P>The key determinant in employment growth is the overall health of the economy. In recent years there has been significant growth in this economy but it is depressing that, over the last seven years despite having the highest growth in Europe, we have one of the worst employment performances.  With 5 per cent growth in national income from 1987 we have not succeeded in creating more than 7,000 new jobs each year, less than one quarter of what we need to provide employment for the natural increase in the labour force.  Things have changed and the outlook for the economy is buoyant.  The estimates for growth this year are sound with an economic growth rate of 6 per cent forecast and 2.5 per cent growth in employment or an increase of 37,000 in non-agricultural employment.  It looks as if this is set to continue in 1996.</P>
    <P>Everyone recognises that the main target we must achieve is to create employment opportunities for our rapidly expanding labour force.  It is a crucial issue.  We must achieve high growth, low inflation and a highly competitive economic environment.  I am encouraged by the Government's achievements since it came to power.  The forecast for non-agricultural employment growth in 1995 is 37,000 &mdash; an increase of 31,000 in net employment in 1995. That is considerably above the natural <Col N="1521" /> increase in the labour force of 24,000 and is a significant achievement bearing in mind recent history.</P>
    <P>Deputies look for hard facts to back up some of the Government's achievements. The building industry is a good example.  It has been dear to the hearts of Fianna Fáil over the years.  In the first four months this year we achieved 7 per cent growth in employment in that industry.  Contrast that with the same period last year when employment there declined by 1 per cent.  There is a significant change in employment performance since the Government came to office.</P>
    <P>In the first five months of this year recorded redundancy figures are 25 per cent lower than in the same period last year.  That is a reduction of 2,000 over the same period last year.  It puts at nought the Fianna Fáil suggestion that there is a widespread spate of job losses. The facts speak for themselves.  That is a credible performance.  It is important that the Government maintain consistent macro-economic policies so that we can continue to enjoy real employment growth in the non-agricultural and private sectors.  The Minister for Finance is to be complimented on the prudent measures he has taken to ensure that by managing public finances in a sensible and coherent way we make room for that growth in the coming years.  We can achieve a sensible growth in public services but in a context where we share the fruits of growth, with tax reform, to promote expanded employment. If Fianna Fáil was honest and looked at its period in office, it would recognise that the facts speak for themselves. Between October 1992 and December 1994 unemployment fell by 11,000.  Long-term unemployment during that period increased by 9,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I commend the Minister for Finance on the measures introduced in his year's budget to reduce the tax wedge which was an obstacle to turning growth into real employment on the ground.  These measures have been widely welcomed by business, particularly by those in some of the more vulnerable sectors such as the clothing industry and other industries which rely on the traditional indigenous sectors. These measures include the increase from £9,000 to £12,000 in the annual income threshold below which the lower <Col N="1526" /> rate of employers' PRSI of 9 per cent applies and the exemption of the first £50 of income from employer's PRSI. They have helped to reduce the tax wedge and the costs of employing people by more than 3 per cent in many industries.  As you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, will know, many traditional industries rely on profitability levels of less than 2 per cent of their turnover and this reduction in their wage bill has been of significant assistance in improving profitability and helping them to grow and develop.</P>

The Government has set the ambitious target of 20,000 gross new jobs in industry in the coming years, and I commend the IDA for the very significant and worthy progress it has made in meeting its target this year.

      <P>Fair minded people will recognise the value of projects such as Hewlett-Packard, Seagate, SRAM, 3COM, INTEL, Corel and MADGE, to name just a few.</P>
      <P>Of course we cannot rely on foreign industry to provide the answer to all our employment needs.  It is critically important to avail of this opportunity to develop our indigenous firms.  We must take a much more strategic view of the base of foreign industry and use it to develop linkages and opportunities for our smaller sub-supply and consumer industries.  In this context Forbairt has set itself ambitious targets over the next five years and has made significant progress in this area.  Although it created more than 9,000 jobs last year another 9,000 jobs were lost in indigenous industries. There was no net gain in employment in the indigenous sector last year and we are determined to try to reverse this trend.  Ambitious targets have been set in the areas of linkages, research and development and innovation for small businesses, and the Minister of State, Deputy Pat Rabbitte, is developing very worthwhile programmes in this area. We have also set ambitious targets for industry in export growth and employment. These companies believe they will be able to expand employment and reverse the recent trent of sustained decline in employment levels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must do more to fund small business and help them to meet their funding requirements.  Small business has always found it difficult to secure finance from banks, which in recent times have been more responsive and supportive of entrepreneurs and business generally.  I also recognise the value of the small business loan fund which was developed by the former Minister, Deputy Séamus Brennan.  I am glad to tell the House that I will shortly announce a much expanded low interest, long term loan scheme which will be of immense benefit to small business and which will also be open to service and smaller businesses.  I am also glad to announce that a new seed and venture capital fund has ben put in <Col N="1528" /> place.  This will be a very important vehicle through which to help smaller, risky ventures which have experienced enormous difficulty in developing.</P>

      <P>I am glad to tell the House that the drawdowns and activities in this area are very healthy.  During the first six months there has been a drawdown of £6 million in support of real employment projects.  This is a huge increase on the figure for the same period last year.</P>
      <P>The Deputies opposite seem to think that we are not addressing the needs of the long term unemployed.  The Government is determined to implement the local employment service as recommended by the NESF and as endorsed by the task force on long term unemployment.  There are 12 partnership areas and it is hoped to bring two additional non-partnership areas into the scheme this year.  This programme is designed to produce tailor-made responses to the need of the long term unemployed instead of putting them on schemes at the end of which they revert to the live register.  We want to see those who participate in training schemes or in second chance education progressing to a career path.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am pleased we had the opportunity to reverse the cuts in the community employment scheme and have restored participation to 40,000 people.  This had been a good scheme and had involved many people across the community in worthwhile projects.  It has drawn 90 per cent of its participants from the long term unemployed and the balance from lone parents.  We are developing the training component and this year we have development modules for all participants. We are stepping up the training of supervisors to ensure that the <Col N="1529" /> quality in that area is up to the desired standard.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that the back to work allowance scheme, administered by my colleague the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa, is making a valuable contribution to reducing unemployment and helping people to establish new business.  As Deputy Kitt pointed out, it is important that we invest in our human resources.  That is why the White Paper on training, on which I am working, is of critical importance.  Anyone reviewing the industrial climate would clearly recognise that it is in the human resource area that competitive advantage will be built for the future.  It is important that we review the effectiveness of the very substantial human resource budgets in place, and that is what I am doing.</P>
    <P>Many of us will have been disappointed and disturbed at the results of the school leavers survey published last week where many of those who dropped out of school without completing any qualification are facing bleak futures in the labour market.  This is an issue that has to be addressed not only in the context of our work in the training area but in the schools.  It is disappointing that 3,500 young people are coming out of school with no qualification and facing such poor prospects in the labour market.</P>
    <P>Part of our bottom-up approach to addressing employment needs is the local development programme.  We have designated 35 disadvantaged areas under that programme which will embrace the partnership concept that has been so successful in areas such as Coolock, to mention just one, in the past two to three years.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that we have a clear strategic approach and that the tackling of unemployment and, in particular, long term unemployment is at the top of our agenda.  I recognise, like other Deputies, that tackling long term unemployment will not be an easy task but we are using our ingenuity to come up with new answers which I am confident will bear fruit in time.</P>

      <P>I am concerned about the problem of long term unemployed.  That is a separate issue from job creation for young people leaving school who will have more skills and be better educated. We are talking about a large number of people, perhaps in excess of 100,000 people, who have been unemployed for seven, eight or ten years.  While I do not like pointing the finger we have got to face reality and look at their situation.</P>

      <P>We have to look at their qualifications.  Unfortunately, we will find that many left school at an early stage.  They may have dropped out at junior cert level and may not have completed the leaving certificate.  Their qualifications for any job are limited. For that reason we have to examine this issue separately from the other issues of ongoing job creation to try to get those people back into the workforce.  The State can play a certain role.  I support the various community schemes and the FÁS schemes which have a role but they are not the be-all and end-all of job creation for these people.  They can play a role in developing skills.  I have seen this happen in the restoration of old buildings; a skill which I thought had died out is being passed on.  There is an opening for these skills but I am not sure whether those in the 35 to 55 age group can be brought back to class and training where skills can be taught to them or what role they can play in the modern employment enterprises such as computer skills and electronics.  That may not be the role for them but we should not simply say there is not much we can do and forget about them.  Many of those people are happily married and their families are growing up.  We are talking about a second generation where the work ethic in the home would not be strong.  That is serious.  Where the father or the parents are out working it instills in the children a work ethic. Unfortunately, those other people, through no fault of their own, are in this situation.</P>

      <P>There is a role for small industry in job creation.  The day of the multinational setting up an industry with 300 to 1,000 jobs is fast disappearing.</P>
      <P>On Sunday last my colleague, Deputy Brendan Smith and I &mdash; we work together for the good of the people of Cavan and there is very little bickering between us &mdash; jointly opened a trade fair in the little village of Ballyhaise.

The State must have a role in helping to market those products.  The business is too small to develop out into the market. I see an opportunity for people in their own community to develop jobs and take a pride in that work which would further encourage job creation because success leads to success.  I am sorry I do not have more time.  This is a subject we should return to regularly for further discussion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>In contributing to this debate I will comment on the importance of employment.  I will refer to what I regard as muddled thinking on how a small business can be assisted and highlight some of the areas where the adoption of a more enlightened approach to science and technology could lead to the creation and maintenance of further jobs.  I will also refer to the county enterprise boards which the Government asked to play a pivotal role.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An adequate science and technology infrastructure is the most vital job creating force in a modern industrial economy because technology, although responsible for the loss of jobs in some sectors is responsible for almost all new jobs.  The seriousness with which a country takes science and technology is a <Col N="1534" /> measure of how effective it is in job creation.  I cite the United States, Japan, Germany and the rapidly growing economies of the Pacific rim countries, such as Korea, Malaysia and Taiwan, as examples.  These lessons have obviously been lost on the Government.</P>
    <P>Innovative and successful initiatives by previous Fianna Fáil led Governments in the science and technology area, such as the programmes in advanced technology are being slowly starved of funds as well as having their industrially based steering boards removed.  The programmes are slowly withering on the vine of bureaucratic inaction starved of funds and the industrial guidance that made their work in previous years so relevant.</P>
    <P>Dismantling these excellent and imaginative initiatives in the area of science and technology was further compounded by the appearance of the recent STIAC report on science and technology which was a damp squib. This was paraded before an unsuspecting public with great though cynical bombast.  This report has been thoroughly discredited because of its failure to recognise that the greatest single job producing industry in the economy is information technology; computers, electronics and telecommunications. It is incredible that we are expected to take seriously a report that proposes no significant initiatives in this globally recognised high growth sector but focuses instead almost exclusively on the development of natural resource based industries whose job creation potential is limited.  This anomaly is so glaring that it undermines the value of the report and clearly demonstrates that the Government has failed to grasp the significance of science and technology.</P>
    <P>A further consequence of the Government's total lack of initiative, ideas and ambition is not only that a great opportunity has been missed with the production of such a lacklustre report.  I reserve my worst condemnation for the almost criminally negligent running down of the programmes <Col N="1535" /> in advanced technology which showed so much promise up to now.  One can only fervently hope that the damage inflicted to these programmes will not be irreversible by the time a responsible Government returns to office.</P>
    <P>Great concern has been expressed about the way in which the economy is being managed.  The function of Government is to collect taxes and spend the proceeds equitably to create the climate in which wealth and employment will be generated.</P>
    <P>This year the Government hopes to raise almost £12 billion in revenue every penny of which will come from those currently employed and in receipt of pensions.  Revenue will be raised by way of duty on small items such as boxes of matches and bottled water, stamp duty on homes, VAT, taxes associated with motoring not to mention PRSI, PAYE, the employment levy, the training levy and tax on profits.</P>
    <P>As a nation we have shown great tolerance in paying taxes partly in the hope of a better future for our children and a caring society for ourselves as we grow old.  The workforce is getting younger, the expectations of those leaving the education system are getting higher, the age of retirement is coming down, the life span of citizens is becoming longer and our population is expanding.</P>
    <P>In the private sector employers and employees make provision out of current earnings for future pension requirements. In Government circles &mdash; as Tim Pat Coogan recently pointed out in referring to the Irish Press group management &mdash; there is a riverdance approach to the growing and already massive unfunded liability for pensions that the State will have to pay in this and future years.  This might be fine if we had the resources to meet these future unfunded liabilities but with the workforce declining due to people joining later and leaving earlier taxes on those at work may not be sufficient to <Col N="1536" /> pay for those requiring education, social welfare, health care and pensions after a life in the public service.  Just because it was a long time ago when remnants of the present Government cut pensions does not mean that this grim spectre will not face future Governments unless we plan ahead now.</P>
    <P>Is the Government making the best use of the taxes it is raising from the workforce?  The State's share of the economic cake is growing steadily and dangerously larger each year.  The public service is increasing in size at a more rapid rate than the rest of the workforce and public service pay continues to accelerate at around three times the annual rate of inflation.  Inflation is currently below 3 per cent.  Nonetheless, a few months ago the Government planned to increase expenditure this year by 6 per cent.  Few independent commentators think that the actual increase will be as low as 9 per cent.</P>
    <P>The basic approach to controlling expenditure and creating employment is wrong.  The Government is concerned that expenditure in 1995 and 1996 will be greater than target which on budget day we were told had been achieved in respect of the current year.  No longer is there talk of the end of the century and the year 2010.  That is what we should think of.</P>
    <P>We have been promised cuts in public expenditure by curtailing employment in the public service.  It is hard to know whether this is a by-election promise and its timing would suggest that worse is to come.  In the silly season &mdash; August &mdash; I will pray for the people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Cutting back on employment in the public service would lead to a reduction in the number of jobs in that sector by at least 5 per cent per annum and, perhaps, considerably more.  The principle of controlling and pruning expenditure is the correct one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1537" /> Controlling payroll expenditure, however, does not involve examining the question of new recruits only but all jobs.</P>
    <P>Some Departments have existed since the establishment of the State.  During the years new Departments and ministries have been created and programme managers, committee chairmen and so on have been appointed.  Every year each Department applies for and obtains an increase.  This involves making sure all large allocations are spent regardless of whether this is necessary since otherwise the full increase requested will not be granted.  Asking for more than one needs and not coming up with any cost cutting suggestions would be dangerous.  Each penny of Government expenditure and the work of every single Government employee should be examined with one thing in mind: is this expenditure or job necessary and could resources be used to better effect elsewhere?  The less the State takes out of the economy the more opportunities there will be to create and maintain productive jobs.</P>
    <P>The lack of employment opportunities creates a vacuum that is filled by criminals thus placing a greater burden on those at work and their families. The State can assist business by providing various grants, aid and other incentives and through its taxation policies. The biggest part the Government can play is in questioning State expenditure, cutting it where it must be cut, facing the hard choices and reallocating resources not within Departments but within the public sector not hesitating to invest more resources where a return can be foreseen.</P>
    <P>During the course of a recent Adjournment debate I made positive and practical proposals as to how a small business could be assisted in creating more jobs.  Allowing small business companies to retain more of their profits would lead to the creation of <Col N="1538" /> more employment in the sector with a double benefit to the Exchequer.  As well as raising revenue by way of PAYE, PRSI, VAT and excise duties on items such as petrol and drink paid for by employees there would also be a saving in that, taking everything into account, the average unemployed person costs the State £3,800 per annum.</P>
    <P>The reply I received, while polite and thoughtful, is indicative of the Government's muddled thinking on how to support the small business sector and create employment.  I regard only one of the points raised as being of practical and immediate assistance and indicative of the Government's intent to take positive action promptly.  In fairness to the Minister for Finance, this year he reduced one of the taxes on employment, employer's PRSI.  I welcomed the Minister's proposal then and I call again for a further reduction in the 9 per cent PRSI rate by 1 per cent per annum for four years and a simultaneous increase in the threshold from £12,000 to £15,000.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Rourke referred to the textile industry.  As a result of the uncompetitive environment in which it operates &mdash; employers' PRSI is 5 per cent in the UK as against 9 per cent here &mdash; that industry is in crisis.  A special case must be made if it is to survive in the years ahead and create the necessary jobs.</P>
    <P>Apart from the PRSI change it was proposed that there would be a concerted programme to help small business in the creation of enterprise and employment by strengthening the Competition (Amendment) Bill; empowering the courts to impose fines on those found to be engaged in unfair competition; the exemption of most mergers and take-overs from scrutiny in the review of the Competition (Amendment) Bill, which is currently under way; recognition of services as an area with enormous potential for employment creation &mdash; that is under <Col N="1539" /> consideration; recognition that 80 per cent of the service sector is made up of small businesses.  If there is not a proper climate for investment there will be no hope for this sector.  I ask the Minister to consider the innovative and progressive findings of the report of the Task Force on Small Businesses.</P>
    <P>It was also proposed that an Oireachtas joint committee would be set up to examine and report on improving the operating environment for small business and services, with the final report due by March 1997.  A commitment was made to introduce long overdue legislation to enforce prompt payment by public bodies.  This is one matter that has caused major problems for small business.  Last year provision was made in the budget for a once-off payment to health boards so that they would be in a position to make payments within 30 days.  However, after short term relief, payments have again fallen overdue.  I appeal to the Minister to consider the position of small traders and businesses who experience great difficulties in receiving payments on time.</P>
    <P>It was proposed that information and advice on public service contracts should be provided to small business, and this matter is awaiting clearance from Brussels.  A scheme was proposed for the provision of long term, low cost financing.  It was agreed that reports of the Task Force on Small Business and Services would constitute a blueprint for the development of the small business sector.  This would of necessity entail a multi-annual perspective.</P>
    <P>An assurance was given that the Department of Enterprise and Employment and the industrial development agencies associated with it, including the county enterprise boards, would provide support and assistance in creating employment in the small business sector. A Chamber of Commerce of Ireland survey published in January of <Col N="1540" /> this year shows that many Irish businesses are dissatisfied with the level of support provided by the new county enterprise boards &mdash; 42 per cent of firms rated the county enterprise boards as unsatisfactory in terms of service.  Forbairt, IDA Ireland, the Irish Trade Board and CERT as well as the Revenue Commissioners received high satisfaction ratings for service.</P>
    <P>Excessive bureaucracy at central Government and lack of power at local level cause inefficiencies in the operation of county enterprise boards.  Much can be done at local level, but the whole system of local authority funding must be improved.  The 35 county enterprise boards were initially allocated £19.6 million for this year, an average of £560,000 per board.  This is the first full year of operation of county enterprise boards and the funding is inadequate. Job approvals amount to 5,280, including 4,250 full-time jobs.  This is very good value, particularly by comparison with the £81 million allocated to IDA Ireland and £50 million allocated to Forbairt. The enterprise boards were given a pivotal role in the promotion of small enterprises through an expanded range of initiatives.  Their duties include the provision of a broad range of supports to foster the enterprise culture.  In addition they must support, advise and encourage individual projects at the critical start-up stage, when major problems arise for small businesses and small industry generally.</P>
    <P>In launching the county enterprise boards in October 1993 Deputy Noel Treacy and particularly Deputy Albert Reynolds recognised that skills, energy and enthusiasm at local level could be harnessed to create jobs.  A sum of £150 million was envisaged for the scheme, of which £50 million would come from the public sector.  In the short time since the boards have been set up they have been regarded as an engine of job creation. There have been hiccups and even some failures.  There is a willingness to <Col N="1541" /> advance into unchartered waters and to take risks.  I have no doubt that the structures set up in 1993, however forward-thinking then, may still be improved upon and streamlined.  The boards need immediate funding to allow them to perform efficiently.  The allocation of £19.6 million this year is a big reduction on the 150 million envisaged.</P>
    <P>It is my understanding that the allocation to individual county boards and city area boards is being cut back and that they have been instructed not to approve any more projects.  There is much confusion about this matter and I ask the Minister to clarify it.  Is there a thinking in Government that county enterprise boards should be discontinued because of a lack of funding? Surely the boards could be streamlined at little or no cost.  Certainly the funds required should be taken from another less deserving allocation.  For example, the amount of money allocated to one boxing match in Cork, which was fully sold out, with television rights taken up by an international satellite broadcaster, would keep one enterprise board in operation for at least six months.  I must admit that the 30 minutes of boxing was most enjoyable, but the lack of adequate funding to county enterprise boards is unacceptable.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the money provided for the community employment scheme.  Were it not for the efforts of the spokesperson on Enterprise and Employment, Deputy O'Rourke, 40,000 people would not have been employed on this scheme.  It was the Government intention to reduce that figure by 7,000 to 33,000, saving the Exchequer a paltry £10 million.  Communities in every constituency were concerned about this matter, as is evidenced in Wicklow, particularly south Wicklow.  I am sure the Government will hear much more about this matter before the end of the week.</P>
    <P>There is great confusion about public expenditure.  This Government is on a <Col N="1542" /> rocky road to nowhere.  This is the Government that is going to bankrupt the country.  To the embarrassment of Deputy Bradford and members of the other Government parties who were present in Mallow yesterday, I stated that after five months in office this Government has wrecked the economy. Those views were expressed to me on the doorsteps in Wicklow on Saturday and Sunday.  People were frustrated and asked what is happening in the area of taxation and public expenditure.  I told them that the Government has lost the run of itself in managing the economy.</P>
    <P>For periods of five and seven years we were on the opposite side of the House, we put the economy right and perfected matters under the leadership of the former Taoisigh, Charles Haughey and Deputy Reynolds.  The Deputies opposite have wrecked the economy and frightened the people of Wicklow and elsewhere, but they will get their answers.</P>

      <P>Six days ago the Minister announced the take-over of the socks and underwear division of the Sunbeam industry in Blackpool in Cork, a modest but nonetheless welcome development. He committed £400,000 of taxpayers' money to a new company called Millfield Textiles Limited.  Since then he has persistently refused to reveal the identity of the new owners of the company. When pressed on the matter Forbairt explained that certain details of the <Col N="1543" /> package regarding the private investors remained to be finalised.  Can the Minister explain why £400,000 of taxpayers' money was approved before all details of the transaction were finalised?  That is not normal practice and I believe it is without precedent.  Why the panic?  Will the Minister concede that taxpayers have a right to know who are the recipients of their money?  Will he consider that members of the outgoing workforce and their union representatives have a right to know the names of the prospective employers?  Will he admit that, as a public representative, I have a right to demand on their behalf what conditions, if any, were attached to the Government grants, a right to seek assurance that this money will be invested in job creation, not asset enhancement?</P>
      <P>There is a clear perception that taxpayers' money, voted to create and maintain jobs in this industry, was not used for that specific purpose.  In that event the obligation to be open and accountable is even more urgent than in any other case.  The Minister has a clear obligation to spell out the conditions attached to the granting of the latest tranche of taxpayers' money.</P>
      <P>When I queried the identity of those people, I was told by the junior Minister, sitting beside the Minister, on a radio programme that nobody had inquired about the identity of the Pfizer Corporation when it moved into Cork. I put it to the Minister and the Minister of State that the position regarding Sunbeam is a far cry from the investment of the American Pfizer Corporation.</P>

      <P>The development at Sunbeam is welcome but modest.  In the week leading up to the announcement <Col N="1544" /> of the take-over of a division of that company, I was given the impression that there would be an investment of £1 million from the new investors in addition to a State grant of £400,000 and that 150 jobs would be saved.  That has not happened.</P>

      <P>I thank my colleague, Deputy Quill, for giving me the opportunity to contribute.  I speak on this issue from a national point of view and on behalf of Deputy Dan Wallace who wishes me to make the point that many concerned constituents who lost their jobs in Sunbeam telephoned him as they are concerned about their fate and the fate of the proposed 100 jobs for that company.  Indeed, Deputy Quill made many valid points.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have sought endlessly to secure information on that company from the Minister, but he has not given it.  When he responds will he tell me why he wishes to keep matters related to the IDA and Forbairt a secret to himself and his Department?  Will he also indicate why he has consistently failed in reply to written and oral parliamentary questions to give the facts to which I am entitled as my party's spokesperson on Enterprise and Employment?  The Minister has frequently told me that these are not matters I should know about and that they are private, but they are not as public money is being invested in firms.  Such matters are not investigated by a committee and there is no accountability regarding them.  I thought the Minister would be different and that he would want to explain matters.  I ask him when responding to give me the facts and to indicate why he cannot give the details of the jobs per business, what <Col N="1545" /> the IDA is doing with the taxpayers' money or to what forum it, Forfás and Forbairt can be made accountable to enable us, the representatives of the people, know to what use their money is being put.</P>

      <P>The proposed take-over of the Sunbeam operation was discussed in detail in the House on 15 June in the context of parliamentary questions relating to the clothing and textile sectors.  I advised the Deputy and the House on that occasion that a new company, Millfield Textiles Limited, would be formed which would take over Sunbeam's socks and underwear operations. The proposal was approved by the Forbairt board last week.  Forbairt advised me that all the promoters do not wish to be publicly identified at this stage.  I understand they are a group of Irish business people who have considerable experience in the textile sectors and general business.  They appointed Mr. Tom Hayden, one of those involved, as their spokesman.  Mr. Hayden is a former, non-executive director and a small minority shareholder in Sunbeam Industries and one of the members of the take-over group. Apart from Mr. Hayden the ownership and control of the new enterprise has passed to new promoters.  I understand that the new company will make an announcement in due course.  In the meantime Mr. Hayden proposes to meet the unions within the next few days to apprise them of developments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The condition attaching to the State grants being made available to the new company are contained in confidential legal agreements between Forbairt and the promoters and it has never been the convention to reveal such confidential commercial information to the House. Deputy O'Rourke is aware of that from her experience in the Department.  As I indicated, the issues are the day to day <Col N="1546" /> responsibility of Forbairt and the general disclosure of the specific details of the grant conditions of an individual company would not be helpful to the relevant State agencies in promoting the development of industry.  The Deputy knows this was the practice observed when she was in the Department.</P>

      <P>Thank you, Sir.  I understand from Forbairt that recruitment of up to 50 people will commence in July and as the market develops the new company intends to employ 100 people at full production.  I have also been advised that if the company's projected sale targets are exceeded this could lead to job opportunities in excess of those predicted.  While Millfield Textiles will operate in a difficult and highly competitive sector, I am confident that the combination of new enthusiastic management, equity backed by significant Forbairt support and the full co-operation of the workforce augurs well for the company's future.  I am sure those sentiments will be shared by all Members.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lawlor</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, Sir, for allowing me raise this matter.  I wish to highlight a sad and sorry mess created by the Minister of State, Deputy Burton, regarding the possible purchase by the State of the Shackleton Gardens at Beech Park, Clonsilla.  The Minister of State saw fit to telephone the &ldquo;Pat Kenny Show&rdquo; twice last week.  She made her first telephone call to the show on Wednesday.  The Shackleton <Col N="1548" /> family proposed to dispose of the holdings which were in their possession since 1919 by public auction the following day in order to satisfy family legal matters.</P>
      <P>The lands and gardens were withdrawn from public auction at £500,000 but when Mr. Jonathan Shackleton and his wife Daphne were being interviewed on the &ldquo;Pat Kenny Show&rdquo; on Wednesday, the Minister of State telephoned the show and stated that the State had decided to purchase the lands on a phased basis.  There was no such offer from the State.  Some months previously the State had offered £550,000 for the lands, increased its offer to £575,000 and then formally informed Lisney and Son that it was withdrawing its offer.</P>
      <P>During her Friday telephone call to the &ldquo;Pat Kenny Show&rdquo; the Minister of State was somewhat apologetic and defensive and Pat Kenny correctly requested her to be more specific about the State's intentions.  She stated that such negotiations were normally conducted in private.  Surely she was not conducting negotiations in private when she waxed eloquently on the airwaves on two occasions about the proposed purchase, when no formal offer was made by the State.  The Shackleton family are being forced to take legal advice on the mess and muddle created by the Minister of State.  As far as the Lucan Demense is concerned, she created a similar mess.  The State is at an advanced stage of negotiations for that demense, but after the Minister of State informed all and sundry that the State owned it many people invaded the property claiming that as the State owned it they were entitled to gain access to it.</P>
      <P>This is not a petty political point.  A report in last Saturday's issue of <i>The Irish Times</i> states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>According to Mr. Tom Day, a director of Lisney and Son, estate agents, the Office of Public Works is being &ldquo;unfair&rdquo; to the Shackleton family by offering to open negotiations <Col N="1549" /> for a phased purchase of the ...property rather than making a...bid.</P>
    <P>The report also states:</P>
    <P>Mr. Day said his company was willing to open negotiations with the State on behalf of the five owners of the property if a bid was made.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We will negotiate with anybody when we have an offer but, until an offer is made, there is nothing to talk about,&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>On Friday a senior official in the Office of Public Works informed me that the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht was endeavouring to cobble together a proposal.  The Minister of State's behaviour could prove expensive for the State.  She believes politics were invented when she was elected to the House, but she should note that one's first electoral success is one's easiest. Her endeavours to curry favour by making such announcements and distorting the position is despicable.  I hope the Minister of State present will give the facts regarding the purchase of the Shackleton properties.  Does the State propose to make an offer and, if so, will it improve on the bid made at the public auction?  The Minister of State's cheap political attempts at currying favour with the people of Dublin West in an irresponsible manner could result in the State being sued by the owners.  She should be more careful in her handling of such affairs.</P>

    <P>Briefly, the position is that the Shackleton property, consisting of a regency house with gardens of 1.5 acres and a four-acre arboretum set in some 60 <Col N="1550" /> acres of parkland, was offered for sale at public auction on 15 June 1995.  Prior to auction the desirability of the State acquiring this property was drawn to the Minister's attention by the Minister of State, Deputy Burton, and the State indicated its interest in acquiring the property subject to negotiation of acceptable terms and on the basis that any purchase price agreed would be paid over a period of years.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 19, 23, 34 and 85 together.</P>
      <P>I assume Deputies are referring to the proposed Strategy for the Development of the Forestry Sector to the Year 2015. This was not complete prior to the change of Government.  Consultants were appointed to assist in the task of formulating the plan in May 1994.  This phase of the work, which was scheduled to be completed by December 1994, has taken much longer than anticipated, with a knock-on effect on the overall timescale.</P>
      <P>I attach considerable importance to this strategic plan and to getting it right. It will be the first comprehensive and integrated programme for development of the entire forestry sector, from forest nurseries through growing and processing to timber end-uses and woodcrafts which has been produced in Ireland.  It will in essence provide the framework for development of the entire sector to the year 2015 and beyond.  Following consideration by Government, I expect to publish the plan in the coming months.</P>

      <P>I propose to take <Col N="1356" /> Questions Nos. 20, 37, 64 and 178 together.</P>
      <P>In any development project such as the proposed Masonite plant which involves State funding, there are clear distinctions between the grant aid aspects of the project, for which Government and Government Departments have responsibility, and the planning permission and appeals aspects which are clearly the responsibility of the planning authorities and An Bord Pleanála respectively.</P>
      <P>Forbairt investment in the project was approved by Government on 15 December 1994.  Approval was subject to a number of conditions including environmental aspects, which were required to be dealt with in the appropriate manner, that is, by the planning process.</P>
      <P>While the Minister for Enterprise and Employment has responsibility for industrial development in Ireland including the development of the saw-milling and downstream industries my Department was involved in the proposal in so far as the supply of raw material was concerned.  That Department consulted my Department on a continuous basis in relation to this project prior to the Government approval. I am satisfied that the level and extent of consultation with my Department in this particular instance was fully satisfactory and accorded with the responsibilities which fall within the ambit of my Department.</P>
      <P>The distinction between State funding and the planning process does not preclude any Minister in discharge of his/her statutory functions from availing of the planning process as would be the right of any other party.  In this particular case the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, availed of this right and, in doing so, it was not a requirement that he would consult with my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am pleased to note that the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, with whom I discussed the matter last week, has now been able to withdraw <Col N="1357" /> the objection he raised to this development.</P>

      <P>I have received no such representations from the Falmouth Port Authority.  The allegations of animal cruelty made by the UK official who boarded the ship in Falmouth for a very short period following the sudden death of the captain proved to be entirely without foundation and, indeed, have already been criticised by me as inaccurate and unhelpful.  The cattle in question were loaded under the supervision of my Department's veterinary inspectorate who were satisfied that the stocking density in the vessel was in accordance with the specifications of the Statutory Instrument and that there was adequate feeding and watering on board.  As the Deputy will be aware, it was subsequently established that all the cattle arrived safely and in good condition in Egypt without a single mortality and that this was additionally confirmed by <i>The Irish Times</i> journalist who was on board the vessel during that journey.</P>

      <P>Arrangements to implement the charter are already under way.  The commitment to operate a more extensive advice and help service in 1995 has been met. Officers of the Department were deployed locally to centres where they were available to explain rights and entitlements to farmers, so as to avoid errors when the farmers come to complete their applications.  Media advertising alerted farmers to the location of this facility in their own areas.  All the Department's offices will revert to full opening hours with effect from 1 September. Furthermore, with effect from 1 November, an information desk covering all aspects of the Department's schemes and services will be operated in all livestock and veterinary offices.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 24, 42, 66 and 175 together.</P>
      <P>The Operational Programme for Agriculture, Rural Development and Forestry under the 1994-1999 round of Structural Funds provides funding of approximately £195 million for on-farm capital investment.  About half of this has been earmarked for the scheme for the control of farm pollution.  I have already indicated that the overall level of funding provided for this scheme by the previous Government was inadequate. My plans are to make a strong case for extra funding for this very important scheme when the mid-term review of the Structural Funds gets under way in 1996.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the interim my officials are carrying out a detailed examination of all other schemes in the Operational Programme for Agriculture, Rural Development and Forestry to indentify where savings can be made.  I expect that this work will be completed by September. I am confident that this examination will enable me to make progress <Col N="1360" /> in 1995 on the remaining unapproved applications still on hands.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 25 and 79 together.</P>
      <P>I submitted a memorandum to Commissioner Fischler earlier this year setting out the problems associated with the eligible land rule and suggesting measures for resolution of the difficulties.</P>
      <P>The options which I suggested were: repeal of the eligible land rule in its entirely; amendment of the rule to exclude reference to permanent pasture; retention of the eligible land rule as an option for member states, with the possibility of applying it in whole or in part; and replacement of the existing historic reference period for determining eligibility, with a rolling reference period.  This would mean that land cultivated during the most recent five years would be eligible, with the reference period rolling forward by one year each year.</P>
      <P>I have since received a reply from Commissioner Fischler indicating that while he would be reluctant to repeal the eligible land rule at this stage, the question could be examined in a study of the arable support system which is to be carried out at the end of the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1361" /> The other suggestions I have made are still under consideration by the Commission.</P>
    <P>A recently introduced change to the eligible land rules, which will permit substitution of eligible land with ineligible land in certain circumstances within a holding, will go some way to relieving the problems being experienced by cereal producers.  The new rules are being examined in my Department with a view to assessing the types of situations in which this facility can be availed of.  Details will be announced in advance of the 1995 autumn sowings.</P>
    <P>On the question of set-aside, the rate of obligatory set-aside was reduced by 3 per cent for the current harvest year to 12 per cent for rotational set-aside and 17 per cent for non-rotational set-aside. The rates are likely to be considered again before the new season.  It is not open to me to vary these rates unilaterally. It is my intention, for the next sowing season, to reduce the rate of voluntary set-aside &mdash; that is set-aside which producers may undertake above the obligatory rates.  Member states are empowered to fix the level of voluntary set-aside within a maximum of 50 per cent.  The rate adopted in Ireland for this year was 30 per cent.  I intend to reduce this to a lower level for next year.  I will ensure that the rate to be fixed will be sufficient to provide flexibility for producers to enable whole fields to be set-aside, which may not be possible if the obligatory rates only were to be applied.</P>

    <P>The rules were the subject last week of a detailed briefing session between officials of my Department and representatives of the groups.  While we are prepared to look at a number of points which may cause difficulty for the groups in operational terms, the general thrust of them will not be diluted.  In particular the flexibility clause which operated in Leader I will not be restored.</P>
    <P>The detailed rules have been compiled to take account of the European Commission requirements for Leader II, our own experience of operating the pilot programme, the independent evaluation of that programme and the Comptroller and Auditor General's recent value for money report.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that not all the rules are palatable for the groups but in the interests of good management, accountability, value for money and transparency, I am satisfied that the thrust of the rules which have now been specified is correct and will be maintained.</P>

      <P>The Irish Government made submissions to the EU Commission on the extension of the disadvantaged areas and reclassification of certain areas from less severely to more severely handicapped area status in November 1993 and October 1994 respectively.  The Commission asked for clarification of some aspect of the submissions and for some additional information to assist in its examination of the proposals, and our response was transmitted to the Commission on 14 April 1995.</P>
      <P>I met with Commissioner Fischler in February 1995 and again in May 1995 to stress the urgency of a decision on these submissions, and he assured me that he will attempt to secure a decision on both extension and reclassification in 1995, during the summer period if possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Officials of my Department will be meeting with Commission officials later this month to resolve any remaining difficulties with the proposals.  The reclassification proposal can then be approved by the Commission.  However, the extension proposal must also be approved by the Council of Ministers after consultation with the European <Col N="1365" /> Parliament, so it is not possible to say when an announcement of the new areas will be made.</P>

      <P>I am examining every aspect of the fines which the Commission Services has proposed to levy on Ireland in respect of beef intervention in 1990 and 1991, with a view to minimising the amount of the fines and to avoiding the cost falling on the Exchequer.  As part of that examination, I have asked my officials to discuss with Forbairt the position regarding grants, both national and EU, in the beef sector and these discussions are continuing.  No grants have been paid for slaughtering for some years because of slaughtering overcapacity and Forbairt has recently decided to suspend grants for boning halls because capacity is now adequate.</P>

      <P>I have no plans to develop existing available technology for slurry injection on a commercial basis.  However, there is ongoing research by Teagasc and researchers in other countries on methods of overcoming odour nuisance and ammonia emissions to the atmosphere from the spreading of slurries.</P>
      <P>The use of injection equipment in Ireland has a number of disadvantages compared to the conventional splash plate system including higher equipment costs and the stony nature of Irish soils.  Injection of slurries on a commercial basis in this country is a slow procedure with the technology now available. It is, however, hoped that research will lead to improved technology for this purpose.</P>
      <P>Problems of odour nuisance from conventional spreading systems could be reduced by farmers if spreading operations are undertaken in accordance with codes of good agricultural practice for the land spreading of farm waste.</P>

    <P>Most imports and agri-food products into the Union until the year 2000 will be governed by the various GATT import commitments undertaken by the Union.</P>
    <P>Another factor influencing Union imports over the coming years will be the bilateral trade and co-operation agreements either currently in place or envisaged with various trading partners. I will continue to press that these agreements will take account of the particular sensitivity of agricultural markets.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 53, 54, 60, 188 and 189 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware of the growing use of plastic wrapped silage by farmers and the problems which the disposal of such plastic can create.  My officials advise farmers to collect and store all plastic <Col N="1375" /> on the farm and reuse as much of it as possible.  Plastic film used to bale silage cannot be reused and should be disposed of in approved landfill sites.  In this regard, participants in the rural environment protection scheme &mdash; REPS &mdash; operated by my Department are required to dispose of all unusable plastic in this manner.</P>
    <P>A study carried out under the STRIDE Operational Programme for Ireland 1991-1993 into the feasibility of recycling plastic sheeting used in the agricultural sector established that the heavy contamination of such material when used in agriculture mitigates against successful recycling.  The study concluded that under current economic conditions, including poor market outlets, variation of degree of contamination and high waste collection costs polythene film recycling is not economically viable.  The study also showed that of the 33,000 metric tonnes of plastic waste produced in Ireland each year 4,000 tonnes is plastic wrap for agriculture.</P>
    <P>I have no plans for further research into this subject at present.</P>

      <P>I am committed to providing an effective, efficient and streamlined service to farmers for all schemes operated by the Department including payment of headage and premia grants.  The charter of rights for farmers which was published on 20 April sets out clear target dates for payments. To facilitate earlier payment in 1995 it was decided to bring forward the application period for the EU disadvantaged areas' cattle headage and the EU suckler cow premium schemes from June to May.  This decision was taken in full consultation with the main farming organisations and the decision was initially announced on 10 April 1995.  A further announcement was made on 9 May.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In accordance with a commitment in the charter, application forms for this year's cattle schemes were reviewed again in consultation with the farming organisations and composite application <Col N="1377" /> forms, covering the EU disadvantaged areas cattle schemes and the EU suckler cow premium schemes have been introduced. This will lead to much less paperwork for applicants and will streamline the processing of applications in my Department.</P>
    <P>Application forms were available in the Department's local offices from 9 May while there was some delay in posting application forms directly to farmers the vast bulk of posted forms were with applicants for up to two weeks before the closing date of 31 May 1995.</P>
    <P>Under EU regulations, a closing date for receipt of completed application forms must be set.  In Ireland's case the closing date was 31 May and application forms received after that date but before 21 June are subject to a late application penalty.  Applications received after 21 June cannot be considered for payment.  The closing date forms part of the terms and conditions governing entry to the scheme and it is incumbent on my Department to adhere to that date.  To do otherwise would create problems with the EU Commission and could ultimately lead to EU disallowances.  I have no proposals to alter the closing date of 31 May 1995.</P>

This approach has been taken to ensure equality of treatment across all counties. Work is in progress on the processing of these applications.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the concerns expressed by Egypt about the suspension of exports of live cattle beyond the Mediterranean, following a review of the welfare aspects of trade to North Africa and the Middle East.  My paramount concern is to ensure the welfare of the animals being shipped long distances in a climate to which they are not accustomed.  I have recently agreed to two trial shipments to Saudi Arabia which will, it is hoped, give valuable information on the acceptability of the trade.  In the circumstances, I do not see the need for a visit to Egypt.</P>

      <P>The charter of rights for farmers states that the objective is to make payments under the <Col N="1381" /> slaughter premium scheme within 60 days of application.  In general this target is being achieved in non-problem cases and there has been a considerable advance in the payment situation by comparison with previous years.</P>
      <P>Payments under the 1995 slaughter premium schemes commenced on 20 April, over two months ahead of the commencement date of 30 June which applied in 1994.  To date, 7,368 of the 12,418 applicants have been paid premium totalling some £4.65 million.</P>
      <P>Every effort is being made to further improve the delivery of slaughter premium payments with the view to achieving the charter of rights commitment in full.  The payment situation has, however, improved very significantly in 1995 given that a comparable level of payment was only achieved in early September under the 1994 scheme.</P>

      <P>Four random samples have been taken from show animals in the past year; all were negative for the presence of illegal growth promoters.</P>
      <P>The overall objective of my Department in the enforcement of the ban on growth promoters is to protect human health and Ireland's beef industry.  To this end, duly authorised personnel of my Department carry out intensive investigations at farm and factory level as well as among distributors of veterinary medicines to eradicate the use of growth promoters.  I consider that this strategy is bearing fruit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Given the many other duties which <Col N="1382" /> have to be carried out by the officers and laboratories concerned, I do not consider that it would be a justifiable use of resources to divert them to testing animals at fatstock shows.  If the organisers of fatstock shows consider testing for illegal growth promoters is desirable to ensure fair competition, it is open to them to have samples taken on their own behalf and to have them tested at one of a number of laboratories which engage in residue analysis.</P>
    <P>It is normal practice for departmental personnel to be present at fatstock shows.  Should a particular animal give rise to a suspicion that illegal growth promoters may have been used, follow up action will be taken.  If the evidence warrants, criminal proceedings would be instituted against any person found to be using illegal growth promoters.</P>

      <P>EU Directive 92/102 on the identification and registration of animals in the context of intra-Community trade, requires that bovine animals carry identification marks meeting certain requirements. These specify, <i>inter alia,</i> that the animal's eartag must be applied within 30 days of birth and that this must be done at the holding of birth.  The eartag must be easy to read for the animal's lifetime and the information code on it must be such that the holding of birth on which the animal was born can be identified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The EU legislation on the payment of livestock aid schemes also requires that <Col N="1383" /> animals must be identified in accordance with the above mentioned Directive.</P>
    <P>At present all animals in Ireland are identified with a small metal tag which is applied by veterinary practitioners under the disease eradication schemes arrangements.  That tag, whilst quite successful and appropriate for the purposes of those schemes, is not capable of meeting some of the requirements of Directive 92/102.  It is necessary therefore to introduce a new national identify system for animals which will involve the use of easier to read tags which farmers will be required to insert in their animals within 30 days of birth.  It is considered that plastic tags would best meet these requirements.</P>
    <P>In a situation like this, it is prudent to envisage a transition period during which both old and new tagging systems will run in tandem until such time as the new system is working satisfactorily.  It is intended that the overlap will be as short as possible and any unnecessary cost will be avoided.</P>

      <P>My Department is interested in promoting the non-food use of farm crops, in order to maximise the potential of our natural resources and enhance the rural economy.  The production of bio-diesel from oilseeds grown on set-aside ground is of particular interest.  <i>Camelina sativa</i> is an oilseed crop which has been relatively unexplored to date.  Teagasc has an ongoing research programme with a view to <Col N="1384" /> establishing its yield potential and quantity and quality of the oil.</P>
      <P>Results to date indicate that the crop has good yield potential in Ireland and that it could be used for food and non-food purposes including biofuel.  <i>Camelina sativa</i> has advantages over rapeseed in respect of its agronomic characteristics and oil quality.  Its ability to produce acceptable yields with relatively low fertiliser and chemical inputs is a distinct advantage.  In general it is one of the most promising alternative crops which are presently under investigation by Teagasc.</P>

      <P>Under the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964, the mother and father of a child born in wedlock are its joint guardians, subject to any qualifying court order.  To safeguard the rights of parents as laid down in this Act, the Passport Office normally requires the written witnessed consent of both parents when a passport application is made for a person under 18 years of age.  The courts have recognised this to be a prudent practice.</P>
      <P>Special circumstances apply if one of the parents has died and the Passport Office must have regard to the terms of the Guardianship of Infants Act in this situation also.  The Act provides for the right of a parent to appoint by deed or will a person to act as guardian of his or her child in the event of the parent's death.  Such a person, known as a testamentary guardian, acts jointly with the surviving parent.</P>
      <P>The Passport Office is not automatically aware of situations where a testamentary guardian has been appointed. Accordingly, if a passport application is submitted with the consent of one parent only, on the basis that the other parent is deceased, it is the practice of the Passport Office to ask the parent to sign an affidavit to the effect that she/he is the sole legal guardian and that no other person has been appointed a guardian by the courts or by operation of law.</P>
      <P>The Passport Office is always anxious not to put applicants to any unnecessary inconvenience and the request for an affidavit in these circumstances is designed solely to ensure the level of protection provided for in the Guardianship of Infants Act.</P>

      <P>Tax relief for non-reimbursable medical expenses is intended to alleviate the hardship caused to taxpayers by the expense incurred as a result of non-routine non-reimbursable expenditure arising from disability or illness.  Section 12 of the Finance Act, 1967, therefore excludes routine maternity care, which is defined as</P>
      <P>(i)  care which is received by a woman in respect of a pregnancy otherwise than as a patient maintained in a hospital, or</P>
      <P>(ii)  care which is received by a woman in respect of a pregnancy as a patient maintained in a hospital where the total length of the period or periods during which she is so maintained is not more than 14 days or during the first 14 days of such maintenance where the total length of such period or periods is more than 14 days.</P>
      <P>Thus, relief is allowed under the Act for what might be described as non-routine expenditure in connection with a pregnancy, namely expenditure incurred in respect of days as a patient in hospital in excess of 14 days.  The days do not have to be consecutive.</P>
      <P>The Government is committed to the maintenance of the core element of the medical expenses relief which is designed to alleviate the hardship which could otherwise arise for taxpayers because of unforeseeable costs of medical care incurred as a result of disability or illness.  The extension of the relief to cover routine expenses, including the costs of routine maternity care, would go beyond the basic intention of the relief and I have no plans to extend the relief in this way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would draw the Deputy's attention to the fact that all maternity care services in public maternity hospitals, <Col N="1390" /> including pre- and post-natal care, are provided free of charge.</P>

      <P>The Vehicle Registration Tax (Permanent Reliefs) Regulations, 1993 were made to give effect to the reliefs contained in section 134 of the Finance Act, 1992.  Under the terms of these regulations a vehicle may be registered without payment of vehicle registration tax if it is the personal property of a private individual transferring his normal residence to the State and has been in the possession of and used by him outside the State for a period of at least six months before the date on which he ceases to have his normal residence outside the State.  Evidence must be supplied to the Revenue Commissioners within one month of the date of the application for relief that the requirements have been satisfied.</P>
      <P>The person concerned applied for relief from VRT under the transfer of residence provisions.  He was advised of the evidence required to substantiate his claim.  This evidence comprised proof of him having had his normal residence abroad for at least six months after the acquisition of the vehicle and proof of using the vehicle outside the State during the same period.  As the evidence requested was not produced the application was refused and the means of appealing against the decision were outlined to him.  The applicant then paid the appropriate VRT.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that they are satisfied that the person concerned was aware of the nature of the evidence required to support his claim and that he had been given reasonable opportunity to produce this evidence.  In the circumstances the Commissioners are satisfied <Col N="1391" /> the VRT was correctly payable.  It is open to the person concerned to appeal the decision to the Vehicle Registration Tax Section, Bridgend, County Donegal and if his appeal is successful the VRT paid will be refunded to him.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> I understand the company has an interest in the purchase of the private hospital at Ely in Wexford for use as a private facility.  The Order of St. John of God indicated that it was willing to sell the property to the South Eastern Health Board.  The board and the Department of Health were anxious to ensure this provided value for money, as opposed to building on a green field site and it was necessary to have the site surveyed and valued.  It is also necessary to make provision for the transfer of the acute hospital service from Ely to Wexford General Hospital where some building work will be required.</P>
      <P>As soon as the Department of Health was satisfied the building was fully suitable for the purposes intended and that the purchase price of £1.5 million represented good value for money the Department of Health authorised the health board to negotiate the purchase of the hospital at Ely from the Order at a cost of up to £1.5 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At no time did the Minister for Health enter into direct negotiations with the Order on the purchase of the hospital at Ely for the health board.  All negotiations took place between the <Col N="1393" /> health board and the Order.  At no time did the Minister or the Department of Health authorise any increase on the figure originally envisaged as a reasonable purchase price for the hospital at Ely, £1.5 million.  Any suggestion that the Minister for Health entered into negotiations with the Order or used information received in confidence to set the level of offer to be made by the health board is totally incorrect.  A written withdrawal of the assertion made in the letter referred to by the Deputy is being sought and failure by the company to comply with this request will be regarded as grounds for appropriate legal action.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> In the first instance, responsibility for the provision of long-stay accommodation for the elderly lies with the health boards.</P>
      <P>The report <i>The Years Ahead &mdash; A Policy for the Elderly,</i> published in 1988, recommended that existing geriatric hospitals/homes, long-stay district hospitals and welfare homes be developed as community hospitals, where appropriate, to provide a range of services for the elderly and their carers.  The health strategy published last year, builds on this recommendation and provides for the building of eight small-scale nursing units in the community by the end of 1997 to replace unsuitable accommodation and to meet the needs of the expanding population of older people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am committed to a capital programme over the next few years which will improve long-stay health board care facilities for the elderly in each of the eight boards.  I am currently considering a number of proposals from the health boards regarding the development of new and the re-organisation of existing units for the elderly.  New or improved accommodation will normally be provided in the community with close links to the specialist departments of medicine for the elderly in general hospitals. <Col N="1395" /> The number of storeys of accommodation for the elderly depends on a variety of factors, such as the lay-out of the site, the level of dependency of the elderly and the planning requirements of the relevant local authority.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> St. Mary's Orthopaedic Hospital, Cappagh has indicated that the patient in question is due to be called for admission to the hospital's assessment unit on 3 July 1995.  In this unit a patient's fitness for surgery is determined and generally takes place two to three weeks before the operation is scheduled.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that the admission of a patient to hospital is a matter for the consultant concerned and each patient is assessed to determine his or her medical priority.  Should the patient feel concerned that her condition has deteriorated, she should return to her medical practitioner who is in the best position to emphasise the urgency of her case directly to the consultant.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may be aware that, under the 1994 Waiting List Initiative, a total of £500,000 was allocated to St. Mary's Orthopaedic Hospital, Cappagh for the provision of 270 additional orthopaedic procedures and these targets were achieved.  This should reduce the overall waiting time for patients in this speciality.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> Under the Health Act, 1970 medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board, are unable, without undue hardship, to provide general practitioner services for themselves and their dependants.</P>
      <P>Income guidelines are drawn up by the chief executive officers to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility. These guidelines are revised annually in line with the Consumer Price Index.  However, these guidelines are not statutorily binding and, even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, that person may still be awarded a medical card if the chief executive officer considers that the person's medical needs or other circumstances would so justify.</P>
      <P>A medical card normally covers the card holder, his or her spouse and any children under 16.  It also covers any persons over 16 who are dependent on the medical card holder.</P>
      <P>Persons aged 16 to 25 who are dependants of a person who is not a medical card holder, are not normally entitled to a medical card except where they have an entitlement under EC Regulations or where they are in receipt of a disabled person's maintenance allowance.  The decision on whether or not a person is regarded as a dependant or as being financially independent is made by the chief executive officer of the health board on the basis of the circumstances of each individual case. Those who are financially independent are entitled to apply for a medical card in their own right and are assessed on the same criteria as all other applicants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1401" /> It is open to all persons, be they parents or students, to apply to the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board for health services if they are unable to provide these services for themselves or their dependants without hardship.  I am satisfied that health boards give sympathetic consideration to such applications when the circumstances warrant it.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> The administration of the system for the registration of marriages is statutorily a matter for An tArd-Chláraitheoir &mdash; Registrar-General &mdash; of marriages and for local registrars who operate under his general direction.</P>
      <P>An tArd-Chláraitheoir has advised that the marriage in question has not been registered.  The marriage in question is not registrable under the Registration of Marriages (Ireland) Act 1863 which provides for the registration of Roman Catholic marriages, nor is it registrable under any of the provisions for the registration of marriages other than Roman Catholic marriages.  While registration in the various marriage registers is restricted to marriages which may be lawfully solemnised in Ireland, the absence of registration does not necessarily imply that a particular marriage is invalid.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht (Mr. M. Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>As previously stated by me in the Adjournment Debate on 14 June 1995, I support and have consistently supported the proposal to provide a fibre board manufacturing plant in Leitrim.  I welcome an industry which will use local materials and create much needed jobs in the region.  However, as Minister with responsibility for waterways, my concerns in respect of the siting of the plant related to its possible adverse impact on the visual amenity and on the tourist potential of the Shannon navigation. Leitrim deserves and needs to benefit from both forestry and tourism-related job creation.</P>
      <P>The decision in regard to this plant was taken in December 1994 at a Government meeting, a Government of which I was not a member.  My Department was not consulted by the Department of Enterprise and Employment, the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry or Forbairt in relation to the proposal and only became aware of it as a result of an article published in <i>The Irish Times</i> on 30 May 1995.</P>
      <P>My Department sought advice from the Wateways Service and from the National Heritage Council.  I personally became aware on Friday 9 June 1995 on the basis, in particular, of architectural advice, that the development could have a significant visual impact on the Shannon navigation.  There was insufficient time to communicate my concerns to Leitrim County Council, to Forbairt or to Masonite prior to the last day for submission of objections to An Bord Pleanála, which was also Friday 9 June 1995.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am pleased to advise the Deputies that, following consultations between representatives of my Department and the Masonite Corporation, I am satisfied that the additional amelioration measures proposed by the Company, which will encompass further mounding, <Col N="1404" /> landscaping and a 5 to 6 metre reduction in the ridge height of the main building, address my concerns.  Accordingly, I have withdrawn my objection.</P>

      <P>The developers of the project to which the Deputy refers have applied for funding under the cultural development incentives scheme 1994-1999.  This scheme has been over-subscribed.  The process of evaluation of projects has been made complex by both the quantity and quality of the applications received.  Due to the number and complexity of the applications I have decided to begin the detailed evaluation process by concentrating on evaluating and assessing those applications received from the priority zones and centres of excellence as identified in the <i>Arts Plan 1995-1997.</i> The priority zones are the counties of Laois, Wicklow, Donegal, Longford, Westmeath, Offaly, Leitrim, Tipperary and Roscommon and the centres of excellence are the cities of Galway, Cork, Limerick and Waterford.</P>

      <P>As stated in reply to Question No. 54 of 9 May 1995, a revised preliminary report for a new water scheme to serve Ashbourne has been submitted to my Department.  The revised report costs the proposal at £2.61 million which corresponds to the maximum sum allocated for the scheme by my Department in a letter of 28 March 1994 to the Meath county manager.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1408" /> I have already drawn attention to measures which have subsequently been completed to improve the water supply to Ashbourne.  These include the development of a borehole source, the installation of a filtration plant and a chlorine residual unit; all of these works are reported to be operating effectively. In addition, my Department has recently suggested to Meath County Council that improvement of the Dunboyne water supply should be pursued independently of the major Ashbourne proposal.</P>
    <P>In these changed circumstances, and given the many demands on the allocation for water and sewerage services both in County Meath and nationally, I am not in a position to say when approval may issue to the Ashbourne water proposal.</P>

      <P>There are no proposals to amend the terms of the new tenant purchase scheme as recently announced in <i>Social Housing &mdash; The Way Ahead.</i>  This scheme offers more affordable purchase terms to tenants by increasing the discounts and including a shared ownership option.  It does not require any tenant purchase to get mortgage finance from a private sector financial institution. The discounts available under the new scheme have been increased by <Col N="1410" /> £3,000 for most tenants which is equivalent to a reduction of some £7 a week in mortgage repayments on an ordinary purchase at the current interest rates. Under shared ownership, the outgoings would be reduced by a further £10 per week in the case of a tenant of 10 years' standing purchasing a £25,000 house. Any tenant purchaser may, under either option, obtain mortgage finance from the local authority; in the case of an ordinary purchase he-she also has the choice of getting such finance from a commercial financial institution.</P>

      <P>When I met my Northern Ireland counterpart.  Mr. Malcolm Moss, MP, at the Anglo Irish Intergovernmental Conference on 14 February last to discuss cross-Border roads issues, we took particular account of the special importance of the Dublin-Belfast route and agreed a two-stage approach to its <Col N="1413" /> improvement: in the short term, measures to improve the traffic capacity and safety of the existing Newry-Dundalk route will be considered; a joint study will be carried out to identify longer-term options for the upgrading of the Newry-Dundalk section, taking account of environmental factors, planned improvements elsewhere on the route and the spending priorities of two Governments.</P>
      <P>Officials met in April to discuss arrangements for this study.  There are plans for a further meeting at official level later this month at which I expect terms of reference to be agreed, subject to the approval of both Ministers.</P>
      <P>I understand that work on both the Balbriggan and Dunleer-Dundalk bypasses is expected to start this year.</P>

      <P>The carrying out of housing development by a local authority in its functional area is exempted development under the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963. However, section 3 of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1993 specifically provides for an alternative procedure in the case of certain classes of development by local authorities.</P>
      <P>Effect is given to the provision in the 1993 Act by Part X of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Regulations, 1994, under which local authorities are obliged to give public notice of, <i>inter alia</i>, a proposal to construct or erect a house or other dwelling.  Submissions or observations dealing with the proper planning and development of the area concerned must be sought in regard to the proposed development and the plans must be available for inspection by the public during a period of not less than one month.</P>
      <P>Following the period allowed for submissions or observations, a report must be prepared regarding the details of the proposal and this must include details on any submissions or observations received in relation to it.  The report must be submitted to the elected members of the local authority who have the discretion, under section 3 of the Local Government Act, 1955, to direct that the proposed development is not to proceed.</P>
      <P>I believe that this is an open and democratic procedure and I have no plans at present to introduce any changes to it.</P>

      <P>The average all-in cost nationally of providing a standard three bedroomed local authority house in 1994 is estimated at £40,000.  From the information available to my Department, the lowest cost in 1994 for such a house was about £30,000, and the highest was £79,000, approximately, for a house in an inner city scheme in Dublin city.  Costs for standard three bedroomed local authority houses in the Dublin region and in the county borough areas were at the upper end of the range (up to £60,000) and those for most of the county council areas were at the lower end, generally between £30,000 and £40,000.</P>
      <P>Last February, I fixed unit cost limits for two, three and four bedroomed houses in the case of all local authorities in order to speed up the implementation of the local authority housing programme by reducing the number of submissions for specific Departmental approval.  The unit cost limits for Dublin Corporation are £50,000, £56,000 and £59,000 for two, three and four bedroomed houses, respectively.  If the corporation can provide houses at or below these cost limits, they are free to seek and accept tenders provided approved house plans are used, the layout plan conforms to the Department's guidelines, and the lowest valid tender is accepted.  If costs exceed these limits generally or for an individual scheme, the corporation can apply to my Department for an increase in the limits generally or in the case of that scheme, setting out the circumstances and the reasons for the higher costs; any such applications will be considered on their merits.</P>

    <P>As I informed the House in reply to <Col N="1429" /> Priority Question No. 4 of 8 June 1995, I am at present reviewing the whole question of the payment of debts and fines.  In particular, I indicated that I was examining a system of attachment of income where a court could order fines or debts to be deducted from a person's income.  This would be intended to ensure the collection of the amount due in a way which would be manageable for the debtor (or offender) and avoid the option of imprisonment.</P>
    <P>I also informed the House that the various options would require legislation and that, when my examination of all the issues had been concluded, I would waste no time in bringing forward any proposals for legislative change which I and the government believed was desirable.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 166 and 167 together.</P>
      <P>The Government is committed to the promotion of occupational pensions. There are some 500,000 people approximately who are members of occupational pension schemes and we would like to see this number grow.  Pension funds are a very successful vehicle for savings for workers to provide for themselves and their families and with assets of almost £14 billion they make a very important contribution to the economy. The tax treatment of occupational pension schemes, which is the responsibility of my colleague the Minister for Finance, has had a strong positive influence on the development of occupational pension schemes over the years.</P>
      <P>On a number of occasions recently I have drawn attention to the demographic patterns which indicate a considerable increase in the proportion of elderly people in the population over the first half of the next century.  This will have a significant impact on the future costs of social welfare pensions, which are set to increase by some 100 per cent by the year 2035.  At the same time the ratio of persons in the economically active age group to those over age 65 is projected to fall.  This would result, in the absence of any change, in an increasing burden of the cost of pensions falling on future generations of PRSI contributors and taxpayers.</P>
      <P>These are important factors in any consideration of the development of future pension arrangements and raise serious questions, which must be addressed, about the capacity of the present financing arrangements to meet these emerging costs.  The pensions industry is also placing considerable emphasis on these issues at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1432" /> The final report of the National Pensions Board <i>Developing the National Pension System</i> raised and considered these issues.</P>
    <P>This report is being considered within my Department at present and I intend to bring forward, in due course, proposals based on the recommendations of the report.</P>
    <P>In this context, a major survey of occupational pension schemes, which was recommended in the National Pensions Board report has been commissioned and will be available next year.  The last major survey was carried out in 1985 and the results of the new survey, which is being financed mainly by my Department, will give essential up to date information on occupational cover, which will be of considerable assistance when proposals in relation to pensions are being formulated.</P>
    <P>I have also stated frequently in recent times that demands to abolish or significantly reduce contributions to the Social Insurance Fund are short sighted given the demands which are currently being placed on it and which will grow in the years ahead.  We must preserve the principle of solidarity embodied in the PRSI system if we are to guarantee pensions needed in the future due to the ageing of the population.</P>
    <P>It should be stressed that there is no danger to anyone's pension entitlement. However, as I pointed out earlier this is an issue which we cannot afford to ignore.  Provided that, over the next few years, we face up to the needs we know will arise because of the demographic changes, we can plan to deal with them in an orderly and effective way.</P>

      <P>Golf has become one of the fastest growing outdoor activities in Ireland over the past number of years. In this context, the development and promotion of golf tourism has been a major product success and this has resulted in an increasing number of overseas holiday-makers playing golf in Ireland.  Numbers have risen from 95,000 in 1989, to over 170,000 in 1994.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland now has a considerable number of golf courses, due to the unprecedented investment that has been made in our golfing product since 1989. Therefore, the emphasis now is on attracting more golfing visitors to Ireland through marketing the superb asset that has been created on the basis of quality, value for money, accessibility, and a friendly welcome.  Accordingly, under the Operational Programme for Tourism 1994-1999, only a small amount of funds are being made available, on an exceptional basis, to assist the development of a limited number of new championship courses in remote areas where they could become the catalyst to encourage tourism development.  The provision or improvement of visitor and learner <Col N="1434" /> facilities in Bord Fáilte branded courses, which have not received assistance for such improvements under the last Operational Programme, will also be supported.</P>
    <P>Decisions on grant applications under the programme are made by autonomous management boards which include not only the State sector, but also independent professionals.  The essential criteria on which these boards judge applications for assistance is their ability to attract foreign visitors, to increase tourist earnings, and to create sustainable long term employment.</P>
    <P>It is, of course, impossible to say which golf courses might benefit from grant assistance under the operational programme until such time as the appropriate management board has made its decision on each individual application in line with the criteria laid down in the Programme.  Accordingly, I have no function in the matter.</P>

      <P>Firstly, I would like to point out that a distinction must be made between the State funding aspects of industrial development projects and the subsequent planning permission process.  The grant recommended by Forbairt in this case required the approval of the Government. My Department examined the proposal and the matter was submitted to and received Government approval.</P>
      <P>Government approval of the Forbairt investment in the Masonite project was subject to a number of conditions including conditions relating to environmental aspects.  Such conditions are standard in Forbairt grant agreements. It was accepted, too, that an Environmental Impact Statement would be required by the planning authority and that the project would also require an Integrated Pollution Control Licence from Environmental Protection Agency.  It was not, however, possible to be more precise at the time that the proposal was considered by the Government about the actual environmental issues until such time as the promoters set the planning process in train with the local planning authorities.  They did this, in the normal way, once they had got the &ldquo;green light&rdquo; of grant approval.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department and the industrial development agencies have no statutory <Col N="1436" /> role in the planning process.  However, Forbairt and Forfás did, in accordance with their usual practice, assist Masonite in discussions with the relevant authorities in the course of the participation of the company's planning application.</P>
    <P>I am advised, too, that Forbairt, Environmental Services Department, Glasnevin was retained, by Masonite, as an independent consultant, to prepare the Environmental Impact Statement relating to the proposed development.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to note that the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht has obtained the reassurances he required and has been able to withdraw his objections and I can assure the House that Forbairt will continue to provide all possible assistance in an effort that this important project can proceed without delay.</P>

      <P>Following the challenge in the High Court to the division of commonage lands at Glenamadoo and Bunahowna, work on the compulsory division of commonage lands was suspended.  However, work on voluntary division of commonage, that is where all of the shareholders agree to division, is not affected and is progressing at a satisfactory rate.  In this regard it is worth noting that between 1983 and 1992 only 54 of the 417 applications for commonage division have been for compulsory division.</P>
      <P>In 1992 in the Glenamadoo and Bunahowna case the judicial commissioner directed that certain matters, including the question of compliance with planning legislation, should be clarified before the case was returned to the High Court.  The matter was referred to An Bord Pleanála, and its decision, which was delivered in 1993, was appealed to the High Court.  The result of this appeal must be considered by the judicial commissioner before the original appeal is resolved.  This is the first time that the legislation used in the compulsory division of commonages has been referred to the judicial commissioner and I propose to have the policy and procedures used in these cases reassessed in the light of the judgement of the court.  Pending receipt of the final judgment of the Judicial Commissioner action on compulsory division of commonage lands must remain suspended.</P>

      <P>I am conscious of the importance of protection of watercourses from pollution for the development of water based tourism activities including angling.  While primary responsibility for the protection of watercourses rests with the Department of the Environment and local authorities my Department has provided considerable assistance to farmers to tackle pollution problems on their farms.  Grant aid has been provided towards the cost of investments in improved housing and waste storage facilities on farms.  Over £170 million in grant aid has been paid over the past five years alone for pollution works on some 30,000 farms under the previous control of farmyard pollution scheme and farm improvement programme.  In addition a significant proportion of the approximately £195 million allocated for on-farm investment in the 1994-99 period is for pollution control investments. I have already announced that I am taking steps to secure extra funding for the control of farm pollution scheme over this period.</P>
      <P>While the provision of pollution control facilities have the potential to significantly reduce pollution from farms, these must be accompanied by effective management practices for the handling and safe disposal of farm waste.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1446" /> Responsibility in this regard rests with farmers.  Teagasc and the local authorities provide advice and assistance to farmers in this regard.  I might add that considerable progress has been made in recent years in reducing pollution particularly point source incidents of farm pollution.  This improvement is reflected in a reduction in the number of serious incidents of farm pollution of watercourses and fish kills.  I am confident that the position will be further improved over the coming years.</P>

The remainder are for redundant or spent industrial sources.  Such sources are widely used as control devices in manufacturing process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The further, more detailed, information sought by the Deputy cannot be <Col N="1447" /> easily reproduced and, accordingly, I have asked the RPII to forward the information to the Deputy at the earliest opportunity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Lowry)</NameTxt>
      <P>The radioactive waste in question is in the form of dust arising from the melting down in 1990 of a consignment of imported scrap steel which unknowingly contained a gauge incorporating a radioactive source.  The dust in question is stored, under licence issued by the Radiological Protection Institute, in an old munitions store on Rocky Island which forms part of the premises of Irish Steel.  The storage conditions are regularly inspected by the institute, with the last inspection being carried out in June 1994, at which time it was noted that the waste was been held in safe and secure storage in a locked store as required by a condition of the licence. The institute was satisfied then that, as long as the storage conditions obtained, the dust would not present a hazard to individuals or the environment.  The institute was, therefore, very concerned recently and I share that concern, to find that members of the public were able to gain access to the store, although it should be emphasised that the radioactivity content of the material is sufficiently low that people coming into proximity to it would not be exposed to a significant hazard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Irish Steel has been asked to provide a full report as to how the incident occurred.  The company was also instructed to immediately make the store safe and secure against any <Col N="1448" /> unauthorised access.  Furthermore, the inspector from the institute, who immediately travelled to the site, witnessed this being done during the course of his visit.  I do not envisage a recurrence of an incident like this in the future.</P>
    <P>Preliminary inquiries with Irish Steel indicate that barriers which were temporarily removed from the store during May 1995 to facilitate the resorting of waste were not properly replaced at the end of the month.  This sorting was undertaken to facilitate the return of the waste to the UK from where the scrap including the gauge had originated.  The failure on this occasion to adhere to very high standards is not a normal feature of safety measures at Irish Steel.</P>
    <P>The institute has informed me that they will be considering the course of action open to it in respect of any infringement of relevant legislation which may have occurred in relation to the matter.</P>

      <P>The person named applied to my Department in December 1994 for an occasional passenger licence to provide a bus service between Doolough Cross, County Mayo and Belmullet.  Occasional passenger licences are issued in accordance with the terms of the Road Transport Act, 1932.  In considering whether to grant or refuse an application for a passenger licence under that Act, my Department is required to have regard to the extent of passenger road services <Col N="1449" /> and other forms of passenger transport available to the public on or in the neighbourhood of the route of the proposed service.</P>
      <P>Consideration of this particular application is complicated by the fact that a number of applications have been received from other bus operators to provide passenger services in the area in question.  The assessment of all of the relevant application is nearing completion and I expect to be in a position to advise the Deputy of the outcome in the very near future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Lowry)</NameTxt>
      <P>The agreement reached by the 1 June 1995 Energy Council established some basic principles in relation to the introduction of a single electricity market in Europe. However, agreement is still outstanding on a number of fundamental issues which will be the subject of further discussion during the Spanish Presidency. The Council conclusions specifically recognise that such further discussions are necessary on the special needs of small systems such as Ireland's.  It is, therefore, not possible to make any definitive statement on the impact of liberalisation on the Irish market or on rural ESB stations until these have concluded. I can, however, say that in negotiations I will continue to stress our overriding requirement for secure supplies of electricity at the lowest possible cost.</P>

      <P>Omni link is a new wheechair-accessible minibus service for the general public operated as a pilot scheme by Dublin Bus on behalf of the Interdepartmental Transport Accessibility Committee, which is chaired by my Department.</P>
      <P>The project was undertaken by the committee on the basis that it would attract a grant of £592,000 under the EU Horizon Programme, representing a contribution to the capital and operating costs over a two-year period. In the event, total EU funding made available was limited to approximately £210,000, relating almost entirely to the capital element.  In view of the shortfall in the EU contribution, the project was reviewed and it was decided that a city centre service linking the O'Connell Street and St. Stephen's Green areas to the wheelchair-accessible DART system would be introduced instead of the Clontarf-Finglas, Route 103, service originally planned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new service, Route 222, which went into operation on 28 May was publicised by means of newspaper advertisements, press releases and leaflets circulated to 34 organisations representing people with disabilities and has also been featured on a number of radio programmes. While I am advised that revenue on the route has been poor so far, I understand that it is considered too early to draw any definite conclusions about the viability of the pilot scheme at this stage.  The interdepartmental committee is monitoring the situation <Col N="1451" /> and will review every aspect of the project, including the question of public awareness and the desirability of alternative routes and other service arrangements.</P>
