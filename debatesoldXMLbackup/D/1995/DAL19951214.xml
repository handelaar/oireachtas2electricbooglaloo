      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 4, 5, 6 and 2.  It is also proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that: (1) No. 4 shall be decided without debate and, subject to its agreement, all stages of the Appropriation Bill, 1995, shall be taken together without debate and shall be decided by one question which shall be put from the Chair and which shall, in relation to amendments, include only those set down or accepted by the Minister for Finance; (2) No. 5 shall be decided without debate; (3) The proceedings on No. 6 shall be brought to a conclusion within one hour and the following arrangements shall apply: (i) The speech of each Member called upon shall not exceed ten minutes in each case; (ii) Members may share time; and (iii) A Minister or Minister of State shall be called upon to make a speech in reply which shall not exceed ten minutes; (4) The Second and remaining Stages of the Intoxicating Liquor Bill, 1995, shall be taken today and the proceedings thereon, if not previously concluded, shall be brought to a conclusion at 4.45 p.m. by one question which shall be put from the Chair and which shall, in relation to amendments, include only <Col N="1686" /> those set down or accepted by the Minister for Justice; and (5) The Dáil shall sit tomorrow at 10.30 a.m. and shall adjourn not later than 4.45 p.m.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>While I accept it is near Christmas, the Government should not deem it necessary to apply such brevity to matters and play fun and games with the Opposition.  Is the Taoiseach seriously asking Opposition parties to accept, on the nod, the Appropriation Bill that, based on yesterday's Estimates, will provide for a nominal increase over last year of more than 10 per cent in current expenditure?  If last year's once-off amnesty expenditure is excluded, the increase will amount to 13 per cent.  Are you, Sir, asking us to put through that Bill on the nod?  Either you or the Taoiseach is trying to be funny because in relation to amendments&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I withdraw my remarks on the Chair.  Is the Taoiseach seriously asking us to agree, without debate, an Appropriation Bill which, under the programme, A Government of Renewal, will increase expenditure from 6 per cent to 13 per cent, or 10 per cent if the amnesty expenditure is excluded?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister of State listened he would know what I am talking about.  We are asked to accept only Government amendments.  How can the <Col N="1687" /> Opposition agree a Bill that will increase expenditure to such an extent? How can it table amendments to a Bill it has not seen?  Will the Taoiseach explain to my colleague how he expects us at 10.38 a.m. to pass, without debate, a Bill we have not seen?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach told my colleague.  Deputy McCreevy, yesterday that it would not be possible to produce the Appropriation Bill until the Supplementary Estimates were passed and that as soon as they are approved the Bill would be available.  The Estimates were agreed in haste at 12 o'clock yesterday.</P>

      <P>I hesitate to interrupt the Deputy but I am sure he will appreciate that if items on the Order of Business are opposed, brief speeches only are permitted and then the matter is put to a vote.  The Deputy has had some latitude and I ask him to bring his speech to a conclusion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I will do that but I am sure you will appreciate that you are asking the Opposition to pass, without debate or amendment, a Bill that we have not seen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I argued yesterday &mdash; I apologise for my disorderly behaviour and that of my colleagues; I made the same point on Tuesday &mdash; that if the Government wished to make £60 million available to meet the cost of the claims pending from women who have contracted hepatitis C, the seriousness of whose position was outlined by my colleague, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, this should be provided for in legislation.  I now notice that the Government intends to provide in the Appropriation Bill which we have not seen &mdash; item No. 4 on the Order Paper &mdash;&ldquo;for the setting up, and payments on an <i>ex gratia</i> basis out of, a special account to be funded from <Col N="1688" /> moneys provided by the Oireachtas in the Health Vote in respect of a scheme of compensation...&rdquo; Does that not prove that there was illegality, as I argued for two days, for which I was denounced by the Taoiseach?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>We also oppose the proposal that the Appropriation Bill, which we have not seen, be taken without debate.  The Government is asking us to approve its publication, to then take all Stages without debate and to accept amendments in the name of the Minister for Finance.  This is crazy.  The Government set a spending limit of 6 per cent in its programme for this year, but it has fallen at the first fence in the credibility stakes.  Public spending is rising at four times the rate of inflation.  It seems the Taoiseach, Deputy Bruton, in his mature years, has been converted to the spend and tax policies of his socialist buddies in Government.</P>

      <P>It is unreasonable for the Taoiseach who claims to be committed to Dáil reform to ask us to approve the publication of the Appropriation Bill, to then take all Stages without debate and to accept amendments in the name of the Minister for Finance only. Will the Taoiseach agree to a debate this morning?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been a Member for a good while and each year the Appropriation Bill is introduced in this way.  Leave to publish is sought and it is then taken straightaway, usually without debate.  If one checks the records of the House for the past 25, 30 or 40 years, one will find that the procedure about which the Opposition parties are working themselves into a lather was followed by them when in Government year on year without objection.</P>

      <P>I am glad that at last the Opposition parties have rediscovered their voices and I welcome this participation on their part, but I hope they will find a real target affecting real people rather than this imaginary, manufactured moral outrage about procedures which they followed with monotonous regularity when in office.  It shows just how disconnected the Opposition parties are from the concerns of ordinary people that this procedure should be the issue upon which they should choose to find their long lost voice in the House.</P>

      <P>We should not waste time, we are still on the Order of Business.  I intend and must conform to and administer the rules of the House which Members made for me.  They expect me to do so.  Does the Deputy accept the Taoiseach's offer of a one hour debate on this matter?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, we accept his offer, but in all reasonableness the debate should not take place until we have had an opportunity to examine it. We do not know what it contains.  The Taoiseach's claim that it is not a matter of concern rings hollow.  When public expenditure rises by over 10 per cent, it is a matter of extreme concern.</P>

      <P>Neither I nor my colleague, Deputy Fox, are represented at the Whips' meetings.  It might be appropriate to take the debate on the Appropriation Bill tomorrow morning.  I understand, from what the Minister for the Environment said, that it may not be necessary to provide a full day for the debate on the Waste Bill about <Col N="1692" /> which I was not consulted although I had tabled 166 amendments on Committee Stage.  It would suit me if that Bill was taken in the afternoon.</P>

Are the proposals for dealing with No. 6, the motion <i>re</i> the Select Committee on Members' Interests of Dáil Éireann, satisfactory and agreed?  Agreed.  Is the proposal for dealing with No. 2, the Intoxicating Liquor Bill, 1995, satisfactory and agreed?  Agreed.  Is the proposal that the Dáil shall sit tomorrow satisfactory? Agreed.</P>

      <P>On legislation which has been promised, would the Taoiseach like to take this opportunity to apologise for his <i>volte-face</i> regarding what now appears under the Appropriation Bill, payments on an <i>ex gratia</i> basis out of a special account to be funded from moneys provided by the Oireachtas in the Health Vote in respect of a scheme of compensation established or to be established by the Minister for Health and for connected matters? Will the Taoiseach thank me for preventing him and the Government from any illegality regarding the £60 million as this is the legislation which covers this matter to which my party leader referred yesterday?  Is the Taoiseach willing to correct the record of the House, to apologise to me or to thank me for that?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>All that is happening on this occasion is that the procedure for referring in the Appropriation Bill to the Supplementary Estimate &mdash; in this case we are dealing with a Supplementary Estimate for Health &mdash; is being followed as before.  If Deputy McCreevy understood the content of Appropriation Bills, he would realise that every Supplementary Estimate is provided for, that the statutory basis for all public spending is contained in the Appropriation Bill and that every Supplementary and ordinary Estimate can only be legally effective when incorporated in an Appropriation Bill which must be passed at the end of each year. What is happening here is exactly the same as happened every year in the history of this State.</P>

Over the last week I questioned the Taoiseach in relation to the freedom of information Bill.

Yesterday I tabled a question to the Minister for Equality and Law Reform and the answer I got was that the Bill, once published, would then go to the committee for discussion.  Will the Taoiseach clarify that issue?  Will the Taoiseach also state if he is taking any action in relation to the leaking of the Government memorandum dealing with this Bill?  We have been trying to find out what is in this Bill.  Unfortunately when we look at one of the daily newspapers we find that the memorandum is being referred to verbatim.

    <P>We debated the Ethics in Public Office Bill, 1995, in detail and this motion is the final piece of the jigsaw.  Under the Constitution this House regulates its affairs and the proposed Select Committee on Members' Interests of Dáil Éireann will deal with the interests of Members.  It will offer guidance to Members on the provisions of the Act, particularly the Second Schedule which deals with registerable interests, and investigate complaints about Members.

    <P>The committee will be empowered to engage people with the relevant specialist or technical knowledge to assist it in the consideration of any matter.  For example, it will be able to obtain legal advice if it deems it necessary.  The committee represents the Members of the House and it will discharge its duties in a fair and impartial way.  It will work for the benefit of Members and the public whom we serve.</P>

      <P>On the proposal to nominate five members to the committee, I presume these will represent the five main political parties.  I am open to correction but it appears the Independent Deputies will not be represented on the committee.  Regardless of what people may think, we have always tried to ensure a balance in terms of the representation of parties in the House.  If the Independent Deputies believe they should be represented on the committee, my party has no objection to such a proposal.</P>
      <P>We have discussed this issue in detail in the last two years and I will not repeat the points made.  However, I would like to know when the order will be brought into operation and at what stage Members will be compelled to make a declaration of interests.  I hope this will not happen for some time as this is a complex issue.  During the debate on the Ethics in Public Offices Act, 1995, Deputies on this side of the House requested the Minister to publish a booklet setting out the details in regard to this matter.  A document was published during the summer recess but it did not set out in detail the interests which must be declared.  Will the Minister give further consideration to this. The trustees of GAA, soccer and rugby clubs must declare their interests even though they may be of no material benefit to members.  I hope this order will not be brought into operation for some time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is proposed to hold the first meeting of the committee on Wednesday, 10 January 1996.  I have no problem with this date but I hope Members will not be required to make a declaration before 1 April next year.  The format of the declaration can be decided by the committee which may have to get legal or other advice on the operation of the Act.  Members of both Houses want to make proper declarations to ensure there is no controversy or debate afterwards because they omitted to declare a particular interest.  It is important that the order is not brought into operation immediately as decisions will have to be <Col N="1705" /> taken on how the returns will be made, the format etc.  A booklet setting out in simple form the interests which must be declared by Members should be published by the Minister as early as possible in the New Year.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, if any Member overlooks making a return on a certain issue, it could be fatal, particularly at election time.  That is why I hope the Minister agrees that the date by which returns must be made should be extended.  The select committee will then deal with this and all other relevant matters.</P>

      <P>I have said enough, possibly far too much, about this procedure.  It is important that the committee is representative of every group in the House and that has been taken on board.  It would have been difficult for any group to come before a jury composed of politically hostile or competitive Members.  As Deputy Connolly suggested, the involvement of all Members in a consultative process, so they know what they are doing and are briefed as to what is required of them, is crucial.  It would be a pity if, through an inadvertent error, a person was put in a bad light by this process.</P>
      <P>I normally take the view that if we are to do something we might as well do it quickly but Deputy Connolly has suggested that there be a suitable lead in time for people to sort out their affairs. Knowing how much pressure is put on Members to do various things, especially at this time of the year, the timeframe he suggested is not unreasonable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have heard rumours, not in but about this House, that some Members of the Oireachtas will not under any circumstances make a declaration of interests and would prefer to end their political careers before doing so, which is interesting.  However, when this procedure is completed I believe there will be a sense of disappointment that Members have so few interests.  My entry will consist of one line, that I am a barrister.  The vast majority of Members <Col N="1706" /> will put down one other occupation or something similar.</P>

      <P>Yes.  Most of them will have nothing substantial to declare &mdash; to use the old airport terminology, we will all be going through the green channel.  The public will be surprised at how poor and unencumbered by external interests most Members are.</P>
      <P>I described this measure as a prophylactic worn by the Labour Party when in Government with Fianna Fáil and the more I think about it the more convinced I am.  It will not clean up politics &mdash; if anyone wants to take a paper bag full of £10 notes, nothing in the Act will inhibit him from doing so.  Politics is not cleaned up by legislative gestures of this type.  It is kept clean by the people exercising vigilance, the media keeping politicians on their toes and the voters using discretion at elections as to who they trust.  No amount of legislation can make up for the common-sense judgment of voters at election times as to who they wish to represent them.</P>
      <P>Having made those points, I presume the Minister is sick and tired of this process and regards today as the last stage in the implementation of the Act.  I should be gentlemanly enough to say she put a great deal of work into this measure &mdash; whether it is to much effect I will reserve my judgment but she has put much effort into bringing the Act into law and then into operation.  That effort has been noted and while its importance may have been exaggerated I wish her well with it and the other measures, some of which are more important, such as the freedom of information Bill which we will deal with soon.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. J. Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I join Deputy McDowell in complimenting the Minister of State, Deputy Fitzgerald, on the tremendous amount of diligent work she has put into this area.  She has been <Col N="1707" /> involved in a hands-on capacity from the promise of the measure to its delivery, the dates for which are quite clear. She made a commitment and involved herself on a day to day basis.  We are now seeing the final fruits of her work and rigorous investigations.</P>
      <P>I join Deputies from all sides in welcoming that the Dáil and Seanad will shortly have a public register of Members' interests and a system of disclosure of interests which compares well with practice abroad.  I do not share Deputy McDowell's scepticism or his view that it does not get to the root of the problem.  It is a measure well worth embracing but the manner in which it is implemented and enforced is fundamental. One may have many aspirations but unless they are rigorously applied they will not achieve their aim, which in this case is to ensure the system is open, clear and transparent with no hint of financial force being applied to the manner in which people discharge their obligations in the House.</P>
      <P>The establishment of this select committee stems from the adoption by the Dáil of the Ethics in Public Office Act as it relates to disclosures of Members, interests.  Deputy Connolly asked about the dates involved but, as he is aware, the registration date is the end of January and arrangements are well in train for the other dates.  Under the Act, Members must make the first statement by 1 March 1996 to the Clerk of the Dáil.  The committee will issue advice and guidelines well in advance of this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The key requirements on Members under the Act are: first, an annual statement of Members' interests which will be entered into the register and laid before the House; and second, an <i>ad hoc</i> statement by the Member when speaking or voting in the House or one of its committees on a matter in which the Member or a connected person has a material interest.  The role of the Dáil Select Committee on Members' Interests will be a positive one in assisting Members to meet these requirements. The committee will discharge its <Col N="1708" /> functions in three ways: first, providing guidelines to Members on compliance with the Act; second, issuing advice in individual cases where appropriate; and third, undertaking investigations of possible breaches of the Act and, where necessary, reporting to the House on such matters.  In addition, the work of the committee will involve dialogue and a key task will be to establish and maintain close contact with the independent public offices commission and the Seanad Select Committee on Members' Interests in the preparation of guidelines and the application of the Act generally.</P>
    <P>Developments in recent years have signalled the ever increasing importance of select committees of the Dáil.  They have a proven track record in efficiently discharging the business of the House and, more recently, an effective framework for investigating key issues of national importance.  It is worth bearing in mind their remit which has not been taken up to date, that is the powers vested in them to debate legislative proposals in advance of their publication.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach gave the House a commitment this morning in relation to the freedom of information Bill, the heads of which will be submitted to a select committee for detailed discussion on 10 January next.  We are also examining the possibility of bringing one or two other Bills, in advance of their publication, to a select committee for consideration, when Members can debate their provisions and Ministers benefit from Members views, hopefully leading to better legislation in draft form rather than having to substantially amend it subsequently.  We would exhort the chairpersons of the various committees to examine any such legislative proposals in advance and have them debated by their respective committees. Ministers have indicated their willingness to be amenable to this process.</P>
    <P>It goes without saying that, in order to obtain results, a select committee must have effective powers.  I am especially pleased to note, that section 32 of the Ethics in Public Office Act confers <Col N="1709" /> extensive powers on the select committee dealing with Members' interests, which include powers to summon witnesses and documentation and to require the giving of evidence before them.  In addition, any evidence given to such committees will attract the same privileges and immunities as those afforded a witness in a court.  Members will be aware also that the Houses of the Oireachtas (Compellability, Privileges and Immunities of Witnesses) Bill, 1995, at present before the House, is designed to enhance the powers of other select committees, thus enabling them to discharge their functions more effectively.</P>
    <P>I strongly welcome the augmentation of the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs in order to consider Members' interests.  First, it will be a key mechanism which will assist this House to follow best practice abroad in the disclosure of Members' interests; second, it will give direct, practical support to Members in meeting the requirements of the Ethics in Public Office Act, and, third, the augmentation of this committee marks a further milestone in the development of the important role of select committees not only in the business of this House but in our national affairs generally.</P>
    <P>I commend the motion to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Bill introduces very modest and limited amendments to the Licensing Acts.  The main aim of the Bill is to ensure that shops that have licensed sections can open as if it was a weekday on any Christmas Eve or 23 December that falls on a Sunday.  The last time Christmas Eve or 23 December fell on a Sunday was five years ago.  This year Christmas Eve is a Sunday.  The legislation will not be relevant again for another five years.</P>
      <P>The Bill recognises the fact that people like to shop, eat out or simply meet their friends for a drink on Christmas Eve, even when Christmas Eve falls on a Sunday.  Like other legislation, the licensing Acts have to keep pace with the realities of modern life. That includes facilitating retail business and consumers in the run-up to Christmas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With Christmas Eve falling on a Sunday this year, restricted trading hours would apply to premises licensed to sell alcohol, like shops, supermarkets, pubs and off-licences.  Were that to remain the position it would cause unnecessary difficulties for those persons who rely on food shops being open during their final preparations for the festive season, I am one such shopper.  I have in mind in particular people shopping for fresh foods in the run-up to Christmas.  I also have in mind the many people who actually like to shop at the last moment and for whom such shopping has become a tradition.  Of course, there are many families who like to shop and sample the atmosphere of Christmas Eve. There are people who because of work commitments or because some family members are living or working away <Col N="1711" /> from home find it difficult to organise a family shopping day until Christmas is almost upon them.</P>
    <P>As matters stood, when Christmas Eve fell on a Sunday, licensed premises could not open for business until 12.30 p.m. and had to close their doors between the hours of 2 p.m. and 4 p.m. For proprietors of and shoppers in most premises with off-licences, that would mean a very unpleasant day.  One could easily envisage the chaos that would ensue in supermarkets, especially at check-outs, if the available shopping time was shortened on what is one of the busiest days of the year.  Some shop proprietors might take the view that trading on Christmas Eve would be so disjointed it would be better, perhaps even safer, not to open at all.  In addition, uncertainty as to which shops would open and which would remain closed would add to shoppers' problems.</P>
    <P>Under this Bill public houses and off-licences will also be able to open as if it was a weekday on what is normally a busy day for them, one on which persons may like to meet and have a social drink.  The supply of meals in hotels and restaurants with wine licences or pub-type licences was restricted also.  Without this proposed change such premises would be unable to open between the hours of 3.p.m. and 4 p.m.</P>
    <P>That is the reason I decided to introduce this short Bill this year which will do no more than permit shops with licensed sections, pubs, registered clubs and restaurants with licences to operate on Christmas Eve, as they did last year and every other year when Christmas Eve fell on a weekday.  I should stress that its provisions will not permit later opening times in public houses because their closing time on Sunday nights and on week nights during the winter months is the same, 11 p.m.</P>
    <P>The key provisions of the Bill are contained in sections 2 to 6.  Section 2 amends the generally permitted hours provisions of the licensing Acts so that the hours that apply to premises such as <Col N="1712" /> public houses, hotel bars and restaurants with full licences, in addition to off-licences and supermarkets which retail the full range of alcoholic drinks, on any Christmas Eve or 23 December that falls on a Sunday will be the same as if either such day was a weekday.  I am including in my proposal any year that 23 December falls on a Sunday, as the arguments for weekday hours on a Christmas Eve Sunday also apply to any 23 December that falls on a Sunday. Being aware that both Christmas Eve and the preceding day are extraordinarily busy in all shops, I consider it practical to treat both, for trading purposes, in like manner.</P>
    <P>The net effect of section 2 is that the premises I have referred to will be able to open for licensed business at 10.30 a.m. on Christmas Eve this year and will not have to close between 2 p.m. and 4 p.m.  Section 2 and sections 4 to 6 deal with the hours during which drink may be sold in the various types of permises referred to in those sections.  Section 3 deals with mixed trading.  For anyone who may not be familiar with the concept, mixed trading, in the context of the Licensing Acts, refers to businesses which involve both the licensed sale of drink and the sale of other commodities referred to as non-licensed business. The Licensing Acts make allowance for the demands of such businesses by permitting them to open early during weekdays for non-licensed business only. This is to facilitate, for instance the delivery of goods from suppliers to businesses such as a grocery with an off-licence. Section 3 will enable these weekday mixed trading provisions to apply to the premises concerned on a Christmas Eve or on 23 December which coincides with a Sunday.  That means shops with on-licences attached will be able to open for non-licensed business at 7.30 a.m. on Christmas Eve this year and shops and supermarkets with off-licences will be able to open for non-licensed business at 9 a.m.  Such businesses are simply being allowed commence their non-licensed business on Christmas Eve this year as on every <Col N="1713" /> other year that Christmas Eve falls on a weekday.  The licensed business will commence at 10.30 a.m.  This is the reason, not always well understood or appreciated, persons can purchase their shopping in say supermarkets from 9 a.m. on a weekday but have to wait until 10.30 a.m. before they can purchase alcohol.</P>
    <P>Section 13 of the 1927 intoxicating Liquor Act, as amended, allows less restrictive hours to apply to the sale of alcohol with meals in hotels and restaurants. Section 4 will extend the more generous weekday provisions to a 23 or 24 December which falls on a Sunday. Thus, that section will allow, say, a family which is delayed by shopping, to obtain a meal in any of the premises concerned at any time in the afternoon of the coming Christmas Eve.  It will also allow hotels and restaurants to serve alcoholic drinks with substantial meals on a 23 December that falls on a Sunday as if it was a weeknight, i.e. until 12.30 a.m.  When 24 December is a Sunday alcoholic drinks will only be served and consumed with substantial meals until midnight, because, except where there is specific statutory intervention, Christmas Day is a closed day in licensed premises.</P>
    <P>Section 5 extends the proposed changes to registered clubs and section 6 does so in relation to restaurants with special restaurant licences.  In the case of restaurants with special restaurant licences the usual Sunday afternoon times when alcoholic drink cannot be served or consumed with substantial meals is slightly different from other licensed premises, that is, it is 3 p.m. to 6 p.m.  Therefore, this year persons eating out in such restaurants on Christmas Eve will be able to have a drink with their meal no matter what time of the afternoon they are eating.</P>
    <P>On the position of supermarkets and shops, this Bill does not affect any retail outlet that does not have a liquor licence.  Neither does it affect the non-licensed business in supermarkets and shops that sell alcohol from a structurally separate part of the premises.  By <Col N="1714" /> structurally separate I mean where the portion of the premises in which non-licensed business is carried on is structurally separated from the remainder of the premises.  They can do such non-licensed business any time on a Sunday in any case.  This Christmas Eve they will, of course, be able to sell alcohol on their structurally separated licensed areas as they would on weekdays.</P>
    <P>I add my voice to the Minister for the Environment's call for sanity and care on the roads at Christmas.  There has been a very marked change in many people's habits when it comes to driving without drink and it is essential that this attitude extend to all.</P>
    <P>The Garda Síochána will enforce the law vigorously, and I appeal to drivers to have patience if they get stuck behind a queue of cars being checked by gardaí. We will all be the winners if fewer people drink and drive.</P>
    <P>This is a minimal change to our licensing laws to allow for a circumstance that has arisen this year &mdash; the fact that Christmas Eve falls on a Sunday. Many Members will use the opportunity afforded by this debate to highlight other elements of the licensing laws about which they are concerned and which they may wish to see changed or strengthened.  Our licensing laws are extraordinarily complex.  Whenever a Minister has begun to review or to make minimal changes in them it has given rise to very robust debate outside the House and among its Members.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the co-operation of Members of the House so that we can pass this very minimal Bill.  If there are wider issues of interest to Members, I hope other opportunities will be taken to debate them.  I have suggested to some Members that it would be an appropriate issue for the Select Committee on Legislation and Security to review.  I have been told there are other elements I could have included in this legislation, but I do not wish to delay it because it will only be of use if we pass it before Christmas Eve.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this pragmatic legislation.  The general public will also welcome these minimal changes.</P>
      <P>The Bill states that the normal commencement time for the sale of intoxicating liquor in supermarkets will apply, that is to say, 10.30 a.m.  Many housewives and others may want to shop early in the morning and may not have the opportunity of doing so later in the day. It would, therefore, be desirable to make a minimal change to this Bill to allow people to purchase intoxicating liquor during normal shopping on Christmas Eve, even if it falls on a Sunday.</P>
      <P>It is an absolute nonsense to have to close restaurants between 3 p.m. and 4 p.m. on normal Sundays, because many people go out for a meal on a Sunday and find that they cannot have an intoxicating drink with their meal just because it is between 3 p.m. and 4 p.m. A change in this requirement is something the Minister might favourably consider in the context of this legislation.</P>
      <P>The introduction of licensing legislation often leads to very heated debate among the general public and interested parties.  No society can afford not to have restrictions on the sale of intoxicating liquor for obvious reasons.  For example, it would be undesirable if people under the age of 18 years were entitled to purchase intoxicating liquor as this could lead to severe dangers for them in future.  In this context one wonders whether this minimal Bill should go a little further.  There are many who feel that the normal closing hours which will apply on Christmas Eve, if Christmas Eve should fall on a Sunday should also apply to St. Patrick's Day or to New Year's Eve or New Year's Day should they fall on a Sunday.  They are occasions for celebration.  The view is held in some quarters that the Bill should be amended to take account of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Restaurants licensed to sell intoxicating liquor fall into the same category. Licensed premises with a convenience <Col N="1716" /> restaurant annexed thereto are much in evidence in Dublin.  Such restaurants are entitled to sell intoxicating liquor until midnight under the law.  While this may be acceptable throughout the year it ought not be the practice after 10 p.m. on Christmas Eve.  Christmas is a time for the family.  Unfortunately some men consume too much drink and there can be considerable violence in the home at what is supposed to be the happiest time of the year.  It is undesirable for people to go to a public house on Christmas Eve and not return home until midnight. It would be preferable if closing time on that day was 10 p.m.  If a husband consumes too much alcohol or has a drink problem women and children suffer.  To minimise the risk of violence in the home it would be preferable to have earlier closing on Christmas Eve. This would be welcomed by society and particularly by those vulnerable women and children.  They would thank the Minister if this small concession were granted.</P>
    <P>I did not have time to table an amendment but the simplest way to deal with the issue would be to insert an additional section.  Subject to the amendments tabled the Bill is welcomed. Identity cards must be introduced for those under the age of 18. Young people purchase alcohol in supermarkets and other outlets.  They have cider parties, etc. which lead to violence, vandalism and alcohol dependency which in turn leads to drug dependency.  We must recognise that the lives of young, vulnerable and deprived people who have easy access to alcohol are ruined by alcohol or drugs dependency. It would not be a simple matter for the Minister to introduce legislation in this complex area but retailers find it extremely difficult to ascertain the age of young people purchasing intoxicating liquor.  The majority of retailers have no wish, nor would they intend to sell intoxicating liquor to young people. Retailers and parents would welcome the introduction of an identity system.</P>
    <P>There is also an argument to be made for introducing restrictive legislation to <Col N="1717" /> stamp out the sale of ecstasy tablets in pubs, clubs, discos etc.  Every possible obstacle must be placed in the path of those who distribute or facilitate the distribution of drugs.  The licensing Acts must be amended urgently to enable gardaí to serve a warning notice on managers of pubs, clubs etc. where drugs are distributed and consumed. The recent deaths of young people serve to highlight the problem which has spiralled out of control.  Ecstasy tablets are available in every parish, village, town and city.  Unscrupulous people use the premises of others to ply their trade in death.  We were horrified to hear of the deaths of so many young people this year.</P>
    <P>While it is true that the vast majority of managers would not be aware that ecstasy is sold on their premises it must be made clear that where they have some knowledge of it and do not take the appropriate action to stop it the courts will be empowered to suspend their licence for an initial period of 60 days.  If the appropriate steps are not taken such premises should be closed down for good.</P>
    <P>There is, of course, a need for knowledge on the part of the managements, but there have been instances where not only did the managements have some knowledge but subsequently participated in this vile criminal offence.  In a few cases managements have turned off the public water supply and sold water to young people who had taken ecstasy and required the water to prevent dehydration.  There is no excuse for that and there must be no hiding place for people who manage their premises in that manner.  Such people are not entitled to be licensed; they should not be allowed to run any premises. I suggest that not only should their licences be taken from them but they should be jailed.</P>
    <P>It may sometimes be difficult to prove that an individual knew ecstasy tablets were being sold in his or her premises. However, through legislation amending the Licensing Acts, an onus must be put <Col N="1718" /> on management to take the necessary steps to prevent the sale and distribution of illegal drugs on their premises where they have some knowledge that it is taking place.  Let us be honest and admit that there are few managers of clubs or discos who would not know people are purchasing ecstasy tablets. for example, on their premises.  They would know by the actions of the young people concerned, perhaps on an habitual basis, that they had taken an illegal substance.</P>
    <P>While recognising that no innocent manager should or could be convicted, those who have knowledge that such practice takes place on their premises should be obliged in future to implement preventative measures to ensure their premises will not become the location for the death of a young person.  The parents have had enough. If the ecstasy problem in some clubs and discos is not stamped out soon we will have more fatalities.  If the onus is not shifted to the managements the problem will continue to grow and be a danger to young people.</P>
    <P>My colleague, Deputy Woods, will make clear our party's objection to the equal status legislation whereby an owner of a premises must give a reason for a refusal of service.  With regard to drug pushing on a licensed premises, possibly the owner of such a premises may know that an individual frequenting it is a drug peddler but may not be able to prove it.  If the owner refuses to give a reason to such a person for being refused service, the owner would be liable to a sanction under the legislation proposed by the Minister for Equality and Law Reform.  However, if the owner gives the reason and cannot subsequently prove it on the balance of probability, the owner could be sued for defamation and could be liable for damages.</P>
    <P>If we are to suggest that an onus be put on the management of premises to put their houses in order with regard to the sale and distribution of drugs on their premises, it is axiomatic that we should also ensure that the management <Col N="1719" /> or owner putting preventative measures in place would not be hindered and placed in danger of a major or minor action in defamation.</P>
    <P>The owners of many premises, particularly those in tourist resorts, feel there should be an extended period given to them for the sale of intoxicating liquor during the peak tourist season.  There would be considerable objections to such a measure among those who feel the present licensing laws give too much leeway.  There is an argument for extending the period in the case of visitors to an area.  However, such issues would require a more lengthy and considered debate than the one we have today.  The Minister has taken a pragmatic step on which I congratulate her and I ask her to take on board the points I have made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this Bill which proposes a specific measure to allow premises to open on Christmas Eve, in like manner as if it was a week day, when it falls on a Sunday.  Any measure relating to the licensed trade or intoxicating liquor inevitably tends to degenerate into a more general debate. Perhaps because we deal in an <i>ad hoc</i> way with changing the licensing laws we never really have an opportunity to have a social policy debate on the consumption of alcohol and its impact on health and criminality.  The present rates of criminality are closely linked to alcohol abuse.</P>
      <P>The position on pub licensing hours needs to be reviewed.  As the Minister suggested, the Select Committee on Legislation and Security could take on a new project &mdash; as if it had not enough to do.  In an ideal world where the Opposition and the committees were better resourced we could enter a useful investigation of a review of the pub licensing hours.  Ireland is one of the few countries where central Government dictates to such a great extent the times people may go out for a drink.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Dublin is a modern upbeat city and Europeans are surprised at how the <Col N="1720" /> licensing laws hinder the night life.  The same limits apply to all pubs and there is little or no attempt to cater for local circumstances.  A small pub in a quiet country village has the same closing time as a large venue in the centre of Dublin.  There is no facility whereby pubs can stay open later on busy weekend nights than on quiet evenings earlier in the week and during the summer, pubs are required to close early on Sunday nights.  The pub trade is a major contributor to the economy.  Licensed premises, including off-licences give employment to 61,000 people and act as unpaid tax collectors on behalf of the State.  In addition, the licensed trade plays an increasingly important role in the development of the tourism industry. Our pub culture is a major attraction for tourists.  However out of that pub culture flows many of our special problems to which other Deputies have referred.</P>
    <P>There were calls earlier in the year for a relaxation of the law on opening hours.  These calls are made sporadically but nothing ever happens because there is not an urgent need for a debate on it although there is general agreement among our citizens on the need to reconsider the laws governing pub opening hours.  Some weeks ago an unnamed official from the Department of Justice was quoted as saying &ldquo;there were no plans for any modification in the present rules&rdquo;.  This information was communicated to the public in an abrupt manner.  I am not sure if this official represented the Minister's position.</P>
    <P>Many pubs in Dublin decide off their own bat to stay open late and it is not uncommon for pubs in the city centre and in the suburbs to remain open until 1 a.m.  They seem to be able to get around the licensing laws by claiming to offer a rudimentary restaurant service and the Garda appear to turn a blind eye.  In some cases the gardaí knock on the door of a pub across from one of these establishments to make sure it is closed.  If premises remain open on the pretext of selling chicken and chips it is <Col N="1721" /> time to clarify the law as otherwise it is brought into disrepute.  Either the law is rigidly enforced in all premises or a new regime should be introduced.</P>
    <P>In many countries the local authorities have the primary responsibility for supervising and regulating the retail drink trade.  The opening and closing times are set to suit local conditions. This applies in jurisdictions where the authorities at local level have much more power than our local authorities to make decisions on pub opening and closing hours in their locality.  It is difficult to reconcile Dublin's new found status as the jet set tourist capital of Europe with an administrative system which shuts the pub at 11 p.m. and virtually takes all public transport off the streets at the same time.  Visitors to Dublin find it extraordinary that we are all supposed to go home to bed at 11.30 p.m. no matter what age we are.</P>

      <P>It is time for a realistic debate on our licensing laws while at the same time being mindful of the social policy objective that the Minister and the Government has to protect us from ourselves given that our great thirst for alcohol is the downfall of the Irish.</P>
      <P>Under age drinking is a huge social policy issue.  Alcohol is a legal mood altering drug which is a gateway to illegal drugs.  Many young people involved in drugs started by abusing alcohol which is available either at home or from their pals who buy it in supermarkets and off-licences. This leads them to the mood altering drug ecstasy.  We now have an &ldquo;E generation&rdquo;, as ecstasy is much cheaper now than when it first came on the market and is amazingly popular with young people.  In spite of the highly publicised tragic ecstasy induced deaths of young people in the past year there seems to be an inability to get across to young people how dangerous ecstasy is and how even one tablet can prove fatal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The local Garda Síochána in Dundrum, Dún Laoghaire and Sandyford <Col N="1722" /> operate a voluntary ID scheme with the co-operation of the licensed vintners in the area.  This is working quite well.  I believe many young people would like to have an identity card.  The Minister should look at the role an identity card scheme could play in resolving the problem of under age drinking.  A recent national survey of the licensed trade found that 89 per cent of respondents were in favour of introducing a national identity card system for customers.  Of course, ID cards would not eliminate the problem of under age drinking but it would be a step in the right direction.</P>
    <P>Deputies mentioned the impact of drink on criminality.  We have not come to terms with criminality's links to alcohol abuse.  The gardaí constantly tell us how frequently alcohol is the cause of and motivation for many brutal crimes.</P>
    <P>In the context of the widespread use of ecstasy, the staff employed in clubs and dancehalls should be trained to deal properly with young people who collapse. In the old days the tendency was to let the person sleep it off but this is fatal if the person has collapsed as a result of ecstasy.  I recall reading recently the tragic events surrounding the death of a young man in Dublin who collapsed and then was moved by the bouncer to the nearby laneway and left lying there.  This young person did not get any medical attention and while lying in the laneway he was robbed by passing youths.  It is like a scene from a horror story.  This young man, the beloved child of his Irish parents had a very slow death.  We need to be very strict in applying the law and setting out the obligations of people managing dancehalls and such premises where young people meet in large groups and ecstasy may be used.  The bouncers and staff should be trained specifically to deal with youngsters who collapse from the use or abuse of alcohol and drugs.  This should be looked into as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>Certain dance venues and music are intrinsically connected with the use of ecstasy.  It would be very easy for the officials in the Department of Justice <Col N="1723" /> and the Garda, who are carrying out an investigation into tightening up restrictions in these licensed premises, to have a fairly good idea about places which are well known as being used by the ecstasy generation.  It has been reported by Deputies in this House that school children are regularly approached by people, including other school children, peddling drugs.  This is obviously totally unacceptable and should be at the top of our agenda.</P>
    <P>There is a direct link between alcohol and suicide.  Our suicide rates are particularly high at the moment, particularly among young men.  I understand that the suicide rate for young men has trebled in the last five years and is now a major cause of death for men between the ages of 18 and 25 years.  I know that the Minister of Health is looking into this area in terms of introducing suicide prevention education and awareness raising measures.  However, alcohol and lack of coping skills of young men in this age group, particularly when combined with high levels of dependency and poverty, lead to a need for us to be very careful about how we allow access to alcohol.</P>
    <P>Having made those general points in relation to intoxicating liquor, I support the Bill because it is specific and should be passed before Christmas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome this short, minimalist Bill which makes some fairly minor changes to the existing licensing laws and is quite sensible.  Its provisions are needed and will help to prevent difficulties for people involved in that aspect of business coming up to Christmas.  However, as the Minister indicated in her speech, perhaps more importantly this Bill provides us with an opportunity to comment on the licensing laws in general.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have long held the view that our licensing laws should be deregulated. The way they work at present is undesirable and we would be better off if we let the market and people themselves control their drinking habits.  If the <Col N="1724" /> licensing laws were deregulated there would be fairly significant changes in the way people behave in regard to drink, and pub opening times would adjust to the needs of the market rather than the present situation whereby many people behave in a manner which is encouraged and facilitated by the licensing laws.</P>
    <P>Deregulation would mean that some public houses would stay open for long hours, some for only parts of the day and some would keep similar hours to food outlets and grocery shops.  If that happened, a number of the undesirable attributes of drinking, which are now typical of Ireland, would fade away.  It would put an end to people consuming large amounts of alcohol prior to closing time when people order double rounds to reach a certain drinking target.  It would put an end to the unseemly behaviour which goes on in certain public houses where the bar staff feel obliged to almost harass people to leave to stay within the law.  It would put an end to rushed drinking prior to leaving pubs which is highly undesirable, particularly in the tragic context where some people still get into motor cars which they are not fit to drive.  If they could remain for a longer period in a public house, it might give them the opportunity to sober up and drink coffee, behave in a sensible manner and call a taxi or get someone to drive them home.</P>
    <P>It would also considerably improve tourist facilities.  It must come as quite a shock to tourists, particularly from the European mainland, who are used to public houses, cafes and other drink outlets being open almost 24 hours a day to come to Dublin, which is now portrayed as a modern, swinging city &mdash; rightly in many ways &mdash; and find that the pubs close at 11.30 p.m. in the summer. That has a detrimental effect on the tourist industry, particularly in Dublin and tourist resorts around the country where, to some extent, life only begins at 7 p.m. or 8 p.m.  It is a pity that publicans in those areas are forced to either break the law &mdash; which they should not do &mdash; or to order people out <Col N="1725" /> of their premises at 11.30 p.m or midnight. Greater flexibility and deregulation of the licensing laws would also end the phenomenon which exists to some extent in this city where people leave public houses and go to nightclubs where they pay two, three and four times public house prices for drink.</P>
    <P>I do not accept that the present restrictions prevent the abuse of alcohol. Alcohol abuse arises from a series of complex factors.  There are more than adequate opportunities for those who are inclined to abuse alcohol to so do at the moment.  A considerable amount of Garda time is tied up in enforcing licensing laws and deregulation would free up much of that time which they could use in the pursuit of more important matters.</P>
    <P>A number of speakers mentioned the levels of alcohol consumption and drew attention to the phenomenon of Ireland having a pub culture and so on.  That is the impression but the data does not really bear it out.  We are somewhere in the middle of the table of alcohol consumption across Europe and certainly far from the top.  Many people do not realise that.</P>
    <P>There is no denying that alcohol is a drug.  However, it is one of the more acceptable and tolerable ones.  In comparison to some drugs which are rampant across this city, it is relatively insignificant in terms of its undesirable effects for the vast majority of people who use it.  There is, of course, an unfortunate minority who succumb to alcohol abuse and whose lives are dominated by it.  However, I do not accept that the controls in relation to pub opening times have any significant or real impact on those developments.  It is time for us, as a society, to place more emphasis on the need for individuals to be much more responsible in relation to how they regulate their lives.  That is vitally important.  It is time to move away from the concept that the State should have power to regulate people's behaviour <Col N="1726" /> even in simple matters such as the opening hours of public houses.  That viewpoint is from another era and we should move on.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that she is interested in hearing our views on licensing laws in general.  I hope I am not misquoting her in saying that I believe she is also interested in stimulating a debate on the need to alter our licensing laws.  I have always held the view that a radical shake up of those laws is necessary.  Much of our law in this area dates back to the last century, if not earlier.  Some of my friends in legal circles informed me that the regulations on the required distance between public houses are founded on concepts that relate to Church of Ireland parishes and I am sure Deputy O'Dea will correct me if I am wrong in that regard.  However, there is no doubt our licensing laws are from another age and it is time to move on.</P>
    <P>The legislation fails to take account of changes in population density.  While many densely populated areas in Dublin have a small number of public houses, other parts of the city have a large number of public houses per head of population and there is a public house at every crosssroads in the country.  Such anomalies in our law, which create considerable difficulties, must be addressed. Difficulties will also arise regarding the price of public houses, the amount of money publicans invested in them and the assumptions they made when making those investments.  Nevertheless, it is necessary to develop new concepts in this area.</P>
    <P>Members opposite referred to the legislation that will allow publicans to bar persons from public houses.  That legislation has not been published yet, consultations are being held with departmental officials and outside interests.  While the legitimate concerns of Members in this regard must be considered, we must also bear in mind the legitimate concerns of publicans.  If public houses are to be managed efficiently, it is essential that publicans are allowed exclude people from their premises, but <Col N="1727" /> how that should be regulated is a matter for debate and I am sure we will reach a satisfactory conclusion.  From the point of view of efficient management and the welfare of publicans, bar staff and customers, people who cannot behave properly when they consume a certain amount of drink should be barred from the premises concerned.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donnell linked the consumption of alcohol with crime.  Such a generalisation is far too sweeping and, to a large extent, incorrect.  Approximately 75 per cent of the adult population consume alcohol and the majority of them do not get involved in crime.  In a small number of cases, the consumption of alcoholic drink facilitates crime, but if alcohol was not available those people would find other reasons for committing crime.  The association of alcohol with crime stems to some extent from the fact that in pleading for leniency for their clients in court, the legal profession attribute their outrageous behaviour to excessive alcohol consumption in the hope that the judge is understanding.  If their behaviour was subjected to critical analysis, I am sure that suggested link would not stand up.</P>
    <P>Some Members referred to the problem with ecstasy, some of which is sold in public houses.  This is a major concern and I agree with the sentiments expressed that no mercy should be shown to publicans who condone such activity.  However, we must protect the legitimate interests of publicans as it may be impossible in some cases to monitor the selling of this drug in public houses but, for financial reasons, some publicans have condoned this activity.  I would have no difficulty with allowing the gardaí more discretion on such matters when licences are being renewed in the courts.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and the opportunity to contribute to the debate.  I welcome, in particular, the Minister's indication that she is interested in having a debate on the matter.</P>

      <P>I, too, welcome the Bill which will allow shops and supermarkets, public houses and other premises licensed to sell intoxicating liquor through retail premises to remain open on Christmas Eve or 23 December in any year that either day falls on a Sunday, as if it were a week day.  This will facilitate customers and overcome the practical difficulty that arises this year and will arise approximately once every five years.  This is a significant step.</P>
      <P>While we recognise the importance of facilitating the licensed trade in these arrangements, we cannot ignore the tragic consequences of the abuse of alcohol, especially at this time of year. Deputy O'Donoghue referred to the difficulties faced by many women and children in the home in this regard. Domestic violence, marital discord, increased admissions to psychiatric units, unnecessary conflict between neighbours, road accidents and deaths are the outcome of excessive drinking and the abuse of alcohol.  A large number of difficulties can arise at Christmas time from the abuse of alcohol.  It is important that as a nation we learn to use alcohol without abusing it and we have learned a great deal in that regard in recent years.  We should send out the clear message for Christmas that people should enjoy the festivities and celebrate the occasion, but should not allow alcohol destroy families or shatter lives.  As public representatives, far too often we see at first hand the tragedy and desolation that follows accidents, particularly serious ones, at Christmas time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Christmas is a time for families, particularly children.  We pride ourselves on our family traditions and our care and consideration for children and much has been said about this in recent months.  Let us enjoy Christmas but at <Col N="1729" /> the same time show care and consideration on the roads, in the community and among our neighbours.  We should listen to the advice and warnings from the National Safety Council and the Garda Síochána whom we should support in their campaign to save lives this Christmas.  In this regard I agree with the Minister and Deputy O'Donoghue. Members of the Garda Síochána, too, are human and many enjoy a drink. They have spouses and children, but they also see the carnage on our roads, the young and vibrant lives prematurely ended or scarred for life and the mad rush to hospitals to save a life or limbs. They are doing their best this Christmas.  We should give them our full support.</P>
    <P>The Government's proposal to remove from publicans and other service providers the right to refuse service is a source of great alarm throughout the country.  The folly of this approach can be seen at this festive time.  Fianna Fáil rejects the Government's proposal to remove from members of the licensed trade the right to refuse service and will oppose that part of the forthcoming legislation.</P>
    <P>The two organisations representing publicans, the Vintners' Federation of Ireland and the Licensed Vintners' Association have expressed grave concern that their members will be unable to manage their premises if they are obliged to face the danger of an action for damages and-or an objection to their licence each time they refuse or bar a person.  How will they deal with the problems of under-age drinking and drug pushing on their premises and those who appear to be troublemakers if they do not have the right to refuse permission?  This right is crucial to the proper and orderly management of premises.</P>
    <P>The dangers associated with ecstacy have been highlighted.  The public house is one of the places where those who deal in drugs try to sell ecstacy and other drugs.  When parents hear this from their children they approach management and ask them to do something <Col N="1730" /> about it.  It is my experience that where managements have been made aware of the problem they have taken action and barred the people concerned without giving any reason.  It is important, therefore, that the right to refuse permission is retained.  There has been a breakdown in law and order and the position is bad enough without creating chaos in public houses.</P>
    <P>In general public houses are well run, enjoyable places for public recreation. The public rely on their being safe establishments and expect strict management from publicans to maintain an orderly house.  If they are hamstrung by the Government's proposals, they will find such management impossible and may be unable to meet the licensing requirements.  Publicans have been so successful to date in practice that the Irish pub is now copied throughout the world from Moscow to Boston and from Stockholm to Johannesburg.  Many now provide food, coffee and other refreshments in a social environment.  I recall encouraging them when Minister for Health and Social Welfare in the early 1980s to do so&mdash;&mdash;</P>

In this way the costs associated with psychiatric institutions and units are also reduced.</P>

      <P>Governments, have always required strict supervision of their premises by publicans.  No legislation should interfere with their ability <Col N="1731" /> to manage to achieve that strict supervision. The Government's proposed legislation is almost a directive not to manage.  Fianna Fáil has called on the Minister for Equality and Law Reform and Government to find a more workable solution with publicans.  The Irish pub works well and we should not try to fix something that is not broken.  The right to refuse admission or service is of vital importance to the publican and Fianna Fáil supports the licensed trade and its customers in this regard.  The Minister's proposals must be substantially amended or withdrawn.</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil rejects all forms of discrimination, but the proposed legislative approach will not work.  It has defended the nation's publicans in their need to manage their premises and keep an orderly house, but now calls on the licensed trade to present its own proposals to deal with the issue of discrimination on its premises wherever it arises.  It will have Fianna Fáil's full support in devising measures which would enable publicans to maintain an orderly house.  Fianna Fáil has pleasure in welcoming the Minister's proposals in this Bill which it will support.</P>

      <P>I am grateful to my colleague, Deputy Woods, for sharing his time with me.  I compliment the Minister on introducing this timely legislation which has been described as minimalist. It is clear, however, that the Minister has given much thought to the matter and she mentioned that she took the needs of shoppers and families into consideration in its preparation.  I was impressed and commend her for it.</P>
      <P>The abuse and overuse of alcohol can, as many speakers have said, lead to misery and tragedy.  That message must be emphasised by Members from every available forum at all times.  The Minister mentioned that Garda enforcement of the drink driving laws, particularly over the Christmas period, would obtain.  That is to be welcomed and commended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister was praised for her pragmatic approach to this legislation.  I agree but we must be equally pragmatic in our approach to drinking and to the drinking industry.  As Deputy O'Donnell stated earlier, that industry has major implications for our economy.  It was suggested by my good friend and <Col N="1733" /> colleague.  Deputy O'Donoghue, that closing time on Christmas Eve should be at 10 p.m.  I do not disagree with my colleague very often, but on this occasion I am diametrically opposed to his suggestion, which would be a retrograde step.  In tourism terms our licensing laws are regarded as overly restrictive by our colleagues in Europe.  A move to change closing time on Christmas Eve to 10 p.m. would have the effect of bringing us back to the Dark Ages in tourism terms.</P>
    <P>Our drinking public has become very resourceful and I speak from experience of all sides on that subject.  This Minister and previous Ministers for Justice prevailed upon the drinking public to be more responsible and enforced licensing laws by way of legislation and intense Garda activity.  That has encouraged people to be more resourceful.  For example, at Christmas time one member of a group may not drink alcohol or a taxi may be provided to bring people home.  That is evidence of people's resourcefulness and responsibility.  I am strongly of the view that we should not go down the road of introducing further restrictions in this area.</P>
    <P>Regarding the equal status Bill to which my colleague, Deputy Woods, referred, time does not permit me to deal with it in satisfactory detail.  I take Deputy Upton's point that the Bill is not published, but its vibes have given rise to deep concern not only to publicans or those in the licensed trade, but to the butcher, the banker and the candlestick maker.  Many aspects of the forthcoming legislation are welcome, commendable and essential, but the suggestion that there may be an interference with the right to refuse to serve a member of the public is unacceptable, undesirable and unworkable and must be removed.  The best way to do that is to remove the provision prior to the introduction of the legislation.  That aspect of the legislation should be seriously examined and in the context of the detail expressed by my colleague, Deputy Woods.  I am sure we will all have an opportunity to discuss this matter when the Bill is introduced <Col N="1734" /> and I hope when it is introduced it will be conspicuous by the absence of a provision in that regard.</P>

      <P>I will be brief as the time schedule is such that all Members who wish to contribute will not have an opportunity to do so.  I was interested in Deputy Jacob's contribution as he spoke from experience.  I note my colleague, Deputy Foxe, is limbering up on the sideline.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer to the concept of the off-licence and the need for the Department of Justice and the Minister to give early consideration to the operation of off-licences under the Licensing Acts and within her jurisdiction.  It is time the law was updated.  The 1882 Act or the 1902 Act bear little relevance to supermarket shopping in the latter part of this century.  The existing legislation does not cater for off-licences in the manner in which it should.</P>
      <P>The trading hours for off-licences in supermarkets are governed on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis depending on the attitude of the superintendent in the Garda division concerned.  That is regrettable and underlines the need for uniformity in this area.  The craziness of the off-licence system is illustrated by reference to the granting of off-licences to premises in the conurbation of north Kildare and west Dublin.  In recent times new off-licences have been granted to premises in Celbridge, Lucan and Maynooth, but it is not possible to make an application for a new off-licence in Leixlip because the Minister for the Environment has extended the new boundary by granting town commission status to Leixlip.  That is an example of problems posed by the outmoded laws governing off-licences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1735" /> The Minister suggested that a Dáil Committee might consider this matter next year and that may be worthwhile, but we need to set target dates by which licensing laws will be reformed.  The area of off-licensing, on-licensing, beer wholesalers and retailers is an area of huge complexity and has been the subject of discussion for many years.  A body should be established immediately, including officials from the Department of Justice and appropriate experts from the retail area, to consider the current application of the law and the need to introduce an appropriate programme of reform enacted by way of legislation within the lifetime of the Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Flanagan for sharing his time with me.  I compliment the Minister on introducing this Bill.  I wrote to her a number of weeks ago about Christmas Eve, New Year's Eve and St. Patrick's Day, all of which will fall on a Sunday and the six day licence holders.  The Minister in this Bill should have legislated for everybody, not just for the big supermarkets.  There should be provisions for six day licence holders, who cannot open on Sundays. Because Christmas Eve, New Year's Eve and St. Patrick's Day will fall on a Sunday six day licence holders should have been included in this legislation.</P>
      <P>If I was not a member of a Government party and a free vote was allowed I would oppose this Bill.  I was in business for 22 years and understand how business works.  The small shopkeepers should get the business that arises because Christmas Eve falls on a Sunday. If I was the Minister for Justice I would not allow supermarkets sell drink.  That should be left to the licensed premises and the sale of groceries should be left to the grocery business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope there is not a hidden agenda here.  I will never support Sunday trading. People have six days per week in which to work.  Sunday should be a day of rest, prayer, sport or whatever.  There <Col N="1736" /> is not a necessity for big supermarkets to open on Sundays.  Let the small shopkeeper in Ballina, Kiltimagh or Westport have their day.  They have to live too.  They have paid the PRSI and taxes and the State should protect them, not the larger supermarkets who are well able to protect themselves.  I will bitterly oppose Sunday trading.  I understand and support the reason the Minister introduced this Bill to facilitate housewives who may want to shop at supermarkets on Christmas Eve.  I have nothing against drink but it is time this House established a committee representing Government, publicans, parents and everybody involved with a view to tackling the serious problem of under age drinking.  It is not the responsibility of publicans &mdash; though the law states it is &mdash; it is the responsibility of the parents and the people.  In America or London a party or a night out is from 8 p.m. to perhaps 11 o'clock whereas here a party commences at 2 a.m. or 3 a.m. and people are unable to work the next day. On the last occasion I spoke on this topic.  Deputy Fox defended the management of licensed premises.  My uncle has been in the pub business all his life and I know a little about it having often worked a Sunday or a Sunday night for him.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill in principle but I am concerned about Sunday trading and hope major supermarkets will not be allowed to open on Sundays.  I hope the Government introduces legislation to curb that as quickly as it introduced this legislation.  I am pleased to note legislation could be introduced so quickly to appease the big supermarkets.  What about the small shopkeepers?  They have a part to play in society.  They are finding things very difficult.  It would not have been wrong on this occasion if we allowed the small shopkeepers have some business on Sundays.</P>
    <P>The six day licence holders cannot open on a Sunday.  If shops and supermarkets are to be allowed to open on Christmas Eve for Sunday hours I appeal to the Minister, at this late stage, to allow the six day licence holders to <Col N="1737" /> open on Christmas Eve.  If a concession is being made for the supermarkets it should be made for them also.  We are here to legislate for everybody.  In the past some older premises had a seven day licence but when the pub passed on to a son or daughter there may have been difficulties with licensing laws.  I am not a solicitor but I gather it is difficult to get a licence moved from a premises at the top of the town to the bottom unless the licensed property is rendered derelict.</P>
    <P>It would be wrong not to provide for the six day licence holders and to include the Dunnes and the Quinnsworths.</P>

      <P>The purpose of the Bill, as the explanatory memorandum states, is to:</P>
      <P>...allow shops and supermarkets which are licensed to sell intoxicating liquor by retail and other licensed premises to remain open on Christmas Eve or 23rd December in any year that either day falls on a Sunday, as if it was a weekday.</P>
      <P>I take Deputy Ring's last point that it is extraordinary, in view of the pressing need for reform of the law and the paucity of law reforming measures introduced by the Government in the past 12 months, that this Bill, consisting of seven sections, providing for all eventualities, could be prepared at short notice.  While I support the Bill it is extremely narrow legislation, designed to meet a specific problem.</P>
      <P>While there is a need for a radical overhaul of the licensing legislation, I accept this Bill is not the place in which to do it.  I regret the opportunity was not taken to correct a few of the more arcane features in licensing laws.  I will give a few examples.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support what my colleague, Deputy <Col N="1738" /> Woods, said about the rumoured impending proposals from the Department of Equality and Law Reform.  I and my party are opposed to discrimination in all forms.  If the rumours we hear are correct, then the asinine proposals from the Department of Equality and Law Reform will not eradicate discrimination but will introduce a number of grave injustices.  As I understand it, the basic proposal is that people, including publicans, whom we are discussing in the context of this Bill, will have to give reasons for refusing to serve people.  That means, in effect &mdash; as outlined by Deputy Woods &mdash; that every publican to avoid being hauled before the courts, will be forced to open his or her premises and serve drunks, drug pushers, pimps, prostitutes and miscreants of every shape and description.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>That law is still there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>One has to give a reason for refusal.  As Deputy O'Donoghue said if he cannot give a reason the publican can be dragged before the courts for libel and presumably there will be a sanction in the legislation.  It does not take much reflection, a legal genius or a person with a lifetime's experience in the licensed trade to know that if that legislation is introduced in the format rumoured, it will cause grave injustice from one end of the country to the other.  It will also make publicans vulnerable to instant violent retaliation in some cases.  I do not have to spell out the problems faced by a publican who does not want to serve a person who is drunk and obviously violent.  If he is forced to give a reason and say, &ldquo;I will not serve you because I think you are drunk and violent&rdquo; one can imagine what will happen in many instances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is even stranger is that legislation of that nature would conflict directly with a publican's obligation to obey other laws for which there is very good reason, for example, the law against serving under age persons.  A publican who says to a person who may not be under age, &ldquo;I will not serve you <Col N="1739" /> because I think you are under age&rdquo; is effectively saying, &ldquo;you are the type of under age person who comes into my premises and demands drink&rdquo;.  This could leave the publican open to a libel action and it will certainly leave him open to an action if a sanction is built into the legislation.  As the Minister well knows, people do not carry their birth certificates in their pockets and we do not have an indentity card system, which we should have.  However, that is a debate for another day.</P>
    <P>If measures are put in place &mdash; I am sure the Minister is sympathetic to these &mdash; to prevent people colluding in the supply and distribution of drugs on their premises, then the law which says a reason must be given for refusal to serve or entertain a person in a pub would conflict directly with it.  There is a very good reason for the former legislation, that is we do not want to turn pubs into havens or centres for the distribution of drugs such as ecstasy.  If we want to strengthen the law in this area then it is ludicrous to introduce legislation which will force publicans not to comply because of the risk of being hauled before the courts.</P>
    <P>Deputy Woods has clearly outlined my party's position on the issue.  I urge the Minister to ask the Taoiseach and her Government colleagues to remove this legal sword of Damocles hanging over the heads of worried publicans and make a statement before Christmas that these ludicrous proposals will be consigned to the scrap heap and they will be allowed to remain in control of their premises.  It is not a question of a large political lobby, rather it is a question of people who are genuinely worried about their livelihoods and responsibilities and the management and control of their premises.  It is only fair, proper and just for the Government to reassure not only publicans but the owners of other retail outlets that this proposal in its rumoured form will not be inflicted on them.  Some weeks ago the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs gave a <Col N="1740" /> promise that this matter would be discussed by the Select Committee on Legislation and Security before the legislation was enacted.  To date we have heard no more about the matter. A promise is a promise and I ask the Minister to say in her reply when that discussion will take place.</P>
    <P>A serious and radical re-examination of our liquor licensing laws is long overdue. As things stand, the dice is loaded unfairly against ordinary publicans.  For example, clubs can apply for a late night exemption &mdash; each club is entitled to 15 late night exemptions per annum.  In cities such as Limerick which have dozens of licensed clubs this means that several clubs legally sell alcohol after ordinary closing hours every night of the week. The right to purchase alcohol in pubs is supposedly confined to members.  This attempted safeguard has become nothing other than a sick joke.  The law states that members can bring in guests to clubs but guests cannot purchase a drink for themselves, it has to be purchased for them by the member.  This restriction has never been obeyed and, as the Minister will appreciate, is basically unenforceable.  A busy barman in a club cannot question, and invariably never does, whether a person who asks for a drink is a member.  Clubs get around the law by using the transparent device of requiring people to sign a book at the door on the way into the club which means they automatically become members and are thereby entitled to all the privileges of membership, including the right to purchase alcohol.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>That applies mainly to gentlemen's clubs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>We want to get rid of discrimination and there will be no more of those clubs after the enactment of the equal status legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Licensees who manage to obtain a restaurant certificate also have an unfair advangage over ordinary publicans.  The holder of a restaurant certificate is <Col N="1741" /> entitled to apply for late night exemptions &mdash; that is the reason for getting the certificate in the first place &mdash; and while they have to pay for this privilege they invariably get their money back by imposing a cover charge at the door. The law states that a person cannot obtain a restaurant certificate unless their main business consists bona fide of the supply of food.  This provision is almost totally ignored.  Sometimes local court officials make a half hearted attempt to enforce this aspect of the law and on very rare occasions a certificate is refused, denied or not continued as a result of an investigation.  However, this happens on rare occasions only and the stark reality is that many, if not most, of these establishments operate in blatant breach of the law.  I have carried out research in this area and I would go so far as to say that if the law was strictly enforced 70 per cent of night-clubs would have to shut their doors.  The main business of the 70 per cent of night-clubs is not to sell food.  Yet they continually apply for, and receive from the court, a restaurant certificate on the basis that the sale of food is their main source of income.</P>
    <P>It is extraordinary to think that the State is turning a blind eye to this practice and operating a deliberate policy of non-enforcement.  The State is in effect colluding in illegality in every town and city virtually on a nightly basis.  I understand that the late night venues in Leeson Street have made no attempt even to pretend that their main business consists of the supply of food.  They operate in blatant breach of the law, yet the State has made no attempt to interfere.</P>
    <P>One of the criteria which must be observed in order to justify the granting of an exemption for the after hours sale of alcohol to premises with a restaurant certificate which also have a dance licence is that they serve &ldquo;a substantial meal&rdquo;, which is defined as a meal costing not less than £2.  That provision has become meaningless with inflation.  One could not buy a bag of chips for £2 in the more up market chippers in Limerick.</P>

      <P>Surely the opportunity could have been taken in this Bill, narrow though it may be, to redefine what a substantial meal means in this context. There is nothing to prevent the Minister from doing this and I urge her to give consideration to this proposal.  I am amazed the Government did not avail of the opportunity under the legislation to amend that glaring anomaly.  It could easily have done so if it had any desire to enforce the law.  However, the truth seems to be the opposite.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>These mainly illegal operations are of substantial benefit to the Exchequer, which apparently is the Government's paramount consideration. If the State wishes to level the playing pitch between ordinary vintners and people with special restaurant certificates it should ensure that the law is enforced in relation to the sale of alcohol in clubs.  In addition, it should consider allowing ordinary publicans to apply to the court for late night exemptions on payment of an excise fee.  The fee could be graded according to such factors as locations, turnover, the extent of the exemption and the number of nights for which it is sought.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Alternatively, the Government could take the much more radical step of relaxing our licensing laws, because they are having an adverse effect on foreign tourism.  The projected employment creation figures show that we are becoming more dependent on foreign <Col N="1743" /> tourists in creating jobs and in that context the licensing laws must be examined as a matter of priority.  We are sufficiently mature as a country that we do not need the law to protect us from ourselves. However, I do not expect the Government to take these radical measures.  <i>The Irish Times</i> this morning described its performance as unexciting and dull&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Wexford):</i> I welcome this narrowly focussed legislation which deals with one specific issue.  Perhaps it is time to examine seriously all our liquor laws, especially pub opening hours, as mentioned by Deputy O'Dea, and under age drinking.  Our pub opening hours are no longer acceptable, especially in the summer when we are trying to encourage tourism.  This year I spent some of my holiday in Deputy O'Donoghue's constituency&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Wexford):</i>&mdash;&mdash; and in Clare.  By 11.30 p.m., visitors were being pushed onto the streets and told to go home.  We must consider pub opening hours at some stage in the future.  We must also consider the new anti-discrimination measures which were mentioned a number of times today.  While <Col N="1744" /> we are not dealing with that issue now the Minister should be aware that we stongly feel those laws are not acceptable.</P>
      <P>Publicans should be responsible with regard to under age drinking.  I have been concerned about this for some time because a certain percentage of publicans are flouting the law in this area.  Every summer when the leaving and junior certificate results are released, teenagers are to be found drunk and disorderly on the streets. There is no point in saying they get the drink elsewhere, they are being served by publicans.  This matter must also be examined.</P>
      <P>I would not fully agree with Deputy O'Dea about clubs.  I am chairman of a GAA club in Enniscorthy which has bar and lounge facilities and is run on a strict basis, in line with how the publicans in the town run their businesses. The laws are not flouted, there are no late openings and no questionable meals are served.  A myth has been put about that all GAA clubs, soccer clubs and golf clubs with bars and lounges are flouting the law.  I do not agree &mdash; they are behaving responsibly and those in charge are running them well.  There may be problems in Dublin but that is not the case in rural areas.</P>
      <P>While this Bill is welcome the Minister must bring to the House in the near future legislation dealing with the wider aspects of the liquor laws so that pubs will be more accessible and it will be easier to attract tourists.  When one goes abroad one can have a drink late at night or early in the morning but in Ireland people are put out on the streets at 11.30 p.m.  I ask the Minister seriously to consider these points so that the House can have a meaningful input into what would be the best licensing laws for the future.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Bill.  The Minister must be complimented on introducing it at this point in the year as it is most timely.  Unlike many Bills it will be put into effect within a matter of days of being passed.</P>
      <P>The abuse of alcohol was mentioned by Members.  Some people do abuse it but today's youth are for more mature than they are credited.  In respect of the Garda checkpoints at Christmas and throughout the year, young people have a more mature approach than their predecessors some 25 to 30 years ago.  One member of a group will stay off alcohol or they will hire taxis &mdash; that trade has developed considerably in rural areas in the last few years.  It might not have been to the good of the publican that the laws to control drink driving were introduced but taxi men have benefited and are providing a good service.  It is also heartening that it is young people who make most use of taxi services. When discussing death on the roads more emphasis could be put on controlling speed.  Alcohol plays its part, but perhaps not as much as we think. Speed is a far greater culprit in that regard.</P>
      <P>Under age drinking is a problem but publicans are not the only people who sell alcohol.  Supermarkets do also. Many young people who obtain drink and perhaps become drunk are not served in pubs; their source of drink is supermarkets and off-licences.  Perhaps this could be looked at more closely from the licensing perspective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In certain parts of the country, such as Roscommon, there is an identity card system.  It operates in most of the towns <Col N="1746" /> and is fairly effective, although if a person took his drinking seriously he could get around the ID system.  However, it is a start.  We should consider introducing it to every town in the county and perhaps in the country.</P>
    <P>It was suggested that the Minister should stipulate that closing time on Christmas Eve should be 10 p.m.  The Deputy who said that should remove it from his script when supplying it to the local newspapers in Kerry if he wants to be back here after the next election.  I agree with the Deputy who suggested that the six-day licence holders should get the benefit on this occasion since the Minister was sufficiently generous to facilitate publicans.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I have no problem whatsoever in ensuring that we have a full and proper debate in this House on the way our financial affairs have been managed since this Government took office just over a year ago.</P>
      <P>The analytical need to reduce the rate of increase in public expenditure is one shared by all political parties.  Since all political parties have had an opportunity of being in office since 1990, with the exception of the Green Party, all Members will readily understand that need.  Therefore, all senior politicians if not all political parties will be well aware of the difficulties of meeting specified targets in the very necessary but nevertheless difficult task of reducing the rate of increase in public expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the formation of this Government we decided to insert in our policy document, <i>A Government of Renewal,</i> our <Col N="1747" /> objectives for reducing the rate of increase in public expenditure in real terms.  This year we set a target of 6 per cent.  Following negotiations with my colleagues, based on the revised Book of Estimates published after the budget, our projected nominal increase this year on the Non-Capital Supply Services Book of Estimates, including inflation for the year of approximately 2.5 per cent &mdash; though forecast to be slightly higher at the beginning of the year &mdash; was 6.9 per cent.</P>
    <P>With the agreement of the House we are enacting the Appropriation Bill, the legal instrument which gives effect to the expenditure of moneys raised through Estimates voted by this House, original and supplementary.</P>
    <P>In that respect Deputy McCreevy made the charge that, rather than that figure representing an increase of 6.9 per cent on the Book of Estimates, as published after the budget, it represented an increase of the order of 12 or 13 per cent.  Obviously, we shall have to enter into a long, tortuous debate on figures &mdash; an accountant's paradise &mdash; when no doubt Deputy McCreevy will take great pleasure in displaying his virtuosity in analysing the various columns of figures.  He is a responsible politician for whom I have a great deal of respect but, having heard his charge, I asked my departmental officials &mdash; from a purely factual accountancy viewpoint &mdash; to address it as best they could.  This House or democracy is not served in any way by obscuring figures or misleading people and I will not be a party to any such endeavour.</P>
    <P>When replying I shall respond to any points not covered in my introductory remarks.  Deputy McCreevy is reported as having quoted a figure of 12 to 13 per cent as representing increased public expenditure in 1995 when account is taken of the Supplementary Estimates of £203 million, the proceeds of the tax amnesty in 1994 and equal treatment payments due to women.  That calculation is utterly false and misleading for the following reasons.  First, it includes <Col N="1748" /> in the 1995 figure the full amount of £203 million for Supplementary Estimates, wrong for two reasons.  The figure of £203 million is the total figure, which includes current and capital spending, whereas the current element of the quoted figure of £203 million is £157 million.  The total figure of £203 million, or the current element of £157 million, is a net non-capital supply services figure whereas we are dealing with gross non-capital supply services.  The correct gross non-capital supply services figure for the Supplementary Estmates represents a further reduction to a figure of £114 million.  Therefore, the real comparison is represented not in the £203 million but the £114 million.</P>
    <P>Second, I do not accept that deducting the proceeds of the tax amnesty from the 1994 base is justifiable or valid since a significant portion thereof was spent on ongoing items of expenditure such as the pensions liability of An Post and Telecom Éireann; in other words, much of the amnesty-funded spending was not of a once off nature and, therefore, should not be excluded from the 1994 base.  We used the benefits of the proceeds of the amnesty to meet liabilities, some of which were ongoing.  For that reason it is proper to include them and improper to exclude them from the 1994 base.</P>
    <P>In addition, the full amount of the proceeds of the tax amnesty appear to have been deducted from the 1994 base whereas £40 million of capital expenditure included in the total should not have been included.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, it is completely wrong to add to the 1995 published figures the additional £114 million equal treatment payments as that amount has already been included in the published figures for the current year; to do so is simply to engage in double-counting.</P>
    <P>I want to turn to a third matter of controversy that has arisen in recent days, that is the hepatitis C special fund. The Government decided to establish a tribunal, under the aegis of the Minister for Health, to administer a special compensation scheme for those affected by <Col N="1749" /> hepatitis C so that compensation would be paid speedily to those entitled to it without the necessity for lengthy court proceedings.  The tribunal hearings will be informal, flexible and take evidence in private, which we consider to be the most effective way of meeting the needs of those affected by hepatitis C.  The model of that tribunal is based loosely on that established to compensate the victims of the Stardust tragedy of the early 1980s, when that format was found to be satisfactory all round.</P>
    <P>Above all, the establishment of a specific fund into which Exchequer funds will be paid as soon as possible is the clearest way of showing that the Government intends doing all it can to ensure the tribunal is effective.  The Minister for Health has engaged in extensive, continuous discussions with the group known as Positive Action who grouped together to make representations to him on compensation for those women who were the unfortunate victims of this tragedy.  In order to demonstrate maximum good faith in addressing their real fears and concerns, a substantial figure has to be voted and clearly placed on the record of the House as being available to meet their perceived needs and calculated compensation requirements.  Therefore, the Government freely, openly and properly made this provision of £60 million. There was nothing hidden about any of this; the Government's policy on hepatitis C has been reiterated by the Minister for Health on many occasions and spelled out by him in a debate here on Tuesday evening last.  Equally, so far as accounting for public funds is concerned, neither is there anything hidden. It has been made clear to the Dáil how much is involved, as of now, and how the fund will be administered.  In the first place, a Supplementary Estimate for £60 million has been taken on the 1995 Health Vote in order to provide the requisite funds.</P>
    <P>Parts 2 and 3 of the Supplementary Estimate explain that the £60 million would be a payment to a special account <Col N="1750" /> for the compensation tribunal.  Secondly, the Appropriation Bill now before the Dáil seeks approval for the creation of the special compensation fund into which the money voted in the Supplementary Estimate will be paid. Section 3 of the Bill provides for the creation of the account and for the rules under which it will operate.  Again, there is nothing underhanded in what we are doing.  It could not be any plainer and is in keeping with established Government financial procedures.  I assure the House that the legal advice obtained by my Department indicates that this is a perfectly proper course of action.</P>
    <P>I stress that what the Government is doing, namely, introducing a Supplementary Estimate to make money available to be paid into a fund created by the Appropriation Bill, was decided some time ago in the light of official and legal advice on accounting procedures and advice on the best way of supporting the work of the tribunal.  There is no question of section 3 having been a last minute addition.  The Bill cannot be finalised until all the Supplementary Estimates are known.  For that reason it is always one of the last items published and brought before the Dáil each year. If the section had been an afterthought, the Supplementary Estimate would not have taken the format it did.  I should also point out that one of the precedents followed in drafting section 3 of the Appropriation Bill was the Air Companies (Amendment) Act, 1993, which created a similar fund to cover the payment of equity to Aer Lingus in the following year.  If anyone cares to check, the wording in the Bill and the Act is almost exactly the same.</P>
    <P>We have agreed to have a debate on the Estimates which will be published on Monday afternoon.  The debate will take place for a number of hours.  I am not sure if the final arrangements have yet been agreed between the Whips, but there will be sufficient time for a debate. If Deputy McCreevy is unhappy with the amount of time allotted, I hope he will convey that to his party Whip.  We will consider a request for extra time if <Col N="1751" /> that is the Opposition's wish, because we have nothing to hide or to fear from a full and comprehensive debate.</P>
    <P>The Estimates for 1996 will be published on Monday afternoon and the debate will be on Tuesday.  I look forward to that debate because in regard to the 1996 Estimates we have managed to carry out a very difficult task which has eluded many other Governments within the European Union, to make sensible and prudent provision for 1996 in a manner that meets all our obligations and requirements as a Government to honour the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work,</i> to ensure essential provision of funds, to maintain existing services on which many people critically depend, and to do so in a way that enhances and secures social cohesion for 1996.  We are doing this against a difficult background where other European countries are finding it very hard to maintain budgetary discipline to ensure they meet the Maastricht criteria.  I confirm that in 1996 we will meet all the Maastricht criteria, and I am confident that we will be adjudged by the European Commission, with respect to the excessive deficit procedures, to have complied with the requirements as described and adjudicated by the Commission.</P>
    <P>I regret there has been some controversy in the way in which this debate has come about.  As the Taoiseach said earlier today, the Opposition were offered a debate on this matter.  That was my understanding.  If that is not correct, I assure Deputy McCreevy that I, as Minister for Finance, have no problem in entering a debate at any stage here or at the Financial Affairs Committee of the House at which both of us participated yesterday afternoon.  Let nobody think that this Administration has anything to hide or is defensive about the course of action it has taken or that it has in any way not lived up to the commitments it entered in its programme of renewal.  All stages of the Bill which we are now debating will be taken today; this is a necessary legal mechanism to <Col N="1752" /> ensure that the moneys voted can be properly appropriated and, consequently, spent within the proper and legitimate obligations that the Constitution imposes on this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to make a couple of points about the Appropriation Act, 1995.  I will deal with the controversial aspect of the £60 million Health Estimate for hepatitis C victims and then I will refer briefly to the overall Estimates and expenditure outturn for 1995.</P>
      <P>Without blowing my own trumpet, I think I know a bit more about the financial procedures of the House than the Taoiseach apparently does, despite his time as Minister for Finance in a previous Government.  As the Minister for Finance rightly points out, the Appropriation Bill gives legal effect to the Estimates and any Supplementary Estimates that have been voted by the House throughout the year.  There have been debates on Appropriation Bills before to give the House an opportunity to discuss various aspects of the Estimates, but generally that is all it is about, so there is generally no need to have a debate on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Appropriation Bill contains an additional section 3 to get over the illegality which was being perpetrated on the taxpayer by the deception of taking £60 million out of next year's Estimates and voting in a Supplementary Estimate for the Health Vote as was done earlier this week.  I have the record of what was said in this House yesterday on the Order of Business and, despite the reasonableness of my friend, the Minister for Finance, the Taoiseach at no stage said that this would be covered by an additional section in any Act.  I stand over the charge I laid at the Government's door on Tuesday.  I said that what the Government was doing amounted to fraudulent accounting, that it was illegal and technically incorrect. In leaks to eminent journalists which appeared in <i>The Irish Times</i> yesterday and in a subsequent comment by a person in RTE, presumably inspired by the <Col N="1753" /> Government, the impression was given that this had been done before and that there was nothing special about this. That is incorrect, and I say that without fear of being contradicted.  As my party leader said yesterday morning, in Christmas week of 1993 the then Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications had to introduce the Air Companies Act to which the Minister referred to allow a sum of money to be paid in the way the Minister outlined. Regarding the other two spins that were put on this in the two media organisations concerned regarding the payment of wages and salaries, those wages and salaries were paid on the last pay-day of the year in which they were voted.  The said journalists were also given to understand that the same thing was done in regard to An Post.  The Minister for Finance, and anybody who was a member of the last Government, know that was also incorrect because that accrued liability had been built up since splitting the old Department of Posts and Telegraphs in 1984.  It is not generally known that it had got to a stage where the trustees of the pension fund were about to refuse to act any more if the Government did not honour its liability and pay moneys into the pension fund.  It had become so serious that there would have been court cases relating to it.  Consequently, out of the proceeds of the tax amnesty, the sum of £70 million was paid to allow the Government to catch up on its liability, and that was for known expenditure which had accrued.  More than anybody else in the House, except for members of the last Government, the Minister for Finance knows that what I said on Tuesday and repeated yesterday was correct.</P>
    <P>The Minister may be aware of my contribution to the tribunal of inquiry into the fall of the last Government and the Charlie McCreevy theory on the lesson to be learned.  In my view the file in the Attorney General's office was forgotten about as happens in large accountants' offices or solicitors' practices. It would have been an embarrassment to state that before the House but <Col N="1754" /> it would have been much better than what happened in the end when a large organisation had to think up an excuse as to why it was forgotten about.</P>
    <P>When the Government was caught with its hands in the till it should have owned up.  The Taoiseach did not do that this morning.  He did not refer to the additional section in the Bill.  When one makes a mistake the simplest thing to do is own up.  Section 3 has the same effect as the Companies Act in 1983 had on Aer Lingus.  I stated it was illegal, incorrect and fraudulent accounting and it has proved to be so.  The Taoiseach should have owned up to that this morning.</P>
    <P>My party leader wrote to the Comptroller and Auditor General late on Tuesday night and before 1 p.m. today he received a reply.  The letter states:</P>
    <P>Dear Deputy,</P>
    <P>Thank you for your letter dated 12 December 1995.  I have noted your concern about the propriety and legality of passing a Supplementary Estimate in the circumstances outlined in your letter.</P>
    <P>Firstly, I would like to point out that I have no function in relation to the Estimates process which is the exclusive preserve of Dáil Éireann. However, I have two functions in relation to the public finances &mdash; a control function and an audit function.</P>
    <P>In the independent exercise of my function as Comptroller, I am required to grant credit on the Central Fund on foot of requisitions from the Minister for Finance provided that I am satisfied as to the correctness of the requisition.  In regard to requisitions relating to the Supply Services, the passing of an Estimate or, as in this case, a Supplementary Estimate, is regarded as the general basis for granting credit, in the expectation that statutory sanction will be subsequently conferred by the Appropriation Act for the particular year.</P>
    <P>In my capacity as Auditor General, I am required as part of my audit to <Col N="1755" /> establish the chargeability of sums to Appropriation Accounts.  If, as seems likely, the £60 million in question is paid into a special account in 1995 and is charged to the 1995 Appropriation Account for the Health Vote, I will need to consider whether the amount is properly chargeable to the Account.  In this connection, I would examine the status of the special account and whether the liability has matured for payment in accordance with Section 24 of the Exchequer and Audit Departments Act, 1866.  I can say that my Office has already written to the accounting officers of the Department of Finance and the Department of Health seeking information on aspects of the procedure adopted.</P>
    <P>If I become of the opinion that the £60 million is not properly chargeable, I have the power under section 3 (2) of the Comptroller and Auditor General (Amendment) Act, 1993 to report on the matter to Dáil Éireann after raising the question with the relevant accounting officer and the Minister for Finance, if necessary.</P>
    <P>I hope that the foregoing has clarified the position for you.</P>
    <P>Section 3 deals with the problem of statutory sanction.  However, the Comptroller and Auditor General raises a subsequent point I did not consider in the allegations I made on Tuesday that have proved to be correct.  The Comptroller and Auditor General is concerned about the status of the special account and whether the liability has matured for payment in accordance with the 1866 Act.  He has written to the accounting officers in the Departments of Health and Finance on the matter.  I knew one could not pre-pay or accrue and the Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach, as a former Minister for Finance, should know that.</P>
    <P>The Comptroller and Auditor General raised a most important point which must be considered.  He states that even though section 3 deals with the statutory <Col N="1756" /> sanction and the illegalities I referred to, there is an additional matter which must be considered.  I know the Minister takes his responsibilities seriously but as far as the £60 million is concerned, the Government was found out and it would well behove it and the Taoiseach to own up.</P>
    <P>I am prepared to debate the Estimates at any time in any forum and stand over the fact that, taking like with like, the increase in current expenditure in 1995 over 1994 is 12 per cent plus. The Minister for Finance knows that is correct.  The increase in current expenditure in 1995 is higher than in 1981. The Minister will remember that famous year and the construction of the Estimates.  The increase in 1995 is the highest in 17 years &mdash; since 1978.  The Minister will remember the inflation rates in those years.  Now we have very low rates of inflation and have increased current spending by up to five times the rate of inflation.  If any economy can do that please supply the name of the said country.  No country is able to do that and survive economically and we will not do so either.</P>

      <P>This House has been the victim of a sustained campaign of deception by Government Ministers over the past few days.  I find it remarkable now to hear the Minister for Finance's defence of what has happened.</P>
      <P>Let us put the record straight.  The terms of reference of the hepatitis C tribunal have not yet been finalised and are still the subject of negotiation.  This tribunal is not at a point where it can entertain any application from anybody who has suffered as a result of the blood transfusions scandal.  Nobody is in a position to claim any of this money now. If a woman presented herself at Government buildings seeking an application form for or the terms of references of the tribunal she would be sent away empty handed.</P>

    <P>Negotiations are still taking place with Positive Action and Transfusion <Col N="1757" /> Positive as to the terms on which this tribunal will function.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach has stated falsely that the motivation in giving £60 million to this tribunal now is to reinforce its credibility.  The members of that tribunal do not need to be insulted and defamed by policital rhetoric of that kind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>None of this is necessary.  The £60 million can be put into it next year.  None of these people has asked the Minister to put £60 million into an account now so they can have more credibility with the hepatitis C victims.  No hepatitis C sufferer will be fooled by such blatant nonsense.  No hepatitis C sufferer believes that whether the money is given in the last fortnight of December or the first fortnight of January in any way affects the credibility or competence of the tribunal. A decision was made for budgetary purposes to make this expenditure occur in this financial year and the Taoiseach defended it in these terms.  The Taoiseach said it time and again; he accused Fianna Fáil of having done it on <Col N="1758" /> many occasions.  He let the cat out of the bag and the question now arises as to whether it is legal.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy McCreevy.  The setting up of a special account is a device with no substance.  This money is not sitting in a shoe box in the Department of Finance.  What is being done is equivalent to an ordinary person such as myself dividing my overdraft into two halves, putting money from one half into the other and claiming I spent money this year.  We are talking about borrowed money which does not exist in a real sense.  The section even provides for the interest accruing on it to be used. This is the greatest joke of all time.  It will go into a special account and some poor civil servant will have to calculate the interest on it, but that will be back to back with the borrowings which financed it.  We are not fools.</P>
      <P>Let us talk sense.  This money is being borrowed.  It is equivalent to me shifting money between two overdraft accounts, or mentally dividing my overdraft into two portions, shifting money from one to another and considering it expenditure.</P>

      <P>I am amused by the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte. The Government had to borrow £1 billion to keep the country going this year and it cannot be in the position of having £60 million in late December to move from one account to another.  This money has to be borrowed and we are paying interest on it.</P>

      <P>Section 3 was framed at a time when it was not known whether the scheme would be in existence and hence it refers to &ldquo;a scheme established or to be established&rdquo; for the purpose of compensating the hepatitis C <Col N="1759" /> sufferers.  That shows how false this transaction is.</P>
      <P>Even if one goes through this device of setting up a special account and the Government's overdraft is divided into two ledgers, the Minister is still faced with the problem underlined in the letter from the Comptroller and Auditor General to Deputy Bertie Ahern.  The Minister cannot get away with such chicanery unless he can establish that the liability matured in this year.</P>
      <P>The Minister accepts and has probably been advised that there is a liability to the hepatitis C victims&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>This situation is different.  The Minister is establishing a special fund which is earmarked for the activities of a tribunal which cannot and will not hand out one penny in this year &mdash; under the scheme it is impossible for the tribunal to do so.  Therefore, the £60 million which is to be allocated to this special account is money in respect of a liability which has not matured in 1995 within the meaning of public accounting procedures.</P>
      <P>The Comptroller and Auditor General is an independent officer responsible to this House and not to the Government.  I am delighted he sees himself in a position of such independence that he will correspond with Members of the House.  The Comptroller and Auditor General makes the point that under section 24 of the 1866 Act the legality of this payment is something he will have to consider.  Only a very naïve person would consider that this liability matures in 1995.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1760" /> If the Comptroller and Auditor General, having reviewed this matter, comes to the opinion that the Minister has acted improperly, the consequences for the Minister are very serious.  This will have been a premeditated effort to bend the rules.  The Minister will have done so in the face of the Opposition, despite a clear warning shot from the Comptroller and Auditor General and in circumstances in which anybody with common sense would have known that because of the way the tribunal is being established, it could not have given out a single penny of this money in 1995 to any of the women eligible to receive <i>ex gratia</i> compensation.</P>
    <P>The special account to be established is a sham to try to circumvent public accounting procedures.  I appeal to the Minister to consider his position.  If he proceeds with this measure and the Comptroller and Auditor General reports to the House in the fullness of time that what was done was in contravention of public accounting procedures, the implications for the Minister's tenure of office are obvious.  I ask the Minister not to go through with this charade but to return to his colleagues in Government, ask for the money to be left out and paid next year and be up front about breaching the guidelines if that has to be done.</P>
    <P>The Minister is being sent in by the Government to front for an action which, if the Comptroller and Auditor General in his constitutional role in relation to this House adjudicates was improper, will have stark consequences for the Minister.  I say this as a constituency colleague of the Minister; this is a make or break occasion for him.  He may get great marks for courage if he gets away with it but it is a resigning matter if the Comptroller and Auditor General reports to the House that the liability was not one which matured in terms of public accounting procedures. It is the Minister's choice to go ahead and make our day.  With the greatest of respect, I say to the Minister that he cannot come to this House and say that our advice was this or that &mdash; as was <Col N="1761" /> done in the Supreme Court decision on the financing of the referendum information campaign.  The Minister has been advised by Deputy McCreevy, has had a shot across his bows by the Comptroller and Auditor General and is hearing from the Opposition that if he goes ahead with this, in spite of all the material that has been put before him, it is his own fate he is putting at risk.  I suggest that the Minister go back to his colleagues in Government and ask them to drop section 3 and make the books honest and then go ahead and pay the £60 million into this account next year. The Minister would get a much fairer hearing in this House even at this eleventh hour if he decided to adopt that course.</P>

If the Minister ignores the advice now and is censured for so doing by the Comptroller and Auditor General, he can blame only himself and his colleagues for having put him up to it.  I am not saying that in an unfriendly way. I genuinely am asking the Minister to delete section 3 from the Bill and make this year's and next year's books honest and to abandon this subterfuge which does not fool anybody.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>Two central issues, which have been dealt with by the two previous speakers, faced the Minister for Finance in trying to agree the 1996 Estimates. I do not think anybody has any doubt about the problems arising from negotiations with the various Departments and the Minister's difficulties in adhering to the 2 per cent increase in real terms in 1996.  I do not think anybody would deny that statement of fact. The Minister then had the difficulties arising from the very genuine problems of women with hepatitis C.  The Government accepted that the liability would fall on it and that the cost to the State would be of the order of approximately £60 million.  It seems that the guidelines the Government has set for itself will be broken but on top of that the Government faces the difficulty of paying £60 million into a special account to set up the tribunal.</P>
      <P>I cannot understand the logic of the Taoiseach's claim that £60 million would need to be established in a fund so that the people would believe the tribunal was serious about its work.  The 1996 Estimates will be published on Monday and could have included this £60 million that the Minister has tried &mdash; and I fear illegally &mdash; to put into the 1995 accounts by way of Supplementary Estimate.  The difficulty to which the Taoiseach alluded as enough to undermine the credibility of the tribunal is the difference between Thursday and next Monday.  I wonder who is stretching credulity in this House?  Clearly, it is the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having listened to the two previous speakers &mdash; I have just received a copy of the Comptroller and Auditor General's letter &mdash; it is quite clear that the Minister is caught in a very difficult <Col N="1763" /> position.  Originally he was caught between the forces of three parties and the demands of 1996 being met.  A way out was found in part &mdash; he is not out of the woods with the 2 per cent increase in real terms &mdash; by some bright spark in keeping the increase to a level that did not exceed the target too seriously and using a mechanism to deal with the £60 million.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCreevy quite rightly says that it is always better to be up front when things are going wrong instead of trying to chase something that is unravelling in illegality.  The Minister should stand back and put the record straight.  Nobody would deny this Minister his right and his opportunity to do this.  He is far more experienced than I and would know the consequences of events when they go out of control, particularly when he is being pulled in so many directions.  I think he realises the consequences of this.</P>
    <P>I do not know if the Minister has been given a copy of the letter from the Comptroller and Auditor General, but we will certainly make one available to him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>The consequences of this letter are very serious.  The second part of the Comptroller and Auditor General's letter states: &ldquo;In this connection I would examine the status of the special account and whether the liability has matured for payment in accordance with section 24 of the Exchequer and Audit Departments Act, 1866.&rdquo; Quite clearly, as has been previously stated, this has implications for the Minister's and the Department's handling of this issue.  The matter was dealt with in this way to resolve a difficult political issue and is not a good accounting practice. The Minister should remember that the greatest problem is when political objectives as opposed to the rightness of the situation are the driving force.  The Minister faces a serious situation and <Col N="1764" /> the House will support him if he stands back from it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I will try to be as succinct as possible but I hope my brevity is not taken for evasion.  I have no interest for as long as I am a Member of this assembly in any way to participate in dishonest books.  Let me say clearly to anybody in this House and particularly to my constituency colleague that the practices that are being currently undertaken in the Department of Finance are on the advice of departmental officials whose integrity is in no way being impugned by this debate.  Every figure of taxpayers' money which is raised by Vote will be properly displayed and accounted for in the books.  Deputy Michael McDowell does no service to this Republic by suggesting that the books are dishonest, misleading and presented in a favourable way.  To suggest that they are dishonest demeans what we are doing in this House.  I ask the Deputy to reflect on that and perhaps withdraw that remark in his own good time.  We are not about dishonesty. The political management of the financial affairs of this country is our task.</P>
      <P>Deputy Michael McDowell's second point was that the integrity and credibility of the tribunal required in some way or another that we put £60 million into it and, therefore, these people in their own right were clearly full of integrity and did not need the underwriting of £60 million to establish their bona fides.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not going to make any cheap shots abour lawyers.  However, the bona fides of the Government in accepting its moral obligations to the victims of hepatitis C had to be demonstrated in the most tangible form possible, which was not the selection of eminent people to serve on the tribunal but the provision of substantial resources as soon as they can be accessed, which is what we did. The same Deputy would be the first to say we were offering less than what the victims could get in the courts if we put up a demeaning amount of money.  We <Col N="1765" /> will have another day to debate this issue in full.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCreevy stated that this year we would have the highest increase in 17 years, even higher than in 1981.  I should like to quote from figures I received from officials in the Department of Finance with whom we have all worked, whom we all respect and who have served this State well.  With regard to the gross non-capital supply services &mdash; I will give this information to the Deputies after the debate &mdash; the increases in constant prices since 1990 when Deputy McDowell was not a Member but his party was in Government&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>He spent a great deal of time trying to get his party out of Government, if I recall correctly; perhaps these figures were one of the motivations.  The real increase in constant prices from 1990-91 for non-capital gross supply services was 6.4 per cent, 6.7 per cent in 1991-92, 6.2 per cent in 1993-94, 4.9 per cent in 1994 and our calculation for 1995 is 4.3 per cent.</P>
      <P>These are not my figures; they were not prepared by the political office of the Labour Party or by other parties in Government but are the objective figures in response to the allegations made by Deputy McCreevy.</P>
      <P>We had a rather fractious debate some weeks ago where allegations about tax, payment and numbers were made by a particular group.  I saw the basis of the calculation on which the 10 per cent more claim was made.  The devil can quote more than the scriptures for his purposes &mdash; devilish accountants can quote numbers even more effectively. We have the temptation for devilish quoting in accounting procedures of figures in any way they like. Let us not get into this false debate because it has no winners.</P>

It is politically dishonest &mdash; I am not referring to anybody's moral standards &mdash; of this Government to try to pretend that this expenditure is a 1995 expenditure or, to use the phrase used by the Comptroller and Auditor General in his letter of which the Minister has a copy, to suggest that the liability for payment by the tribunal has matured in 1995.  It has not matured in 1995 but is a 1996 liability.  When the Department of Health officials went before a committee of this House to justify this extra allocation they said it was in relation to moneys which would be payable in 1996.

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen) Nora Owen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1, 50 and 118 together.</P>
      <P>These questions arise from the judgment of the Central Criminal Court of 5 December last in the case of the DPP <i>v.</i> JR In that case Mr. Justice Carney, although inclined to impose a life sentence, considered that he was precluded from doing so by superior court judgments which obliged him to reduce the sentence to take account of a guilty plea.  This was a particularly horrific case involving rape and other heinous sexual crimes against young people ranging in age from four to 14 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The accused pleaded guilty to ten counts of rape, five counts of unlawful carnal knowledge, seven counts of indecent assault and five counts of sexual <Col N="1771" /> assault.  The accused was sentenced to 15 years for the rape offences, 15 years' penal servitude for the unlawful carnal knowledge offences and six years and four years' imprisonment, respectively, for the indecent and sexual assault offences, all sentences to run concurrently.</P>
    <P>Mr. Justice Carney said he would have wished to have been free to consider the imposition of a life sentence in this case.  While the maximum statutory penalty in respect of many of the counts in the indictment was either imprisonment or penal servitude for life, it was clear from the decisions of courts binding on him that this sentence was not open to him in this case, particularly in the light of the accused's plea of guilty.</P>
    <P>Mr. Justice Carney said he would have wished to consider a life sentence for a number of specified reasons, including the capacity of the Minister's expert advisers to evaluate when and if a release would be safe from the standpoint of the community in general and its children in particular.</P>
    <P>The judge quoted at some length from a number of court decisions.  In the first such decision, the DPP <i>v.</i> James Jackson 1993, Hederman J. said that preventive detention was not known to our judicial system and in an apparent reference to the evaluation by the authorities of the fitness of the persons for release having regard to the safety of the community, he said that sentencing policy was exclusively a matter for the Judiciary and not for the Executive.  In the second judgment G <i>v.</i> DPP 1993 Finlay C.J. concluded that a life sentence should be reduced to determinate sentence to mark and give effect to the mitigating factor arising from the admission and plea of guilty by the accused at an early stage.</P>
    <P>The House will appreciate that it would be inappropriate for me to comment on a judicial decision in any particular case and I cannot comment on the sentencing decision in this case.</P>
    <P>It is of course my function to ensure <Col N="1772" /> that the law offers the maximum protection to society against the criminal. Accordingly if, having given this judgment the detailed examination it requires, I am satisfied there are deficiencies in the law and that it needs to be changed for the good of society, and in the interests of the victim and, in particular, children, I will not be slow to bring forward appropriate legislative proposals.</P>
    <P>The issues which this judgment raises are serious and complex and require detailed examination and analysis.  That examination must take account of the need for maximum protection of our community and our children.  It must also take account of the victims of rape and other sexual offences who are spared the trauma of giving painful evidence in court when an accused pleads guilty in the expectation of a reduced sentence.</P>
    <P>I am conscious of the fact that sentencing guidelines have not been laid down by the Oireachtas or to any significant extent by the courts.  The solution to the issues raised by Mr. Justice Carney's judgment may more appropriately lie in sentencing guidelines to assist the courts in imposing appropriate and consistent sentences.</P>
    <P>The question of sentencing guidelines is being examined by the Law Reform Commission in its review of sentencing policy.  The commission has already published a comprehensive discussion document on that topic which runs to more than 400 pages and deals with a wide range of issues including such matters as aggravating and mitigating factors and maximum, minimum and mandatory sentencing.  I understand that the commission's final report will be published early next year and I will examine it immediately it is available.</P>
    <P>I reiterate my assurance that, following a detailed examination of Mr. Justice Carney's judgment which clearly raises the question of a guilty plea and whether it should at all times lead to benefit to the convicted person, I will not be slow to bring forward any legislative proposals which I consider are <Col N="1773" /> necessary to offer the maximum protection to society against sexual and other serious criminal offences.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for her reply.  Will she accept that as a court must take into account the plea of guilty when handing down a sentence and under the Constitution our law cannot provide for preventive detention, the only kind of detention that would be effective in cases of horrific sexual assault, rape and so on is a mandatory life sentence?  Even though an individual who is given a determinate sentence of a number of years is likely to reoffend, he must be released into society.  Will the Minister agree that the only way to adequately protect society in cases as horrific as the recent one in which Mr. Justice Carney handed down sentence is to provide for a life sentence so that the Department's experts can assure the Government prior to the release of such offenders that they are not likely to reoffend?  If they are likely to reoffend they should be detained until such time as the Government is satisfied they will not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it the Deputy is asking if I would consider introducing mandatory sentences, particularly for serious crime.  This is not a straightforward matter.  As I stated in my reply, Mr. Justice Carney indicated that the plea of guilty was the reason he could not impose a life sentence in the recent case.  The judge would have had the freedom to impose a life sentence for the crimes committed by the accused if he had not pleaded guilty because some of the offences he committed carry a maximum sentence of life.  The accused pleaded guilty and the judge quoted two previous cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The issue of pleading guilty and mitigation of sentence applies to more than serious sexual offences.  Many concerns have been expressed about introducing mandatory sentences.  In the case of sexual offences, if the accused pleads guilty the victim will not be subjected to questioning in the court and many people, <Col N="1774" /> including the chairperson of the Rape Crisis Centre, have highlighted the importance of protecting in law the victims of sexual offences from exposure to difficult questioning in court.</P>
    <P>This is a complex matter which will come up again for discussion when the Law Reform Commission has completed its study of sentencing policy. However, I do not think it is the answer although I will introduce amending legislation if it is found necessary to do so having considered previous court cases in which a guilty plea was entered.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that in any assessment of the matter the trauma suffered by the victims in having to go through a trial will have to be balanced against their fear that the individual in question may be released after a number of years and is likely to reoffend?  The fears of potential victims in this respect should also be taken into account.  The only way to adequately protect society from habitual paedophiles is to provide for a mandatory life sentence.  The Minister will have to give this proposal favourable consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not the policy of the Department of Justice to grant early release to sex offenders.  I cannot say what a future Minister might do in ten or 11 years time when the case of a person sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 15 years comes up for review.  A new programme for sex offenders under which consideration may be given to this matter is being introduced.  The Deputy may take it, however, that such offenders will serve the 15 years unless a change is made.</P>

    <Col N="1775" />
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I dealt with the general issue of crime in a response to a previous parliamentary question tabled by the Deputy in October 1995 and most of what I had to say then is equally relevant to the issue of so-called &ldquo;gangland&rdquo; violence.  Setting out the precise nature of the problem and dealing with the fundamental causes are just as necessary when dealing with this specific type of crime as when dealing with the general crime problem.</P>
      <P>I take it that the Deputy's question is tabled in the context of the recent killings and other violence perpetrated by criminal elements in Dublin.  All these incidents are the subjects of detailed Garda investigations.  In this regard, the Garda Síochána allocate optimum resources to the investigation of all murders. The primary task is to identify those responsible and to assemble evidence to support their prosecution. Special attention is also directed to the motivation involved.</P>
      <P>The Serious Crime Squad at the Central Detective Unit gathers intelligence and information on all serious crimes, including murders.  Every effort is made in the examination and collation of this material to establish if the crimes are linked in any way.  This includes, in the case of murder, trying to establish if there is a common perpetrator for two or more offences.  The Garda authorities are satisfied that maximum resources are deployed to solve all murder cases, including the identification of possible so-called contract killers.  In addition, the Garda, on an ongoing basis, target and keep under surveillance persons suspected of involvement in serious crime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would appear that many of the incidents are related to the drugs trade, but until investigations are complete it is not possible to confirm this.  In this regard, the Deputy will be aware that I have already taken it as one of the cornerstones of our strategic response to the crime problem that we comprehensively tackle the drugs problem.  Among the measures being put in place are the setting up of a Garda National Drugs Unit <Col N="1776" /> and the establishment of a joint task force comprising members of all the law enforcement agencies involved in the fight against drugs: the Garda, the Customs and Excise Service and the Naval Service.  These developments will enhance our capability to hit the drug traffickers and, in this regard, special mention must be made of the operation which led to the biggest seizure of drugs in the history of the State at Urlingford last month.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>In the light of the recent killings in Dublin, will the Minister consider establishing a specialised Garda squad comparable to the murder squad to zone in on this area of criminal activity?  Does she believe that it is necessary to do this?  Does she accept that the time has come for the Revenue Commissioners, in liaison with the Garda Síochána, to make inroads to the affairs of those whose lifestyles do not match their visible means of income?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a Serious Crime Squad at the Central Detective Unit. The new National Drugs Unit, which operates on a countrywide basis, will tackle crimes such as these perpetrated in different districts and counties.  I am satisfied that the structures and resources available to the Garda Síochána are adequate.</P>
      <P>On the wider question of targeting the drug barons, the package approved by the Government provides for the involvement of the Revenue Commissioners and the Customs service in liaison with the Garda Síochána.  I am satisfied that progress is being made, although at times it will necessarily be slow.  While some people think that the persons in question can be grabbed and locked up, the Garda Síochána still have to produce the evidence in court to secure a conviction.  I share the public's frustration when they read about the activities of the crime bosses in the newspapers, but the justice system requires the gathering of evidence.</P>

      <Col N="1777" /> When this has been gathered prosecutions will be brought by the Garda Síochána.</P>

      <P>Although that is a separate question I will consider the Deputy's suggestion.  We already have strong gun laws under which licences may be issued by chief superintendents.  The guns used in these crimes are not always capable of being traced as they are unlicensed.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3, 14 and 41 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that the work and functions of the Chief State Solicitor's office are being examined as part of the Strategic Management Initiative process in the Office of the Attorney General.  The work and functions, in particular, of the <Col N="1778" /> Chief State Solicitor's office in relation to the criminal prosecution system and the question of a unified prosecution agency will be addressed by the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions in the context of its own Strategic Management Initiative.  In addition, as mentioned by the Taoiseach in a reply to Parliamentary Question No. 3 of 24 October 1995, the Department of Finance has commenced a review of the structure and organisation of the Director's Office.</P>
    <P>While the Government would be prepared to examine any proposal which might lead to improved efficiency in prosecuting criminal cases, the House will appreciate that consideration of the desirability of a unified prosecution agency must await the outcome of the strategic management work and the other study to which I have referred.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Director of Public Prosecutions &mdash; an eminent officeholder who has been in office for 20 years &mdash; has called for a unified prosecution service to overcome the duplication of work and delays in the present prosecution service which he described as absurd.  Has the Minister met him to discuss these comments on a sensitive matter and, if so, did she discuss other aspects of the operations of his office which are the source of public concern, including for example, the need for liaison with victims of crime?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not met the Director of Public Prosecutions to discuss the article in the magazine mentioned or any of the other statements made by him in public.  As the Deputy is aware, the Office of the DPP was set up in 1974 and it is independent of the Department of Justice and the Executive.  It would be inappropriate for me to appear to be in some way guiding or directing the DPP on the action he should take on any case.  I cannot do that.  I have met him socially from time to time, but I have not met him officially to discuss his comments.  It should be noted that his article was extremely lengthy and makes <Col N="1779" /> good reading.  He went into great detail about the type of justice system here.  It would appear that he is arguing for an examination of the system in terms of moving from an adversarial to an inquisitorial system similar to that which obtains in other jurisdictions.  That would involve a major change and would require examination.  The operation of the Office of the DPP is subject to the provisions of the strategic management initiative and the practical running of the office is subject to examination by the Department of Finance. When those examinations have been carried out, we may see improvements in the practical running of the office.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>In his article the Director of Public Prosecutions raised the fact that there was a split in the present system as between the decision making process in which he is involved and the initiation of a case which is organised by State solicitors around the country.  What is the Minister's view of those difficulties?  Why does she consider that she is precluded from having a meeting with the Director of Public Prosecutions to discuss what I consider are valid and legitimate concerns publicly expressed by him?  I do not understand why the Minister considers that the independence of the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions precludes her from having discussions with him when he wants to have discussions with somebody to discuss the inadequacies in the prosecution service.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I explained why it is not appropriate for me to talk to the DPP about the changes which he believes might come about.  There may be a time when I consider that is appropriate.  The DPP is independent of the Department of Justice and I am not in a position to tell him how he should change the system. He has his methods of examining the system and that is taking place currently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1780" /> Regarding the other issues he raised about changes in structures, those structures have existed since the establishment of the Office of the DPP.  The strategic management initiative is being carried out and I imagine all these issues will be examined.  I have responsibility for the criminal justice side of his work. As part of the examination of that office, the existing structures are being examined.  When that examination is completed I will take whatever action I consider appropriate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister does not accept that the independence of the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions can survive a greater degree of accountability and consultation with the Executive.  Does the Minister consider it improper of the Director of Public Prosecutions to go on the Marian Finucane programme when he has never been allowed to address this House or a Dáil committee?  Is she aware that the Select Committee on Legislation and Security has invited the Director of Public Prosecutions to attend one of its meetings and does she approve of that?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of measures have already been taken in recent times to make the judicial system more user-friendly and receptive for victims of crime.  These include: the provision in some courthouses of accommodation facilities for use by the Association for Victim Support and the commitment for such facilities in all refurbished courthouses; the provision in new and refurbished courthouses of family law suites where family law cases can be dealt with apart from the main court business; the grant-aiding of the Association for Victim Support by my Department since 1985; the introduction in the Four <Col N="1782" /> Courts, Dublin of a closed circuit television system, known as video link, to enable persons under 17 years of age to give evidence without having to go into the courtroom in cases involving sexual offences and offences involving violence; in cases where a witness is giving evidence through video link, neither the judge nor the barrister or solicitor concerned in the examination of the witness is permitted to wear a wig or gown &mdash; the wearing of wigs by barristers and solicitors in family law proceedings is also prohibited by statute; in cases involving sexual offences or offences involving violence, the court shall take into account and may receive victim impact reports in determining the sentence to be imposed &mdash; I understand that the courts are seeking such reports on an ever-increasing scale; and in the context of judicial training, funding was made available to the Chief Justice for a conference in May 1994 on the effects of crime on victims of crime at which outside experts spoke.</P>
      <P>I am committed through the courts building programme, to providing the most up-to-date facilities for all persons who attend court.  Included in this programme is the provision of rooms for the use by the Association for Victim Support.  In so far as is practicable the victim support rooms are provided in an area away from the courtroom area to provide an element of privacy for the victim prior to and following the court hearing.</P>
      <P>I am particularly pleased by and welcome an initiative being taken by the Chief Justice in setting up a Judicial Studies Institute which will have responsibility for induction courses for newly appointed judges and continuing courses of education and training for members of the Judiciary.</P>
      <P>In line with other measures I am taking to make the courts more user-friendly, a range of information booklets is in the course of preparation in my Department for the benefit of adult victims/witnesses, child victims/ witnesses and their parents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1783" /> I have recently appointed a working group on a courts commission whose terms of reference include the review of &ldquo;the operation of the courts system, having regard to the level and quality of service provided to the public&rdquo; which would include victims of crime.  I look forward to receiving the recommendations of the working group in this regard.</P>
    <P>The Government's policy agreement, <i>A Government of Renewal,</i> gives a commitment to draw up a charter for victims of crime and work on this charter is at an advanced stage in my Department.  I hope to receive a first draft of the charter before Christmas and I will be liaising with the Association for Victim Support before finalising the charter.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that victims and their families often do not hear evidence in court because of the poor acoustics?  Is she further aware that in a murder case gruesome photographs that may be passed around the court by counsel and others unwittingly cause extreme distress to members of the deceased person's family?  Will the Minister accept that not only should those matters be rectified but at the very least a room in the courthouse should be provided for victims and their families where they could be given refreshments and treated with dignity?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I will reply to the Deputy's last question first.  I explained that I have commenced providing victim support rooms in courts.  I recently opened the District Court in Cork and met a victim support group there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>There is such a facility in a number of courts.  Victims did not appear on the scene only yesterday and at least I am doing something to provide support for them now.  It will take some time to complete the refurbishment programme and provide a victim support <Col N="1784" /> room in all courthouses, but we are making progress.</P>
      <P>The practical matter of victims and their families not hearing evidence in court was raised with me when I met members of the Association for Victim Support during recent weeks.  I have asked them to list the courts where the acoustics are creating that type of difficulty. They brought to my attention the effect on victims of gruesome implements and photographs left lying on the table.  I indicated to them that I would raise that issue with the working group on the courts and get word back to the judges.  Weapons are usually left on the table, but it should be possible to change that bad practice.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister favourably consider providing a civil servant, an officer or a clerk of the court to advise victims and or their families of precisely what is taking place in the trial in question?  Often people do not know what is going on and become extremely confused, agitated and depressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>That suggestion has been made to me.  I am aware that in many instances, victims report that they get great assistance from the court officers but from time to time they can feel isolated. The Association for Victim Support provides a good service and often accompanies a victim into court, so that they have somebody sitting there.  I was disturbed to hear that in one instance they were asked to leave the court.  That should not happen.  I will raise the question of appointing an officer when I am considering the charter for victims of crime.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Justice</askee>
      <Quest>the number of sex offenders in prison who have been convicted of more than one offence of a sexual nature; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not clear as to the precise information sought by the Deputy.  In some cases, offenders may be convicted and sentenced at a single court sitting, of a number of offences against one or more persons, occurring, perhaps, over a period of years; this can happen, for example, where paedophile crime is involved.  There can also, of course, be convictions for more than one sexual offence in the course of a single assault incident on one individual.</P>
      <P>It may be that what the Deputy is looking for is not the number of offences in respect of which current sentences are being served by individual prisoners, but an indication, in the case of sex offenders now in prison, of the number of them who had convictions for sexual offences in the past.  The information available to the prison authorities suggests that the proportion of offenders in this cetegory is quite small.</P>
      <P>I will endeavour to supply whatever statistics the Deputy seeks, but I have to explain that it may take time to extract the precise information sought.  This is because information on individual prisoners is maintained on their individual files and accessed by staff who need relevant details.</P>
      <P>By and large, detailed statistical information would fall to be compiled on the group as a whole only if it were considered useful by the professional staff dealing with these offenders.</P>
      <P>I have acknowledged in the past, of course, the need for more comprehensive statistics in the criminal justice area as a whole and I am glad that work is already under way in this regard.  The position is that the prisoner record system which has not been in place for a number of years is currently being reviewed to ensure that it will, in future, be able to compile, collate and make available statistics relevant to the prison system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>It is extremely disappointing and frustrating, whenever questions are tabled in relation to statistics for the prison system, that often the Minister is unable to reply.  I put it to the Minister that sometimes &mdash; and perhaps often &mdash; recidivism among paedophiles can be high.  In this context will she accept that handling down a prison sentence of a period of years, while the Minister may not allow an early release in such cases, means that at the end of the sentence the individual concerned, even though he may be likely to reoffend, must be released?  This problem must be resolved immediately and one does not have to study case law in great depth to understand and implement that objective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question of statistics, I have openly admitted in this House that I am not satisfied with the way in which I can answer such questions. It is not today or yesterday that work should have been done on creating a system from which we can draw down statistics more easily.  Our courts, prisons and Garda stations are only now being brought up to date in computer systems.  Over the coming years that will make it easier to extract information more speedily.  I had another difficulty in that Deputy O'Donoghue's question was not clear.  I was not sure of what he wanted.  However, I can inform him that 226 prisoners are serving sentences for sex related offences but I cannot say whether some had previous convictions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has not answered the second part of my question.  Perhaps she will address it and when doing so to address, also, the following? Her colleague, the Minister of State Deputy Currie, has made it clear that the number of allegations of sexual offences against children has increased dramatically in recent years.  Therefore, it behoves the Minister for Justice to introduce legislation which will adequately address a growing problem in Irish society, possibly related to <Col N="1787" /> drugs.  She must, as a matter of necessity, introduce penalties which the courts can impose and which will adequately fit the horrific type of offences to which I am referring.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>The second part of the Deputy's earlier question, as I understood it, was more of a statement than a question.  It related to what can be done with people who have completed their sentence and whether there is any way in which they can be detained further.  We are back to the idea of mandatory sentencing.  A sentence of life imprisonment for a sexual offender is allowable under our laws.  The Criminal Law (Rape) Act, 1981, amended our laws very considerably.  Earlier this year I introduced the Incest Act to ensure the 1908 Act was amended.  If an offender gets a life sentence and a future Minister is inclined to release that person, it means that controls and conditions can be imposed on that release for the rest of his life.  I understand from the Department of Health and the Garda that many cases of sex offences against children are being investigated.  I assure the Deputy that our laws are already very stringent in this regard.  If any breach in the law comes to light I will fill it as I did earlier this year in relation to the incest laws I corrected it immediately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to possible measures to deal with the problem of sexual offenders reoffending, will she consider the present situation whereby every offender automatically qualifies for a 25 per cent remission of sentence? Would it be appropriate in the case of serious sexual offences that the automatic 25 per cent remission should not apply, particularly where it is clear from those working with the offender that there is a danger that the person would reoffend?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>The remission is not automatic, but the point raised by the Deputy is valid.  The position is that <Col N="1788" /> people who commit these awful offences are not treated the same way as other prisoners and they serve to the last day.  There is also a school of thought that says if they serve the whole sentence they should walk out of the prison without any conditions or controls being imposed on them.  Some advisers and experts say it is better to have a period where people are resocialising to ascertain whether they will behave.  I am examining a number of measures available in other jurisdictions to monitor people who have committed these awful crimes.  The fact is that people are frightened as they will return to the communities where they committed the crimes.  The measures that work in other jurisdictions are electronic tagging and proper registering of where people will live after leaving prison &mdash; that that information will be available to the Garda.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Given that preventive detention <i>per se</i> is not allowable under law, the only effective form of preventive detention in paedophile cases where people are likely to reoffend is a mandatory life sentence.  This is the only way an individual who is released can be monitored by the Department's experts.  This could not be done in the case of a person who has served a determinate sentence.  Given the increase in the number of these offences, the Minister must as a matter of urgency introduce mandatory life sentencing in horrific cases of child sexual abuse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Life sentences are available for many of these offences and I hope judges will continue to impose them.  The issue of guilty pleas is of particular concern.  I urge the Deputy to await the report of the Law Reform Commission on mandatory life sentences. There may well be very good reasons for the introduction of mandatory life sentences in specific serious cases but no previous Government or Minister has gone down this road given the difficulties involved.  A person who <Col N="1789" /> receives a life sentence can be controlled for the rest of his life and monitored if he is given early release after 11 or 15 years, the usual length of the sentence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6, 7, 20, 49 and 115 together. The statutory authority for the release of most sentenced prisoners rests with the Minister for Justice under section 2 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1960.  While <Col N="1790" /> I make the decision in many cases, for administrative reasons this is not always possible.  In cases where I do not authorise a release the decision is taken by a senior official of my Department following consultation with the prison governor and the Garda Síochána.</P>
      <P>When offenders serving longer sentences, including life, have served seven years of their sentences they are entitled to have their cases reviewed by the sentence review group.  This is a non-statutory body chaired by Ms Mary Kotsonouris, a former judge of the District Court.  Recommendations by the group are submitted to me for decision in each case.</P>
      <P>In the case of offenders who do not qualify, on the basis of length of sentence served, for consideration by the sentence review group a system of review meetings is operated at all the prisons and places of detention.  These meetings, which are always attended by a senior official of my Department, enable the views of the various agencies dealing with an offender - such as the prison governor, prison staff, psychiatric and psychological services, chaplains and the probation and welfare service, &mdash; to be fully taken into account in the management of their sentences which may in suitable cases include the granting of temporary release.</P>
      <P>Temporary release arrangements are, in effect, our system of parole, which is a feature of prison systems worldwide. Paroles are an important vehicle for reintegrating an offender into the community in a planned way.  While due regard must be had to any risk which a particular release might pose, the generally accepted view is that the risk to the community would be even greater if, in certain cases, attempts at planned reintegration of offenders were not made since they must return to the community anyway on the expiry of their sentence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where temporary release is granted it is always subject to conditions.  In all cases there is the condition that the person released must be of good behaviour. <Col N="1791" /> Other conditions could include supervision by the probation and welfare service and reporting at regular intervals to a Garda station etc.  Temporary release automatically ends if any conditions are breached, in which event the individual concerned can be immediately returned to custody without warrant.</P>
    <P>While the system of temporary release is soundly based, I am also aware that, due to a shortage of prison accommodation, some offenders are granted temporary release earlier than would otherwise be the case.  I do not believe, however, this problem can be addressed by means of changes to the guidelines under which the system currently operates.  No matter what system or set of guidelines was in place, it would have to operate as the present system does on the principle that those released are, on the basis of the best advice available, the most suitable candidates for release on the day.</P>
    <P>The document entitled &ldquo;The Management of Offenders &mdash; A Five Year Plan&rdquo; which was published last year, contains in chapter 5, a review of the current temporary release arrangements together with a number of specific proposals for the future.  These proposals provide for a reduction in the number of unsupervised releases in favour of a system when the majority of releases would be closely supervised by the probation and welfare service.  The plan also provides for an increase in the number of prison spaces and this aspect is currently under active consideration.</P>
    <P>The establishment of a prisons board and a parole board are among a number of options being examined actively in accordance with the commitment contained at paragraph 119 of the <i>Programme for Government,</i> published in December, 1994.  The outcome of this examination will, in the first instance, be brought before the Government for its consideration as soon as possible.  There is one outstanding legal action, and one claim for damages which may result in legal action, against the State arising out <Col N="1792" /> of criminal offences allegedly committed by prisoners while on temporary release from prison.  The legal action relates to a claim for damages arising from a malicious wounding conviction dating from 1992.  The claim arises from a conviction for malicious damage and arson in 1993.  Legal proceedings have not been initiated in the latter case.</P>
    <P>On 13 December last a total of 408 offenders were on temporary release. These releases were granted for various periods of time as appropriate, ranging from a few hours to weekly renewable temporary release.  Records are not maintained in such a manner as to indicate the number of offenders convicted of crimes while on temporary release.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept the probability that thousands of crimes are committed by people on temporary release?  Does she further accept that one of the main criterion used for granting temporary release is the lack of prison spaces and that it is entirely wrong in any democratic society to use this criterion to decide whether an individual should be granted temporary release and allowed back into society where he may prey on people?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept the probability that thousands of crimes are committed by people on temporary release as I do not have evidence to support it.  With respect, I do not think the Deputy has any such evidence either.  I am not in the business of creating a new rumour that thousands of crimes are committed by people on early release. A person on early release who commits a crime and is caught by the Garda is immediately returned to prison to serve the rest of his sentence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree there is a shortage of prison spaces.  There was a shortage of prison spaces when I came into office on 15 December last year but I hope to have addressed this issue by the time I leave office.  The reality is that improved laws and detection rates have led to the conviction of more people and a need for more prison spaces.  I am glad to say that <Col N="1793" /> I recently created 33 additional places in St. Patrick's Institution.  I am actively working to ensure that more prison places can be made available as soon as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said one of the conditions for granting temporary release is that the person must be of good behaviour.  Given that she cannot say the number of offences committed by persons on temporary release, who monitors the adherence to or breach of that condition?  If the Minister has no statistics in this respect this means nobody monitors what these people do when they are released and she is presiding over a chaotic system of temporary release.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>A person is considered to be of good behaviour if he is not caught committing another crime.  Other proofs include supervision by the Probation and Welfare Service and reporting to Garda stations on a regular basis.  Those conditions oblige the offender to go to the Garda station or to report to the Probation and Welfare Service.  It is a condition of release that the prisoners must be of good behaviour and the way it is monitored is based on whether they come back into prison again.  One has to assume that they are of good behaviour unless they return, having committed a crime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>When I asked the Minister in a previous question how many people were returned to jail having committed an offence, she was not in a position to reply with the information because the statistics are not kept.  How is the Minister presenting this temporary release system when good behaviour is one of the conditions of release yet there is no evaluation or monitoring of the behaviour of former prisoners?  It seems a chaotic, unevaluated and uncertain system that is dominated by ad hockery.  The Minister gave the impression earlier that this was a carefully considered process but on the basis of her replies today that there are <Col N="1794" /> no statistics as to what happens to prisoners after their release and no information as to whether they reoffend, it is not a considered and carefully evaluated process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Donnell is correct in the sense that I have already said, and will say it again at the risk of boring Members, there is a system in place from which it is very difficult to pull this information out.  I share Deputies' frustration and am working to change the position so that whoever inherits my job will not inherit the difficulties I have inherited in trying to pull out statistical information.</P>
      <P>People on temporary release either for a short or long period are in some instances subject to conditions such as reporting to Garda stations or to be of good behaviour and if they do not come back to prison, one assumes they have been of good behaviour.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>In the midst of what is unquestionably a mammoth crime wave, surely the very least people can expect when the Minister cannot provide the necessary prison places and people are allowed out on temporary release, though still under the theoretical control of the prison system, would be the introduction of electronic tagging for people on temporary release?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Electronic tagging is used in other jurisdictions and I am having it examined.  Recently, a senior garda visited a jurisdiction in which this is available and I recently had a discussion with a group of Texan judges.  I do not know whether Texas is a good example because they have 160,000 people in their State prisons, one million people in their county prisons and a plethora of other situations.  Their large volume of prison places is fully utilised.  I am examining electronic tagging and I will certainly let the Deputy know the outcome of my examination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>We know that the number of temporary release orders is <Col N="1795" /> increasing every year, given the shortage of space in prisons.  I understand that in 1993 there were 3,500 orders for full temporary release.  Is the Minister in possession of the 1994 figures?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>That report has been approved for publication and as far as I know the mechanism is in place and is probably being laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas even as I speak.  The reports normally only come out at this time of the year and I can give Deputies the dates of the previous four or five reports.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 and 21 together.  I issued a public statement concerning my approach to this matter on 7 November last, which among other things outlined the history of this dispute.  The dispute became public knowledge at the Garda <Col N="1796" /> Representative Association annual delegate conference in 1994.  However there are indications that there were serious disagreements within the association, in one form or another, for some time prior to that.</P>
      <P>To date there have been four initiatives aimed at resolving the dispute. Two of these initiatives had been taken prior to my appointment as Minister for Justice.  They were the offer by the Garda Commissioner of an assistant commissioner to act as a mediator, and mediation in a personal capacity by Mr. Kieran Mulvey, chief executive of the Labour Relations Commission.</P>
      <P>The mediation proposed by the Garda Commissioner never got off the ground as the GRA did not take up his offer.  The second initiative, which was taken by my predecessor, involved a very substantial attempt by Mr. Mulvey to resolve the issue.  The report which he prepared for my predecessor contained a range of recommendations. Some significant recommendations proved unacceptable to the GRA, however, with the result that this initiative also failed.</P>
      <P>On my appointment, I made clear my intention to follow the path of reason and consultation, and to listen carefully to what the three sides to the dispute had to say.  Based on those consultations, I prepared a discussion document with suggestions aimed at reconciling differences.  I circulated this document to the three groups in March 1995.  Among the matters addressed in that document were the question of democracy within the GRA, the system of election of officers, the appointment of trustees, the management of standing orders and the need for review of the GRA's disciplinary procedures.</P>
      <P>The responses from the three groups to my discussion document, while comprehensive and in many respects encouraging, did not have sufficient common ground to suggest that I could take these ideas further with any real hope of success &mdash; at least not in the immediate future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1797" /> When I addressed the annual delegate conference of the GRA in May this year, I asked the association to consider whether an agreed form of arbitration might be acceptable in principle. I was very pleased when, eventually, all three groups to the dispute agreed to arbitration.  Mr. John Horgan, a former chairman of the Labour Court, who acted as chairman, having had separate discussions with each group, arranged for a first meeting of all groups together on 5 October 1995.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately the arbitration process also failed.  Mr. Horgan reported to me that he was not satisfied he could expect sufficient co-operation from the GRA to address the issues involved.  I should say, however, that the GRA denies that they showed an unwillingness to co-operate. I am very disappointed that yet another attempt to bring this deep-rooted and damaging dispute to an end has failed.  While I am still convinced that the best approach is to try to bring about by agreement the structural and other changes which would carry the prospect that all gardaí could again have confidence in the GRA, I am now, regrettably, forced to conclude that this is unlikely to be achieved by the parties themselves.</P>
    <P>I am sure the House will agree when I say that thousands of gardaí cannot be left in a position where they are effectively without representation in matters of pay and conditions of service.  Not only are the interests of individual gardaí not being properly served while this dispute continues but the image of the force as a whole is being seriously eroded.  There are now almost 2,500 gardaí who are not contributing membership subscriptions to the GRA and a further 1,000 gardaí in four Garda divisions &mdash; Louth-Meath, Cavan-Monaghan, Cork West and Tipperary &mdash; who, though members of the association, are not fully participating in the activities of the association.  A sizeable number of the 2,500 who are no longer members of the GRA are members of a group known as the Garda Federation. Although this organisation has sought <Col N="1798" /> recognition in law to negotiate pay and conditions on behalf of its members, I have not acceded to the request.</P>
    <P>Having carefully reviewed the options available to me, I finally decided, following consultation with the Attorney General, to commence the urgent preparation of legislation to bring about, by law, the changes which will ensure that the association representing gardaí is one to which gardaí generally will feel able to give their full support.  The legislation will specify certain provisions which the constitution of a Garda representative association must contain in order to be qualified as the representative body with the sole right to negotiate pay and conditions on behalf of members.  I believe there will be wide support in the House for this legislation because there is recognition, on all sides, of the need to remove the obstacles which stand in the way of bringing this very damaging representation dispute to an end.</P>
    <P>Draft heads of the Bill are, at present, being prepared in my Department and I hope to submit them to Government for approval to draft the Bill shortly.  It would be inappropriate for me to give details of the proposed legislation in advance of submitting it to the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister saying it is her intention to abolish the Garda Representative Association?  Is she in consultation with the parties to the dispute in drawing up this legislation to ensure its provisions will be complied with by all concerned?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am preparing legislation to incorporate some of the conditions that must be included in the constitution of a Garda representative association. When that legislation is passed any association wishing to represent gardaí in their pay negotiations, welfare and services and is recognised under the 1977 Act must abide by its provisions.  It <Col N="1799" /> is my hope that will allow for the establishment of an association that will commend itself to all members of the force of the rank of garda.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Once this legislation has been passed and its provisions enshrined in the constitution of their representative association, there will be one association only representing all members of the force of garda rank in the matter of pay, conditions and welfare services.  I do not consider it would be appropriate to have two associations representing gardaí which I believe would lead to a perpetuation of the dispute we witnessed, with competition between the two, perhaps endeavouring to encourage members to submit all sorts of counter claims and so on.  It would be more appropriate to have one representative association to which all garda ranks could give allegiance.  I wish I did not have to introduce this legislation but my predecessor and I have done everything possible to bring the two sides together without success.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it was President Jefferson who said of Chief Justice John Marshall: John Marshall has given his judgment, let him now enforce it if he can.  How does the Minister intend, through legislation only, to reconcile the deep differences between the parties to this dispute?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>When this legislation has been passed the constitution of the Garda Representative Association may be found not to be in keeping with it, and it will be necessary for the GRA or some members of the Garda Síochána to call a meeting to amend that constitution, or draw up another, that will allow me, as Minister, to recognise such an association.  When the legislation has been passed I will have to examine the <Col N="1800" /> constitution of the existing Garda Representative Association and, if I discover it does not meet those legislative requirements, its constitution will have to be amended to allow it continue to represent them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>In so doing is the Minister not merely placing a road block further down the road, in that if the Garda Representative Association does not comply with the terms of the legislation, in effect she will be abolishing it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>That will be their choice. I am reluctantly bringing forward legislation to avoid a continuation of 3,500 members of the Garda Síochána being excluded from their representative association.  Those who have followed this dispute will readily recognise the efforts made to avoid reaching a point at which legislative changes became imperative.  For example, the Garda have the option of getting together and amending the constitution of their representative association to enable all members of garda rank give allegiance to it &mdash; even while I prepare this legislation &mdash; but I cannot allow this dispute continue any longer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Have there been consultations on the heads of this Bill with the parties to this dispute?  Does the Minister agree it is essential that this bitter, divisive dispute be brought to an end as quickly as possible?  When will she be in a position to publish this Bill and brief Opposition Members given that we have been involved throughout this very difficult dispute?  In addition, does the Minister consider the fundamental democratic deficit, part of the original dispute &mdash; with small units having the same executive representation as larger ones in Dublin &mdash; will be resolved by the provisions of this Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>It is my intention to ensure that that democratic deficit &mdash; which appears to be the road block <Col N="1801" /> preventing members reverting to membership of the association &mdash; will be tackled.  Those problematic issues I identified were: lack of democracy with the GRA, the system of election of officers, the appointment of trustees, the management of standing orders and the need to review the GRA's disciplinary procedures which have given rise to 2,500 members walking away from it.  Obviously I cannot brief the Opposition before bringing the heads of the Bill to Government for approval but I will do so as soon as I can.  Throughout this process I had many exhaustive, lengthy meetings with all three sides and my officials have been constantly available to meet any of the groups wanting to put any point to them.  I have not yet met them in the course of preparation of this legislation but, if I discover there are points needing to be clarified, I will avail of that opportunity to consult them.  I know sufficient about this issue to be fully aware of the problems and at this point do not need to spend more time listening to their complaints, having identified them all.</P>

      <P>I have not instituted any investigation of a leak because I have no evidence of such, although I read newspaper reports to that effect; that would be a matter for the Garda if they felt it hindered some element of the operation. It was an extremely successful operation on the part of the Garda, Customs and Naval Services, demonstrating what can be achieved when there is co-operation between them, and which continues to be nurtured, to ensure they continue to work closely.  I am not in a position to comment on what was reported in a newspaper.</P>

      <P>As the Minister is not at liberty to talk about that issue, I will ask a more general question.  During the past 18 months there were many successful drug seizures.  Have there been any security lapses in the measures employed in the confiscation and destruction of those drugs?  Has anybody ever been charged or investigated?</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that no case has ever been taken.  However, if the Deputy has a reason for raising this, perhaps she <Col N="1803" /> would pass on any knowledge she has and I will pass it on to the Garda Síochána. Certainly no garda has been accused of taking any of the evidence away.  All drugs are burned, but the evidence must be kept until all aspects of court cases have been resolved.  That raises the question of whether it is necessary to keep every last bit of evidence to produce in court.  I have already raised that question following the massive haul of drugs found at Urlingford; fifteen tonnes would be a great deal to put on a table in a courtroom. I have asked if it would be possible, without destroying the integrity of the case the Garda Síochána might take, to dispose of it, because the sooner these drugs are put out of commission the better.  Normally the quantities are manageable, but that was a particularly large haul, and it raised in my mind the question of where it is to be kept and for how long.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the fact that a file has at last been sent to the Director of Public Prosecutions.  Would the Minister agree that we will now encounter a feature which has become common to all such cases involving child abuse which took place over ten years ago, that is, the issue of lapse of time? We have had a litany of pathetic cases of people who were abused as children and, years later, when they came to disclose it as adults, prosecutions were blocked because of the notion that a lapse of time precludes a successful prosecution.  In the light of such a litany of cases where a decision not to prosecute was taken, will the Minister consider whether lapse of time should any longer be a bar to prosecutions, particularly in child abuse cases?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a question about Trudder House, not about the general policy of the DPP.  I am constrained in giving much information about this case because the file has gone to the DPP. The file was forwarded to the DPP following an 11-month Garda investigation into allegations received that children at <Col N="1805" /> Trudder House, Newtownmountkennedy, County Wicklow had been sexually abused by five male staff over a 19 year period from 1975 to 1994.  His directions are now awaited.  As part of the investigation, gardaí travelled to the United Kingdom and, with the assistance of Scotland Yard, interviewed former residents of Trudder House now residing in the UK.  Given that prosecutions may be instituted, I cannot say any more about the investigation.</P>
      <P>I share Deputy O'Donnell's concern that people are only now finding the courage and the wherewithal to come forward and report abuses that happened many years ago.  These things happened at a time when we all thought Ireland was the land of saints and scholars and nothing like this happened behind our closed doors.  Sadly, it did. There were probably very enlightened people at that time who said it was happening, but they were not listened to. The question of lapse of time is an issue. However, I would not anticipate the decision of the DPP on any case.  I am sure the DPP takes lapse of time into consideration when making his decision. He has already said publicly that there is not a policy decision that just because something happened 20 years ago a prosecution cannot be instituted.  All the evidence is put before the DPP, and he must make his decision based on the range of evidence.  What is being highighted is that in some instances it has been the lapse of time that has prevented a prosecution, but there is no policy decision.  I am not free to comment on what will happen in this case.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister's comments.  I am delighted the file has been referred to the DPP.  I also welcome the Minister's statement on policy issues in the DPP's office.  People are horrified that children in care over a long period in different homes have been subjected to sexual abuse.  What is important now is to ensure there is intervention to stop this happening.  In that regard, is the Minister satisfied the new guidelines given to the Garda</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1806" /> Síochána and health board workers are working effectively?  Will she give a commitment to the House that there will be joint training of gardaí and health board staff, particularly social workers, to ensure those new guidelines published this year on procedures for reporting child sexual abuse are being implemented properly?  This is one of the most effective ways of ensuring that from now on children in residential care are protected and cases are reported quickly and action taken if anything is suspected.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>The new guidelines were issued in April because it was found that the 1987 guidelines did not specify when or even if the Garda Síochána should refer cases to the health boards.  They are now in place.  I assure Deputy Fitzgerald that included in those guidelines is a requirement to train people designated by the Garda Síochána and by the health boards to ensure they are fully aware of what they have to do.  My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Austin Currie, worked on these guidelines most extensively.  We discussed the need for letting the Garda Síochána and the health boards know that care should be taken in selecting people, male or female to act as liaison people, to ensure that they are sensitive people appropriate for the job they have to do.  Those regulations now require that the notification of cases between the two agencies should be standard procedure. These guidelines will mean we will not have Deputies saying 20 years from now that something should have been done in 1995.  All the abuses we are talking about happened in these institutions as far back as the 1970s.  I hope with the knowledge we have now, we will move forward and ensure that children in institutions or in their private homes will not end up as victims of sexual abuse.</P>

I tabled amendments on this issue.</P>
      <P>Deputy Woods said it would be undesirable from a psychiatric point of view for people to consume more alcohol. If his figures are as reliable as usual, he should talk to the Minister for Finance because if the price of alcohol is reduced, more will be consumed and the Revenue Commissioners will receive more in taxation.  Everyone will be happy.</P>

      <P>The licensed trade has changed in the past 20 years.  Transport was not readily available and people did not go to town as much as they do now.  The day drinking trade is almost a thing of the past. When the Minister reviews the licensing laws she should bear in mind the possibility of allowing late extensions in public houses.  When on holiday it is nice to retire to a tavern for beverages and it would be lovely to continue to drink legally until 1 a.m. rather than doing so illegally, often with the lights turned off.</P>

      <P>I read somewhere that it does but one cannot always believe everything one reads.  A licence holder could be given 20 late extensions in a year and could inform the local superintendent of the occasions on which the person wished to use them.  If the superintendent is satisfied that the occasion is a legitimate one the late opening should be granted.  Perhaps the Minister has <Col N="1913" /> other views on helping the hard-hit publican.</P>
      <P>This Bill has created quite a stir but the equal status legislation created almost as much comment. It is imperative that publicans be allowed to refuse service if they so wish.  A publican is in business to make money and the more drink he sells the more money he makes.  However, if he cannot control the people on his premises life will become hell for him.  He will have to continually break the law.  Every year when a publican applies for the renewal of his licence a Garda superintendent must vouch for the running of the pub during the year.  If it was troublesome the licence may not be renewed.  If a publican does not have the right to refuse service to a group of hooligans how can he run a proper pub?  An example might be a group of football supporters&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Some people are of the opinion that only one section of the community comes into the category of those who are refused. Students may be refused in certain pubs and if the Bill is passed they could take a publican to court for damages.  Lawyers may be delighted with the new legislation as it will create work for them.</P>
      <P>At present publicans may refuse service to drug pushers who come into their pubs.  However, if the publican is obliged to give a reason and says he believes the person to be a drug pusher he may be asked to prove the allegations and may find himself in court for defamation.  It is imperative that the publican retains the right to manage his own premises as he sees fit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGahon</NameTxt>
      <P>However, I do not view that profession in the same favourable light.  Deputy O'Donnell referred to the large contribution made to the economy by the drinks industry.  It also contributes greatly to the misery and distress suffered by hundreds of thousands of families.  The overindulgence in drink to which young people in particular are prone is tragic.  The tolerance of drink is indicative of a deep social problem. Every family has suffered from the excesses of drink, my own family included.  Some restraint is needed if the young people are not to be engulfed in a wave of alcoholic poisoning.</P>
      <P>I contrast this tolerance with the vitriolic treatment of the cigarette industry by all Governments.  I share the belief that cigarette smoking is injurious to health.  Smoking kills but so does alcohol. More families are affected by the excesses of alcohol than by cigarette smoking and more people are killed throughout the world by alcohol and alcohol related illnesses than by smoking or any other hard or soft drug.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a natural progression from drink to drugs for young immature people, as Deputy O'Donoghue suggested this morning.  Adolescents want to be on a high and after a while drink is not enough so they gravitate to drugs. There is a definite link between the two. The drugs problem is the terror of parents but they can only expect it as it is a natural progression from experimentation with drink.  Official figures suggest that the age at which children start to drink is 12 years.  That is an horrific indictment of successive Governments <Col N="1915" /> and of us all for having allowed that to happen.</P>
    <P>The glamorous seductive advertisements for drink on television show attractive happy people in pubs.  They do not show the tragic figure in the corner with head in hands or the husband or wife and children at home waiting for the absent spouse.  Young children are bombarded with seductive and sophisticated advertising for an endless list of drinks, while, hypocritically, cigarettes are not allowed to be advertised.  The drink industry is used for cynical purposes due to the fact that it contributes millions to the Exchequer in revenues. There is a tolerance of drink in society.</P>
    <P>The Minister commented on the tragic figures of 315 people killed on the roads in the summer.  Had a natural catastrophe taken 315 lives the newspapers would produce hourly editions to cover the story.  However, because the deaths are fragmented and the bereaved are left to grieve alone nothing is done. Official statistics indicate that one in three of those people was killed by a drunken driver.</P>
    <P>We have seen the power of the publicans lobby which faced down measures brought in by the former Ministers for the Environment, Deputies Michael Smith and Howlin.  Was consideration given to the people &mdash; mostly pedestrians &mdash; who are at risk?  It was not, because of cynical political reasons of revenue and representations from the publicans' lobby.  Not only that, many TDs hold their clinics in public houses. These matters need airing in this House. The drug problem is a national tragedy. Drugs are being sold in pubs &mdash; as Deputy Foxe accepted &mdash; clubs and discos. Unless draconian measures are introduced to combat the drug scourge, the next 20 years will turn this country into a hell hole for our youth.</P>
    <P>I fully support the Minister's common-sense steps to allow licensed and off-sales premises to open over the Christmas period because it is a practical measure.</P>

      <P>I agree with Deputy Foxe.  The proposal to deny publicans the right to refuse admission is ludicrous and farcical. Does it come from outer space, or from the same dodo who denied a father the right to give a difficult child a tiny cuff? The man in the street cannot accept these two legislative provisions.  Is it any wonder there is no discipline in the country?  We have removed a parent's right to gently chastise his or her child, which is madness.  We can see the indiscipline in schools which leads to many teachers suffering from stress and wanting to retire.  We are now bringing in the unbelievable law that a man cannot prevent a person he considers undesirable entering his premises.  Will we extend the same rights to people calling to Leinster House?

      <P>Deputy McGahon might be surprised to hear that I largely agree with many of his opening remarks about the drink industry, especially about the discrimination <i>vis-à-vis</i> the tobacco industry.  By and large, however, the Bill is not an observation or commentary on the pros and cons of the alcohol industry, rather it concerns regulating access. In that sense, while I agree with the Minister's proposals and welcome the Bill, there is a need to have a more extensive review of the licensing regulations.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill as outlined in the explanatory memorandum is to allow shops and supermarkets which are licensed to sell intoxicating liquor by retail and other licensed premises to remain open on Christmas Eve or 23 December in any year that either day falls on a Sunday, as if it was a weekday.</P>
      <P>What is so special about weekday regulations at present?  To give an instance of the absurdity of many of the current licensing regulations, one local newspaper recently reported an application in a provincial town for permission to open between 7.30 a.m. and 10 a.m. to facilitate a fish licensed market, in Skibbereen, I believe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 3 of the Bill deals with mixed trading in off-licences on larger retail premises; my colleague Deputy Ring referred to this as the &ldquo;Dunnes Stores&rdquo; Bill.  Section 4 highlights the absurd regulation which means some hotels and restaurants currently cannot serve alcohol between 3 p.m. and 4 p.m. on Sundays. Section 6 highlights the further restrictions whereby other restaurants cannot serve alcohol between 3 p.m. and 6 p.m. on Sundays.  In this time such a restriction is excessive.  It is a throw back to days when it was believed there <Col N="1918" /> should be profound control over people's daily lives and it is time to review some of those measures.  Apart from that, an excessive amount of Garda time is taken up enforcing these regulations and inspecting licensed premises to see if they comply with closing time.  At a time when crime is escalating and there are attacks on elderly people, Garda time could be far better spent than in enforcing outdated legislation.</P>
    <P>Closing time regulations are mostly not observed to the letter of the law and any law which is not observed brings the whole law into disrepute.  In that sense the behaviour of people and publicans indicates the clear need for a review of licensing legislation.  It was Lady Margaret Thatcher or one of her cohorts who said one cannot buck the market, which also applies to the drink industry. Regardless of licensing regulations which will determine when one can legally drink in a public house or buy it in an off-licence, those who want to drink, socially or excessively, will do so and the volume they consume will not be related to licensing regulations.  Prohibition in the United States in the early part of this century &mdash; to which Deputy McGahon referred &mdash; did not work either and in that sense there is a need to review licensing regulations.</P>
    <P>The closing time culture is the most socially destructive facet of the present licensing regulations.  In rural areas especially, people rush to their local at 11.15 p.m., gulp down three or four drinks and leave by 12 o'clock.  That is socially undesirable.  If the concept of closing time <i>per se</i> was legally done away with, there would be far more regulated and moderate drinking over a protracted period rather than excessive consumption in the last hour before legal closing time.  Significant revenue is lost to the State from tourists from continental Europe rather than the UK which has somewhat similar licensing regulations to ours.  Tourists aware of our alleged pub culture, which has been exported to the Continent in the form of Irish pubs in almost every major city <Col N="1919" /> in Europe, are shocked to find just when they are getting into the swing of things, the shutters come down and they have nowhere to go except their bed and breakfast accommodation.  That highlights the necessity to overhaul licensing regulations, not least because of the revenues which are lost.</P>
    <P>I favour a system which would allow the proprietors of licensed public houses to decide when they open and close. That would not be socially destructive or lead to increased consumption.  The volume of consumption is not determined by opening hours but by people's disposable income and the decisions they make in that regard.</P>
    <P>A matter related to the drinks industry, which is under consideration at the moment by the Government, is the proposed equal status Bill.  I know the Minister might say this is a side issue but it is important to use the occasion to put down markers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>It was; the Deputy should read the last Programme for Government. I hope the Minister will inform her Cabinet colleagues that there is extraordinary unease among proprietors of public houses that they may not be in a position, if that legislation is passed, to guarantee an orderly house, which would be regrettable.  This issue has the potential to destablise the political system that the rod licence issue had. While Deputies are not anxious to discriminate <i>per se</i> against any section of society, it is essential that the proprietor <Col N="1920" /> of every public house has the authority vested in him as to how best to maintain law and order and a proper house while his premises is open.</P>
      <P>The Minister and the Government would do well to pay heed to the concerns being expressed.  I hope to meet the Minister for Equality and Law Reform early in 1996 at the Joint Committee on Small Business and Services to discuss this matter and the concerns being expressed daily by various interest groups.</P>
      <P>The Bill is welcome in that it addresses a certain anomaly.  However, it is high time we reviewed the licensing regulations which seek to excessively control people's social behaviour.  A decision to put the authority to decide when to open and close in the hands of proprietors of public houses is long overdue.  That is not to say we should blindly follow what happens in continental Europe and elsewhere.  However, it would lead to more orderly drinking. The culture of having a closing time is socially destructive as people gulp down three or four drinks and rush home.  If closing time was at the discretion of the proprietor it would not lead to increased consumption but to more socially acceptable drinking patterns, which is entirely desirable.</P>
      <P>The Bill, in so far as it goes, is welcome. I imagine it will not have any difficulty gaining passage through the House.  I compliment the Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen) Nora Owen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I expected a very wide ranging discussion on this very minimal measure, and I am glad I was not disappointed.  Although it was a relatively short debate, it usefully touched on a number of issues related to our intoxicating liquor licensing laws and the wider issues of the role alcohol plays and should not play in many people's lives, where it causes great hardship and damage, the role it plays in young people's lives, the role of parents, opening hours and the tourism industry. A wide range of points of view were put.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many Deputies referred to the role of public houses in the distribution of <Col N="1921" /> drugs to young people.  The responsibility rests with publicans, disco owners etc. to ensure that their premises are not being used by evil people to sell drugs to, what Deputy McGahon referred to as, immature people who decide to try something new for a change and who may end up very seriously ill or even, God forbid, dead.  With the latitude of the Chair, we touched on almost every aspect of Irish social life with regard to the intoxicating liquor Acts.</P>
    <P>My motivation for this legislation has nothing to do with the pubs.  It has to do with the case made to me very practically and pragmatically that Christmas Eve falling on a Sunday would cause a great deal of difficulty for people who wished to do their fresh food shopping on Christmas Eve and the day before, due to the law in relation to licensed sections in shops.  This does not just refer to big supermarkets.  Deputy Ring said he hoped this measure was not for some big supermarket chain.  Any small shop with a licenced section could only have legally opened at very restricted times on Christmas Eve without this legislation.  This legislation will allow people to go to Mass, do their shopping and have a family day.  My motivation was to assist people on a practical level to prepare for Christmas.</P>
    <P>Allied to that, I also felt it appropriate not to create an anomaly.  We already have enough anomalies in our legislation.  I felt it was correct to ensure that public houses and restaurants would have the benefit of this change in the law.</P>
    <P>The equal status Bill is within the remit of the Minister for Equality and Law Reform.  It is not law, it is not even published legislation.  I welcome what was said here today and I am sure the Minister will consider it.  I share some of the concerns expressed about the latitude publicans must have to ensure they do not allow their premises to become a den where people can sell drugs without finding themselves at the receiving end of defamation claims and threats, as some Deputies indicated.  Some discussion is still to take place on that <Col N="1922" /> section of the Bill.  I understand the Minister is soon to appear before a Committee to discuss that.  The equal status legislation will remove discrimination from our laws and practices and I hope Members support it.  In introducing that legislation, we must ensure we do not create difficulties in other areas and I note the concerns of Members in this regard.  I have no difficulty in carrying out a wide-ranging review of our licensing laws, but the Bill deals with the minimum necessary because every step taken in this area affects other areas. Deputy Creed referred to the fishing licence controversy.  When the word &ldquo;licence&rdquo; is mentioned one is guaranteed a heated debate and all sorts of issues arise.</P>
    <P>A major review of our licensing laws was carried out in 1988 when Gerry Collins was Minister for Justice.  The review began in 1986 but the legislation fell with the demise of the Government in 1987 and the 1988 legislation was introduced in an effort to regulate our licensing laws.</P>
    <P>Some Members suggested that different opening hours should apply in tourist areas.  What constitutes a tourist area?  Where would we draw the line?  If different opening hours apply in tourist areas, people would go to the pubs in those areas to benefit from the late opening hours.  The number of jobs provided by the drinks industry and ancillary services must be taken into account. In any event, we cannot do that as a result of this debate.  It will be the year 2000 before Christmas Eve again falls on a Sunday and if I were to take all the views put forward before then into consideration I would need to begin immediately.</P>
    <P>While I am not ignoring the interest in our licensing laws, my priority is to ascertain how drugs are brought into discos and licensed premises.  The power of the Garda to enter such premises will also be reviewed.  The terms of reference of the Select Committee on Legislation and Security allow it hold a wide-ranging debate on this matter.  Members may think we had a heated debate on <Col N="1923" /> the Courts and Court Officers Bill with regard to solicitors and barristers, but nothing is more destined to raise tensions than a discussion on the wider implications of altering our licensing laws, deregulation, and so on.</P>
    <P>The 1988 Act provides that those under 18 years should produce identity cards when entering a licensed premises and voluntary schemes are well supported by the gardaí in that regard.  As Deputy Foxe correctly stated, even if it were mandatory for those under 18 to produce identity cards when entering such premises, that would not guarantee they would not get alcoholic drink some other way.  The 1988 legislation places major emphasis on curbing under-age drinking but for it to be effective off-licence and shop owners would have to ask those purchasing drink if it is for people under 18 years.  We know that does not happen.  However, pub owners are becoming more responsible in this regard.  In a number of the pubs in the town in which I live staff members ask young people their ages and do not allow them to consume alcohol if they are under 18.  My children, who are in their late teens and early 20s, have brought this to my attention.</P>
    <P>Some Members suggested I should include Saint Patrick's Day, New Year's Eve and the following day in the legislation. We cannot compare Saint Patrick's Day to Christmas Eve.  I introduced this legislation because Christmas Eve is a special day in the preparations for Christmas.  It is a day for shopping, going out to lunch, being with one's family and having a social drink.  We recently changed the law to provide for longer opening hours on Saint Patrick's Day but we cannot consider that and other days under this legislation without examining its effects in other areas.  In recent years we witnessed some disquieting incidents, associated with alcohol, on Saint Patrick's Day.  Members may believe the issues about which they are concerned could be easily resolved <Col N="1924" /> under this legislation, but that is not the case.  Even the simple request to allow people to shop on Christmas Eve led me to go further than I believed necessary.</P>
    <P>This matter will involve a lengthy and heated debate.  Many people believe our licensing laws are far too liberal and would like public houses to be open for shorter periods whereas others believe they should be open day and night.  This would have implications for trade union staff members and so on.  What I am proposing is not obligatory on the owners of public houses, restaurants or shops.  They can adhere to the opening hours that apply at present if they wish. However, this pragmatic measure will assist those who wish to open their premises for a longer period on Christmas Eve.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donoghue suggested that pubs should close at 10 p.m. rather than 11 p.m. on Christmas Eve.  That would have implications for the trade and is not appropriate for discussion under this legislation.  I hope people would have sufficient understanding to go home to their families when pubs close at 11 p.m. to prepare for Christmas Day. Unfortunately, laws will not ensure that people do not drink to excess.  That is a personal habit and Ministers should not pretend that by introducing a law they can dictate people's drinking habits.</P>
    <P>Deputy Upton referred to the relatively small number of public houses in Dublin.  That was an unintentional side effect of the 1902 provisions.  This is a major issue, especially for existing licence holders.  Ideally, it should be considered as part of a wider review.</P>
    <P>Under-age drinking is a social problem. I refer Members to the eight or nine provisions in the 1988 Act to deal with it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Woods, and others, referred to the consequences of alcohol abuse. Between 4,000 and 5,000 people are admitted to mental institutions each year.  I am not in a position to indicate, <Col N="1925" /> as I have not had time to research the matter, how many cases are drink related, but I am aware that in a large proportion of the cases involving people who have had a nervous or mental breakdown, alcohol is a contributory factor.  Tragically, it is a factor in cases involving domestic violence.  This will have to be taken into account in any consideration of the question of extended opening hours.</P>
    <P>The case made in favour of extended opening hours on Christmas Eve and the day before cannot be made in the case of New Year's Eve and St. Patrick's Day.  I have not had the opportunity to consult any of the associations concerned although I received a letter from the vintners' association in connection with this matter.  There was only enough time to consider extended opening hours on Christmas Eve and the day before.  I am not in a position, therefore, to accept any of the amendments.  All the issues which have been raised will be considered and if there is a serious anomaly, I will attempt to rectify it.</P>
    <P>There was reference to the position of six day licence holders who are not allowed to open on a Sunday.  As Deputy Foxe and others are aware, six day licence holders have the option of applying for a seven day licence.  It is a complex procedure which requires examination.  In 1960, about 700 availed of the opportunity to pay the Revenue Commissioners £200 for a full licence, leaving 200 approximately with six day licences.</P>
    <P>I thank those who contributed to the debate which has been most enlightening.  I did my best to reply to the points raised.  I thank Deputies for recognising that this is a minimalist and pragmatic measure which will add to the enjoyment of the public at Christmas time.  Some people will have to work, but I have no doubt, in keeping with the festive spirit, that they will serve customers in pubs and restaurants out for a festive drink or to shop for their turkey and ham with a smile.</P>
    <P>I wish Members a happy Christmas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for allowing me to raise this important issue.  Those of us who have the good fortune not to be homeless have a stereotyped image of the typical homeless person.  When the word &ldquo;homeless&rdquo; is mentioned, the image that comes to mind is that of aimless drunks, drug addicts and bag ladies.  We tend to think of those people as always having been homeless but that is not the reality. Homelessness can be ruthlessly random. People become homeless for various reasons.  A high proportion of the homeless population are people who once lived comfortably with their families in middle class homes with all their attendant comforts.</P>
      <P>Contrary to popular misconception, all homeless people do not sleep out on the street.  The vast majority stay in hostels, night shelters, sometime bed and breakfast establishments, with friends or in squats all of which are stressful short-term arrangements.  Focus Point, the excellent organisation which has done enormous work in this area, stated in its 1994 report that: &ldquo;in some of these locations only essential living necessities are available; in others, not even basic human needs are being met.  None of them are homes&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Focus Point estimates that anything between 3,000 and 5,000 people are homeless at any one time, although precise figures are notoriously difficult to estimate.  All the evidence suggests that the number of homeless is increasing, yet in some vital areas services are declining.  There are approximately 800 hostel bed places in Dublin city. Between 1988 and 1993 the number of hostel beds decreased by 14 per cent. <Col N="1928" /> The 1993 census of hostels showed a 6 per cent increase in hostel usage since 1991.  If this trend continues, that is, growing numbers and declining services, the inevitable consequence will be that more and more of the homeless will be forced to sleep rough on the streets. This will inevitably lead to the creation of the cardboard cities which so tarnished the image of Thatcher's Britain and finally laid to rest the theory that a rising tide will of itself lift all boats.</P>
    <P>Young people under the age of 18 who become homeless are the responsibility of the Department of Health which provides the resources to health boards which directly provide the appropriate services.  The problem of homeless young people was confined almost exclusively to Dublin until recently, but, unfortunately, it has now spread to the provinces.  Children have to leave home as a result of some family crisis, violence, sexual or physical abuse. Focus Point stated that &ldquo;only a specialised hostel with suitable back up and support is appropriate and these are unfortunately very few and far between&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Despite undoubted improvements in recent years the number of places available to cater for the young homeless is totally inadequate to meet this growing problem.  Focus Point indicated that &ldquo;homeless children need an urgent 24-hour child centred response with intensive professional support and guidance&rdquo;. Homeless children are extremely vulnerable to sexual exploitation, addiction to drugs or alcohol or involvement in crime.  A short period on the streets can do considerable long-term damage to a homeless child.  Focus Point has found that not only are some homeless children remaining homeless for longer, but also that the age profile of the young homeless is falling.  Focus Point indicate, and we have no reason to doubt it, that some of the homeless children met by its volunteers on the streets are as young as 11 or 12 years.</P>
    <P>We are constitutionally bound to cherish all the children of the nation <Col N="1929" /> equally.  Therefore, we have a constitutional as well as a moral obligation to provide for the growing army of the homeless.  Our readiness in the past often to look the other way challenges our claim to describe ourselves as a Christian society.  The homeless are entitled to expect that this nation will do everything in its power to help them recover their dignity and self-respect.  If we allow this problem to grow, fester and worsen at a time when the economy is growing faster than at any time in the history of our State, we will have allowed ourselves to become that country where, to paraphrase Goldsmith, wealth accumulates while the quality of life of more and more of our people decays.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Allen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising the issue of homelessness.  It is particularly appropriate at this time of the year.  Christmas is traditionally associated with the home and the family while at this time of year homeless people are at greatest risk from the elements.</P>
      <P>As nearly there years have elapsed since the 1993 assessment of housing need and the number of homeless people, local authorities have been directed to carry out a further assessment in March 1996.  Authorities have been asked to ensure that the homeless assessment will be a thorough one and to take the necessary steps to achieve this.</P>
      <P>Various measures have been taken in recent times to deal with homelessness. The most significant is the expansion of the local authority housing programme from 1,000 starts in 1992 to 3,500 in 1993 and again in 1994 and 3,900 in 1995.  As a result of this significant numbers of homeless people have been and will be housed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another measure is the increased funding under the voluntary housing capital assistance scheme for voluntary bodies providing accommodation for people.  The provision for the scheme increased from £11 million in 1992 to <Col N="1930" /> £15 million in 1995 while the maximum unit cost ceilings were increased earlier this year.  A large part of expenditure under this scheme, generally between one-third and one-half, goes on the provision of accommodation for homeless people.</P>
    <P>The level of recoupment paid by the Department in respect of local authority current expenditure on the accommodation of homeless people was increased from 80 per cent to 90 per cent from April 1993.  As a result of the increased level of activity by local authorities, recoupment paid by my Department increased from £674,000 in 1992 to over £1,500,000 in 1995.</P>
    <P>In November 1993, the Eastern Health Board, by arrangement with Dublin Corporation, introduced an after hours referral service up to 1.00 a.m., including weekends.  The service, which is freefone, complements the existing daytime call-in referral service at the board's homeless persons unit in Charles Street, Dublin.  If local authorities in other major urban areas consider it desirable to establish a similar referral service in their area, the Minister with responsibility for housing and urban renewal will be open to any proposals authorities may make.</P>
    <P>One of the priorities of the Minister with responsibility for housing and urban renewal has been homelessness. The Minister has visited hostels and shelters for homeless people in the Dublin area and has met voluntary bodies in different areas of the country to discuss the issues involved.  The Minister is keeping in touch with the situation and while it is reasonably satisfactory there is always room for improvement and certainly no grounds for complacency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for allowing me to raise on the Adjournment the important question of the provision of a new vocational education committee school at Summerhill in Mallow, County Cork.  The <Col N="1931" /> present school, known as Davis College, was built in 1943 and extensions were added in 1960, 1968 and 1973.  The present capacity is 400, the total enrolment is 485 and the projected enrolment in the immediate years ahead is 500.</P>
      <P>In October 1994, Cork County vocational education committee announced that the Department of Education had sanctioned the building of a new school to cater for the projected enrolment of 500 students.  At present, due to the increase in numbers the school has had to rent accommodation from Dairygold Co-op, but the rented building is not adjoining the school campus. It fragments the school.  It also-raises safety concerns for students and staff who must travel between the two sites.</P>
      <P>The condition of the main building of Davis College is substandard and major expenditure is required to maintain the rotting windows and doors which present a safety and security risk.  The narrow stairs and corridors and partition classrooms with a single narrow exit also add to the safety risk.  The prefabricated classrooms have been condemned by an architect in the Department of Education, but despite that classes must be conducted in those primitive, insecure, damp and unsafe structures.</P>
      <P>There is a total lack of adequate, safe storage space for valuable equipment, such as TVs, videos, camcorders or for students' projects which they must take home despite the Department's directive that they should be retained until after the junior certificate results are issued.</P>
      <P>The staffroom is totally inadequate and Dickensian.  Office accommodation is not acceptable or suitable.  The school library is housed in a leaking prefabricated room.  The toilet facilities are inadequate for the current demand of staff and students.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I request the Minister of State to ensure that building of the new school commences immediately to meet the <Col N="1932" /> needs of the students and staff to provide them with acceptable accommodation and equipment in these latter years of the 20th century.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Ahern for giving me the opportunity to respond to this debate.  Recently I met a delegation from that school, including the principal whom I met on two occasions.  I am aware of the position that has prevailed for many years.  It must be examined urgently and that is being done.</P>
      <P>I would like to outline the background to this matter for the information of the House.  In 1982 the Department agreed, in principle, to a request by the County Cork Vocational Education Committee for a new vocational school building at Mallow.  A ten acre site on the southern end of the town was purchased and a schedule of accommodation for 550 pupils was issued to the vocational education committee in November 1983.  Planning of the new building proceeded and in November 1985 stage 3 of the design team procedures was submitted to the Department.</P>
      <P>In March 1987 the project was put on hold because of the school's enrolment trends at the time, the possibility of rationalisation in the centre and the scarcity of capital finance.  The question of rationalisation or amalgamation of schools in the Mallow centre was considered on a number of occasions since 1988 and discussions were held with the authorities of the schools involved. However, agreement was not reached on the matter.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, the Department has now agreed that a replacement school building for the vocational school should be provided on the site acquired by the vocational education committee some years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In May 1995 the vocational education committee was requested to complete an educational worksheet which was received in June 1995.  The accommodation requirements of Davis College have been assessed by the Department <Col N="1933" /> and a schedule of overall accommodation to cater for 450 pupils, including provision for an all-Irish stream, has recently been forwarded to the vocational education committee.</P>
    <P>When the schedule of accommodation has been formally accepted, County Cork vocational education committee will be requested to submit a proposed design team to start the process of architectural planning.</P>
    <P>Regarding the timescale for construction, the Deputy will appreciate that while the financial resources available to the Department for building purposes are limited, the demand for new and replacement accommodation in the post-primary sector has been, and will continue to be, very high.  At this early stage it is not possible to say when building will commence at Davis College.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, I am fully conscious of the accommodation requirements of the school and I assure the Deputy that every effort will be made by the County Cork vocational education committee and my Department to expedite the planning of the project.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Traffic chaos and congestion in my constituency of Dublin South has been steadily worsening during the past ten to 15 years.  It is not an exaggeration to say that traffic management is a key political issue and of daily concern to thousands of residents of Dublin South.  It is the only reason many citizens in those areas contact their elected representatives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The quality of life for thousands of Dubliners is eroded on a daily basis by their experience of sitting in cars trying to get to and from work and, indeed, to and from schools.  Sadly, in the past we did not have proper planning integrating land use, transportation and road policy.  For that reason the people of <Col N="1934" /> Dublin South view with joy the announcement of the new tramway system, particularly its extension to Dundrum. However there are various concerns in relation to the proposals that the tramway should not be extended beyond Dundrum.</P>
    <P>The combined population of the wider Dundrum area including Goatstown, Upper Kilmacud, Balally, Sandyford, Ballinteer, Marley, Rathfarnham, Churchtown and Dundrum itself must be in the region of 80,000.  What numbers are expected to use the new system? I presume the projections have been done by the DTI.  It is intended that the widest possible usage of the new tram system will be achieved.  How is it intended to accommodate the huge increase in commuters who will descend on Dundrum village in order to avail of the new system?  Regular feeder buses from the outlying densely populated areas would be necessary for the viability of LUAS and the avoidance of further traffic chaos in Dundrum.</P>
    <P>Much of the wider population of the area has to traverse Dundrum in order to go about its daily business.  The traffic problems in the area have increased as each of the above mentioned suburbs has been developed.  It regularly takes 15 to 20 minutes to travel 200 yards along the main street of Dundrum. Parking in the village or its environs for those wishing to transact business there is almost impossible as the car park and the shopping centre are extremely congested at all times.  No matter what time of the day one observes Dundrum village, the traffic is bad.  Where is it proposed to have car parking facilities for commuters who wish to use the new tram route?  If they are to be provided in the village, traffic chaos will be exacerbated and trade will be affected.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister explain why it is proposed that the tramway will not extend beyond Dundrum?  Would it not be economically viable and good use of public money to extend the line to the Stillorgan-Leopardstown industrial estate?  If the line is to be cost effective, surely such a demand cannot be <Col N="1935" /> ignored.  I understand there are 6,000 people working in this successful industrial estate.  It would cost an additional £15 million to extend the line to Sandyford industrial estate but it would only cost the taxpayer £1 million.  In the context of Dundrum traffic, the extension of the line to the industrial estate would make much more sense and would also mean a greater possibility of providing parking facilities for commuters and for feeder buses.  It is imperative that the bypass route for Dundrum, which was the only road the DTI agreed should be built within the outer Dublin ring, should be built at the same time together with the Wyckham bypass, both of which would contribute to traffic calming in the village.  If they are not constructed at the same time as the tram link, there is likely to be a reluctance by commuters to attempt to enter Dundrum to take the tram.</P>
    <P>Dundrum is struggling to be a vibrant village and it is constantly choked with traffic.  I hope there will be good public consultation at all stages of the proposed tram development with elected representatives.  There is a democratic deficit in relation to the roads proposal because no questions can be asked in the House about roads which are the responsibility of the National Roads Authority.  It is important to keep all the elected representatives and the residents fully informed and consulted regarding the various developments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Stagg)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising the matter.  The final report of the Dublin Transportation Initiative which was published last August recommends an integrated transport strategy involving a programme of investment in roads, public transport and traffic management complemented by improved enforcement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has decided that the DTI transport strategy will provide the general policy framework for the future development of the transport system in <Col N="1936" /> the Greater Dublin Area and has agreed to the establishment of institutional structures to oversee implementation of the strategy and to ensure the continuity of the land use and transportation planning process.</P>
    <P>In the case of public transport, DTI recommended a number of major investment projects including the development of a light rail network; the introduction of quality bus corridors; improved interchange facilities for buses and other public transport and off street bus parking facilities in the city centre; extension and upgrading of DART and suburban rail services; provision of secure park and ride facilities on the public transport network; an integrated ticketing system for all public transport services.</P>
    <P>The core light rail network recommended by DTI provides for lines to Tallaght, Cabinteely &mdash; via the old Harcourt Street railway line &mdash; and Ballymun at an estimated cost of £300 million, in 1993 prices.  The Operational Programme for Transport 1994 to 1999 provides for a total expenditure of £200 million on light rail during the period, £175 million of which is proposed to be EU co-financed.  The DTI final report endorsed this expenditure as about the limit of what could be physically implemented in the period.</P>
    <P>In late 1993, a high level project team, comprising CIE personnel and consultants, undertook a detailed analysis of six possible options which could be implemented within the £200 million allocation for light rail.</P>
    <P>These options were examined against a number of criteria including their contribution of DTI objectives, the likely level of use of the network, the likely level of transfer from private car, disruption during construction, engineering feasibility and the financial performance of the service.</P>
    <P>The objective technical recommendation of the project team was that priority should be given to the construction of links to Tallaght and Dundrum, via the Harcourt Street line, and this <Col N="1937" /> recommendation was accepted by the previous Government in October 1994.</P>
    <P>Following the Government decision, the light rail project team proceeded with the detailed planning and design work for the priority phases to Tallaght and Dundrum, including the determination of the preferred technical route alignments.  Earlier this week the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications launched a major public consultation process.  This will be undertaken by CIE on the preferred technical route alignments for the priority phases.  I should stress this point.  What has been launched is a public consultation process on the proposed routes.  Nothing has been cast in stone. We are at the beginning of a process which will give local people a full opportunity to air their views.  This process will continue over the coming months. It will include a formal public inquiry which I expect to be held next autumn.</P>
    <P>Already telephone and fax hotline numbers have been established and households will shortly receive information through their letterboxes.  In the New Year CIE will hold exhibitions in shopping centres in the areas involved and a full time public office will be opened in O'Connell Street.  Members of the light rail project team will be available to attend meetings and answer questions.  A modern public transport system needs a modern legal basis. Legislation is therefore being drafted which will provide a comprehensive legal framework for the development of the light rail network in Dublin.  The Bill will provide, among other things, for the holding of a mandatory public inquiry.</P>
    <P>I outline all this to highlight that the final configuration of the lines can only be definitely determined when the public consultation programme and the statutory procedures have been completed. The aim is to have the LRT links to Tallaght and Dundrum completed by the year 2000.</P>
    <P>While I would be far happier to be in a position to announce that the lines to Cabinteely and Ballymun and Tallaght will be constructed simultaneously, the <Col N="1938" /> reality is that it would be neither physically nor financially possible to do so within the lifetime of the Operational Programme for Transport.  In such circumstances it is inevitable and regrettable that many people are bound to be disappointed whatever the outcome.</P>
    <P>However, I would like to reiterate that the decision on implementation priorities was based on the results of an objective analysis of a range of possible light rail projects each costing about £200 million.  The proposal includes restoring a service to the Harcourt Street line for the first time in 35 years. Most of the route will be completed by 1999 and the remaining section to Cabinteely is included in Phase 2 which will follow later.  The alternative would be to stop short of Tallaght which is not practical or to raise additional Exchequer funding from the taxpayer which is undesirable.</P>
    <P>The decision on the priority phases does not imply any abandonment of the remaining phases of the core network to Cabinteely or Ballymun.  The core light rail network represents the network that best meets the aspirations of the DTI strategy.  It is, therefore, my intention to ensure that the completion of the core network is retained as the medium term objective and that priority is given to its completion once the priority phases to Dundrum and Tallaght have been implemented.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Ireland will be more seriously affected than any other member state by the 35 per cent reduction in the mackerel quota and the concessions granted by the EU to Norwegian fishermen. The dependence of coastal areas on fishing and that we have 5 per cent only of the total allowable catch and 16 <Col N="1939" /> per cent of EU waters makes this reduction all the more unacceptable. For many fishermen it will mean a 35 per cent cut in earning potential.</P>
      <P>Two years ago EU fishery scientists advocated an increase in the mackerel catch but last year they called for a 20 per cent reduction.  It stated that if this arrangement was agreed there would be relative stability in the mackerel stocks for the foreseeable future.  On this basis, fishery interests planned for the future and some made considerable investments in the fishing fleet.  Despite reports about an abundance of mackerel and boats tied up because it was so easy to catch the quota, a new proposal for an 80 per cent reduction was heralded. This has been reduced to 35 per cent. On the basis of these glaring inconsistencies, how can we rely on the scientific evidence?</P>
      <P>Norway seems to be calling the shots in the EU on this question, despite voting to stay outside the EU.  Growth in the herring stocks off the northern coast of Norway and between Norway and Iceland has meant the Norwegians can increase their herring quota by more than one million tonnes.  As a consequence, the reduction in the mackerel catch will only have a marginal effect on them.  They will be able to compensate and make up the shortfall but we will not be able to do so.</P>
      <P>To compound this disaster for fishermen, the EU decided to offer a further 24,000 tonnes of blue whiting off the west coast to Norway on top of the 200,000 tonnes it already has.  As if this was not enough, the EU is conceding the right to Norwegian inspectors to come into our ports, despite the fact that the same inspectors have virtually crucified Irish vessels in Norwegian waters. It is well known that Irish fishermen have been refused entry to that country for the most flimsy of reasons.  In a recent case a perfectly legitimate catch &mdash; the fish were perfect and the factory wanted the stock &mdash; was refused landing by the inspectors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Irish fishermen are virtually excluded <Col N="1940" /> from fishing in Norwegian waters.  While Norway has stayed out of the EU it apparently has all the advantages and none of the disadvantages.  I call on the Minister not to ratify this deal and to enlist the support of our EU colleagues in safeguarding the future of Irish fishermen.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan" hpid="Miss Coughlan Miss Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Miss Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my colleague for sharing his time with me.  This matter was raised prior to the deal being agreed.  We have now reached the stage where many people, some of whom are unskilled, will no longer be able to gain employment in the fishing industry.  If the cut is 35 per cent this year what will it be next year and the year after?  If it is larger, we may as well close the industry. The decision to increase the amount of blue whiting which may be fished will merely serve to compound the anger of fishermen about the proposed reduction.</P>
      <P>I stated previously in the House that the cuts should be in the areas where they will have the least effect, for example, the Scottish fleet.  There will be problems if we do not ensure the negotiations are conducted by the elected representatives, that is the Minister, and not by unelected representatives, that is the EU Commission or its secretariat.  We should look at the development of the marine industry not the destruction of it.</P>
      <P>The fishery in Killybegs has been closed this week.  The reduction of 35 per cent represents the loss of approximately 500 jobs.  Norwegian fishermen are dumping salmon on our market, thereby reducing the price, and they have scant regard for the European Union.  I do not understand why we should not show scant regard for their industry.  They welcome our fish when the price is good but they do not want to see Irish fishermen in their ports when they have enough fish of their own.  They cannot have their cake and eat it and the Minister must look seriously at this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is absolutely necessary for proper investment in research on mackerel <Col N="1941" /> stocks and new species.  Like herring fishing some years ago, mackerel fishing is now in danger.  If the IDA invested the same amount of money in a factory as many individuals have invested in the fishing industry we would give them great support.  However, this has not happened in the fishing industry.  It is a sad day when a marine state like Ireland with depleting stocks is not given the attention it deserves by the EU.  Further consideration must be given to proper investment and research and the measures which can be taken in the interim.</P>
    <P>My colleague has asked the Minister not to sign the agreement.  I do not know what political support he would get, but he should make every effort to secure the support of his counterparts in the EU to prevent this reduction.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to advise the House on the outcome of this year's EU negotiations with Norway on the 1996 fisheries agreement and my response to it.  The negotiations were concluded in Brussels last weekend and the agreement will be tabled for ratification by the Council next week.  The negotiations covered a number of species in which there is joint EU-Norwegian interest. Ireland's primary concern is in the mackerel agreement.  I will deal later with the imbalance in the arrangements for the mackerel share but I wish first to comment on the scientific advice on the total allowable catch.</P>
      <P>The international and national scientific advice on the mackerel stock is very pessimistic.  This year's report of the Advisory Committee on Fishery Management which was unequivocal in its view stressed the need for quick and decisive management action to help bring about a recovery in the stock.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The mackerel stock is now considered by the scientists to be at an all time low. This view is based on ongoing biological stock assessments and the 1995 international mackerel egg survey.  The scientific evidence indicates; that the spawning stock biomass has declined <Col N="1942" /> alarmingly; recruitment to the stock in recent years had been well below average and fishing mortality is at an all time high.</P>
    <P>The scientific advice must be taken seriously.  I fully accept, and so does the Irish industry, that we cannot afford to be complacent about the state of the stocks and clearly decisive action is needed if stock collapse is to be avoided.</P>
    <P>The scientists advised that an immediate 80 per cent cut in the mackerel total allowable catch was needed to restore viability.  They also indicated other possibilities involving less drastic reductions in catch but with the increased risks involved in a slower rebuilding of the mackerel resource.  A cut of the magnitude of 80 per cent would have had devastating effects on the Irish pelagic fleet and the related processing sector which is of vital economic importance for our north west coastal communities.  A level of reduction is required but the approach should be incremental and sustainable over a period.  We pressed, in EU co-ordination, for this medium term strategy to achieve a balance between scientific and conservation imperatives and the industry's need for certainty and sustainable fishing over the forseeable future.  The so called &ldquo;quick fix&rdquo; solution by taking such a major reduction at one go does not strike the necessary balance.  Anything other than an incremental approach would decimate our pelagic fleet which does not have the scale and extent of fishing opportunities available to the Norwegians &mdash; not just in their own fisheries but in EU waters as well.  This is a point to which I will return.  In the event the Commission and other member states accepted our view and the Commission negotiated on that basis.  In the final analysis the Norwegians who had been seeking the 80 per cent cut, accepted the medium term strategy based on a TAC of 420,000 tonnes next year although only after three rounds of very tough negotiations.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1943" /> I am satisfied that the medium term approach to the mackerel TAC, as opposed to drastic &ldquo;quick fix&rdquo; solutions, represents the necessary balance between acknowledged scientific concerns and the vital economic needs of the mackerel industry.  However, I am not satisfied with the continuing imbalances in the mackerel agreement when it comes to share, access and other entitlements.</P>
    <P>We have very serious, longstanding and principled grievances about the balance of the bilateral agreement which is heavily weighted in Norway's favour. While there is no further concession this year to increase Norway's share of the mackerel stock, we consider that Norway has been conceded too high a share over recent years, that flexibility to fish this stock for EU fishermen into North Sea and Norwegian waters is far too limited and that Norway has been granted excessive rights to fish for species in western waters.  Redressing these imbalances will not be easy but I made it very clear to Commissioner Bonino, and at successive Fisheries Councils this year, that it must be pursued as a strategic EU objective.</P>
    <P>In this context, the proposal in this year's accord to increase Norway's entitlements to blue whiting by 24,000 tonnes represents yet another strategic gain by Norway in terms of fishing <Col N="1944" /> opportunities in western waters.  In practice this fishing is largely concentrated in the west of Ireland for much of the year.  I am very unhappy with the outcome of the Commission's negotiations on this issue.  We objected on the night, in EU Co-ordination, and I have written to Commissioner Bonino this week putting my views firmly on record and looking for a solution.  I also wrote to the President of the Council of Ministers, Mr. Atienza of Spain.</P>
    <P>I await the Commissioner's reaction and I will of course be pursuing this fundamental issue of principle at next week's Fisheries Council.  I met the industry yesterday and they are fully behind my efforts to obtain a solution which takes full account of Ireland's genuine concerns.  In my letter to Commissioner Bonino I stressed that we are a small, peripheral country trying to build a sustainable fishing sector, develop fish processing and planning to expand into alternative species such as blue whiting.  The concession of blue whiting to Norway further erodes the long-term scope for expansion by the north west pelagic industry.</P>
    <P>I will be pushing this issue very vigorously in the days ahead and I am sure I can rely on the full support of the House in taking a very tough stance indeed.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5.15 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Friday, 15 December 1995.</P>

      <P>Records of convictions for non-indictable offences (such as traffic offences) are held at local level.

      <P>An annual return of missing persons is included in the Annual Report of an Garda Síochána, copies of which are available in the Oireachtas Library.  The 1994 report will be published and will show that 1,896 persons were reported missing in that year.  The return will also show that the vast majority of persons reported missing are traced by the authorities. No particular significance is attached to the precise date in each year on which the person is reported missing and it is not therefore published.

      <P>There are currently on average 2,210 prison places available.  As I stated to Deputy Callely in answer to his question of 9 November 1995 the Department of Justice published in 1994 a major policy document in relation to prisons entitled &ldquo;The Management of Offenders &mdash; A Five Year Plan&rdquo;.  This outlines in detail the best way forward for the prison system for the following five years.</P>
      <P>The provision of additional prison spaces is one of the elements of the strategy set out in this document.  As the Deputy will be aware, in June of this year the Government decided to defer the Castlerea prison project and the proposed new women's prison.  The matter of the Castlerea project is still under examination by an interdepartmental committee set up after the decision on the deferrral was taken. This committee has been asked to report to me by the end of December 1995.  In addition, I am exploring possibilities within the existing system to create extra places.</P>
      <P>In the meantime the other elements of the strategy set out in the five year plan, such as the importance of developing community sanctions and measures as a means of avoiding the negative effects of imprisonment will be developed.  Some of these sanctions are already in place but there is scope for extending community based sanctions and measures and I will be pursuing this issue in the months ahead.</P>

      <Quest>the total number of crimes involving the use of firearms in the first six months of 1995; the proposals, if any, she has to further limit the availability of guns, to increase the penalties for the illegal possession and use of firearms and to establish a databank containing the relevant details of all legally imported and held firearms; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen) Nora Owen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that 582 crimes were committed in 1994 involving firearms.  This represents a decrease of 20 per cent on the 1993 figure of 723.  Figures for 1995 are not yet available but I understand from the Garda authorities that the indications are that there has been a further decrease of the order of 10 per cent in 1995.</P>
      <P>Under the Firearms Acts, 1925 to 1990, the power to grant a firearm certificate to a person resident in the State is vested in the local Superintendent of the Garda District where the person resides.  The Garda authorities have informed me that the provisions of the Acts which cover the conditions for the grant of firearm certificates are operating satisfactorily and that thorough inquiries are made in relation to all applicants.  In the circumstances, I do not see that there is a need to change the present arrangements.</P>
      <P>The penalties in the Acts, which were revised by the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Act, 1976 and the Criminal Justice Act, 1984, include, for some offences, imprisonment for life and for other offences, imprisonment for up to 14 years.  They are considered satisfactory by the Garda authorities and I have no proposals before me to change them at this time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that any information which comes to their attention in relation to the existence of illegally held firearms and ammunition is thoroughly investigated. Where such weapons and ammunition are found they are seized, and where appropriate the matter is brought to the attention of the Director of Public Prosecutions.  In this connection, the <Col N="1816" /> Deputy may wish to note that substantial quantities of illegally held firearms and ammunition were seized by the Garda in 1994.</P>
    <P>As regards the establishment of a databank of firearms, relevant details of all legally imported or held firearms by persons resident in the State are already kept on computer by the Garda authorities.</P>

      <Quest>in view of the recent decision by EU Home Affairs Ministers confining refugee status to those who have been persecuted by Government or governmental organisations, the steps, if any, she will take within the EU to assist in ensuring that this restrictive new definition will not be used by EU members, all of whom have signed the 1951 Geneva Convention, to forcibly repatriate Bosnian refugees who have been ill-treated by the Bosnian Serbs.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen) Nora Owen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that the decision referred to by the Deputy is, in fact, a reference to a joint position adopted by the Council of the European Union on 23 November last.  That decision is concerned solely with the application of criteria for recognition and admission as a refugee in accordance with the provisions of the 1951 Geneva Convention and it is not applicable, therefore, to persons granted temporary protection status.</P>
      <P>In most member states of the European Union, including Ireland, special arrangements were put in place to meet the special circumstances of those displaced by the conflict in the former Yugoslavia.  Those arrangements included an undertaking by the member states to offer protection on a temporary basis and a commitment not to return such nationals of the former Yugoslavia who arrive at their frontiers to areas in which they would be at risk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In line with the view of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, states did <Col N="1817" /> not necessarily need to provide simultaneous access to individualised asylum procedures in accordance with the 1951 Geneva Convention where such temporary protection had been provided. As regards Ireland, for example, persons were admitted at the request of the UN High Commissioner under the terms of specific Government decisions and granted temporary protection status with the full rights of refugees.  There is no question, therefore, of persons admitted in such circumstances being forcibly repatriated.</P>
    <P>I should emphasise also, for the information of the Deputy, that the joint position in question consists of non-binding guidelines in line with the objective set by the European Council in 1989 of harmonising member states' asylum policies with the intention of defining criteria for fairness and efficiency which would set a general framework while leaving it to each member state to fill in the exact nature of the asylum procedure.  The guidelines are to be notified to the bodies responsible for recognition of refugee status which are requested to take them as a basis without prejudice to the caselaw of the member states on asylum matters and their relevant constitutional positions. The joint position in no way affects the conditions under which a member state may, according to its national law, permit a person to remain in its territory if his or her safety or physical integrity would be endangered by return to the country of origin because of circumstances which are not covered by the Geneva Convention but which constitute a reason for not returning that person.</P>

      <P>There are a number of services available in the prison system where prisoners can avail of counselling, i.e. the psychology service, the probation and welfare service, the chaplaincy service and, of course, a number of voluntary groups with which prisoners may have contact.</P>
      <P>The psychology service comprises six psychologists to provide a clinical service to the prisons.  This service specially targets a number of offender groups within the prison system, i.e.</P>
      <P>&mdash;juvenile offenders</P>
      <P>&mdash;HIV positive offenders</P>
      <P>&mdash;sex offenders who require specialised treatment</P>
      <P>&mdash;female offenders</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1819" />&mdash;difficult, disruptive and dangerous offenders</P>
    <P>&mdash;offenders who represent a known suicidal risk and</P>
    <P>&mdash;offenders serving very long sentences.</P>
    <P>The psychology service also provides counselling to prison staff who have been subjected to traumatic events in the course of their work.</P>
    <P>There is a total of 27 probation and welfare officers and six senior probation and welfare officers providing a service to the prisons.  Their duties include counselling offenders, helping them cope with personal and domestic problems, guiding them towards services within and outside the prisons which will assist them to cope with specific problems, such as substance addiction, encouraging contact with families and volunteers from the community, helping them generally to cope with their sentences, preparing them for eventual release, and very often putting in train arrangements in the community to help them re-integrate.</P>
    <P>The probation and welfare service, in conjunction with the psychology service, is involved in the delivery of specialised counselling by way of a sex offender treatment programme.</P>
    <P>There are at present nine full-time and seven part-time chaplains working in the prison service.  Their work involves extensive counselling of offenders, not just in spiritual matters but in everyday human activity &mdash; helping them to cope with personal and family traumas, helping some of them deal with suicidal tendencies, and helping them to adapt to prison life.</P>
    <P>The above services are complimented by a number of voluntary groups with whom prisoners may have contact, e.g. the Samaritans, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and Alcoholics Anonymous. The question of expanding the prison counselling services is a matter which will have to be examined in the context of the Government's overall staffing policy.</P>

      <P>The Government Policy Agreement contains a commitment that the Government will examine the possibility of legislating to enable journalists to protect the confidentiality of their sources in certain circumstances. That examination is being undertaken in the context of the Law Reform Commission Report on Contempt of Court.  It is important to bear in mind that it is essential that there is a proper balance maintained between competing rights in this area.  There are differences of view, and the commission's report demonstrated this, as to how exactly the balance should be struck.</P>
      <P>I recognise the important role which the media have to play in a democratic society.

      <P>At present court statistics are maintained primarily for the purpose of measuring activity levels and thereby measuring resource requirements for the courts.  I acknowledge, as my Department does and I am sure Deputies generally do, a more sophisticated and informative statistical system for courts and indeed for the criminal justice system as a whole and I consider that the best way of achieving such a system is through the use of information technology. In this regard my Department is planning major expansion in the use of Information Technology in court offices which will allow for the recording and retrieval of much more detailed statistics in the future.  In planning the expanded use of IT for the courts area close attention is being paid to the need for integrating statistics between the courts, prisons and the Garda Síochána.</P>
      <P>It will take time, expertise and commitment to get us to the stage where we have an adequate set of criminal justice statistics coming on stream each year.

      <P>The Cannes European Council in establishing a strategy for European action against drugs agreed a medium term plan for implementation over a five year period (1995-1999) and also a Commission Programme for Community Action for the Prevention of Drug Dependence.  The Council also mandated a group of experts from the member states to submit to the Madrid Council an analytical report dealing with the measures to be taken to ensure practical implementation of this strategy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the presentation of the draft expert report to the Justice and Home Affairs Council on 23 November I welcomed the proposed practical measures <Col N="1824" /> which will form the basis for a programme of activities during both the Italian and Irish Presidencies, to combat the scourge of drug trafficking in all member states.  In particular, I emphasised the pivotal role of the Justice and Home Affairs area in tackling illegal trafficking by adopting measures to increase protection of the external borders of the Union, maximising police-customs co-operation, combating all forms of money laundering and improving judicial co-operation.</P>
    <P>Meetings of the Justice and Home Affairs Council with Third Countries (Central and Eastern Europe, Mediterranean countries, USA) have also considered the importance of addressing the drugs problem.  The Council has given the Commission approval to negotiate an agreement with Member Countries of the Organisation of American States on the Control of Drug Precursors. The objective of this agreement is to control chemicals normally intended for legitimate manufacturing, from being used in the illicit manufacturing of drugs.</P>
    <P>The adoption earlier this year, of the Convention establishing a European Police Office (Europol) will facilitate greater exchange of criminal intelligence in the fight against drug trafficking. Indeed, the appointment of a Liaison Officer from the Garda Síochána (at Inspector level) to the Europol Drugs Unit, the forerunner of EUROPOL, has substantially strengthened our participation in the European fight against drugs.  Some of the seizures of drugs by our law enforcement agencies have been facilitated by our participation in the work of the Unit.</P>
    <P>Ireland has secured funding in the region of £200,000 for a pilot training exchange programme which focuses on the development of joint strategies, methods and closer co-operation in policing drug trafficking in the European Union.  The project will involve the exchange between a number of member states of operational police involved in drug trafficking.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1825" /> The work of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction in providing the Union with reliable and comparable information concerning drug addiction and its consequences is a further practical measure in the fight against drug trafficking.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 37 and 112 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 40 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1988, empowers the Minister for Justice to make regulations providing for a national, voluntary, age card scheme as a means of helping to curb the supply of alcohol to persons under <Col N="1826" /> 18 years of age.  I have no proposals at present to make such regulations.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the most acceptable and effective way of complementing the comprehensive set of provisions in the 1988 Act aimed at curbing under-age drinking is through the continued development of voluntary local age card schemes.  Such schemes, backed by vigorous community involvement and with continual monitoring are, I believe, capable of making a greater contribution to tackling under-age drinking than a single nationwide scheme.</P>
    <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that more than 110 local schemes are in operation throughout the country and that plans are under way to establish new schemes in other centres.  I am also informed that, overall, the schemes are considered to be reasonably successful and beneficial and that they have assisted in reducing the level of alcohol use by persons under the age of 18 years.</P>

      <P>The current position is that all prisoners are regarded as entitled to 25 per cent remission of sentence for good conduct. Remission may be forfeited by the Governor, visiting committee or Minister for Justice for a breach of prison discipline. The grant of remission and the threat of losing it for misbehaviour encourages offenders to co-operate with prison management in maintaining order and control.  I am, therefore, satisfied that, for sound management reasons, remission should continue to be granted as heretofore.</P>
      <P>I am not convinced that a change in the standard remission rate in respect of a single offence category, would really advance the aim of protecting society from offenders in that category.  The courts, in determining the sentence to be imposed in individual cases, are aware of the fact that a standard 25 per cent remission rate applies as a matter of entitlement for good behaviour.  The existence of standard remission does not mean, therefore, that the offender is released earlier than the judge thinks appropriate, because the standard remission rate is already &ldquo;factored into&rdquo; the sentence imposed &mdash; what it means, in practice, is that the offender who misbehaves while in custody may serve a longer period in custody than would have applied if he had been of good behaviour.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen) Nora Owen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to begin by reiterating my personal commitment to dealing effectively with the drug abuse problem in our prisons. It would be disingenuous to suggest that &mdash; on their own &mdash; security related measures, no matter how rigorous, aimed solely at detecting the smuggling in, and abuse of, drugs within the prisons would provide an effective solution to the problem.  It is widely accepted that in the area of substance abuse, an effective programme of education along with aftercare and support for those affected are both essential components of any overall strategy aimed at combating the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having regard to this, I have implemented a number of measures in Mountjoy and other prisons.  These include, in respect of Mountjoy Prison, the adaptation of the existing visiting arrangements, an improvement in the procedures for searching and the upgrading of video surveillance equipment at the prison.  I have, in addition, decided to expand and improve the visiting facilities at the prison.  All of these measures will greatly assist staff in intercepting illegal drugs and associated contraband and I am glad to be able to inform the House that the measures already in place since mid-summer have had a marked effect with an overall increase in the order of 100 per cent in the number of seizures of contraband. Arising from these seizures a number of visitors suspected of being involved in passing drugs to prisoners have been arrested and I understand that charges are pending in these cases.  A great deal of credit is due to the staff concerned <Col N="1831" /> for their efforts in this area and I am sure Deputies will join me in complimenting them on their efforts in this regard.</P>
    <P>There is also in place, in all the institutions since last year, a comprehensive integrated education programme aimed at discouraging drug abuse and educating prisoners as to the risks posed both to themselves and their families by the activity.  The programme is based on a multi-disciplinary approach utilising the most modern educational aids available including the specially commissioned award winning video &ldquo;HIV and Aids &mdash; The Facts&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I am aware also that to be effective, treatment for addicts in prison or in the community must include a therapeutic element in order to equip them with the mechanism to avoid becoming reinvolved with drug abuse in the future.</P>
    <P>With this in mind, I have already announced a range of measures which will, when fully implemented, meet this need.  These measures include the creation of a treatment facility in Mountjoy Prison.  This facility will provide prisoners who are suffering from acute drug addiction problems and who show the necessary commitment, with an opportunity to avail of a humane detoxification programme on a par with what is available in the community.  The delivery of methadone maintenance programmes for those prisoners assessed as medically suitable for them, will also be provided in this facility which is likely to be located at the health care unit in Mountjoy Prison.</P>
    <P>I have also approved the opening of a drug-free facility in the Mountjoy Prison complex.  Prisoners with a background of drug addiction, including those who successfully complete the detoxification programme, and who show the necessary commitment will be able to benefit from a sympathetic yet closely monitored regime where a specially designed and structured therapy programme will play a key role in their long-term recovery. This facility will also enable the prison authorities to accommodate those <Col N="1832" /> prisoners who do not have a background of drug abuse in a totally drug free and secure environment within the prison system.</P>
    <P>I am sure the House will agree that the measures which I have outlined represent a comprehensive and realistic response to the problem of drugs and drug abuse in the prisons &mdash; which, it should be remembered, is unfortunately a direct reflection of what is happening in the community as a whole.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen) Nora Owen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The legislation for which my Department has responsibility dealing with the sale and distribution of pornographic material is principally the following:</P>
      <P>&mdash;the Censorship of Publications Acts, 1929 to 1967 (as amended);</P>
      <P>&mdash;the Censorship of Films Acts, 1923 to 1992; and</P>
      <P>&mdash;the Video Recordings Acts, 1989 to 1992.</P>
      <P>These Acts provide for censorship of books-magazines, films and video recordings, respectively.  The task of censorship is carried out by the Censorship of Publications Board in relation to books and magazines and by the film censor in relation to films and video recordings.  There are also appeal boards to decide on any appeal against the decisions of the Censorship of Publications Board and the film censor.</P>
      <P>In accordance with the provisions of the relevant legislation, the various boards and the film censor are independent in the exercise of their functions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a mechanism in place, under the existing Censorship of Publications legislation, through which pornographic or obscene publications can be banned. <Col N="1833" /> I strongly urge persons who may be aware of the sale, at any place, of books or magazines which they regard to be pornographic to employ the provisions outlined in sections 6 and 9 of the Censorship of Publications Act, 1946 (as amended).</P>
    <P>In particular, section 9 of the Censorship of Publications Act, 1946, makes provision for the Censorship of Publications Board, on receipt of a complaint from any person, to prohibit the sale of a magazine which they consider to be indecent or obscene.  Complaints should be made to the Censorship of Publications Board.  A complaint must be accompanied by a copy of the book in question or, in the case of a magazine, by three recent issues of the magazine. When a publication is banned, it is then a criminal offence to sell, expose, offer, advertise or keep for sale, or distribute, or offer or keep for distribution, any such publication.</P>
    <P>With regard to the censorship of films and video recordings, I consider that the existing legislation gives the film censor wide-ranging powers to deal effectively with this area.</P>
    <P>The existing legislation confers certain powers on the Garda Síochána and officers of the Customs and Excise Service to search for and to seize indecent and obscene pictures, books, magazines and videos.  In this regard, I am aware that the Garda recently carried out a number of raids in the Dublin Metropolitan Area, some of which were as a result of ongoing investigations.  I understand that quantities of pornographic materials were seized and that Garda inquiries in this regard are ongoing.</P>
    <P>In all this, I am conscious of the need to ensure that the powers of both the Garda and the Customs and Excise Service in this area are sufficient to deal with any problems arising and, with this in mind, I have sought the opinion of the Attorney General in this regard.</P>
    <P>If, on receipt of the advice of the Attorney General or at any other stage, <Col N="1834" /> it becomes evident that the existing censorship legislation as amended is inadequate, I will not hesitate to bring proposals for amending legislation to the Government for approval.</P>

    <P>1 Including PAYE on employee income of farmers.</P>
    <P>These figures do not include any yields in 1993 and 1994 under the 1993 tax amnesty.  Also excluded from the calculations are tax receipts from deposit interest retention tax because it is not possible to apportion that tax between particular classes of taxpayers.</P>
    <P>The amounts paid by each sector must be seen in the context of the relative numbers of taxpayers in the PAYE and farming sectors.  It should also be noted that the amount attributed to the PAYE sector includes the tax paid under PAYE on the employee income of farmers.  Such tax is included in the overall collection of PAYE and is not distinguishable until after the income tax returns submitted by farmers have been analysed.</P>
    <P>An analysis of the returns for the <Col N="1841" /> income tax year 1992-93, the latest available, indicates that some £56 million in tax was paid by farmers, including farmers who have other trading income, or their spouses, under the PAYE system for that year.</P>
    <P>Farmers are assessable to tax on farming profits on actual income on the same basis as other self-employed taxpayers. The normal self-employed allowances may be offset against farming profits as well as special provisions in relation to stock relief and income averaging.  In common with other self-employed taxpayers, farmers are subject to the various compliance and audit arrangements which apply under the self-assessment system.  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the evidence currently available from self-employed audits indicates that the compliance levels of farmers are comparable to those of other self-employed taxpayers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Coveney)</NameTxt>
      <P>The delay in completing the sale and lease of separate parts of this property is due to the fact that these transactions cannot be completed until the title of the Commissioners of Public Works to the property has been registered in the Land Registry.  A counsel's certificate of title is an essential prerequisite to this application for registration, and counsel has recently been furnished by the Chief State Solicitor with the results of research which was deemed necessary by counsel before the required certificate could be furnished.  On receipt of the certificate, the Chief State Solicitor will apply for registration of the commissioners' title.  It is the intention of the <Col N="1843" /> Chief State Solicitor, when the application for registration has been lodged in the Land Registry and a Land Registry dealing number is available, to furnish a contract for sale to the purchaser's solicitors.  The terms of a draft lease for the remainder of the property are the subject of correspondence between the Chief State Solicitor and the lessee's solicitor.</P>
      <P>The agreement for the sale of part of the property contains no provision for the price to be index-linked.  No loss of revenue is envisaged as a result of the delay in this case.  As I indicated to the Deputy on 29 June 1995 in reply to Question No. 49, the portion of the property on sale is occupied by the party to which a sale has been agreed and payment in respect of this occupation will be settled in the context of closing the sale.  The agreed terms of the lease for the remainder of the property provide for specific payments on the commencement date of the lease and the first four anniversaries of that date, and for payment of a nominal rent for the remainder of the duration of the lease.</P>

      <P>The provisions of section 20 of the Finance (No. 2) Act, 1992 which stipulate that vehicles must be licensed at the time of registration for vehicle registration tax came into effect on 1 January 1993 on the introduction of vehicle registration tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1844" /> I am informed by the Minister for the Environment that the staff of the licensing authorities which administer the vehicle licensing regulations were advised, by circular letter issued by the Department of the Environment on 21 December 1992, of the statutory provisions introduced by section 20 of the Finance (No. 2) Act, 1992.  A further circular letter, issued by that Department on 18 January 1993 included a notice outlining the changed provisions for public display in the licensing authorities.</P>
    <P>Under section 117 of the Finance Act, 1995 certain exemptions to the requirement of section 20 were introduced with effect from 2 June 1995.  As prior notification of non-intended use of a vehicle immediately after registration is a integral part of the exemptions the question of back-dating the exemptions is not feasible.</P>

      <P>The EU Commission challenged the legality of the tax in 1985 on the grounds that it violated Community law applicable in the area of workers' rights to travel from one member state to another.  The points raised by the Commission were responded to by my Department.  The matter was not taken any further.</P>

      <P>I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the system of tax deductions for certain sub-contractors in the construction industry, which has since become known as the C45 system, was introduced by section 17 of the Finance Act, 1970 with effect from 6 April 1970.

      <P>Over the past few years the Commissioners of Public Works have been engaged in the survey, design and economic and environmental evaluation of various options for the execution of an arterial drainage scheme for the Mulcair catchment under the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945.  All prospective costs and benefits have been included in the various analyses undertaken but it has not proved possible to devise an economically acceptable scheme.</P>
      <P>The Commissioners of Public Works are engaged in designing flood relief schemes for Cappamore and Newport both of which suffer as a result of flooding of the Mulcair.  An environmental impact assessment of the proposed scheme has been commissioned and is due for completion in July next year.</P>
      <P>Provided the EIA and cost benefit analysis prove favourable the scheme will then be submitted for approval by the Minister for Finance prior to public exhibition in accordance with the provisions of the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945 as amended earlier this year.</P>
      <P>All going well it is hoped to commence work at the end of next year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>, <i>Limerick East):</i> Admission for open heart surgery in the public hospital service is determined having regard to the medical condition of patients, is based solely on the patient's condition and not on the length of time on the waiting list. Emergency cases are given priority.  In these circumstances, the average waiting time is not a critical indicator of the adequacy of the service available.  The adult waiting list for open heart surgery stands at 1,597.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am now anxious to expand the current public hospital capacity for cardiac surgery.  I have asked my Department to formulate proposals for the provision of additional cardiac surgery activity in the public hospital system.  I am fully committed to the provision of additional capacity, including the appointment of additional cardiac surgeons on a permanent basis within the public hospital system over the next two-three years.  This <Col N="1850" /> examination of the long-term requirements will begin immediately.  However, because of the need to ensure that future developments are well planned and to allow sufficient time to put in place the type of permanent, expensive, high cost infrastructure required for cardiac surgery it will take some time before this additional capacity comes on stream.</P>
    <P>I have therefore also asked my Department to see whether any health care organisations can provide cardiac surgery at prices which are reasonable and affordable on a once-off basis.  I am engaged in finalising negotiations on the purchase of additional once-off procedures and hope to be in a position to make an announcement in this regard very soon.</P>
    <P>I wish to stress that the major objective is to increase the permanent capacity for cardiac surgery in the public hospital sector and in the meantime to provide additional procedures quickly to ease the problems of those waiting cardiac operations.  I am hopeful that the short-term approach together with the long-term planning initiative will ensure that waiting times for cardiac surgery are reduced significantly and look forward to co-operation from everybody involved to bring this about as quickly as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>, <i>Limerick East):</i> Following the success of last year's waiting list initiative the Government has committed a further £8 million in 1995 to continue to reduce waiting times in a number of target specialties where waiting times are considered excessive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1851" /> Emphasis this year has been placed on providing funding to ensure a reduction in waiting lists where waiting times for adults were in excess of 12 months and, for children, of six months. The specialties of ENT, ophthalmology, orthopaedics, plastic surgery, vascular surgery, general surgery, gynaecology and urology are being targeted as needing particular attention.</P>
    <P>When the initiative commenced in June 1993 the total in-patient waiting list for all specialties was 40,130.  By 31 December 1994 this figure had been reduced to 23,835 which represents a reduction of 16,295 or 40 per cent over a period of 18 months.</P>
    <P>An additional 10,394 in-patient procedures are being carried out under the 1995 initiative.  This year's initiative also targets out-patient waiting lists where waiting times are excessive.  An additional 6,728 persons awaiting an out-patient appointment will be seen. These extra procedures to be performed will be in addition to the level of baseline activity to be carried out in each agency within their approved current expenditure allocation.</P>
    <P>While the total waiting list at the end of September 1995 shows an increase over the December 1994 figure, the total number of people waiting for treatment has reduced since the end of March 1995.  This indicates that the 1995 waiting list initiative which was launched at the end of June is succeeding in reducing the increased waiting list which had built up due to the rise in emergency activity in the early part of the year.  With the majority of additional procedures being performed during the final quarter of the year I am confident that this downward trend in the overall waiting list will continue to the end of the year.</P>

      <P>, <i>Limerick East):</i> The health strategy noted that there are a number of services, including paramedical services, for which no eligibility criteria, or rules governing charges, are set down in legislation. The strategy also stated that because these services have developed in the absence of legislative guidelines there are considerable differences from area to area in relation to the extent to which they are provided and who is entitled to receive them.  It said that national guidelines on eligibility, which will be applied in a uniform manner in all areas, will be introduced in respect of services where legislative provisions are absent.</P>

    <P>The extent of such services, including chiropody, is being considered and I do not consider it appropriate at this stage <Col N="1853" /> to introduce a limited service for any specific group.</P>
    <P>Chiropody services are relevant to a number of different client groups, such as the elderly, persons with a mental handicap and persons with a physical disability.  As funding is allocated on the basis of the overall programme for each client group it is not possible to identify separately the total expenditure on the chiropody service.  Therefore, the data required to estimate the cost of providing the level of service requested is not available.</P>

      <P>, <i>Limerick East):</i> I understand that there are 114 children diagnosed with haemophilia registered for treatment with the national haemophilia treatment centre at the National Children's Hospital at Harcourt Street.  A further 20 children are believed to be under investigation where diagnosis has not been confirmed. There are no details available as to the number of these children who are covered by medical cards.  The approximate annual average cost of a child under 16 to the general medical services Scheme is £96.50.</P>
      <P>Haemophilia is one of the conditions covered by the long-term illness scheme which entitles those eligible to free drugs and medicines in respect of the particular condition.  I understand from the Eastern Health Board that the child concerned has been availing of the long-term illness scheme since 1993.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1854" /> The Eastern Health Board has indicated that it has no record of an application for a medical card having been received in respect of this child in the past year.  However, if the family forwards details of their circumstances to the chief executive officer of the Eastern Health Board, the matter will be examined by the board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht (Mr. M. Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>Directive 89/552/EEC &ldquo;Television without Frontiers&rdquo; obliges member states to ensure that European broadcasters reserve for European works, where practicable, a majority proportion of their transmission time excluding news, sports events, games, advertising and teletext services. RTE devotes considerably more than a majority proportion of its transmission time to European works as defined by the Directive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 31 May 1995, the European Commission presented a proposal for a European Parliament and Council <Col N="1859" /> Directive to amend the &ldquo;Television without Frontiers&rdquo; Directive.  One of the main objectives of the Commission proposal was to clarify and add detail to the obligations placed on member states regarding the quota system.  In particular it was proposed to delete the vague phrase &ldquo;where practicable&rdquo; which has hindered the effective application of the majority proportion quota in the various member states.  I supported this proposal because I believe that a more effective application of the quota at its existing level is necessary in order to ensure that European broadcasters fulfil their obligations to the European programme production sector.  The quota is an essential element of the audiovisual policy of the EU which has as its objective the development of a European audiovisual sector which can act as a cultural counterweight to its North American counterpart.</P>
    <P>The Commission's proposal was considered by the Council of Ministers at meetings in June and November.  At these meetings it became clear that those member states, including Ireland, which favoured a more effective application of the quota were in the minority. In fact a majority of the member states were in favour of abolishing the quota system in the short or medium-term.  On 20 November the Council, subject to and pending the opinion of the European Parliament, agreed to leave the quota provisions of the Directive unchanged with provision for a further review of the quota system within five years.  I reluctantly accepted this agreement in the light of the reality of the position within the Council.</P>

      <P>The proposed National Cultural Institutions, Indemnities and Related Miscellaneous Provisions Bill, 1995 which will, amongst other things, establish autonomous boards to run the National Museum and the National Library, was approved in principle by the Government in July of this year.  The approved proposals are with the parliamentary draftsman and I would hope to be in a position to have the Bill published in the earlier part of next year.</P>

      <P>In general, capital projects in my Department are in the first instance evaluated by reference to how they can contribute to the Government's core economic and social <Col N="1862" /> strategies for job creation and the elimination of social exclusion and regional imbalance so as to ensure access to all facets of the Irish language, our culture and heritage.</P>
      <P>Individual projects are considered in regard to their potential to satisfy the cultural, social and economic needs of a given community.  A further qualifying consideration is that funds will be available at least in the medium-term for operational purposes and to maintain the capital assets.</P>
      <P>Under the cultural development incentive scheme 1994-99, which my Department is administering under the Operational Programme for Tourism, projects, while having a tourism potential, must also demonstrate a distinct and recognisable cultural aspect.</P>
      <P>Likewise, projects being financed by moneys allocated for specific activities such as Gaeltacht schemes, heritage or cultural projects have to meet the specific requirements for each of those schemes pertaining to geographical location, local community support, additional funding from other sources and long-term sustainability.</P>

      <P>Under the Wireless Telegraphy Acts 1926-88 the issue of licences for radio transmitters is a matter for the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications.  I have no statutory function either in the issue of such licences or in connection with any application for a licence.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1863" /> I understand that the judgment to which the Deputy is referring and which was delivered by the court in November 1993 related to the specific circumstances existing in Austria whereby under Austrian legislation the right to establish either a radio or television station was restricted to the Austrian Broadcasting Corporation.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy is aware, Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights specifically states that &ldquo;this Article shall not prevent States from requiring the licensing of broadcasting, television or cinema enterprises.&rdquo; The judgment of the court has not altered this provision.  In the light of the legal regime relating to broadcasting that exists here, I believe that the judgment is not relevant to the Irish situation.</P>

      <P>I take it that the question relates to housing being provided by the Society of St. Vincent de Paul at Cappanaleigh, Upperchurch, Thurles, County Tipperary. I approved a grant of £88,000 under the voluntary housing capital assistance scheme for this project last August.  An instalment of £30,000 of this grant is being paid to Tipperary (NR) County Council this week.</P>
      <P>An application for a supplementary grant of £20,000 for the project, arising from the increase in the rate of grant announced in &ldquo;Social Housing &mdash; The Way Ahead&rdquo;, will be considered in the context of the allocation of funds for the scheme in 1996.  A decision will be notified to Tipperary (NR) County Council, which is responsible for administering the scheme in the area, in due course.</P>

It is one of the most comprehensive pieces of legislation of its type in Europe.

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities who are responsible for the detailed allocation of Garda personnel to different areas that the area of Lower Gardiner Street and Sean McDermott Street has two uniformed members specifically assigned to patrolling the area on foot. They have a very good relationship with the residents of both streets and play a major role in the prevention and detection of various types of crime in the area.</P>
      <P>In addition to these two gardaí there is one sergeant and six gardaí attached to the Store Street and Fitzgibbon Street Garda stations specifically assigned to foot patrols in the general locality of Lower Gardiner Street.  The area is also patrolled by regular foot and mobile units from Store Street, Fitzgibbon Street and Harcourt Square.</P>
      <P>Every garda, in the course of his or her duty, recognises that elderly people may feel particularly vulnerable and suffer greatly from the fear of becoming a vicitim of crime.  With this recognition in mind, the Garda authorities have assured me that the gardaí pay particular attention to the elderly in all respects of their duties.</P>

      <P>Exchange rates can fluctuate frequently.  In view of this and the fact that a considerable number of Irish non-contributory pensioners are in receipt of British pensions, it would not be practicable to reassess entitlement to old age non-contributory pension each time currency exchange rates move.  A realistic approach for resolving this problem has therefore been adopted by my Department. When calculating means based upon EU pensions, the Department employs an exchange rate mechanism used within the EU in relation to certain social security transactions between member states.</P>
      <P>Any person in receipt of a United Kingdom retirement pension whose means have changed as a result of the change in value of sterling may be entitled to an old age non-contributory pension from my Department provided their means do not exceed IR£66 per week.  A United Kingdom pensioner already in receipt of an old age non-contributory pension and whose means have reduced as a result is entitled to request a review of his or her means assessment at any time.</P>
      <P>People in receipt of United Kingdom pensions, who, for instance, may be waiting for the non-contributory old age pension application to be processed, who are experiencing difficulty as a result of their income falling below the appropriate rate of supplementary welfare allowance for their family size should also contact the community welfare officer at their local health centre.</P>

      <P>The free travel companion pass is a variation on the free travel pass which allows certain incapacitated people, who are medically unfit to travel alone, to be accompanied free of charge by a person 16 years of age or over when travelling.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the case of International Investments Limited, a Gibraltar-registered banking company which, by order of the Gibraltar Supreme Court, has been in liquidation since 1984.</P>
      <P>Earlier this year, I ordered a review of my Department's files relating to the company.  There have been many allegations over the years about irregularities in the affairs of the company, which was originally incorporated in Gibraltar in 1976 and essentially sprang from an Industrial and Provident Society registered by the Registrar of Friendly Societies in 1975.  Many of the investors were from Northern Ireland and the State.  The matter had been the subject of several reviews by my predecessors in my Department and investigations by the Garda, the RUC and the official Gibraltar liquidators.  The Garda referred the case to the Director of Public Prosecutions who directed that there was insufficient evidence to mount a prosecution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a thoroughly regrettable case and my concerns, and those of others represented to me, impelled me to commence the review.  This was detailed and exhaustive and, consumed much time and effort particularly in view of the length of time since the contentious events took place, some 17 or so years ago.  Representations seeking the appointment of an inspector have been made to various Governments since <Col N="1890" /> 1992.  During the course of the review, I have been in written and verbal contact with many people about various aspects of the case including, in particular, the Minister for Justice, the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications and the Attorney General.  The Attorney General has given me detailed advice.  I also met some creditors of the company in June 1995 when they reiterated their request for the appointment of an official inspector under the Irish company law code.</P>
    <P>Despite these efforts, no new factors have been substantiated to me either in the course of the review or in representations I have received since my appointment in the present Government. Material submitted to me has been carefully studied and advice taken thereon.  I have formed the view, having regard to the advice of the Attorney General and the results of the work carried out in various fora in reviewing the case, that no useful purpose would be achieved by pursuing the matter any further in so far as matters under my aegis are concerned.  The nub of the advice I received is that it is doubtful whether the courts would be satisfied that any worthwhile result, such as the orderly winding-up or recovery and distribution of property, would be achieved by pursuing the matter in the context of the Irish company law code. I was also conscious that effective action and redress would be difficult with the trail having gone cold with the significant passage of time since the contentious events took place.  Accordingly, with considerable reluctance and regret, I have decided to conclude my review.</P>
    <P>It is a matter for those affected, but I would counsel that matters that might arise in the official liquidation of the company should be brought to the attention of the Gibraltar authorities, if that has not already been done.  As regards the allegations of fraudulent activities in the Irish jurisdiction, any new material arising should be forwarded urgently to the Garda Fraud <Col N="1891" /> Investigation Bureau.  Clearly, any new evidence would need to be compelling, in view of the earlier decisions by the Director of Public Prosecutions not to pursue any prosecutions.  I have been informed that the Garda is fully prepared to pursue any leads that might arise and that it has been in touch with the official liquidator in Gibraltar and the police authorities in Northern Ireland, which have been pursuing their own leads.</P>

      <P>A total of 121 recommendations have been identified in the report of the Task Force on Small Business.  The latest position is that 18 recommendations have been fully implemented and a further 20 partially implemented.</P>
      <P>It is clear from the Government's document, A Government of Renewal, that the Government accepts the task force's agenda for improving the operating environment for small business. However, every recommendation needs to be examined on its merits.  In some cases options need to be explored as to how to deliver the essence, if not the letter of a recommendation.  In other cases, there may be a very substantial body of work in the pursuit of just one recommendation.  Moreover, the large number of tax recommendations in the report have to be considered annually in the context of fiscal policy and competing demands in relation to the budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In general terms I am pleased with the progress being made towards <Col N="1892" /> creating a better context in Ireland for small businesses to flourish and make a strong contribution to the national economy.

      <P>I would draw the Deputy's attention to the Restrictive Practices (Groceries) Order, 1987 which includes provisions which prohibit below cost selling of many grocery products and the payment or receipt of &ldquo;hello money&rdquo;.  The Director of Consumer Affairs is responsible for enforcing the order and has the power to investigate alleged breaches of the order.  I decided earlier this year to retain the Groceries Order for a period of two years.  I believe the retention of the order is necessary because competition law, as it now stands, is ill-equipped to tackle anti-competitive activity in the grocery trade.  The lack of public enforcement and inadequate penalties for breaches of the law are fundamental deficiencies in the existing competition regime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Competition (Amendment) Bill, which is currently before the Select Committee on Enterprise and Economic Strategy will, when enacted, give powers of investigation and enforcement to the Competition Authority.  The proposed Director of Competition Enforcement may investigate complaints, including those from newsagents <Col N="1894" /> and grocery outlets concerning anti-competitive practices and may make recommendations and give advice to the authority on the institution of Court proceedings in such matters as appropriate.</P>

Since then the UK have been considering the points made by me and I understand that senior British officials will be in contact with senior Irish officials within the next few days.  The Industry Council on Wednesday 20 December, specifically requested by Ireland to discuss the Irish Steel case, will present another opportunity for further political initiatives with my UK counterparts where I hope the genuineness of the Irish Steel case which is supported by the 13 other member states plus the Commission and the Presidency will be accepted by the UK thus enabling the UK to lift its reservation.</P>

      <P>The deseasonalisation slaughter premium is payable in member states where the number of steers slaughtered in the period 1 September to 30 November of the second <Col N="1898" /> preceding year exceeds 40 per cent of annual steer slaughterings.  On that basis, the deseasonalisation slaughter premium will be payable in Ireland in 1996.  This scheme is designed to encourage a better seasonal spread of slaughterings in regions with traditional seasonal imbalances in production.  It has been very successful in Ireland in meeting this objective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the success of the scheme in reducing the seasonality of steer slaughterings this autumn has caused slaughterings in the relevant period this year to fall below the 40 per cent threshold. In view of this and in order to prevent a reversal to the traditional seasonal pattern I have asked the European Commission to propose a reduction in the trigger to 35 per cent in order to guarantee payment of the premium in future years.  This request is at <Col N="1899" /> present being considered by the Commission services.</P>

      <P>I propose taking Questions Nos. 141, 142, 143, 144, 146 and 148 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the Community Support Framework for Ireland, 1994-1999, it was agreed that an independent evaluation of the Compensatory Allowances Scheme would be carried out &ldquo;to examine the balance between income support and development measures with a view to ensuring that farming can become more self-reliant and integrated into the rural economy&rdquo;.  This evaluation was requested by the Commission as it felt that the share of funding being devoted to this scheme was very high &mdash; £642 million (62 per cent) &mdash; as against a total of £1,034 million for the agriculture and rural development elements of the operational programme.  Accordingly, my Department commissioned this evaluation in accordance with normal tendering procedures as set out in the Code <Col N="1902" /> of Practice for Government Departments Employing Management Consultants. The cost of the report was £22,143.</P>
    <P>As already indicated in my reply to Questions Nos. 32 and 66 on 16 November, the areas the consultant was asked to examine were as follows:</P>
    <P>&mdash;the balance between investment and income support measures under the Operational Programme for Agriculture, Rural Development and Forestry</P>
    <P>&mdash;the extent to which the scheme contributes towards its main objective of maintaining the population in disadvantaged rural areas</P>

    <P>As also indicated in my reply of 16 November, the farming bodies have been supplied with copies of the report which has also been placed in the Dáil Library.</P>
    <P>Officials of my Department recently had preliminary discussions with representatives of the European Commission on the findings of the report. The report is now being assessed in my Department in the light of those discussions prior to meeting with the farming bodies.  When I have come to final conclusions on the report, more substantive discussions with the Commission will be necessary.</P>

      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to the importation of pigs from other EU member states. As I indicated in replies to Questions on 12 December, this is governed by Council Directive 64/432/EEC, as amended, which sets out very strict conditions for such trade, including requirements that the pigs have tested negative for certain diseases and are accompanied by a health certificate issued by an authorised veterinarian in the member state of dispatch.  In addition checks are carried out on consignments in accordance with the provisions of the European Communities (Trade in Animals and Animal Products) Regulations, 1994.</P>
      <P>Whilst I appreciate the value of the voluntary Code of Practice adopted by the National Pig Health Council and would strongly encourage all importers to abide by it, the requirements of the EU single market preclude me from establishing animal health conditions over and above those set out in this directive.</P>

      <P>There are around 6,500 applicants for suckler cow and special beef premia and disadvantaged areas grants who either submitted their 1995 area aid applications too late or did not submit any 1995 area aid applications.</P>
      <P>Some of those applicants may not have submitted 1995 area aid applications because they did not need to &mdash; i.e. because they were not applying for Disadvantaged Areas grants or interested in qualifying for Extensification Premium and because they were not eligible for any Suckler Cow and Special Beef premia in excess of 15 livestock units.  It is not yet clear, therefore, how many of the 6,500 cases mentioned might lose payment of premium or headage because they did not submit a 1995 Area Aid application.</P>
      <P>What is certain, however, is that a very substantial number of farmers is affected by this problem.  That is why I directed my Department to take it up with the European Commission and why I shall ensure every effort is made to convince the Commission of the need for an equitable solution to the problem at the earliest possible date.</P>

      <P>I announced on 24 October last that the <Col N="1908" /> Aer Rianta discount scheme would include, from 1996, a special scheme for Shannon and Cork Airports.</P>
      <P>There will be no aircraft landing charges or passenger load fees for new traffic or new services for a period of two years.  This new strategy is aimed at attracting new services on routes into Shannon and Cork and will position the airports for significant new business.</P>
      <P>In addition, the Government decided recently that full responsibility for promoting and marketing Shannon Airport should be assigned to Aer Rianta.  The company is already managing the airport as well as those in Cork and Dublin. It will now be able to devise integrated strategies for marketing all three airports.</P>
      <P>A sum of £1.8 million is being allocated to Aer Rianta in 1996 specifically for the marketing of Shannon Airport. In addition, I have set up a consultative committee, comprised of local interests, to offer advice to Aer Rianta on all marketing strategies for the development of traffic at Shannon Airport and to monitor and review progress under such strategies.</P>
