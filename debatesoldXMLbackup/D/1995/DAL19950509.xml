      <P>Provision for unemployment payments in 1995 has been made on the basis of the forecast of average registered unemployment of 266,000 set down by the Minister for Finance on budget day in the document <i>Economic Background to the Budget.</i> This forecast takes account of a range of macro-economic factors and of the expected impact of participation by unemployed people in various programmes aimed at getting them back into the active workforce. The average impact of participation in community employment at the level envisaged in the 1995 budget is, therefore, already reflected in my Department's provision for unemployment payments. Any proposals for adjustment <Col N="930" /> to the community employment participation rate are, of course, a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Enterprise and Employment.</P>
      <P>Expenditure on the full range of my Department's programmes is monitored closely as a matter of routine and an additional provision can, if necessary, be sought by way of Supplementary Estimate later in the year.</P>

      <P>The Minister is off loading the problem to his colleague, the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, but that will not do very much for the long term unemployed. At budget time did he have discussions with his colleague? Provisions were not made for an estimated 7,000 people who will now come back on to the social welfare payroll? Would it not be a more efficient use of taxpayers money if it was used on community employment rather than on the dole?</P>

      <P>I am afraid the Deputy is displaying his ignorance of the way community employment works. I have discussions at various times with my colleagues on a range of issues and during discussions on the budget I discussed the needs of the Department of Social Welfare with virtually all Ministers.</P>
      <P>Community employment is the responsibility of the Minister for Enterprise and Employment and in due course he will express his views on how the current situation can be dealt with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Variations in the live register impacts on unemployment payments expenditure and it costs £3.5 million for every 1,000 persons who have to be paid. The Deputy will appreciate that the Department's expenditure is very large, given the numbers who are unemployed. It is a constant concern of the Department to ensure that unemployed people gain useful employment. The Department has a very effective back to work scheme employing in excess of 6,000 people. The Deputy may be aware of it. Under that scheme a person, during the first year of employment, can retain 75 <Col N="931" /> per cent of his social welfare payments; during the second year he retains 50 per cent of social welfare payments and during the third year 25 per cent of social welfare payments. To imply that the Department of Social Welfare is doing nothing to enable people move from the live register to employment is incorrect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I defer to the Minister in his expertise, ignorance and arrogance for that matter. Seven thousand people were employed in community employment schemes on heritage and arts projects which were very good for the local community. On community employment people have self-esteem but now they will go on the dole where they have no self esteem. At this late stage will the Minister discuss the matter with his colleague to see whether the Departments of Social Welfare and Enterprise and Employment can continue this universally acknowledged good scheme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Despite what the Deputy might consider to be arrogance on my part, he seems to be of the opinion that community employment is about to be abolished. It is not.</P>
      <P>The Estimates include a provision for an average of 38,500 participants on community employment schemes which, by their nature, are temporary. People participate in the scheme for a year and, depending on the life of the project, may get a further year's extension. More than 50 per cent of the projects under the community employment scheme are once-off. The participants either go back onto the live register or, as a result of their experience on the scheme, find part-time or full-time employment. Instead of implying that the Government is knocking people off community employment schemes when the reverse is the case, the Deputy's party should acknowledge that, when in Government on their own, they agreed Estimates which would have provided for only 26,000 participants on community employment schemes this year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 and 25 together.</P>
      <P>Death grant is a social insurance benefit which is payable, subject to certain PRSI contribution conditions, on the death of an insured person or of their spouse or child under 18. The amount of the grant varies with the contribution record and, in the case of children, with the age of the child.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the grant which was introduced with effect from 1 October 1970 was to help with funeral and other post-bereavement costs. While I accept that the value of the grant has fallen having regard to average funeral costs, there are other measures in place which are designed to assist people in the immediate aftermath of bereavement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="933" /> For example, where a person dies while in receipt of a social welfare payment, the payment usually continues to be paid to his or her adult dependant for six weeks. In addition, payment may also continue for six weeks after the death of an adult or child dependant.</P>
    <P>As regards people who retired before the introduction of the death grant, the position is that social insurance contributions paid prior to 1 October 1970 did not contain an element in respect of the cost of the death grant. Consequently, people who ceased to be insurably employed before that date would not have contributed towards the cost of the scheme.</P>
    <P>The rate of death grant is reviewed in the context of the budget each year in common with all other social welfare rates of payment. I am currently reviewing the present arrangements in the context of developing improved provision for income support for bereaved persons generally.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>At least Fianna Fáil cannot be blamed on this occasion. It is a pity that the Minister for Health has left the House. The cost of a funeral is approximately £1,200 and a death grant of £100 is derisory. People who go to community welfare officers and health boards end up paying the cost. Will the Minister have discussions with the Minister for Health to see if the grant of £100 could be increased to a more realistic figure which would give people who are badly off and cannot meet funeral expenses a reasonable grant towards them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The grant was not intended to cover the cost of a funeral but to assist people in the aftermath of a bereavement. Other costs arise following a bereavement which are not directly related to funeral costs. Payments are made by community welfare officers out of money provided by the Department of Social Welfare. It can be argued that that money is more effectively directed towards those in most need of it because there is a means <Col N="934" /> test assessment before payment of assistance in those circumstances whereas the death grant is not means tested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that funerals are important and that people like to bury their relatives with dignity? The Minister might give some consolation to people who are unable to provide a decent burial for those belonging to them by increasing the grant to a realistic level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know if the Deputy is listening. I said in my reply that I am currently reviewing the present arrangements in the context of developing improved provisions for income support for bereaved persons generally. The death grant was introduced from 1 October 1970 as a social insurance benefit. Only those with such benefit will qualify for it in the first instance. Anyone in receipt of a noncontributory pension or assistance payment will not qualify for it. It is likely that such people will go to a community welfare officer. As I said, the Department of Social Welfare provides that money. There is no equivalent grant on the assistance side.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Death grants never made more than a modest contribution towards funeral costs. The margin increased considerably over the years because the rates were revised on four occasions only, the most recent being in 1982. The Deputy's colleagues were in Government from 1987 to December last year and had ample opportunity to consider whether the grant should be increased. Obviously they considered it and decided against it. In 1986 the Commission on Social Welfare recommended that death grants should not be part of social insurance but should be available on social assistance. If the scheme were to be modified to make a real contribution to funeral costs it would require considerable investment. Assuming a maximum grant of £500 instead of the existing £100 and an annual demand of 15,000 applications <Col N="935" /> the cost would increase from £1 million per year as at present to £7 million per year. The Deputy will appreciate that is considerable expenditure.</P>

      <P>Arising from the delay in implementing EC Directive 79/7 on Equal Treatment, proceedings are being taken in some 475 cases involving about 16,000 plaintiffs. Judicial review proceedings relating to other aspects of the social welfare code are being taken in ten other cases. It is not possible to provide information on the amounts of money claimed in these proceedings as, in most instances, the plaintiffs are seeking a series of declarations, orders and damages.</P>
      <P>In addition, the Department currently has 15 claims on hands from people who are seeking compensation in respect of injury and/or damage. No specific amount has been claimed in any of these cases. Expenditure, including legal costs, on such compensation amounted to £26,000 in 1994.</P>
      <P>It is not considered appropriate to disclose the names and addresses of the people involved in these claims.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeadarClohessy" hpid="Mr. Clohessy Mr. Clohessy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clohessy</NameTxt>
      <P>While I agree that payments of small sums of money should not be made public, it was the view of Democratic Left when in Opposition <Col N="936" /> that all public moneys paid out should be made known. It is necessary to make the general public aware that compensation of certain amounts has been paid to people who have taken the State to court.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy misunderstood what I said. I said it is not considered appropriate to disclose the names and addresses of the people involved in these claims. There is a question of privacy involved and there may also be questions of agreements on confidentiality which have been approved by the court. The equal treatment claims will amount to approximately £260 million and I have already indicated how that money will be paid &mdash; approximately £200 million by the end of December this year and the remaining £60 million over the following 18 months. Approximately 75 per cent of the moneys due will be paid this year to women who have been waiting for more than a decade for equal treatment in relation to social welfare.</P>
      <P>Expenditure, including legal costs on compensation claims, since 1990 is as follows: in 1990 there were five cases at a cost of £167,011; in 1991 there were two cases at a cost of £12,674; in 1992 there were eight cases at a cost of £26,103; in 1993 there were 13 cases at a cost of £205,402 and in 1994 two cases at a cost of £26,000. The figure for 1994 includes legal costs for three earlier settlements. This expenditure relates to compensation claims and not to the equality equal treatment issue to which I referred earlier.</P>

      <P>Following the successful uptake of last year's summer students jobs scheme when over 2,200 sponsors offered in excess of 11,000 jobs and over 9,000 third level students participated during their summer holidays, I have decided to run the scheme again this year from 1 June to 30 September in an improved form. Last year a very wide and impressive range of activities were undertaken by the students who took up jobs in areas such as health care, sporting activity, youth work and general community work such as tourism, summer camps, credit unions, art centres etc. This year an equally impressive and wide range of jobs has been offered by sponsors. Already to date this year some 2,262 sponsors have offered just over 16,000 jobs, which is a substantial increase in the number offered last year.</P>
      <P>This scheme, which has been in operation for two years, has been of significant benefit to both the students who took part and their local communities. It provides third level students with valuable work experience and contributes significant benefits to their local communities at the same time. It also helps to foster a self-help ethic among local communities and provides them with a valuable resource which is funded by my Department. Much of the valuable community work undertaken could not have been done without the benefit of the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because of the success of last year's scheme and in recognition of the valuable contribution made by students to their local communities, I obtained a significant additional allocation of £1 million in the budget for improvements in this year's scheme. This has allowed me to make the following improvements: an increase from £540 to £600 in the maximum amount payable under the scheme with the hourly rate of pay <Col N="938" /> increased from £2.82 to £3; a special additional allowance of £1 per hour worked will be paid to those students whose parents' only income is social welfare at the end of the scheme; an increase in the maximum number of hours from 192 to 200 and the introduction of a telephone line so that students or sponsors can make known their problems or any suggestions they have for improving the scheme. Applications this year have been invited from third level students and students on post-leaving certificate courses.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted the Minister praised the scheme this year as both he and his party were not too happy with it in the past. As we have seen from the work in various communities, this is an excellent scheme. Students who sat their leaving certificate in 1994 were allowed to participate in the scheme during the summer of that year. Will students who sit their leaving certificate in June be able to participate in the scheme during the summer?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I objected to the scheme in the past because the rates of pay were too low and many people who had means of £15 per week assessed against them were excluded from it. I have improved the scheme this year by increasing the amount of money paid and exempting the students from the payment of tax and insurance. In addition, I have eliminated the £15 threshold students have to meet. Even if they are assessed &mdash; it is a desk rather than a home assessment &mdash; as having means they will be entitled to participate in the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of participation by second level students, as I have indicated, post-leaving certificate students can be taken on. However, the scheme is specifically aimed at third level students, it is not intended for second level students. As the Deputy will be aware, her party, which introduced the scheme, eliminated the right of second level students to receive unemployment assistance for three months after they sit <Col N="939" /> their leaving certificate. They are precluded from the scheme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>I am particularly worried by the Minister's reply. Students who sat their leaving certificate in June 1994 participated in the scheme during the summer of that year. Is the Minister saying that there has been a change this year and that he will not allow the students who sit their leaving certificate in June to participate in the scheme during the summer? If this is the case, many students will be greatly disappointed. I hope I am wrong but this is what the Minister seems to be saying. Many leaving certificate students who hope to attend third level colleges in the autumn have applied to participate in the scheme. There seems to be uncertainty about whether they can participate and I would like the Minister to clarify the position.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to the financial improvements he made this year. While the students of families on social welfare will get an extra £1 per hour, it is hard on those students whose parents are on a low income and who will not get this extra money. Would it not have been better to have spread the money among all the students participating in the scheme? We are talking about students. My main concern is about the leaving certificate students of June 1995 who plan to go to third level colleges in the autumn.</P>

Earlier this year the Department of Education confirmed that 8,463, or 14 per cent, of the students sitting the leaving certificate in 1994 were over 18 years of age on 1 January 1994 and at least another 3,000 were 18 years of age by 1 June 1994.

      <P>This scheme was introduced by the former Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Woods, for third level students. If he and the Deputy fiddled the scheme last year, they will have to answer for it to the Committee of Public Accounts, not to me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's acknowledgement of the success of the scheme last year. Certainly it was castigated in the House when it was introduced and Deputy Woods was under enormous pressure. Like my colleagues, I am disappointed that the Minister is categorising the students. An 18-year-old student sitting his leaving certificate will not now be able to avail of the scheme because he may not be eligible. What provision is being made to make students aware of the sponsors? How quickly will the information be available in relation to availing of particular schemes in their local area? Again, I acknowledge the Minister's recognition of the success of the scheme which is a total reverse of his position last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Contrary to what the Deputy said, it is not a total reversal <Col N="942" /> of my position. I have carried out significant improvements to this scheme which have eliminated a considerable number of the objections I had to it, which I have already pointed out, relating to the low level of pay. The lack of protection of students in terms of injuries is now covered by way of public liability insurance which is covered by the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
      <P>In addition, extra payments are being provided for students whose parents are solely dependent on social welfare. I have extended the number of hours they can work; I have introduced a system whereby they can work all the hours within six weeks but they may not work more than 35 hours per week. They can complete the 12 week job within six weeks if that suits them and receive the full amount of money within that six weeks. They are then free to continue to work, to go abroad, to study, or do whatever they wish. In addition, students whose families are solely on social welfare will receive a bonus of £200 before they return to college which will be useful in terms of buying books, equipment and so on. The scheme has been improved significantly. I have also eliminated the £15 per week threshold. Under the previous administration, a student assessed as entitled to £15 or less unemployment assistance did not qualify for the scheme. That has been eliminated. If that person continued to qualify for unemployment assistance, even though they may only be entitled to £5, they will now qualify for a job which will earn them £600 at least and possibly £800. That is a significant improvement in the scheme and far better than it was last year. There is no question of my reversing my position on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of how information is promoted, posters have been printed for all the colleges. A book of sponsors has been printed and is available to all who want it. A telephone line has been provided whereby students can telephone for material and have it sent out to them. At colleges and so forth where I have spoken I have mentioned the <Col N="943" /> scheme. The number of applications from third level students this year far outweighed the number of applications received last year.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Social Welfare</askee>
      <Quest>the position regarding the improvements implemented in October 1994 for widowers; the communication his Department has made with each widower to date; the uptake to date; and if he will consider backdating the improvements in the interest of equality.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>In the Social Welfare Act, 1994, widow's contributory pension was replaced by survivor's pension which gives widows and widowers the same contributory pension entitlement under the same conditions. The provisions came into effect on 28 October 1994.</P>
      <P>My Department undertook an extensive advertising campaign to highlight the scheme. Advertising was conducted in the national press, radio and television and a special FREEPHONE service operated during June 1994 to deal with inquiries from widowers about the new scheme.</P>
      <P>Information leaflets on the new scheme were made available through the Department's local offices, post offices and community information centres.</P>
      <P>The advance publicity was aimed at ensuring that existing widowers were made aware of the new contributory pension available to them to encourage them to apply early so that as many new claims as possible were decided and ready for payment by the October 1994 commencement date. A further advertising campaign is currently being considered to reach widowers who may not be aware of their new pension entitlement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over 5,170 widowers now receive a survivors pension from my Department. <Col N="944" /> On average, 80 new claims from widowers are received each week. Widowers also benefit under other schemes administered by my Department. Those who are not qualified for survivor's pension and who have dependent children may be entitled to receive lone parent's allowance which is subject to a means test. Others may qualify for retirement pension or old age contributory pension on the basis of their social insurance contributions when they reach age 65 and 66.</P>
    <P>The introduction of contributory pension entitlement for widowers in 1994 addressed a significant gap in the social welfare provision for men. The introduction of the new arrangements without retrospection followed normal practice for developments in our social welfare provisions and I have no proposals to apply the provisions from an earlier date.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no doubt that the scheme introduced in 1994 was an excellent one in the interests of equality for widowers. It was unfortunate that over the years widowers did not qualify for a pension similar to widows. I am concerned that while the uptake following the advertisement was encouraging, according to CSO statistics there are 38,000 widowers in the country with only 6,500 having applied for the widower's pension. The Minister needs to readvertise the scheme to inform widowers whose spouses have died during the year and to inform widowers who did not understand the scheme introduced last year. A widow's pension scheme has been in operation for many years but it is only in the past 12 months a widower's pension was introduced. I would like to see a new advertising campaign to get information to the widowers who qualify but who have not applied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My other concern relates to backdating payments. The widowers scheme should have been introduced long ago and we should consider a planned approach to backdating payments to these people on the same basis as the <Col N="945" /> equal payments to women under the social welfare system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department will advertise in the most effective way it can, bearing in mind the cost of advertising. On the question of costs, it would be exceedingly expensive to backdate the payment of pensions. At the end of April 1995 there were 5,107 survivors contributory pensions in payment to widowers. In the week ending 30 April 1995 the number of applications received was 6,500 of which 5,170 were awarded, 320 were pending, 707 were refused, 212 were withdrawn and 91 were stopped. The estimated 1994 outturn on survivors contributory pension is £307 million, of which £2 million refers to widowers expenditure &mdash; that was just ten weeks' expenditure in 1994. It is estimated that the survivors pension will cost £342 million in 1995 of which £26 million refers to widowers. Backdating to prior to October 1994 would have a considerable cost. It is simply not possible to do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not accept that it is surely a question of equality, not cost? If widows were entitled to the money from the time they lost their spouse, surely widowers are entitled to the same. This is the argument that was made all last year on the question of equality for women. Surely this is a moral issue and payments to men should be based on the same principle of equality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>We all have views about what is moral and what is not. However, morality does not always enter into questions of law. The EC directive on equal treatment of men and women in matters of social security in 1979 excluded widows' pensions and similar payments. Accordingly the question of arrears for widowers does not arise in regard to that directive.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Social Welfare</askee>
      <Quest>the steps, if any, he intends to take in order to regularise the payment of child dependant allowance to all relevant categories of social welfare recipients so that payment is made at the same rate in all cases.</Quest>

      <P>In 1987, there were 36 different rates of child dependant allowances payable to social welfare recipients. Currently, only three different rates of allowance are payable. The cost of paying all child dependant allowances at the highest rate currently paid is estimated to be in the region of £62 million.</P>
      <P>The Government is committed under the programme of renewal to work towards a basic income system for children by systematic improvements in child benefit, and the creation of a child benefit supplement. The proposed supplement will replace child dependant allowances currently payable to social welfare recipients. The implications of the new child benefit supplement are being examined in my Department at present. At the same time, the Expert Working Group on the Integration of the Tax and Social Welfare Systems has been asked to consider the proposal and to advise of the best overall strategy.</P>
      <P>In these circumstances, changes in the existing structure of child dependant allowances would not be appropriate pending this advice.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister not agree that paying child dependant allowances at £15.20 to retirement pensioners, £17 to survivors pensioners and £13.20 to old age pensioners is ludicrous and that the matter should be regularised and a unified payment made?

      <P>I regret to have to say again that the Deputy has not listened to what I have told him. The Government is currently proposing that there be a child benefit supplement introduced, the intention being to subsume the current child dependant and family income supplement allowances into a child benefit supplement. The <Col N="947" /> question of what to do with child dependant allowances is dependent on the advice we get from the Expert Group on the Integration of the Tax and Social Welfare Systems which has been asked to advice on the best way of introducing this supplement. I do not expect that the Deputy will advise us to bring all child dependant allowances to the lowest rate but would be looking for the highest rate, but to do that would cost £62 million extra. Given all the other things the Deputy wants me to do, I do not think he would be too happy if I were to bring the allowances down to the lowest level.</P>

      <P>I am sure we need no expert to tell us how to get from A to B in regard to the figures. The Minister should be up front and not hide behind an expert group. Surely it would be reasonable to have child benefit the same for all categories. It costs everybody the same to clothe, feed and educate children. Why the differentiation? I am surprised to hear a Minister who always articulated the needs of the less well off suggesting the setting up of an expert group to examine such a simple thing as ensuring that all categories of child dependant should be equal. We are certainly not suggesting that the allowances be reduced but that they should be equal and as high as possible.</P>

      <P>As spokesperson for social welfare on the Opposition benches I welcomed the introduction of these changes by the then Minister. This Government is taking a new approach to the issue of supporting children in our society. We increased child benefit this year by £7 per child. Interestingly we have two rates of child benefit, one rate for the first two children and another rate for the third and subsequent children. I do not think the Deputy would argue that there should be only one rate of child benefit. Expert groups from different sources have recommended that there should be an advantage given to families with more children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are currently examining the introduction of a new idea, child benefit supplement, the idea being to bring the child dependant allowances which are payable to people on unemployment benefit, unemployment assistance and other assistance payments into line with payments made to people who are working and who get family income supplement, so that the children of people whether employed or unemployed who are below a certain income level are supported regardless of whether or not their parents are working, thus eliminating the poverty and unemployment trap associated with child dependant allowances. At the moment persons on unemployment assistance or benefit who are getting income for themselves and their spouse as an adult dependant and for one, two or three children lose the support they are receiving for their children if they <Col N="949" /> get a job. We are saying that those earning up to a certain income level should retain this support for their children. That is a different concept from the one the Deputy is talking about, levelling child dependant allowances and leaving untouched the question of poverty and unemployment traps.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 and 19 together.</P>
      <P>The supplementary welfare allowance scheme is administered on behalf of my Department by the eight regional health boards. All expenditure on allowances is borne in full by my Department. The administration costs of the supplementary welfare scheme were capped in 1988 by the Department of Finance and since then, any increase in this area, apart from the annual inflator applied requires the sanction of that Department.</P>
      <P>The main additional items of administration for which Department of Finance sanction is regularly sought are: retirement gratuities of staff involved in the operation of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme and subsequent pension payments and additional staff.</P>
      <P>The administration costs of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme for 1994 were £12.8 million which represents 11 per cent of total expenditure of £121 million on the scheme for that year. The 1995 administration allocation is set at £13.2 million which represents 10 per cent of the total post-budget allocation of £131.3 million for the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Annual administration costs are calculated on an individual board basis. For example, the 1995 administration <Col N="951" /> allocation for each health board was based on the 1994 administration figure. Pay and price inflators are supplied by the Department of Finance and are used to adjust the estimate. Pay and non-pay costs are estimated at 70 per cent and 30 per cent respectively of total administration costs.</P>

An increase of £6,000 in the board's administration allocation was granted for this purpose. A further request for funding two clerical officers for a six months period costing £10,000 and an additional clerical administration position costing £11,000 on a full time basis was refused. An application for funding of £13,913 in respect of the cost of establishing a special unit to deal with supplementary welfare allowance claims from former TEAM Aer Lingus employees was received. This included one SCWO and five CWOs for a period of six weeks. Sanction was not given for the SCWO post. The temporary CWO posts were sanctioned and a sum of £8,000 was provided for this purpose. Applications were also received from the Midland Health Board, the MidWestern Health Board and the NorthEastern Health Board.

An application for funding of £59,000 in respect of bank charges incurred from <Col N="952" /> 1989-92 was received. Sanction for this amount was requested from the Department of Finance. However, this was refused.</P>
      <P>An application was received from the Mid-Western Health Board for funding of £4,000 to install a computer system to assist with the administration of the back-to-school clothing and footwear allowance scheme. This application was refused. An application was received for funding to meet additional pension costs of retired staff members and for an increase in the board's administration allocation of £11,000. An application was received for a full time CWO to deal with asylum seekers and an acting CWO was appointed pending sanction of a full time position. A sum of £2,275 was provided to cover the costs of the acting CWO from 7 November 1994 to 31 December 1994.

      <P>What plans, if any, does the Minister have to reorganise the supplementary welfare allowance scheme? During the debate on the Social Welfare Bill I referred to two persons in my constituency in receipt of <Col N="953" /> a reduced rate of disability benefit, one of whom has to visit the local community welfare officer each week and who receives £40. This will continue indefinitely as long as this person continues to receive disability benefit. It is regrettable that this person who worked for most of his life and who, through no fault of his own, became ill, must queue for two hours to receive £40.</P>

      <P>Given that the cost increased from £7 million in 1989 to £56 million this year does the Minister accept that the workload of community welfare officers has increased dramatically and that resources should be made available? Does he further accept that because many applications for additional staff from health boards are being refused it is not possible to carry out the required assessments of applications and that the cost of employing additional staff will have to be met directly from the existing allocations to health boards, many of which are underfunded?</P>

      <P>As I indicated in my original reply, the administration costs of the supplementary welfare scheme were capped by the Department of Finance in 1988 and, if I am not mistaken, the then Minister for Finance was a member of the Fianna Fáil Party. Since then any increase in this area, apart from the annual inflator applied, requires the sanction of the Department of Finance. The effect has been that the administration cost as a proportion of the money spent on supplementary welfare allowance has fallen from about 20 per cent to about 10 per cent this year. Bearing in mind that the administration cost of the Department of Social Welfare as a whole is only 5 per cent of total expenditure, the administration cost of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme is considerable. It is understandable given that it is very much a labour intensive scheme and that the community welfare officers are senior officers.</P>
      <P>There is an issue to be resolved in terms of the administration of the scheme and that will be addressed in due course. It cannot however, be addressed by simply increasing the amount of money for administration when there is so much demand for increasing the amount paid to people in need. That is where the increases should be considered.</P>

      <P>When the Minister <Col N="955" /> was in Opposition he paid little heed to sanctions imposed by the Minister for Finance. Is this not a typical case of being penny wise and pound foolish? In many instances the investigations carried out by overworked community welfare officers are minimal and many people benefit from this scheme who, under closer scrutiny, would not be entitled to some of the payments they are receiving. Given that the Minister has admitted this is labour intensive work, it is important that more staff are employed to evaluate fully what is a very expensive scheme.</P>

      <P>The answer is not simply to pump more money into the present administration system. We must consider the current functions of community welfare officers to see whether some of them should be more correctly carried out by the Department of Social Welfare, local authorities or health boards. That obviously requires an in-depth look at the whole area of supplementary welfare payments, which are basically a safety net for people in dire need who cannot get money anywhere else. It is not a simple matter of increasing administration funding but of considering the way the schemes are administered.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Social Welfare</askee>
      <Quest>if he will maintain the same facilities for those who are in receipt of disabled person's maintenance allowance, when this scheme is transferred from the Department of Health to the Department of Social Welfare.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The transfer of responsibility for disabled person's maintenance allowance from health boards to my Department will not result in any diminution in the entitlements of people in receipt of the allowance. People in receipt of disabled person's maintenance allowance are usually entitled to medical cards and may also, depending on their circumstances, be entitled to free travel, free electricity allowance, free television allowance, free telephone rental allowance and vouchers under the free fuel scheme and the EC social assistance butter scheme. All those currently entitled to these allowances will retain this entitlement following the transfer of the disabled person's maintenance allowance scheme to my Department and all new customers will of course be entitled to apply for these secondary benefits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At a broader level there are a number of differences in the means test for the allowance by comparison with other <Col N="957" /> social welfare schemes and I will be addressing this issue in the future. My intention is, however, to transfer the scheme as it is and subsequently to address the anomalies which exist. In doing so I will take account of any recommendations emerging from the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities. The transfer of responsibility for the scheme to my Department will of itself improve the situation for people in receipt of the allowance and in any subsequent rationalisation of the existing arrangements my intention will be to ensure that the situation of people with disabilities is improved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>When will the transfer take place? At present there is an income disregard of £32.20 for people on disability working with the National Rehabilitation Board, where they do very valuable work. Will that benefit continue under the new arrangement? I am not certain whether the transfer to a nationally based scheme will improve the system. People on disabled person's maintenance allowance have very close contact with community welfare officers at local level and I am anxious that that continues.</P>

      <P>A number of issues arise in the transfer of disabled person's maintenance allowance to the Department of Social Welfare. For instance, there is no formal appeal procedure at present when a person is refused disabled person's maintenance allowance. The health board will obviously consider an appeal, but the intention is that the Department of Social Welfare's independent appeal procedures would apply in those circumstances when the system is transferred. The payments systems differ throughout health boards &mdash; for example, by way of cheque, voucher book or payable orders cashable at post offices. The target for the transfer date was originally the middle of this year. There is a working group &mdash; I hope Deputies do not object to my using a <Col N="958" /> working group to try to eliminate the problems that may arise as a result of this transfer&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The original target date was 1 July 1995, but it does not seem likely that target date will be achieved at this stage, given the complexity of adapting eight different administrative systems to produce one smooth functioning system. However, it should be possible to commence the transfer during the current year. The legislative basis for transferring the scheme will be contained in the Social Welfare (No. 3) Bill. The timescale for that Bill will affect the timescale for the transfer which cannot take effect until that Bill is enacted. I understand the Bill will be introduced in the autumn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The financial arrangements regarding disabled person's maintenance allowance in the interim between 1 July and the date of transfer are under discussion because those arrangements will involve a transfer of resources between the Department of Health and my Department. Differences between the disabled person's maintenance allowance means test and the unemployment assistance means test operated by my Department must be ironed out. The bottom line is that the advantages people in receipt of <Col N="959" /> disabled person's maintenance allowance currently have will be retained by them once that scheme is transferred to the Department of Social Welfare. It is not intended that their position will be disimproved but will be improved.</P>
    <P>People who qualify for disabled person's maintenance allowance are those who have disabilities of a long term nature. There is currently a good deal of discussion about the need to give people who have disabilities an enhanced income over and above that of people who are unemployed. People with disabilities have higher living costs and we will look to the forum on disability in making recommendations in that regard. In the long term we are considering the establishment of an assistance scheme in the Department of Social Welfare. The disability benefit scheme currently in place enables employed people who become ill to claim their insurance benefits if they have sufficient contributions or credits but if they do not have enough they cannot claim any benefit and must, as Deputy O'Keeffe said, call to the community welfare officer.</P>
    <P>It is my view that the Department should have in place a type of means tested allowances which could be claimed by employed people who become ill, similar to unemployment assistance. With the transfer of disabled person's maintenance allowance to the Department of Social Welfare there is an opportunity to consider that broader question. There are many plans afoot to develop that area. The bottom line is that people on disabled person's maintenance allowance will not lose out as a result of the transfer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister did not answer the specific question I asked. Will the disregard of £32.20 which applies to people in receipt of disabled person's maintenance allowance who work with the Rehabilitation Board continue under the new arrangement?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have a <Col N="960" /> specific note on that, but given my general undertaking that people in receipt of disabled person's maintenance allowance will not lose out as a result of the transfer, the Deputy can take it that those involved will not lose that disregard. It is important that the message goes out from all sides of this House that the people in receipt of disabled person's maintenance allowance will not lose out as a result of the transfer of that scheme to the Department of Social Welfare. People in those circumstances have enough to worry about without being concerned whether they will lose some income as a result of administrative change between the Department of Health and the Department of Social Welfare.</P>

      <P>I am concerned about the Minister's comment regarding streamlining the disabled person's maintenance allowance means test in line with the unemployment assistance means test, given that many young people are disqualified from unemployment assistance perhaps because their parents are farmers and even though the farm income may be low they may be disqualified from benefit when assets and so on are taken into consideration. The Minister has given an undertaking that people currently in receipt of disabled person's maintenance allowance will not lose out. Will he give an assurance that new applicants will not lose out and that the means test that applies to that scheme will not be streamlined with the unemployment assistant means test to such an extent that people who would normally qualify for disabled person's maintenance allowance under health board regulations would not qualify under the new regulations in the Minister's Department? That is a matter of concern for those people. When considering applications for that allowance will the Minister's Department take into consideration the established principle that the disabled person's maintenance allowance is designed to cover the additional costs incurred by the fact that people are disabled?</P>

      <P>I did not mention the word &ldquo;streamlining&rdquo;. Specific issues relate to the disabled person's maintenance allowance means test and that operated by the Department of Social Welfare. It is intended that the disabled person's maintenance allowance scheme will be transferred in its present form to the Department of Social Welfare and the current means test will continue to apply. Any future changes to the scheme will be made in full consultation with people in receipt of disabled person's maintenance allowance and will not be made by way of diktat.</P>
      <P>Regarding the disabled person's maintenance allowance means test, a medical eligibility test must be undertaken by a disabled person's maintenance allowance applicant. Article 4.1 of the regulations provides that an allowance is payable to a person who by reason of a specified disability is substantially handicapped in undertaking work of a kind which if he or she were not suffering from that disability would be suitable to his or her age, experience and qualifications. Specified disability is defined as an injury, disease, congenital deformity or physical or mental defect which is continued or may reasonably be expected to continue for at least one year. There is a clear difference between that disability and the disability benefit paid by the Department of Social Welfare, generally referred to as sick benefit, which is a temporary payment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is an opportunity now that the disabled person's maintenance allowance will be transferred to the Department of Social Welfare to consider the creation of a new assistance allowance for people who are sick and do not have a right to benefit by way of insurance contributions. The question of the means testing of disabled person's maintenance allowance applicants, which is separate from their medical eligibility, as against the means test that applies to others will not be addressed until the scheme is transferred to my Department. The decision to transfer the <Col N="962" /> scheme is a major administrative undertaking and we do not have the resources to make changes to the scheme. If the Deputy wishes I can outline the differences in the means tests, but I am sure she is aware of them.</P>

The disabled person's maintenance allowance scheme will be transferred in its present form to the Department of Social Welfare and will continue to operate under current regulations, means test, medical eligibility, age limits and so on for the foreseeable future. If there are any proposals to change the disabled person's maintenance allowance, that will be done in full consultation with organisations which represent people with disabilities in receipt of disabled person's maintenance allowance. It is intended to improve the system so that people with disabilities will have an enhanced quality of life, not a more difficult one. That is the guarantee I am giving.</P>

      <P>The Deputy's question refers to a comment in the Taoiseach's speech at the opening on 25 April of a conference for senior public servants, the purpose of which was the examination of the lessons learned from the EU Poverty 3 programme and to look at ways of creating a national policy framework to maximise the effectiveness of local development initiatives and to ensure that tackling poverty is a priority objective of all Government Departments and agencies. The Taoiseach in his speech adverted to the danger of developing an ever more polarised society unless a co-ordinated and sustained effort to promote social inclusion is made.</P>
      <P>The nature and extent of poverty in Ireland is already well documented, for example, in recent reports from the ESRI and the Combat Poverty Agency. What is changing now, by comparison with the experience in the later 1980s and early 1990s, is that the overall economic indications for the next few years are very good, with rising incomes and levels of employment being forecast by most commentators. The expectation is that these trends will continue for the foreseeable future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The danger is that general economic growth and increased prosperity will <Col N="965" /> again by-pass those on the margins of society unless targeted and effective steps are taken to ensure that the benefits of economic progress are spread more widely. It is this very real danger of growing disparities between, to take a simple measure, those who have jobs and an education and those who do not have these advantages which creates the prospect of developing an ever more polarised society.</P>
    <P>The Government has already begun the process of addressing social exclusion and poverty in this year's budget with a significant improvement in child benefit; as it has been established that in Ireland, households with children have a higher risk of poverty than those without, we increased the monthly payment for each child by £7. We have also provided for a number of other improvements as a first step in tackling poverty effectively and reducing poverty and unemployment traps and inequalities, including a new uniform scheme for lone parents at a cost of £20 million in a full year, which will incorporate the existing deserted wife's benefit and lone parent's allowance, will abolish the concept of &ldquo;desertion&rdquo; and apply equally to men as well as women; extending the payment of child dependant allowances payable with long term social welfare payments to 21-year-olds in full-time education; an increase in the minimum unemployment assistance payment for people living in the family home and assessed with board and lodging from £10 to £25 a week; the first £50 per week to be PRSI-free for employees paying PRSI contributions at classes A and H; a similar allowance of £10 per week is also being introduced for contributors paying PRSI at classes B, C and D modified rates, while the self-employed will have an annual allowance of £520; for employers, the current threshold for reduced PRSI rate, £173 a week &mdash; £9,000 annually &mdash; to be increased to £231 a week &mdash; £12,000 &mdash; and no increase on the existing ceiling on which PRSI contributors are payable, £25,800, and the provision of an additional £400,000 to the Combat <Col N="966" /> Poverty Agency to fund new pilot programmes and existing grants schemes.</P>
    <P>Speaking on behalf of the Government at the United Nations World Summit on Social Development in Copenhagen in March, I made a commitment to implement proposals to substantially reduce levels of poverty and inequalities.</P>
    <P>As already announced, the Government has approved my proposals for drawing up an anti-poverty strategy by a high-level interdepartmental policy committee. The strategy will involve all Government Departments and agencies targeting poverty and exclusion in their policy-making, including the people affected in that policy making and implementation.</P>
    <P>I place particular importance on the need to ensure that a mechanism is developed to allow for the participation of disadvantaged groups through the organisations that represent them in this process. I intend that there should be wide consultation with voluntary and community organisations. I also intend that disadvantaged people will have a real input into the development of the strategy that goes beyond formal consultation.</P>
    <P>The decision by the Government to develop a national strategy to tackle poverty puts the issue of poverty at the heart of Government policy for the first time ever. According to the <i>ESRI Medium-Term Review 1994-2000,</i> an annual GNP growth rate of 5 per cent is forecast until 1999. A rapid convergence in living standards between Ireland and the other EU member states is also forecast. It is our responsibility to ensure that the benefits of this growth are distributed in a manner which will redress economic and social inequalities. This can be achieved only through a comprehensive national strategy across all sectors of the economy.</P>

      <P>I am bowled over by all the information. While many of the strategies enunciated by the Minister are meritorious, he omitted to say he gave 2.5 per cent only to the most <Col N="967" /> dependent group in our society. That alone is evidence of a great polarisation in the thinking of Ministers and Government Departments, indicating that that most dependent group should be satisfied with 2.5 per cent whereas there is now clear evidence that the rate of inflation will far exceed that figure in the current year.</P>
      <P>In the early part of his reply the Minister said he foresaw growing inequalities arising between people in employment and those without jobs, or that that one circumstance gives rise to many disparities between them. Will the Minister comment on the October 1994 to April 1995 figures, covering a six week period in which Fianna Fáil were in office, the remaining four and a half months falling within the term of office of the present Government since it has become fashionable for Ministers to blame their predecessors for all ills? I suggest that the Minister should not blame his predecessor or others for such ills. When I entered the Department of Education I did not blame any of my predecessors for the ills prevailing; my philosophy was that I was in office and that was the end of the matter. Will the Minister agree that those in employment have a better chance of escaping poverty and, in that respect, will he say why he is reluctant to part with the savings in social welfare, as demonstrated in his telephone call to me on the Saturday programme&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Deputy made an important point relating to the question of unemployment and community employment schemes. Obviously, those without a job or a good education &mdash; specifically a good education &mdash; are less likely to benefit from economic advances. Research has established that measurements of poverty are relative and depend on precisely where an income poverty line is drawn. Regardless of where the line is drawn, households headed by an unemployed person make up a substantial proportion of the poor, households with children, particularly three or more, are at a relatively high risk of living in poverty, households headed by women do not in general face a higher risk of living in poverty than those headed by men and the risk of poverty declines dramatically as the level of education of the head of household increases. The Deputy is correct in saying that the <Col N="970" /> more people who are at work the more there are who are capable of rising out of poverty. However, many people in employment earn very low wages and must depend on family income supplement to make up even a half decent income. Therefore, while this is an important matter, our tax and social insurance systems and the question of wages must be addressed. Should employers be allowed pay wages below that which a person would receive on social welfare? Should we not consider the feasibility of a minimum wage in this society to prevent employers exploiting those who are unemployed and desperate to work?</P>
      <P>I dealt with the question of the community employment scheme under Question No. 1.</P>

      <P>The Deputies opposite insist on my repeating what I said earlier. I spend a great deal of time earlier explaining to the House that the Department of Social Welfare currently operates a number of schemes to ensure that social welfare payments are used in an active way. Approximately 6,500 people are participating in real jobs under the back to work allowance scheme, most of whom are self-employed. Under this scheme people may retain 75 per cent of their social welfare income for the first year, 50 per cent for the second year and 25 per cent for the third year. In addition, the Department provides assistance by way of a special allocation to the unemployed who set up small businesses and provides them with advice and assistance to enable them succeed. It is incorrect to suggest that the Department of Social Welfare is not actively using its weight to ensure people move from unemployment to employment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is referring to community employment. It has been suggested that if a person moves from unemployment to community employment a saving accrues to the Department of Social Welfare. As I pointed out in reply to Priority Question No. 1, the budget for the Department of Social Welfare for the 266,000 unemployed &mdash; estimated as the average figure for this year &mdash; has incorporated into it the estimated average number of places that will be available on community employment schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The budgets for the community employment scheme and for the Department of Social Welfare are related and the figures for unemployment have taken that into account. The argument that some saving would accrue from increasing the numbers on community employment can be refuted. For instance, refusing extensions to the people on community employment will not result in savings because the <Col N="973" /> Department of Social Welfare is not paying unemployment assistance to them; they are getting a payment from FÁS and, indirectly, from the Department of Enterprise and Employment. In fact, the figures for community employment predicted that the Department of Social Welfare would pay them if they did not find employment in the meantime. I hope to assist those currently in schemes who may not get an extension and to see how many of them would benefit from the back to work allowance scheme if their experience on community employment has enabled them to identify jobs to which they could go or employment they could create. There are various other things we are doing which I dealt with at length in Question No. 1.</P>
    <P>There is a great deal of misunderstanding about the community employment scheme and how it works. As I am sure the Deputy knows, the community employment figure is not static. People are constantly coming off and going on community employment depending on the date on which they begin. It is a rolling figure and it is not possible to say that X number of pounds from the Department of Social Welfare will pay for X number of places.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister agree that the greatest cause of polarisation in urban society is the social segregation in our cities? Will he agree that setting up policy committees will not solve the problem? Also, on the rural side how can the Minister equate his wish to move towards a basic income with his reluctance to move an inch on the question of means testing for small farmers, people involved in tourism and fishing who have £1 taken off them for every £1 they earn? If the Minister really believes in the concept of a basic income, he should allow them to keep a little of what they earn.

    <P>For the 1995 scheme, I have increased <Col N="976" /> the rates of allowance from £35 to £40 for a child attending primary school and from £50 to £55 for a post-primary pupil. It is expected that some 285,000 pupils will benefit under the scheme this year at a cost of approximately £12.9 million.</P>
    <P>The health boards have advised my Department that the scheme operated satisfactorily in all boards last year with families throughout the country receiving their payments in good time to make provision for their children's needs.</P>
    <P>My Department's circular on the operation of the 1995 scheme, which issued to all boards on 25 April 1995, requests all boards to ensure that the majority of payments are made by 31 July 1995. This is to enable parents to make the necessary purchases in the traditional back to school shopping month of August.</P>
    <P>The present arrangements are satisfactory and I urge parents to assist the boards by making applications as early as possible in order that payments can be processed speedily.</P>

      <P>The supplementary welfare allowance scheme is administered on behalf of my Department by the eight regional health boards. Under the legislation governing the scheme the determination of entitlement is a matter for the chief executive officer of the board. Under section 172 (1) of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1993 people attending a full time day course of study at an institution of education are excluded from entitlement to supplementary welfare allowance; however, in exceptional circumstances, section 172 (3) of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1993 allows a <Col N="977" /> health board to make a payment when it considers this to be justified. Each application for assistance is decided on its own merits by the health boards.</P>
      <P>My Department has introduced a number of educational incentives for lone parents and the long term unemployed. Participants in &ldquo;second chance&rdquo; educational schemes, such as the vocational training opportunities scheme and the third level allowance scheme, may continue to receive their full social welfare payment and retain a range of secondary benefits, such as rent supplements, under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme for the duration of their course. These participants are required to have been in receipt of a social welfare payment for at least one year and to be aged 23 years of age or over.</P>
      <P>At present, the total number of lone parents participating on the vocational training opportunities scheme and the third level allowance scheme is approximately 500 and 90 respectively.</P>
      <P>Following my meeting with lone parents studying at UCG concerning this issue the payment of rent supplements to lone parents in full time education is being actively reviewed. Lone parents have special needs and I am anxious, in so far as possible and bearing in mind financial considerations, that they are not discouraged from participating in full time education.</P>

      <P>I refer the Minister to the terms of the question which related to people in receipt of lone parent's allowance, not people on VTO or third level schemes. The question related to the fact that, until recently, people in third level education in receipt of lone parent's allowance were, under normal rules, entitled to and received rent allowance. Recently, those people have been disallowed rent allowance which means that for many of them, their opportunity to continue to third level education will disappear because they cannot afford to pay rent costs. Is the Minister willing to instruct the health boards to reverse this decision <Col N="978" /> thereby allowing these people to receive rent allowance?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot instruct health boards to do something which they may consider to be illegal. The health boards are obliged to interpret the law in the same way as anybody with responsibility for administering funds on behalf of the public.</P>
      <P>There are different interpretations of the section dealing with special needs and the discretion of boards on rent supplement for lone parents in third level education. As I indicated in my reply, lone parents who are 23 years and over may qualify for a rent supplement but in some health board areas lone parents who are under 23 years have been refused. As the Deputy indicated, some lone parents in the Western Health Board area who had been in receipt of a rent supplement have recently had it withdrawn because of a recent decision. As I indicated also in my reply I met lone parents students some weeks ago when I visited UCG and they made a strong case that if they were not assisted with their rent they would have no option but to give up their third level course. I undertook to have the situation examined and it is being actively reviewed in my Department with a view to seeing how we can ensure these students and others in similar circumstances can participate and remain in third level education.</P>

      <P>Far be it from me to ask the Minister to do anything illegal. It seemed to have been legal before Christmas and I am a bit surprised that after Christmas it is illegal. While he is carrying out this review will he, in consultation with the health board, try to arrange that those who were in receipt of a rent allowance will continue to receive it until the review has been completed as otherwise they will be left high and dry while people are talking?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy asks why it is illegal now but may have been considered legal before. We have a <Col N="979" /> thriving legal industry which makes fortunes out of disputes over what is legal and illegal. Unfortunately, there is a difference of opinion as to what is or is not allowed under the Act. We are currently trying to resolve those differences to see whether we can find a way of ensuring that young women under 23 years with children who are already in college may remain in college and those with aspirations to go to college may do so. In UCG, for example, not all the lone parent students I met were from Galway and in order to pursue their courses they needed good quality accommodation and not a hole of a place such as the places in which many students have to live. They need also to be able to retain the accommodation throughout the summer months when the college is not operating. We need to address a range of problems and we are attempting to find a solution that will assist not only those students already affected but future students as well.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on this long overdue Bill which it can be assumed will enjoy the support of all sides in the House. I have never understood why it has taken so long to ratify the Council of Europe Convention, but better late than never. This Bill is particularly welcome at this vital stage in the peace process in Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>When we talk about prisoners we usually refer to two categories &mdash; those who have been convicted for actions directly connected with the political conflict of the past 25 years and those who are described in some quarters as having been found guilty of &ldquo;ordinary crimes&rdquo;. In so far as the so called &ldquo;troubles&rdquo; are concerned, many of those in prison would claim to be political prisoners while others from all sides of the conflict could by any standards be rightly accused of war crimes. Unfortunately, as a general rule prosecutions for this type of crime very rarely, if ever, involve members of the state security forces. This tends to further exacerbate the sense of grievance felt among Loyalists and Republicans alike.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, what is certain is that, regardless of the kind of crime or alleged crime, there are countless innocent victims involved. These include the families of the prisoners who have been sentenced and who frequently have been deprived of a father or mother, a breadwinner. Their misery is further compounded if the prisoner is detained in a prison in Britain or elsewhere outside the country. I do not know the number of people from this State who are detained in foreign prisons but it has been conservatively estimated that more than 100,000 people in Northern Ireland have been directly affected by the imprisonment of politically motivated relatives. I am fully aware that this <Col N="1121" /> Bill can deal only with prisoners from our jurisdiction. However, I do not have to remind the House that we have been very much affected by what has happened in the North. Prisons North and South have been stretched to capacity over the past 25 years as a direct result of the Northern Ireland conflict and the economy in the South has been severely affected. We have a legitimate interest in what happens north of the Border.</P>
    <P>I hope the Government will use its influence at the Anglo-Irish Conference and elsewhere to persuade the British Government of the necessity for the wider use of the provisions section 26 (1) of the 1961 Criminal Justice Act, which gives discretion to the appropriate Minister to allow the transfer of a prisoner from one part of the United Kingdom to another. In the past there was virtually a blanket refusal to grant transfers of prisoners from Britain to Northern Ireland. There is some evidence that there has been a recent change of heart in that respect, I sincerely hope so. It was that policy which is said to have led to the tragic death on hunger strike of Frank Stagg in 1977. The families of the many prisoners from Northern Ireland who are in British prisons have endured years of suffering, including the break-up of families, of marriages, as a result of the economic impossibility of keeping in touch with prisoners. I am speaking of the relatives of prisoners such as the Birmingham Six, the Guildford Four and others who should never have been in jail in the first place. We would all do well to study the findings of Fr. Denis Faul who has concerned himself more than most with the effects of imprisonment on prisoners, their families and the wider community.</P>
    <P>I commend the Government on activating the decision of the previous Government to proceed as soon as possible with the release of politically motivated prisoners. I trust that the British Government will greatly accelerate its release programmes from prisons in the <Col N="1122" /> North. In this context, I would again refer to Fr. Denis Faul who has frequently stressed that, though drawn into the Troubles in a marginal way, many young people were given sentences which were totally out of proportion to the alleged offences and were so embittered that they became full blown terrorists, so to speak, in whatever prison they were detained. Their families, extended families and close friends became equally embittered. Many of these prisoners are still in Britain. Their immediate transfer to Northern Ireland would be the first step towards eventual genuine peace and reconciliation.</P>
    <P>Many Members will have received a copy of the submission from the Irish Commission for Prisoners Overseas. I received this submission only recently and I have not had time to study it properly or to consult with people who are qualified to comment on it. I trust the Minister will have regard to the legal and constitutional arguments put forward in the submission. I note that the commission intends to prepare a further response in time for the Committee Stage of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Obviously the Bill cannot provide us with the power to repatriate prisoners unless the foreign government concerned agrees to the transfer as a matter of discretion. Perhaps the solution will eventually lie in a comprehensive agreement backed up by appropriate legislation covering the European Union as a whole. This would at least cover the position so far as these countries are concerned. Mr. Michael Farrell, solicitor and representative for these people, stated:</P>
    <P>According to this Bill Ireland can legislate to give rights to a foreign national imprisoned here to transfer to his/her home country if that State agrees to accept him/her. Ireland can also legislate to give a right to Irish nationals or persons who are to be regarded as such to be accepted here, if the State in which they are currently held agrees to transfer them. However, Ireland cannot legislate to give Irish nationals imprisoned, for <Col N="1123" /> example, in the UK a right to transfer out of the UK. It can only guarantee that if the UK agrees to transfer these nationals then they will automatically be entitled to acceptance here. Similarly, Ireland cannot legislate to compel another state to accept the transfer of that state's nationals. Ireland can only guarantee that it will transfer them if their home state agrees to take them. That said, however, it would seem much preferable (and I agree with him here) that Ireland should establish transfer as a right when certain criteria are fulfilled rather than as a matter of discretion for the Minister concerned. If Ireland adopts the attitude of making transfer a right subject to agreement by the other state then that might also exercise a certain moral authority or moral pressure on other convention states to adopt the same attitude in relation to Irish nationals held in their territory.</P>
    <P>That matter will be taken up again on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>In welcoming this Bill our spokesperson, Deputy O'Donoghue, stated correctly that it is not just a humane and social Bill but an important component of the peace process. That also was clearly the message given by all sides at the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation some weeks ago. Many issues have been debated and discussed at the forum, with varying opinions expressed. There was agreement and consensus on all sides that this is and will be an extremely important issue if the peace process is to continue.</P>
    <P>The issue of whether these are political prisoners was discussed. Having heard the arguments from both Loyalists and Republican prisoners and from responsible representative bodies of both sides I feel this point will have to be seriously discussed. I understand that after the deaths of over 3,000 people in the troubles during the past 25 years &mdash; most of them innocent victims &mdash; contemplating having anything to do with <Col N="1124" /> these prisoners might be seen as adding insult to injury. How many times have the families of these innocent victims requested that there be no retaliation? What they are in fact saying is that they do not want another 3,000 families to go through what they have gone through. Each case will have to be taken on its merits. The whole question of the prisoners issue, whether we like it or not, will have to be addressed if the peace we are currently enjoying on this island is to continue, a peace that has been the focus of attention throughout the world.</P>
    <P>The transfer issue is but a small step in the right direction in this complex issue but is a welcome one, especially for the families concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Ms Burton) Austin Currie">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Ms Burton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank all Deputies for their contribution to the debate. There has been a broad welcome for what Deputy McDaid said is essentially a humanitarian measure. As has already been pointed out, it is one which will benefit not only prisoners themselves but their families.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know many Deputies have received representations in relation to individual cases where prisoners are interested in a transfer under the Convention and, in reply, they can now hold out hope that a transfer might be possible in the foreseeable future. In relation to a timescale I should mention that once the legislation is enacted Ireland will ratify the Convention as quickly as possible, but there is built into the Convention a lapse of time between when a state ratifies it and its coming into force for that state. The period in question is about three months. What the Convention says exactly in Article 18 is that it will enter into force on the first day of the month following the expiration of a period of three months after the date of deposit of the instrument of ratification. While I cannot give a precise timescale for the enactment of the legislation by the Oireachtas I think that, given the lapse of time built into the Convention, realistically we should be able to begin operating the Convention early in the <Col N="1125" /> autumn if all goes according to the parliamentary schedule.</P>
    <P>While there will be legal formalities to follow under the Convention there is nothing to stop individuals in the period before it comes into force indicating an interest in being transferred under the Convention. Any preliminary work which can be done in my Department will be done and the relevant formalities can be dealt with once the Convention is in force.</P>
    <P>Under the Convention it is a matter for states to make applications, but these would normally follow from an expression of interest by a prisoner in a transfer under the Convention. Where a prisoner expresses an interest in a transfer there is an obligation on the state where he or she is serving a sentence to provide information to the state the prisoner is interested in being transferred to.</P>
    <P>It is the intention of my Department to draw up information leaflets for prisoners interested in a transfer out of or into this country. Once these are available, copies will be circulated to Deputies which should be helpful to them in dealing with individual representations.</P>
    <P>As I explained at the opening of the debate, this is enabling legislation and it is only necessary to include in the Bill measures which are necessary to give legal effect to our obligations once we ratify the Convention. Many of the measures contained in the Convention &mdash; such as informing foreign prisoners of the existence of the Convention &mdash; can be dealt with simply on an administrative basis and there is no need to make specific reference to them in the Bill. If Deputies feel there are any changes of a technical nature which would improve the Bill these can be dealt with at Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The question of funding was raised. Section 8 of the Bill contains the standard provision in relation to expenses incurred in the administration of the Act. Article 17 of the Convention itself provides that any costs incurred in the application of the Convention shall be <Col N="1126" /> borne by the administering state except costs incurred exclusively in the territory of the sentencing state. When a prisoner has been transferred here obviously expenses in relation to his or her imprisonment will be a charge on the Prisons Vote. In relation to the cost incurred in the actual transfer itself I think it is fair to say that in many cases the prisoner would not have the resources to fund the transfer but the intention in the Department would be to deal with this on an administrative basis and on a case by case basis.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies &mdash; in particular Deputies O'Donnell and O'Donoghue &mdash; sought further information about the number of prisoners involved. It is difficult to obtain a precise estimate of the number of Irish prisoners held abroad because, for example, not all of these would make their positions known to the local embassies. We do not have embassies in all countries. The best estimate available to me &mdash; and I cannot reconcile this with the figure of 1,200 mentioned during the debate by Deputy O'Donnell &mdash; is that there are about 600 Irish nationals serving sentences abroad. About two-thirds of these are serving sentences in the UK. Of the 180 non-nationals serving sentences here about 80 per cent of them would be from the UK. While these figures give an indication of those eligible to apply, until the Convention comes into force we will not have a precise idea of the number of applications. As a matter of common sense it is clear that probably the great majority of those serving sentences in the UK will not have any interest in a transfer to here because of their long-established roots in the UK.</P>
    <P>There was also a reference to pressure on prison accommodation. This is not a new phenomenon. The House will already be aware that developments in relation to a new prison at Castlerea and a new women's prison will help to alleviate the situation. Transfers out under the convention will create some spaces. However, there certainly can be <Col N="1127" /> no question of allowing the operation of the convention to place an intolerable burden on the prison service and it has already been indicated that at the time of ratification we will enter an appropriate reservation. This is a question which will have to be approached with some flexibility, drawing a balance between pressure on accommodation and the desirability for humanitarian reasons to facilitate as many applicants as possible.</P>
    <P>Deputies O'Donoghue, Costello and O'Keeffe raised the issue of different remission rates between here and the UK. The effect of the Bill &mdash; in line with the Convention &mdash; will be that where a person is transferred here our remission rate of one-quarter will apply to the balance of the sentence to be served.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donnell raised the related question of whether the Minister for Justice will be able to use her powers of release in relation to prisoners transferred here. The answer is yes. The Minister will have the same powers as if the sentence had been imposed here. Again this is in line with the approach enshrined in the Convention.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donoghue gave notice of amendments which he proposes to introduce on Committee Stage about making it mandatory on the Minister to consent to transfers where certain criteria are met and allowing appeals to the courts against a refusal. Obviously we can go into this in detail on Committee Stage but all I will say for the present is that the approach contained in the Bill is in line with that taken in the Convention where, before a transfer, there must be the consent of the sentencing state, the administering state and the prisoner.</P>
    <P>I would again like to thank Deputies for their contributions and particularly for the broad welcome there has been for the Bill. I am sure that the detail of the proposals contained in the Bill will be fully thrashed out in the Legislation and Security Committee.</P>
    <P>I am particularly conscious of the matter raised by Deputy McDaid which is that when the prisoner is sentenced it <Col N="1128" /> is very often not just the prisoner but the prisoner's family who serve the sentence. I am also very aware of the work of various penologists and criminologists and that maintaining contact with the family is very important to a prisoner's rehabilitation from crime. This is not simply a humane measure but a logical one if the aim of our prison system is not simply to punish but also to rehabilitate, which is an important objective. I again thank all who contributed to the debate.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This Bill is short and straightforward. The Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs has certain statutory functions under the European Communities Act in relation to the supervision of EC secondary legislation. The purpose of the Bill, following the establishment of the Joint Committee on European Affairs, is to transfer the statutory functions in question exercised at present by the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs to the new Joint Committee on European Affairs. The transfer of these statutory functions necessitates a simple amendment of the European Communities Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The background to the Bill is that <Col N="1129" /> after Ireland joined the European Community in 1973, the statutory function in relation to secondary legislation under the European Communities Act was initially exercised by the Joint Committee on Secondary Legislation of the European Communities. With the establishment of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs the function was transferred to that committee. The most appropriate committee to exercise this task is now the new Joint Committee on European Affairs. Secondary legislation plays an important role in the implementation of directives adopted by the European Union and it is essential that the Oireachtas should continue its constructive role in examining that legislation.</P>
    <P>The remit of the Joint Committee on European Affairs, of course, extends far beyond the supervision of secondary legislation. It will, I have no doubt, in conjunction with the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, make an essential contribution across the range of issues arising from Irish membership of the European Union.</P>
    <P>The decision to establish the Joint Committee is a reflection of the importance which the Government attaches to European issues and to the role of the Oireachtas in addressing them. I should like to take this opportunity once again to wish the Joint Committee well in its future work. It will certainly face an important workload over the coming years and I very much look forward to working closely with it. Officials from my Department have already appeared before the committee to outline the background to the Council of Ministers' Report on the functioning of the Treaty on European Union, which will serve as an important input to the Reflection Group which is to prepare the Intergovernmental Conference and which will start work next month.</P>
    <P>Today is &ldquo;Schuman Day&rdquo;, named in honour of the French Foreign Minister who on 9 May 1950 put forward the original proposal that the French and West German coal and steel industries <Col N="1130" /> be placed under a single High Authority. That proposal, 45 years ago, led to the setting up of the European Coal and Steel Community, thereby starting the whole process of European integration as we know it today. Europe has come a long way in the intervening period. A Coal and Steel Community consisting of six member states has developed to become a European Union of 15 member states. The brave hope of peace and prosperity has been translated into a solid achievement but the European Union cannot rest on its laurels. Most particularly, it must ensure on the one hand that it addresses positively the aspirations for membership of the Union on the wider European continent and on the other that the benefits of membership are fully extended to all its citizens, most particularly through a concerted attack on the problem of unemployment. The European Union is facing a host of new challenges. I do not intend today to dwell in any detail on the vast array of issues which must be addressed over the coming years and which we will have many opportunities of discussing on future occasions. However, I would like to avail of this opportunity to highlight some of the foremost priorities.</P>
    <P>First, the creation of employment must remain our top priority at national and Union level. The Commission's White Paper on Growth, Competitiveness and Employment identified a number of important avenues for progress. There is no &ldquo;miracle cure&rdquo; for the scourge of unemployment, but at both national level and with our EU partners we are working resolutely and imaginatively to achieve tangible improvement.</P>
    <P>Second, the 1996 Intergovernmental Conference offers both a challenge and an opportunity for the Union to improve its effectiveness and to begin to equip itself for the challenges of a new century. Imagination and vision will be called for in our approach, all the more so as Ireland will chair the Intergovernmental Conference during our Presidency in the second half of 1996.</P>
    <P>Third, the achievement of Economic <Col N="1131" /> and Monetary Union represents a central aim of the Union over the coming years. Ireland fully supports that aim and will be ready to participate in the third and final phase.</P>
    <P>Fourth, as I indicated, the further enlargement of the European Union to include among others the countries of Central and Eastern Europe will remain a major priority over the years ahead. The emergence of democracies with reforming economies in Central and Eastern Europe means that the political and economic context in which the European Union operates has fundamentally altered. The countries of Central and Eastern Europe legitimately aspire to European Union membership and that aspiration must be met. Working out the arrangements for this in a way which preserves the Union's essential achievements and which permits the continuing process of European integration will occupy much of the European Union's energies in coming years. Proceeding with enlargement in a way which did not facilitate the continued process of integration would not be in anyone's interests, least of all the applicant countries.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned in referring to the Intergovernmental Conference, Ireland will hold the Presidency of the European Union in the second half of 1996. Ireland has of course held the Presidency on four previous occasions. It is fair to say that the businesslike, efficient and <i>communautaire</i>manner in which we conducted those presidencies was widely appreciated. The 1996 Presidency will pose a greater challenge for the country in organisation and management terms because there is now an expanded Union of 15 member states and because of the ever widening agenda. The challenge is one, however, which we gladly accept and which I have no doubt we shall meet effectively. Ireland has much to gain from Europe, and I do not mean in narrow financial terms. We also have much to give. If we are to derive maximum benefit from the <Col N="1132" /> Union while making a maximum contribution to it, it is essential that we strive consistently to increase our knowledge and understanding of European issues. It is vital that that increase in knowledge and understanding should apply not only to the Government and the Oireachtas, but also to the public generally. The Government has sought in many ways to encourage and develop public debate on European issues, through for example the &ldquo;Communicating Europe&rdquo; initiative and through the very successful series of public seminars leading to the forthcoming publication of a White Paper on Foreign Policy. Only through knowledge and understanding of European issues can we attain the full rewards of membership and at the same time make a mature, focused and well-informed contribution to the affairs of the European Union.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill, the purpose of which is to give recognition to the new Joint Committee on European Affairs. I also welcome the decision to establish a separate committee. One of the problems is that little attention has been paid by the House to secondary legislation with the result that there is now a huge backlog. It is a matter of concern that insufficient moneys are available to the committee to employ people with expertise to examine directives and secondary legislation.</P>
      <P>It is also a matter of concern that there is a tendency in Europe to seek uniformity. When I visited a chip shop last week I was informed that the owner has to make changes at the back of the shop because someone in the European Commission has decided that a crack in the wall cannot be filled, that the wall must be replastered. Some of the health regulations are too restrictive and, because of this there is a need to provide funds to the Joint Committee on European Affairs to conduct independent research to assess the effect legislation will have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>According to a recent survey 80 per cent of people know nothing about <Col N="1133" /> Europe although they say our membership is a good thing. While I appreciate that the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs is making an effort he has not yet managed to increase people's knowledge. Has he been spending money only in Dublin? It is the view of the average person that Europe only provides money for business and farmers.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, the effect of the regulations to which I referred is to impose costs on small businesses. For instance, if a person sells more than half a dozen eggs they will have to register. Dinny in &ldquo;Glenroe&rdquo; will be summonsed immediately as he leaves dirt on eggs to give the impression that they are free range. Throughout the country people are making pin money by selling a few eggs or baking bread. This is now illegal under European legislation and if they continue to engage in this activity they will be regarded as criminals. A number of years ago an attempt was made to replace the pint in both Ireland and Britain with a half litre system. This trend should be checked as there is a need for individuality and to retain the character and traditions of each country.</P>
    <P>Recently the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry appeared before the committee&mdash;I thank the chairperson for arranging this. He explained that the European Union is seeking a pay back of £123 million on foot of the report of the beef tribunal and other matters. The European Union should not pursue this matter as the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, which acts as its agent, has been extremely vigilant and strict and loopholes have been closed.</P>
    <P>The pay back being sought from Ireland constitutes a penalty in that the taxpayer will have to pay, given that the companies concerned no longer exist although the managements may now be involved in different companies. As each rural Deputy is aware, if a farmer mistakenly gives the number of a bullock when applying for grants on six heifers he will receive nothing for two <Col N="1134" /> years. The Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry is so strict it will not allow the application form to be corrected, even though it was a genuine mistake because of bad eyesight or lack of knowledge in filling out the form.</P>
    <P>I understand that last Friday &mdash; I was unable to be present &mdash; the Minister for Justice appeared before the committee to discuss the drugs issue. There is also a need for legislation in this area. Although there has been tremendous co-operation in recent months and a large quantity of drugs has been seized there is a need for the committee to conduct research to see what it can do. In my naivety I thought that all the drugs seized off our coasts last summer were destined for Holland which is recognised as the major drugs centre of Europe. However, I soon discovered that drugs were being shipped from Holland to this country.</P>
    <P>It is extraordinary that in allegedly providing for the free passage of goods and people, with the exception of ourselves and the British, the European Union is facilitating those who deal in drugs because of the absence of border and customs checks. The place of origin will have to be certified if we are to tackle this problem.</P>
    <P>If professional help is not available the workload of the committee will be far too great. I am aware that consultants will be appointed but only to examine legislation. Civil servants should be seconded to the committee to conduct independent research from the point of view of Oireachtas Members, not of individual Departments.</P>
    <P>I am sorry that Irish people do not enjoy the privilege of being able to travel throughout Europe without a passport. At Brussels Airport Irish people have to take the long way round while everyone else takes the short cut. I appreciate there are restrictions because of the position in Northern Ireland but I encourage the Department of Foreign Affairs to ensure that Irish people enjoy the same freedoms and are not classified as second class citizens in the European Union.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1135" /> In relation to the paper on growth, competitiveness and employment the European Union has made a reasonable effort but the solution to Europe's problems may not be the solution to ours. We should look at what Europe has done, particularly in the smaller regions.</P>
    <P>I spoke earlier about individuals making pin money who are regulated by Europe, but these regulations do not apply to the French farmer who produces wine for local consumption, nor does it apply to the producer who supplies bread to the local shop. Unlike Ireland, France has kept its individuality and its characteristics. A German man who set up business in my constituency making cheese said in a recent radio interview that he does not intend to continue in business because of the EU regulations governing bacteria levels. If he complied with the regulations the cheese would be flavourless and similar to mass produced cheese that is available throughout the European Union. Ministers do not fight for our individuality in Europe but rather agree to uniformity.</P>
    <P>I wish the Government every success with the Presidency in 1996 and hope it will be as successful as the last Presidency which was run excellently by the then Taoiseach, Charles Haughey, and the Government. I hope the Government will show the same efficiency now and that meetings will be held not only in Dublin but throughout Ireland so that Ireland in the wider sense can be seen to be part of Europe. I also hope the Minister of State will increase his efforts to make Europe more knowledgeable about Ireland. Our membership of the EU is considered a disadvantage in terms of legislating for Ireland as an individual country and an advantage in terms of money coming in, but that money only goes to a few farmers and big business people. The average individual does not see the benefit of it even though millions of pounds of EU funding are spent on regional schemes such as water and sewerage facilities and tremendous work is being done in every <Col N="1136" /> constituency. European officials who visit Ireland to see the work being done should meet local authorities and let them know that European funding, in many cases accounts for 75 to 85 per cent of total funding. Very often people do not realise that the work is being carried out with European taxpayers' money. If we are to give credit to the concept of Europe we must ensure the average person knows from where the money is coming.</P>
    <P>As expected, Ireland will not now become a member of the Economic and Monetary Union in 1997 because we have over-borrowed to a large extent this year and will not meet the criteria. I questioned the Tánaiste and the Minister for Finance on the statement by the French Presidency early this year that Ireland would not meet the criteria for a single currency. We could meet the criteria before Christmas, and I am not saying the position changed due to a change in Government but it is peculiar and unusual that it happened at that time and suddenly after Christmas we would not be eligible. Ireland will be in a serious financial position if we are not party to Economic and Monetary Union. Pressure must be put on Britain to join the Economic and Monetary Union, otherwise the single currency will not be successful. A single currency will do away with the MCAs and the huge administration which has been subject to fraud and miscalculations. A single currency would play a central role in uniting Europe and, above all, it would give us an equal trading opportunity so that we would not have to depend on one economy.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to provide greater manpower to the committee, even on a part-time basis, to study this legislation. Otherwise civil servants from the Departments will have to be brought in to explain it and because they argued for it in the first place they will defend it. A greater input is needed before legislation is agreed in Europe. Commitment to a greater input from committees before agreement is reached at Council of Ministers meetings was given <Col N="1137" /> by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry and will probably be given by other Ministers. If we in Dáil Éireann represent the people and the Minister represents the country surely we should have an input not merely in hindsight, by commenting on legislation already passed in the EU.</P>
    <P>Of a total of almost 600 Members of the European Parliament, Ireland has only 15 members and it is impossible for them to cover all the committees. I urge again that extra manpower and finance be given to this committee so that we can do a good job in ensuring that the people are aware of European matters.</P>
    <P>As the Tánaiste said, as well as benefiting from EU membership, we have something to give Europe, particularly in terms of our neutrality. Before the accession of Austria and Sweden, Ireland and Denmark were the only two neutral countries in the European Union. We have a tremendous role to play in this regard in the expansion of the European Union towards the Eastern European countries because those countries respect our position and can perhaps trust us more. We can play the honest broker role and ensure Europe does not over-legislate, and does not become the white washed sepulchre, or the roller coaster it tends to become. An input is necessary at ministerial or European Parliament level to ensure the character of each country is reflected in agreed legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very brief Bill, the details of which need not detain us for very long. The change being made is a minor one and is not of enormous significance. Some of the matters that pertain more broadly to this and other committees should be commented on in the House. I had some doubts about the wisdom of having separate committees for foreign affairs and European affairs of the proliferation of committees in the House, but having been a member of each of these committees since they were established, there is a good argument for two committees. However, servicing the two committees creates <Col N="1138" /> difficulties, especially for small parties. While I agree with the existence of two separate committees, the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Joint Committee on European Affairs, I do not agree with the establishment of 17 committees of this House, which is small by international standards. If members of the Government, Ministers of State, the Ceann Comhairle and Leas-Cheann Comhairle are excluded from its membership, there are fewer than 130 people to service 17 committees. That cannot be done effectively and in a businesslike way. Many of the peripheral committees should be would up after a period, particularly those that seem to have been set up for single issue purposes. This House should concentrate its energies in committee on the main committees. The reasoning for the establishment and maintenance of 17 committees may have more to do with accommodating disappointed backbenchers in positions of limited affluence than with real parliamentary committee work, a wrong reason for the establishment.</P>
      <P>These two committees have worked well given that they are only a few months in existence. One of the reasons is that each of them has been able to bring before it people who have submissions to make and who have particular knowledge of some of the problems being considered. It has been particularly helpful that officials from the Department of Foreign Affairs, the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry and elsewhere have come before them and explained the background to the policy positions Ireland has adopted to a variety of topics. It is welcoming that it has helped to explain that policy in a way that makes it more meaningful to Members and the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this Bill is to transfer from the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs to the Joint Committee on European Affairs the functions originally exercised under the 1973 Act by what used to be known as the Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities which sat for 20 years but did not really function. In so <Col N="1139" /> far as it examined any secondary legislation, it did so months, often years, after it had come into effect. Even if that committee unanimously disagreed with the secondary legislation, the Statutory Instrument concerned, it could not have done anything about it because most of that legislation contains a provision that it can only be set aside within 21 sitting days by a resolution of both Houses. Even if that committee and both Houses were unanimously against such legislation, they could not have done anything about it, which was ridiculous.</P>
    <P>The Joint Committee on European Affairs will not fulfil its function of examining secondary legislation unless it can do so very rapidly after it is passed and that seems to be envisaged. However, I suggest to the Tánaiste and the Minister of State that the ideal position, and I accept we cannot achieve it overnight, is the Danish one where draft directives are considered in advance by a similar committee of the Danish Parliament and cannot be adopted by Denmark at the Council of Ministers unless they have been cleared in advance by the appropriate committee of the Danish Parliament.</P>
    <P>That is light years ahead and is fundamentally different from our position, but it shows the difference in the relative esteem in which the Danish parliament is held <i>vis-á-vis</i>this House. It is all right for this House to discuss something passed three years ago the attitude being it is only the Dáil. In the Danish Parliament it would be regarded as insulting to its Parliament and, therefore, to the Danish people if its Members did not express their opinion in advance of Denmark adopting a position at the Council of Ministers. That is what we must aim for. It is a democratic position. It does not make for the easiest passage of business in the Council of Ministers because as I remember business was held up frequently to enable the committee of the Danish Parliament to examine it, it used to annoy the then Presidency and some of <Col N="1140" /> Denmark's partners, but it was a democratic system.</P>
    <P>There should be at least an input from the Joint Committee on European Affairs to matters of fundamental importance being &mdash; or about to be &mdash; considered by the Council of Ministers. It is not possible in the foreseeable future for a committee like this to examine every line of every directive, particularly if they are of a technical nature, but those concerning important fundamental policy should be examined by the committee even if they are considered initially in an informal way without statutory powers. One way of achieving that would be to table an amendment to this Bill. I do not propose to do that because we need more time in terms of development of these committees, but it might be appropriate in perhaps two years' time to table such an amendment or to introduce a Bill to provide for what I am suggesting.</P>
    <P>The former Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities existed for approximately 20 years and I note, with some amusement, that the Tánaiste in his speech said that it is essential that the Oireachtas should continue its constructive role in examining that legislation. He was taking a liberty in saying that because, unfortunately, the Oireachtas did not have a constructive role for the simple reason that it did not really have a role. While the Oireachtas has never had a constructive role in examining this type of legislation, I hope it will have one now. I welcome the fact that these committees seem to have been allocated increased resources. I hope that trend continues as well as the practice of committees of inviting people before them to make submissions.</P>
    <P>Incidentally, the title of this Bill is wrong because the phrase &ldquo;European Communities&rdquo; has disappeared in practice, if not legally. Therefore, we should begin to refer to it in legislation as the &ldquo;European Union&rdquo;, even though I know the Communities remain in a technical sense which will disappear at <Col N="1141" /> the end of the century if not renewed in a new treaty.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs took the opportunity of referring briefly to some of the large policy issues before us, not least the decisions that will have to be taken at the Intergovernmental Conference to be held next year when Ireland will hold the Presidency. All of the Irish Presidencies have been challenging and difficult for a country as small as ours but we can be justly proud that they have been discharged with some distinction. Obviously, the forthcoming Irish Presidency in the latter part of 1996 will be the most difficult of all. The Union is larger and the issues to be discussed and decided during that Presidency will be larger, more far-reaching than any encountered during our previous Presidencies. I have every confidence that the various Government Departments will be able to cope with these difficulties just as successfully as they did in the past.</P>
    <P>Deputy Davern referred to European Monetary Union, as did the Tánaiste, and to the single currency issue as though it was something that would happen very quickly without encountering any major problem. While I congratulate President-elect of France, Jacques Chirac, on his election &mdash; I am sure he will be an excellent President &mdash; I am somewhat apprehensive about his European as opposed to his domestic policy. Whether he will be as European in his outlook as the outgoing President Mitterand I am not at all sure. He does not appear to have any great enthusiasm for a single currency, which is very regrettable.</P>
    <P>I have heard it said that the greatest impediment to trade in the European Union is the diversity of currencies and that the most profitable activity of banks throughout the Union is foreign currency exchange. For example, it has been calculated that currency exchange adds 2 per cent to Irish firms' costs. It is quite an appalling impediment, not merely for us but for the whole Union, <Col N="1142" /> that this should remain so. Notwithstanding the views of the British, every effort should be made to achieve a single currency which, in turn, can arise only out of economic and monetary union and a greater convergence in economic terms than at present. I hope there will be no lessening of the resolve within the European Union to try to achieve this greater economic convergence and that the Franco-German axis, the driving force behind these proposals in the past, will not be lessened by the recent political changes in France.</P>
    <P>There are many other difficulties to be overcome. Deputy Davern referred to the fact that some countries now cast doubt on our ability to operate a single currency, our ability to operate from within an inner tier or circle, if there should be a two-tier Europe. That is one matter that will have to be examined. Apart from whatever remarks the French made recently, the Germans &mdash; in particular a committee of the German Parliament &mdash; has looked very seriously at the authenticity of some Irish official statistics, particularly in so far as they relate to our national debt which appears to be understated and to our gross domestic product which appears to be overstated. If one of those is overstated and the other understated it weakens our position so far as adherence to the Maastricht Treaty requirements and guidelines are concerned.</P>
    <P>The forthcoming 18 months up to the end of 1996 certainly will be very important and afford an opportunity for such useful work on the part of these two committees. As a result of the establishment of the two committees this House is better placed to deal with that work than it would have been in the past but we still have a long way to go. I hope the respective chairmen of the committees will be able to use their positions to develop further the powers and significance of these committees in a way that never happened in the past. I am given some reason to hope that will be the case and, if it is, I shall be very glad to see it happen. It is vital that we have a much broader debate here on <Col N="1143" /> foreign policy issues generally, in particular on matters related to the European Union. We tend to think of the European Union in financial terms only, which is extremely regrettable. We need to do more than give the kind of lip service evident in the Tánaiste's speech today to what we can give to Europe as well as what we can obtain from it.</P>
    <P>The Joint Committee on European Affairs should consider the question of overseeing, to some degree, the controls exercised in Ireland on expenditure of European Union funds. I do not share the view expressed by Deputy Davern that the Department of Agriculture is very strict and has nothing of which to be ashamed. While the Department may be very strict on small farmers in County Limerick or Tipperary and impose horrendous penalties whenever they make a mistake in the number on an ear tag on a heifer, unfortunately when it comes to dealing with bigger fish, the Department loses its sense of correctness and anxiety to ensure that public and European funds are properly administered. There have been some very serious examples of huge losses caused by the failure of the Department of Agriculture to supervise what was taking place, a fact which has now come to the notice of the European Commission. The Joint Committee on European Affairs might well be able to perform a useful function in this regard. While a more obvious committee would be the Committee of Public Accounts, its remit means that it must operate in arrears and can only examine matters relating to years of accounts now closed.</P>
    <P>What we need is some type of system of continuous supervision so that the types of losses this country now faces in terms of refunds to the European Commission might be avoided in the future. While the committee, of itself, cannot prevent these things happening, if it has an examining role in relation to them, it can encourage the Departments involved to ensure that huge losses of the kind we now face do not recur. It would encourage Departments, such as <Col N="1144" /> the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, to ensure that they are as strict with people who have a turnover of several hundred million pounds per year, and who by and large up to now have had a free run, as they are with people who have no more than a dozen beasts from which to derive their livelihood.</P>
    <P>I would like to table amendments along those lines, particularly with regard to committee powers, but as the committee system is a relatively short time in existence, that would not be appropriate. I invite the Government to consider introducing a further Bill in, perhaps, two years' time, under which the possibility of extending the powers of committees could be considered. As the committee system evolves it will be seen as very useful. It is regrettable that it is only in the relatively recent past that the value and validity of parliamentary committees has been accepted.</P>

      <P>The Tánaiste stated that this is European Day. I compliment the European Parliament office in Dublin and its director, James O'Brien, for the concerts they initiated to mark a very important day in all our lives. This day 45 years ago a Foreign Minister in France, Monsieur Schuman, by way of statement, set out the need for an economic community. By providing us with the enjoyment of excellent young artists, who have been prize winners in Feis Ceoil this year, the European Parliament office availed of this opportunity to show the nation and Europe the tremendous talent and culture we can offer to Europe. As the Tánaiste stated, as well as being major beneficiaries we have much to offer Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the contributions of previous speakers. Deputies Davern, O'Malley and Andrews are members of the committee and have a wealth of experience because of their past membership of the Council of Ministers, which is very important under the new terms of reference. I also welcome Deputy Haughey. Those Deputies have <Col N="1145" /> made a major contribution to the workings of the committee.</P>
    <P>As chairman of the Joint Committee on European Affairs I welcome the Bill. It restores to the committee, charged with scrutiny of secondary legislation of the European Community, the power to recommend to the Dáil and Seanad the annulment of Statutory Instruments. While this power has seldom been used, nonetheless it is important. In a very concrete manner it represents the desire of the Oireachtas, from the outset of Ireland's membership of the European Community, to ensure accountability to the public so far as European legislation is concerned. As a member of the former Joint Committee on Secondary Legislation of the European Communities, I share the sentiments expressed by Deputy O'Malley about the ineffectiveness of that committee. It was bound by a great number of Statutory Instruments, had very little power and was concerned mainly with the implications for Ireland of European Directives which could not be annulled.</P>
    <P>European legislation can have a direct effect on, or be implemented through, national legislation. The processing and implementation of such legislation must be monitored closely. The Joint Committee on European Affairs has already put in place mechanisms to ensure effective monitoring and scrutiny of European Community legislation and the Statutory Instruments it may implement. They will be thorough and relevant and relate to the points raised by Deputy O'Malley. The committee wants to influence legislation as it is being considered and ensure that Statutory Instruments serve the purpose for which they are designed.</P>
    <P>The Joint Committee on European Affairs has a much broader remit than that traditionally fulfilled by the Joint Committee on Secondary Legislation of the European Communities. Since March last it may also examine matters arising from the European Community or Maastricht Treaty. This means that a broader view will be taken of the duty <Col N="1146" /> of the Oireachtas to ensure accountability and transparency on European Union matters. The Joint Committee has been given the necessary teeth to carry out this important responsibility effectively. It has also been given the power to examine policy and to call before it Ministers and officials to give evidence, and intends doing so on a regular basis.</P>
    <P>In its initial work programme adopted in April, the joint committee decided to invite all Ministers whose briefs include a substantive European Union issue to address it. To date the Ministers for Agriculture, Food and Forestry and Justice have appeared before it. On 11 April the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry briefed the joint committee on the proposed disallowances on FEOGA payments for intervention beef, a matter referred to by Deputies Davern and O'Malley. We believed it was important, from the point of view of the public, particularly the taxpayer, that such disallowances of FEOGA payments should be explained to members of the public who, at the end of the day, take up the tab for all fines and disallowances. We wanted to assure them that those matters would be addressed properly and adequately. The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry gave a broad and effective explanation to the committee of how those matters arose. I share the sentiments expressed by Deputy O'Malley regarding the beef industry. The Minister and his predecessor admitted that proper controls were not in place. If they had been, such problems might never have arisen. The joint committee has assured the Minister of its support in his efforts to ensure that disallowances of FEOGA payments are minimised. The Minister also briefed the joint committee on a Council of Agriculture Ministers meeting which took place the previous day. In so doing he set a precedent regarding Council business on which the joint committee hopes to build.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice briefed the joint committee on Friday last on <Col N="1147" /> aspects of the third pillar of Maastricht, namely, negotiations on the Europol Convention and the implications of the Schengen Agreement for the free movement of people in the European Union. I commend both Ministers for responding to our invitation and for offering their personal co-operation and that of their officials in the workings of the joint committee in the future. We look forward to similar co-operation from other Ministers. The Tánaiste and the Minister of State with responsibility for European Affairs, Deputy Mitchell, have assured me they will be available to assist the committee in its work.</P>
    <P>The joint committee has also been briefed by senior officials in the Department of Foreign Affairs on the Council's report on the reflection group, on which the Minister of State, Deputy Mitchell, will represent the Government. That group will assist in preparing the agenda for the intergovernmental council.</P>
    <P>The sister committees in Europe, COSAK, have had a major input through European affairs committees in the preparation for the intergovernmental council. Deputy O'Malley referred to the Danish committee in particular which will address our committee next week. Its members will explain to us the powers of that committee, which exceed those of any other committee in all the member states.</P>
    <P>I believe our committee will benefit from the experience of that powerful European affairs committee of the Danish Parliament which has already begun to influence the forthcoming Spanish Presidency in the latter half of this year. That committee is preparing for a meeting of COSAK, which will be held in Madrid, and has suggested to the EU member currently holding the Presidency that, as a result of an agreement reached in Paris earlier this year, there is broad consensus on the strengthening of COSAK and the role of national parliaments in the decision-making process within the European Union. In a letter to the chairperson of that committee, <Col N="1148" /> the Danish members suggested that this would be of great significance in regard to public support for the EU, which has been sadly lacking in the past. It suggested that, in the plans for the forthcoming COSAK meeting under the Spanish chairmanship, the president of that group should invite, as part of the agenda, the participation of the reflection group.</P>
    <P>I am warning the Minister of State, who will be our representative on the reflection group, that it is envisaged that the group will be asked to put forward its views in the preparations of all national parliaments and the institutions concerned before the Inter-Governmental Conference which will be held here at the end of 1996.</P>
    <P>The immediate objectives of the joint committee are to complete its initial programme at ministerial level already approved by the committee. An intermediate objective is to solidify and formalise the committee's broader remit in relation to EU business. One question which I will be asking the joint committee to address is the regular review of Council business both before and after Council meetings. Many member states in the European Union now have this system in place, which is in the interests of both accountability and transparency, and we intend closely to scrutinise Council business.</P>
    <P>Another important area the joint committee will be addressing is the leadup to the Intergovernmental Conference which will review a broad range of issues fundamental to the operation and structures of the European Union. It is essential that this process receives in-depth examination at parliamentary level and that the Oireachtas makes a fitting input to it. In this regard, it will be necessary for both the Joint Committee on European Affairs and the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs to liaise closely so that the resources of the Oireachtas are focused constructively on this important task.</P>
    <P>This brings me to the point raised by Deputies Davern, O'Malley and others and, indeed, by me at a meeting of the <Col N="1149" /> liaison committee when we discussed resources for the committees. This committee and the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs must be resourced properly. At this point I wish to pay tribute to the existing staff, some of whom have been seconded from other Departments. In particular, I wish to mention Mr. Ansboro, who has been seconded from the Department of Foreign Affairs to the Joint Committee on European Affairs. I pay tribute also to those members of staff who are expected to service not only committees of importance such as the Joint Committee on European Affairs and the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs but other committees of the Oireachtas. If the Government is serious about the importance of these committees, they must be properly resourced and funded to enable their members carry out the statutory obligations placed on their shoulders by legislation and the other responsibilities given to us in our new terms of reference.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Department of Foreign Affairs and to the Minister that when committee members are required, by law and under Standing Orders, to consult with other committees of member states, we should be able to send representatives to Europe to see, for example, the workings of the European drugs unit. In responding to a European Minister's invitation we should have the facility to visit that country and address the public concern, and that expressed here in this House, about the scourge of the drug culture that has hit our island. We must be able to have an input into the future workings of EUROPOL and, in particular, the European drugs unit which I understand is non-operational but which has facilities to transmit information to our Department of Justice&mdash; and the Minister has been forthcoming in this area&mdash;through our police force. I am delighted that a member of our Garda Síochána serves in that unit in The Hague. I suggest this as part of the overall requirement of the committee for proper facilities which will enable us <Col N="1150" /> do the work given us by Government and by the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to speak on a matter which goes to the very heart of our relationship with the European Union and which involves issues fundamentally important to the future of Ireland as a member state. I commend the Bill to the House and look forward to the new powers that will be given us to carry out one of our roles. However, as the Tánaiste said, that is not the only role. There are other important roles of the committee and we have already gone down that road to ensure that Ministers and officials are brought before our committee. In that way, the public will have an opportunity for the first time to listen to representatives of Government, who participate in Council of Ministers meetings, responding to the concerns of all of us, particularly Members of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>As chairman of this committee, I will be reporting back to the Oireachtas on our work at the end of its first year of operation and on those who participated in that work, whether they are Members of the Oireachtas or outside consultants. I intend to make this committee relevant to the needs of the people and the needs of Government in its commitment to transparency and accountability but also to address the deficiencies that existed in the system in the past.</P>
    <P>This Bill is a useful instrument. It broadens the power which we presumed from the Government statement would be forthcoming. Our sub-committee on secondary legislation has already examined areas where it is possible to annual if the committee so decides. With the power given to us today we will have an opportunity to examine some of the relevant Statutory Instruments which are in the public domain. This committee will be relevant, up-to-date and will have the full co-operation of all the Ministers and their officials responsible for areas covered by the Maastricht Treaty.</P>

      <P>As a Deputy for the Dublin area, a former Lord Mayor and a former member of Dublin City Council, the Minister will be aware that public representatives in the Dublin area perceive that Dublin loses out in terms of resources from Europe and elsewhere. I hope the Minister's appointment will redress the balance and that he recognises the need for resources in deprived urban areas throughout the country. The Minister has already made a number of announcements in that regard.</P>
      <P>Direct elections to the European Parliament have changed the perception of Europe. Initially it was thought the European Union was for the farmers and for business but, with direct elections, people representing all sections of society have entered parliament. I hope the Minister, in his new role, will remember his days in Dublin City Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reform of the Oireachtas has been debated in recent years and the development of the committee system has brought about this reform. We may not have needed a committee system in the past but as society is much more complex we certainly need it now. I too question as Deputy O'Malley did the number of committees that have been set up by this Government. All parties in the Oireachtas are not in a position to service adequately all the committees and Deputies mentioned the need for adequate resources if the committees are to do the job well. Committees need personnel and back-up services and all Members have requested such resources. Deputy O'Malley mentioned that committees have been set up to facilitate Members of the Oireachtas being given a special role as chairpersons, convenors and so on. There is some justification for making that claim. However, everybody accepts that the <Col N="1152" /> Joint Committee on European Affairs and its sub-committee are very important as new areas of parliamentary and European activity will come under scrutiny by the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs was unable to give sufficient time to European issues, hence the need for this Bill. It is vital that a committee such as this be established to deal with all aspects of the new proposed European Union measures&mdash;the 1996 intergovernmental conference, the review of the Maastricht Traty. There are vital areas for this country in particular and for Europe as a whole and no doubt this committee will play a crucial role in the deliberations of the Council of Europe in the run-up to decision making.</P>
    <P>Parliamentary scrutiny of the affairs of the European Union have been inadequate and the Minister for Justice, Deputy Owen, admitted last Friday that vast areas of her Department are dealing with security issues which have never come under parliamentary scrutiny. That clearly demonstrates the need for this committee. Last Friday's committee meeting was very useful and probably brought a European dimension to the question of the availability of drugs in this country which would not have happened if it had not been for the Joint Committee on European Affairs.</P>
    <P>The committee has addressed the question of fraud and the proposed disallowance of FEOGA payments on intervention beef. It is suggested Ireland will be fined because of past irregularities in the beef industry. I think the committee broke new ground in investigating this area. The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry briefed us on the issues involved and that was the most useful exercise as far as Parliament was concerned. The question of fraud or stealing money from the European Union raises wider issues about how we perceive ourselves in Europe. I know that fraud is rampant in all EU countries but there is agreement that it should be stamped out. We are perceived as holding out the begging bowl <Col N="1153" /> to Europe and that we wanted to get as much as we could out of it without putting anything back. That was an incorrect perception and Members have to deal with it. Ireland has a lot to offer the European Union, our cultural identity, our history, our markets and so on. It is a two way process. The Tánaiste said that we are fully committed to the European Union and we have a great deal to give.</P>
    <P>We welcome the resources to bring about cohesion. As the years go by we will be a fully integrated and respected member of the European Union. This committee will have to address the 1996 Intergovernmental Conference and the review of the Maastricht Treaty generally. We also need to look at the question of institutional reform.</P>
    <P>There are 15 Irish MEPs, a very small number in the overall context. There should be no diminishing of the role of the Council in the overall institutional structure and that will be extremely important for this country. We need to examine the role of MEPs in this Oireachtas and various suggestions have been made as to how they could become involved in internal parliamentary affairs. It was suggested that they be allowed a right of audience to address the Seanad, and the establishment of this committee provides an option for our MEPs. I am delighted that MEPs attended meetings of the subcommittee on European affairs. They should be encouraged to play a full and active role to bring about more accountability and transparency generally in the European Parliament's activities.</P>
    <P>Members have examined the issue of bureaucracy and the European Union generally. There is a perception that the European Union and its institutions are bureaucratic in nature and this was raised at our meeting on Friday when we were presented with volumes of submissions on the European Union's activities. We need to bring Europe closer to the people. We need to look carefully at the &ldquo;democratic deficit&rdquo;. There is still a perception that the European <Col N="1154" /> Union is of no relevance to us. There is a view that bureaucracy has gone mad on occasion. Deputy Davern gave some examples of that. Apparently there is a proposal to do away with red lemonade and Ireland is one of the few countries which has this product. The EU has decided that the red dye used in raspberry jam must go for whatever reason. Such proposals need to be explained as they may involve job losses. New mechanisms must be put in place to explain the workings of the EU to the people and I have no doubt the committee will deal with that satisfactorily.</P>
    <P>Ireland will hold the Presidency of the European Council next year and we will discharge our obligations efficiently. An effort was made during the last Presidency to include the general public in the activities of the Presidency so that the ordinary people, for want of a better term, would be aware of what was involved. Perhaps provision could be made this time for festivals, carnivals and so on to be held which would bring Europe closer to the people and generate pride in ourselves. I have no doubt that the Minister's office will play a big role in that. The public do not want to see the Presidency in terms of blocked roads, barricades and motorcades through the city with sirens blaring. Let us make the Presidency people-friendly and organise subsidiary activities which will involve everyone.</P>
    <P>Another important issue the committee will have to deal with is enlargement of the Union. We had a useful discussion with the President of Hungary who dealt with many of the issues involved. We all welcome the expansion of the Union and support it. However, the agricultural sector will be concerned given that more than 30 per cent of income in that sector is from direct transfers from the EU. Such resources will be under threat with enlargement but, on the positive side, our business will have access to more markets and there will be increased opportunities for exporters. I hope the committee will address the issue carefully.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1155" /> One of the major topics to be discussed is the question of a common foreign and security policy. We have dealt with it in some detail but it is a crucial area which we must address. We have common positions in the EU on a number of international issues and that is welcome provided our unique traditions can be brought to the table. We have had some success in that regard. The recent accession of other neutral countries will benefit us, less powerful nations and nations with different foreign policies. We have much in common with them.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt but that there will be much discussion regarding our traditional policy of military neutrality. My view and that of the majority of the people is that we should stay outside any military alliance. At present we are involved in UN peacekeeping and arising from that we provided airport facilities at Shannon during the Gulf War. We have a unique tradition of fighting injustice throughout the world. Missionaries have led the way in bringing peace and justice and promoting basic human rights in all countries. That unique experience must be brought to bear in any new agreement proposed by the EU. If the Irish Defence Forces are to be involved&mdash;that matter must receive serious discussion&mdash;they cannot be involved in confrontational military conflicts which are not of interest to Europe as a whole. We should proceed as we have in the past and give every support to peacekeeping. This issue of neutrality must be explained carefully to the people when the time comes as it will generate much discussion, passion and emotion.</P>
    <P>It is with some trepidation that I raise the matter of the Eurovision Song Contest as various commentators have derided it over the years. It takes place in Dublin on Saturday. It is a unique experience for this country. Such a cultural exchange brings about European harmony and supports the European ideal. I pay special tribute to RTE for hosting the song contest for the past <Col N="1156" /> three years and previously. It has done a magnificent job and promoted the country throughout the world. It has demonstrated that Ireland is a young country with a vibrant, talented population which is to the forefront in the arts. It employed the latest techniques and technology and presented a positive outlook for the country. In the past we did not have much to celebrate but now we have really taken our place among the nations of the world. The promotional advantage from the song contest is incredible. The various clips to promote tourism and so on have done us proud. We should get behind RTE, support it fully, congratulate it and leave aside the begrudgers. It is a magnificent occasion for us and I have no doubt that Ireland will do us proud on Saturday. It is a great honour for Dublin to hold the contest and it will look its best. This country and Europe will gain from the event.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>It is hardly necessary for me to say I welcome the Bill. It is an integral part of what has been a welcome and long overdue reinforcement and reorganisation of the committee system in the Houses of the Oireachtas. It is not often that a chairperson of a committee welcomes a Bill which will reduce the workload of the committee, that hands part of it over to another committee. This is a perfectly rational measure, particularly since I have every confidence that the Joint Committee on European Affairs under the chairmanship of my colleague, Deputy Ferris, will carry out its tasks to our satisfaction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The necessity for the Joint Committee on European Affairs and this Bill goes back to the old Joint Committee on Secondary Legislation of the European Communities. I wish to dwell for a moment on the experience of that committee. Members of this House and the Seanad who were members of that committee&mdash;I was a member for a short time&mdash;will remember it for one thing more than anything else, that is, the absolutely mind-boggling tedium of much of the work it had to do. In a <Col N="1157" /> sense this was in the nature of the work but in a more fundamental sense it had to do with the way the old European Economic Community went about its business before the reforms of the Masstricht Treaty. Deputy Haughey referred in passing to some of the items which still cause us some concern. I worked as a temporary agent in the Commission and I remember the apparently endless flow of very detailed directives which used to pass through it. Some of these directives dealt with the most mundane and abstruse matters, things no one ever imagined were required. I remember a directive the purpose of which was to lay down in European legislation the dimensions, location and information to be included on the metal plate attached to the engine of a car so as to identify it. It proved necessary to do this because some of the member states for reasons best known to themselves specified an oblong plate in one place on the car, others specified a triangular plate in a different place and yet others specified an oval plate. They did this to make it awkward to import cars from other member states. It became necessary to have legislation governing the height above ground of the indicators, brake lights etc., as part of putting a Single Market together. Happily we have gone most of the distance to putting that Single Market together, so fewer of these directives are required.</P>
    <P>We did something more important in the Maastricht Treaty which has been overlooked in the debate, we brought about a major improvement in the way the European Union makes its decisions, particularly in the relationship between the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament. We now have a much more focused approach by the institutions of the European Union to the way legislation is passed. To everybody's surprise, the European Parliament quickly made it clear that once it had got the right of co-decision over much of its area of operation it wanted to talk about the general principles of policy and did not want to have to <Col N="1158" /> descend every day into the mundane, oily and complex business of detailed legislation. In the coming years, the European Parliament will be thanked by national parliaments and, in particular, by European affairs committees for having taken that very wise step.</P>
    <P>However, there is more to be done. One of the issues I hope will be tackled by the Minister of State in the reflection group and by the Intergovernmental Conference is the setting of a hierarchy of laws so that we will see more clearly the functions of different types of legislative enactments in the European Union and will be able to deal with them more conveniently. There is no doubt that as an Oireachtas we need to go about this issue in a more systematic way. I have particular things in mind when I say that. Ever since we joined the European Economic Community the Oireachtas has been much less than adequately involved in the process of working out what should be legislated for by the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament and in scrutinising how that legislation is applied here.</P>
    <P>That contrasts with the position of a great many interest groups, most of whom have become very adept at making their views known and getting their points across. I would not for a moment contest the right of those interest groups to do that&mdash;I worked for one of them for a good many years and in some respects cut my legislative teeth on that type of work. They have every right to do this and by and large they are extremely good at it. However, for many years the contest has in a sense been an uneven one in that the Houses of the Oireachtas which are charged in the Constitution with protecting and promoting the interests of the citizen were almost the last body to get involved in this process. That is why the original Joint Committee on Secondary Legislation of the European Communities was set up.</P>
    <P>This committee did a tedious job in previous years when there was an enormous flood of detailed regulations and directives of all types coming from the <Col N="1159" /> European institutions. Rationalisation has led to much more manageable legislation but a job still needs to be done. I am sure the chairman of the Joint Committee on European Affairs will agree that for the Oireachtas to become involved in assessing the impact on our society of European legislation is for it to become involved too late. The Oireachtas should become involved at an early stage of the examination of proposals for legislation. This is specifically included in the terms of reference of the Joint Committee on European Affairs and is almost the most important part of its work. Those of us who take a keen interest in European affairs generally know that hardly a month goes by without the Commission or Council of Ministers announcing some other area where it has a plan to do certain things over a period of years and it needs to be discussed. Happily in recent years the Commission has more often adopted the practice of setting out in a White Paper its plans for a particular area of activity. As a Legislature, we should be much more active in examining those matters at that stage than we have been up to now so that there is a real input from the Oireachtas into the decision-making procedures in the European Union.</P>
    <P>I emphasise that if we use that procedure properly we will avoid what seems to be a very ill-advised move to look for ways of involving national parliaments more directly in the process of negotiations between the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament. There is a natural tendency for national parliaments to want to be involved but we have to look at it logically and with respect for the principle of subsidiarity and the different functions of national parliaments and the European Parliament and what is required to be done to give the national parliaments their legitimate role in forming opinion on these issues before that opinion becomes set and begins to take the form of legislation winding its way through the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1160" /> The importance of these things will be seen if we look at some of the areas where European Union policy impacts most on us. For example, there is a vast range of things which the European Union does in agricultural policy which are important for a huge proportion of our population and our economy. Yet the ways in which Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas can be involved are quite limited.</P>
    <P>If we want to talk, for example, about any one of the many premium schemes that exist in the Common Agriculture Policy and look at the ways that Members of this House and of the Seanad can be involved in them we find the following: a Member has the opportunity of putting down questions either for oral or written reply; the opportunity of raising the matter on the Adjournment, in Private Members' time or, once a year, of participating in the debate on the Estimate for the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry. None of those means available to this House is a legislative function; not one of them gives a Member of this House, in that capacity, any direct way of influencing what is done and yet these schemes are very important to us.</P>
    <P>None of the measures open to us is capable of being altered by the way a Deputy or Senator votes. That is because most of these things come before us not as legislation that we have to originate and pass but as legislation passed by the European Union, in proper and due form, the effect of which we must assess. When we look at it from that point of view it becomes even more important that the Joint Committee on European Affairs&mdash;and its reporting to the Houses of the Oireachtas&mdash;should, at a very early stage of the development of policy proposals, give us the opportunity of being involved and making our points to the Members of the Government who will attend the Council meetings and to Members of the European Parliament who will vote in their forum on it, before the proposals take the form of legislation. That is the only way in which Members of the Oireachtas can <Col N="1161" /> have any direct impact on the shape of the measures finally implemented.</P>
    <P>There is another area where I believe we have been&mdash;I will not say remiss&mdash; but lacking in the way we have gone about this part of our job in relation to legislation, that has been in inspecting and supervising the way in which directives are transposed into national law in this country. In the days when I worked in the Commission one of the very tedious jobs we had to do from time to time, about once a month, was to review the number of cases in which infringement proceedings had been taken against member states for their failure to apply European law. We all like to be proud of our record. Ireland figured often enough in those reviews. There have been cases, in the not too distant past, when we have been very lacking in our transposition into national law of directives, for example, in the field of the environment. We need an instrument to make sure we improve on our performance and the function assigned to the European Affairs Committee is an important part of that whole operation.</P>
    <P>It would be wrong of me to leave that subject without also saying that I am very concerned that we should have adequate resources in our committee system to do that. While there have been substantial improvements in that area in the last couple of years, I do not think it can be said we have arrived at the point where we can be happy that the resources match the job to be done. I look forward to the opportunity, with some of my fellow chairpersons of committees, of discussing this with the appropriate Government Minister so that the two Houses of the Oireachtas can give full effect to the very useful progress and reforms that have been made, not only by this Government but by the last Government, in the way our committees are set up and in the job they are given to do. I know there are always difficulties with resources. I know it, perhaps, more keenly than most other Members but it would be a pity to spoil this particular ship for the <Col N="1162" /> ha'p'orth of tar needed to make the system work as we want it to work.</P>
    <P>A great deal more needs to be done. I make the point that in our committee system there has to be a place for our committees to reflect among ourselves on the important issues before us. I say that because there has been criticism, in recent days from an MEP&mdash;who is welcome to come to meetings of our Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs although I understand MEPs have difficulties in attending the meetings&mdash;of the fact that one particular piece of work being done in the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs is in private session. I ask that lady to reflect for a moment on her own experience&mdash;I am sure this must be her experience because she is a rational person. Very often one has to think a little before one can express a thought and the same applies to committees. It is a very useful exercise in some circumstances for a committee to debate issues in private session before it makes a statement. There are quite a number of cases that I can think of where it is useful and helps the process of understanding without prejudicing the politics of the situation to have discussions in private session before the committee goes into public session and reveals the full beauty of its thought to the world.</P>
    <P>Nobody is more convinced than I of the need for widespread public debate on many of the issues that fall within the competence of the Joint Committee on European Affairs, the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs or other committees of this House. The House and the committees have a right to put themselves in the position of most ordinary individuals, to organise their thoughts before sharing them on a wider basis. I reject the criticism of the MEP; perhaps it was made without much thought being given to it.</P>
    <P>There is a big job before us in dealing with what faces this country and the other member states of the European Union at the Intergovernmental Conference. I wish to make one final point &mdash;it is an important one for the work of this committee, the Joint Committee <Col N="1163" /> on Foreign Affairs and the whole House &mdash;on the enlargement of the European Union. We are always tempted to look at it from a rather narrow point of view of where the economic costs and benefits might lie. We had the benefit last week of the visit of the President of Hungary who spoke to us about his country's view on this. We should spend a little time considering the following question. If we are serious about all the things we have been saying in our political systems for the past 50 years about the necessity of rooting parliamentary democracy as widely in the world as we can then surely we should take the view that the enlargement of the European Union is not simply a matter of possible economic gains and losses. The enlargement of the European Union is a political imperative which we must recognise and meet. It is not simply a matter of markets or of trade; it is a political imperative to ensure that the values of democracy and of liberality to which we in this country adhere are ones to which people elsewhere who have been denied that freedom can now have access. We should treat the question in that way, not simply as a matter of trade.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I am a member of the Joint Committee on European Affairs under the excellent chairmanship of Deputy Michael Ferris, and I want the committee system to work. Unfortunately, I am somewhat out of tune with the general welcome for the transfer from Deputy Dukes's excellent committee to the European Affairs Committee of the examination of secondary legislation. I see this as a hospital pass to the European Affairs Committee. Our own chairman, Deputy Ferris, will agree that what happened last Friday at the European Affairs Committee was quite extraordinary. We were presented with an excellent resumé by the Minister for Justice, Deputy Owen, on a number of items which were before us but, in addition, we received a wheelbarrow load of paper in advance of the meeting last Friday. It was quite a harrowing <Col N="1164" /> experience to have to go through a foot high stack of paper, including translations from French to English, on the basis that some Deputies might complain that the original texts had been omitted from the papers presented to the members of the committee.</P>
      <P>I was interested to hear Deputy Dukes, who has a fund of knowledge and wisdom on foreign and European affairs because of his own experience in those areas. At the same time he made the point, correctly I am certain, that secondary legislation is not as frightening now as it was in the past in the context of work output and so on.</P>
      <P>It is important it put on the record that there are not 17 Oireachtas committees but 19, including Enterprise and Economic Strategy, European Affairs, Family, Finance and General Affairs, Foreign Affairs, Irish Language, Joint Services, Liaison, Legislation and Security, Public Accounts, Small Businesses and Services, Social Affairs, State-Sponsored Bodies, Sustainable Development, Women's Rights, the Committee of Selection, the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, Consolidation Bills, and Standing Orders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am strongly of the view that two of the most important committees of the House, in the context of what we hope to achieve at the Intergovernmental Conference and the Presidency of the European Community, are the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Joint Committee on European Affairs. I want these committee to work, but I am sorry to say that what the Minister of State, Deputy Mitchell, is offering us now causes me grave concern because the amount of work the European Affairs Committee has to do between now and the holding of the Intergovernmental Conference is quite enormous. I am concerned that this transfer of responsibility will add to our creaking burden. The European Affairs Committee is a good committee which is working well and will, I have no doubt, continue to do so. I would like to think that the Chairman will set up a sub-committee to take account of the transfer of <Col N="1165" /> these responsibilities and that sub-committee will be made up of as few members of the European Affairs Committee as possible, perhaps one representative from each party.</P>

      <P>Another matter concerns me in regard to the 19 committees. I have no problem with committees as long as they work. The legislation currently before the House should have been backed into another committee, for example, the Consolidation Bills Committee or some other committee which is not as busy as the European Affairs Committee is at present and, no doubt, will be in the future. It is of serious concern to me that this passing over of responsibilities will cause considerable problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am concerned also &mdash; and I say this deliberately by way of constructive, not destructive, criticism &mdash; about the question of the servicing of the committees. The setting up of the committees has brought great strain on the Members and the staff of this House. We should be mindful of the need to add to the existing staff and assist them with the updated technology required to service these committees. The staff are doing their very best &mdash; I know it because I see them doing it &mdash; but with the best will in the world, there are not sufficient numbers and they have not sufficient time or technology. If we want these committees to work we have to have proper back-up. What happened on Friday at the European Affairs Committee is a sign in the wind. We received this burden of paper, this mass of documents, and I am quite satisfied that there were too many documents and that we did not have sufficient time to study them. If we have to receive documents at that nature in future we should have a summary of what they contain. These are some points that I offer in the context of the working of the Committee on European Affairs. It is doing well but I see dangerous signs in the passing over of this legislation to it. Let us not <Col N="1166" /> become bogged down too much with secondary legislation. Much of it, was Deputy O'Malley said, has been effectively passed months or years before we get to scrutinise it.</P>
    <P>There are a number of other items with which the committee will be concerned, including the involvement of Europe in the area of Third World endeavour, Ireland's position on neutrality and so on. It is important to note that Ireland is an observer within the Western European Union. Our neutrality is important, and my party Leader has indicated that membership of the United Nations does not in any way compromise our neutrality. We have a peacekeeping role to play in the UN. The question of security and defence policy will arise in our deliberations on the committee. In the context of neutrality Ireland should keep in touch with neutral countries like Austria, Finland and Sweden in view of their traditional policy on neutrality. Another fundamental examination will be required within this committee of the question of the elimination of nuclear weapons. Non-proliferation and a reduction in armaments must be key objects to be sought by the European Union. The question of the European Union having a seat within the Security Council of the United Nations is also a matter that will have to be discussed and examined in the context of our obligations and responsibilities in the European Affairs Committee.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Fianna Fáil Bill to reform our bail laws is a timid effort. It does not in any way provide for the major strengthening of the law, a move that is absolutely necessary. It merely <Col N="1167" /> seeks to put on a statutory basis the conditions which a court may attach to the granting of bail and to provide a procedure whereby bail money would be forfeited in the event of any of the conditions being breached. To a large extent therefore the Bill only provides statutorily for what is already happening in our courts where judges have for many years used their common law powers to attach conditions to the granting of bail.</P>
      <P>A much together approach to criminals is necessary. It must be noted and recorded that our system of granting bail is one of the most liberal in the world. It is clear that for years organised gangsters and notorious recidivists have had little difficulty in getting bail and, in turn, abusing it. For the most serious of offences, such as rape and bank robbery, there is a little ground in our law for objecting to bail even if prosecutors know that an accused is likely to reoffend. The notorious Leixlip case some years ago which involved a running gun battle with the Garda Síochána by criminals on bail was a case in point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For almost 30 years we have had to stomach the effects of the 1966 O'Callaghan decision in the Supreme Court. It should be remembered that there was another decision in the High Court where Judge Murnaghan had decided in the O'Callaghan case that there were 11 different grounds which could and should be taken into account by the court in deciding on bail. These included the seriousness of the charge, the nature of the evidence in support of the charge, the likely sentence, the likelihood of the commission of further offences by the accused, the possibility of the disposal while on bail of illegally acquired property, the possibility of interferences with witnesses and jurors, the prisoner's failure to answer to bail on a previous occasion and the fact that the prisoner was caught red-handed. It is worth remembering that the accused in the O'Callaghan case had committed the offence while on bail. Despite this, on appeal the Supreme Court reversed <Col N="1168" /> the decision of Judge Murnaghan and decided that it was unconstitutional to refuse bail except on the basis of a danger that the accused would not attend court for trial or that he would interfere with witnesses. All other grounds of refusal were found to be unconstitutional.</P>
    <P>For many years I have advocated a constitutional amendment to restore full discretion to the courts so that the various grounds of refusal laid down by Judge Murnaghan could once again be available to judges.</P>
    <P>The statutory approach has already been tried. When Fine Gael was last in power it introduced the Criminal Justice Act, 1984 which provided for mandatory consecutive sentences for offences committed while on bail. For some time it seemed to have a major effect. The number of persons charged with criminal offences while on bail fell dramatically for a number of years from about 8,000 prior to 1984 to 2,500.</P>
    <P>Two problems however emerged. An analysis of those charged clearly showed that the provision for consecutive sentences in the 1984 Act had a deterrent effect on those involved in petty crime. However, it had little or no impact on those involved in organised and serious crime. It would appear that organised criminals who know they are going to jail on one serious offence have no compunction about committing other crimes because they are aware they will only serve a certain period in our overcrowded prisons.</P>
    <P>The second major problem is that the number of offences committed by those on bail has again increased dramatically. I mentioned that the figure fell from approximately 8,000 to 2,500 per year but last year it jumped dramatically to 4,500. It is clear that a radical approach is now necessary and this approach must give top priority to the victims of crime.</P>
    <P>I am not in favour of a return to the gruesome punishments of the past which involved people being hanged, drawn and quartered, transported or physically abused. Neither am I in favour of the sharia laws of the Islamic <Col N="1169" /> fundamentalists which involve beheadings, amputations and other physical assaults. To some extent the restoration of the chain gangs in Alabama is part of this dehumanising approach to criminals but I am in favour of protecting the innocent victims of crime to the greatest extent possible.</P>
    <P>There are those who will argue that it is totally wrong to detain an unconvicted person in custody. That is poppycock and nonsense. Everybody will accept, including the Supreme Court, that it is proper to detain an unconvicted person in custody if there is a danger that that person will not attend for his own trial. From every point of view it is even more proper and should be constitutional to give the courts discretion to detain in custody somebody who on past record is likely, before trial, to commit further offences. It is proper at the discretion of the court to detain in custody pending trial somebody who has been caught red-handed. It is proper, in the interests of society as a whole, that somebody in that situation who may have been involved in some heinous crime of murder, rape or bank robbery and against whom the evidence is overwhelming should be deprived of his liberty pending trial rather than giving him the opportunity of killing, raping or robbing some other innocent victim. If we look at the issue in that light we should consider whether the real crime is to release such offenders back into society on bail where they can commit further such offences with impunity.</P>
    <P>Overall my view on the Fianna Fáil Bill is clear. It is a well meaning but half-hearted effort which will bring no solace to any victim or any improvement of consequence in the current situation. What is needed is a constitutional amendment to restore full discretion to the courts. I have made this demand for years and now repeat it. I am asking the Minister to urge the Law Reform Commission to give this issue top priority and produce its report with the minimum of delay. I am aware of the value of its reports. It traces the <Col N="1170" /> background to an issue and examines the position in other countries. I have no doubt that its report will be of great assistance to those of us who are concerned with the matter in question.</P>
    <P>It seems that we may have a constitutional amendment on divorce next November. Our objective should be to ensure that we have an amendment on bail on the same date. It is only by restoring full discretion to the courts by way of such constitutional amendment that we can begin to resolve the problem.</P>

      <P>I congratulate my party's spokesperson on Justice, Deputy O'Donoghue, for bringing this legislation forward and allowing us an opportunity of having a detailed and through debate on the issue of bail. The fact that it is necessary to bring forward this legislation is evidence of the growing concern at the continuing problems of crime and lawlessness. The Bill gives us an opportunity to examine our bail laws. As has been pointed out by a number of contributors, there is great disquiet at present regarding the operation of the bail laws. Recent incidences, particularly attacks on members of the Garda Síochána, are very disturbing and show a ruthlessness on the part of the criminal fraternity who are obviously intent on thwarting the system of law and order. We should be concerned at this emerging trend.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The weekend attack on the home of a member of the Garda had ominous undertones and indicates the lengths to which the criminal fraternity will go to thwart the law. It indicates a willingness on the part of the criminal to confront the institutions that preserve and protect democracy. It is against that background we are having this debate, and the Government should listen to the <Col N="1171" /> views and concerns expressed in this House and outside it about the current state of law and order.</P>
    <P>State institutions are under threat and there appears to be no legisative response from the Government&mdash;the Tánaiste was questioned about this matter in the House today. A number of issues need to be considered. The Juvenile Justice Bill, which I called for when my party was in Government, must be introduced without delay. As I understand it a great deal of work has been done on this legislation and I hope it will be brought before the House as soon as possible. Legislation to deal with drug barons should also be expedited. A great proportion of crime can be attributed to the operations of drug barons and legislation is clearly required to deal with this problem.</P>
    <P>The public demands action from the Government to ensure the criminal element in society faces the full rigours of the law. High standards in terms of law and order are essential. As the trends in crime are changing and becoming more complex, society must be prepared to accept changes which will enable us tackle this growing problem. I think most reasonable people would be prepared to accept a change in the bail laws as recommended in this Bill. People know that the hands of the Garda and the Judiciary need to be strengthened. At present they are fighting the rising crime wave with one hand tied behind their backs, which is unacceptable.</P>
    <P>A matter of particular interest to me is juvenile crime. It has been shown that the involvement of juveniles in crime is increasing and is prevalent particularly in built-up areas. A whole range of issues must be tackled in this regard including homelessness, drug trafficking, under-age drinking, vandalism, car robbery and so on. We need to strengthen the hands of the Garda and the Judiciary either through the Juvenile Justice Bill or proposals such as those put forward in this Bill.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1172" /> If one reads tonight's <i>Evening Herald</i> one will see several references to crime. For example, the front page reports on the Garda seizure of £3.6 million worth of illegal drugs in the Shannon region. Those of us who have been following the issue of the importation of illegal substances and the professionals engaged in the fight against such importation will know that drug seizures make up a very small portion of the total amount of drugs imported&mdash;it has been suggested that seizures account for as little as 10 per cent of all drugs imported. That gives an idea of the volume of illegal substances imported.</P>
    <P>The <i>Evening Herald</i>also reports on the sad story of a woman in a Dublin suburb who refers to her life of hell in her home. As a result of taking part in a neighbourhood watch scheme which cooperates with the Garda in the fight against crime at local community level, she and her family are paying a very high price. They and many families like them are forced out of their homes while the alleged perpetrators are allowed to go free. The report suggests that there is a shortage of gardaí in Dublin which hinders the force in its fight against crime.</P>
    <P>Another report in the <i>Evening Herald</i> states that private security men are policing a meeting of the Garda in Galway. I wonder why the protectors of law and order find it necessary to employ a private security firm to guard their meeting. There are serious questions to be answered in this regard.</P>
    <P>A point that will be of interest to the Minister of State, Deputy Currie, who, like me, represents an urban area, is the two hour bus stoppage. Bus drivers have been forced to operate a two hour stoppage due to vandalism on buses. All these issues of crime need to be tackled.</P>
    <P>Great annoyance is caused in communities when individuals brought before the courts are granted bail and allowed mingle with the people against whom they have allegedly perpetrated crime. That is a serious matter of contention, particularly in urban areas. The proposals in the Bill dealing with <Col N="1173" /> restricting individuals on bail are important in the fight against crime. Those proposals give an important support to the Garda and impose conditions which of themselves, though not very punitive, strengthen the hands of the Garda and the courts while dealing with individuals on bail. Because of changing trends and the complexities of criminal activity we must be prepared to sacrifice some of our hard won freedoms if we are to support the institutions and bodies whose responsibility it is to provide law and order and to protect society. If we fail the individuals and organisations in that task, as a Legislature we will let society down and we should not do that. The Government should seriously consider and accept Deputy O'Donoghue's Bill. When we in Fianna Fáil were in Government we took a number of imaginative decisions and accepted legislation from the Opposition. We created history for one Deputy by the number of Private Members' Bills we accepted. There is a <i>quid pro quo</i>in that regard. If we are serious about tackling crime and the Government is serious about working with all sections of the House, it would do well to accept Deputy O'Donoghue's Bill, recognising that ultimately it may be necessary to hold a constitutional referendum on the wider substantive issue. Deputy O'Donoghue's Bill tackles specific and individual facets of bail and it should be possible for the Government to accept this good legislation and support us in our fight against crime.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanKenneally" hpid="Mr. Kenneally Mr. Kenneally">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenneally</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, welcome the introduction of the Bill which is a positive measure and a genuine attempt by the Fianna Fáil Party to come to terms with the ludicrous operation of our bail laws. The Minister made a public promise that there would be a referendum on bail in the autumn. I was dismayed that the Minister retracted that promise, presumably because she could not deliver on it. It is sad if elderly people trembling behind locked doors, and other <Col N="1174" /> members of the public, will not be protected as is their right because the coalition partners cannot agree among themselves.</P>
      <P>It is my belief and that of my party that a person is innocent until proven guilty and there must be pressing arguments and convincing evidence before departing from that widely held and basic tenet. However, we must also serve the wider population and look to their physical welfare and the safety of their property&mdash;two freedoms also guaranteed by the Constitution. It is the task of effectively marrying all those concepts which faces us and this measure is a genuine attempt to do that. We should not remove a person's freedom entirely, not even someone who has been charged with a serious crime, but where a <i>prima facie</i>case has been established and there are reasonable grounds and compelling evidence to show that the person may be guilty of a serious crime, we should reasonably limit that person's freedom to whatever degree is necessary to protect society. Some people will say that most crimes committed by people while on bail are committed by drug addicts who need to steal to feed their drug habit, but ordinary criminals use the Constitution to make their lives of crimes easier and to escape punishment for their succession of crimes. Once charged with a crime, which will probably earn them a custodial sentence, they stash away a nest egg which will see their dependants through while they are in prison. One might ask why is it necessary to introduce this legislation? It appears from the Government's foot dragging on this issue, it is unwilling to bite the bullet and it has drawn back from promised action. However, something must be done to recover the ground taken over by the criminal element and those with expensive drug habits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many people commit further offences while on bail. The Director of Public Prosecutions has brought a number of test cases before the courts seeking to challenge our restrictive bail laws. The <Col N="1175" /> courts have decided that constitutionally, there is no basis on which bail can be refused on a probability that an accused, if allowed out on bail, would commit further offences. Bail is currently a right to which every citizen is entitled on the precept that all are presumed to be innocent until they are proven beyond a reasonable doubt to be guilty, but even within the scope of existing interpretation there is room for statutory improvement.</P>
    <P>The criteria for refusing bail do not seem to be argued with sufficient vigour before our courts. The Supreme Court accepts that when a charge is serious, is likely to carry a heavy sentence and is supported by cogent evidence, such as a confession or being caught red-handed, the accused should be refused bail. Notwithstanding that, in many such cases bail is granted. In other words, those elements of our bail laws which would allow equality for the prosecution and which have been constitutionally accepted with regard to the rights of the accused are not being applied. The criteria to which I referred should be applied with greater vigour by our courts and arguments for the refusal of bail should be given more weight than they are at present. This legislation spells out in great detail what can be applied by the courts and makes it a good deal easier for the courts to apply stringent conditions to any bail allowed.</P>
    <P>Much of the reoffending at present is drug related. It has been suggested that up to 80 per cent of defendants out on bail who reoffend do so in drug related incidents. Unfortunately, this is no longer a Dublin phenomenon, it has spread to every city and town. Small villages are now becoming contaminated in that way. A recent report indicated that ecstasy tablets can now be purchased for as little as £3 each. That is obviously to generate a demand and they will not stay at that price forever.</P>
    <P>It is claimed that more money spent on providing practical services for drug abusers will not only lead to their being rehabilitated, but will lower the crime <Col N="1176" /> rate generally and the rate of crime committed while accused persons are on bail. We must also seek to stop offenders from reoffending by putting greater responsibility on bailspeople for the actions of the people for whom they stand bail. It would be wrong, however, to assume that only criminals involved in drugs activity reoffend and make use of our liberal interpretation of bail laws. Ordinary criminals are also taking advantage of the loopholes. They have made a mockery of our bail laws which have become a joke and contribute to our revolving door system of law and order which has been allowed to flourish for far too long. The people whose activity I would like to see curtailed are those who commit crime in their full senses. I am concerned that the view is too often taken that every effort should be made to ensure that the civil liberties of the accused are not infringed and we are almost apologetic for having arrested them in the first instance. Too little attention is paid to the rights of the victim which should be paramount and any improvements in our law should be to protect them, not the accused.</P>
    <P>I particularly welcome section 6 which allows any member of An Garda Síochána who, with reasonable grounds, believes an accused to be in breach of any term of the order admitting him to bail may, without warrant, arrest the accused person and bring him before the court to which the case has been remanded as soon as is reasonably practicable. That is not just desirable, it is common sense. If the Minister was honest she would agree it is long overdue. In maintaining any type of criminal law system where people are accused of serious crimes it must be accepted that life for them is not similar to that of the ordinary citizen. Their freedom must be curtailed and society must accept that. A genuine attempt to speed up the work of the courts would help to limit disruption for the accused. In the meantime if the accused has to suffer a curtailment of his or her freedom, that is for the greater good and must be accepted.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1177" /> Gardaí have been frustrated for far too long in trying to carry out their duties and often consider it is not worth their while bringing a case to court as they know the accused will not be taken into custody, will not have rigid bail conditions set down and when he or she reoffends a mechanism is not in place to adequately deal with the problem. This legislation supports the Garda and we have to be seen to support them in their work. An effective Garda force, a practical code of criminal law and a logical approach to bail and freedom are all part of what make life bearable for people, particularly those in urban areas. I repeat, I do not advocate the elimination of constitutional freedoms but the majority of people who walk our streets, drive throughout our cities and towns, who must triple-lock their doors at night, also have constitutional rights and need to be protected from individual criminals and gangs.</P>
    <P>Section 5 (2) (a), (b) and (c) deal with a court order establishing the daily whereabouts of an accused person. That is not unreasonable or great hardship on an accused and should allow Garda time to be better invested elsewhere.</P>
    <P>There was a recent media debate in which a Member suggested that any young person charged with a serious offence should be ordered by the court to be home by a given time each evening, which was scoffed at on morning chat shows. Yet, it is a basic fact that if a young person is at home in the evening, under parental supervision, as ordered by the court, he or she cannot be out committing offences such as stealing somebody's car or robbing a local shop. While it may constitute some curtailment of freedom, it is common sense. Even that suggestion was challenged aggressively by the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children. People must be made accountable for their actions and parents must be responsible for their children; that is what good parenthood is all about and if it entails a court order to enforce it, so be it. That aspect of the problem is dealt with in section 5 (2) (h).</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1178" /> To put into perspective an adult problem, any effective garda will know the three &lsquo;Hs&rdquo;; that is, the hoors, haunts and habits of those persons known or suspected of having committed a crime, in respect of which the thrust of the provisions of section 5 (2) will help them in locating a person on bail.</P>
    <P>For the first time the provisions of this Bill constitute a realistic set of proposals to come to terms with the problems of crimes committed by people on bail. The present position brings our system of justice into disrepute. It is not surprising the electorate are frustrated when hardened criminals and others commit dozens of additional crimes while on bail. We need to reassure the public and take realistic steps to tackle the problem and this Bill constitutes a genuine attempt to do so. I ask the Minister to take its provisions on board, they are long overdue, the public seek them and have a right to see them enacted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have an opportunity of contributing to the debate on this Bill introduced by Deputy O'Donoghue.</P>
      <P>On rereading the Minister's contribution last week, I found she agreed with Deputy O'Donoghue in many respects. While she was not very critical of the Bill she could not see her way to accept it. She gave statistics of crimes committed by people on bail which clearly demonstrated that they have risen dramatically in recent years, thus identifying the enormity of the problem. In addition, she referred to the conditions under which our courts can refuse to grant bail. Nonetheless, she appeared to suggest that, as the provisions of this Bill would not solve all the problems, she could not accept it, contending that she and her Department were engaging in a comprehensive review of all aspects of our justice system which, when completed, would enable them to introduce an appropriate Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remind the Minister that is not the reality in today's world, it is a case of <Col N="1179" /> endeavouring to remedy the weakest link in the chain at any given time. In the real world, this or no other one Bill will solve all our problems. However, we must avail of such opportunities as present themselves in endeavouring to solve some, even if they are the weakest links in the chain.</P>
    <P>I do not doubt the Minister's commitment&mdash;in her statement some weeks ago&mdash;to tackling the problem. Unfortunately, it appeared she was not speaking on behalf of the entire Cabinet and was quickly criticised by some of her colleagues. That did not surprise me, as some Members of political parties while adopting an anti-crime posture at times appear to express greater sympathy for those who commit such crimes than for their victims. I am referring in particular to a couple of Members of the Labour Party to whom I am used to listening here and with whom I serve on Dublin City Council. I think Deputy Joe Costello is one and, at city council level, Deputy Roisín Shorthall in the same category. I regard them almost as the &ldquo;soft on crime&rdquo; wing of the Labour Party.</P>
    <P>We cannot send out confused messages to the public. We must speak with one voice, be determined and let criminals know we will not refrain from taking tough action against them. While on different issues I suppose we all tend to be locked into &ldquo;time warps&rdquo;, on law and order issues a few Members are locked into a 1970s attitude, when they probably perceived themselves as having been the radical students of that era. While they may have had reason to be unhappy, at that point we had the heavy gang&mdash;within the term of office of a previous Fine Gael-Labour Coalition Government&mdash;such people, having cast aside their radical student days, are now members of one of the parties against which they rebelled at that time.</P>
    <P>We cannot object to crime while, when enacting laws to combat it, we become totally hung up on individual rights and liberties. The crucial question <Col N="1180" /> is whether the maximisation of individual rights and liberties is commensurate with the common good. We must focus on the matter rather than on the individual rights of any potential criminal.</P>
    <P>I was surprised to hear on a radio programme last evening that the magazine or newspaper owned by the chairman of a semi-State body&mdash;I think it was the Independent Radio and Television Commission&mdash;appeared to conduct a campaign for the legislation of certain drugs. At a time when board members of certain semi-State bodies are threatened with removal from office because of their affiliations with the Fianna Fáil Party, perhaps because some civil servants may have been critical of them or whatever, I find it extraordinary that an acknowledged ministerial adviser&mdash; probably a very good one in many respects&mdash;should conduct a campaign for the legislation of drugs while we here continue to discuss that basic problem. One wonders whether this gentleman would avail of our airwaves to continue to push that campaign.</P>
    <P>I reiterate that we must speak with one voice, demonstrate that we are tough, mean what we say and are prepared to tackle the problem. Crime has gone through the roof over the past two decades or more. One could advance many excuses; for example, that Governments and the Garda at many times in the past 25 years were more concerned or preoccupied with the security position in Northern Ireland. It it is about time we looked to the protection of our citizens in the South, in many respects the weak and vulnerable. While the type of large dramatic £2 million robbery always hits newspaper headlines, it is the type of petty crime committed at the street corner against a senior citizen, perhaps somebody going to collect a pension or shopping, almost rubbished by some as merely constituting petty crime, that really instils terror in our citizens.</P>
    <P>Now that the security position has changed I hope politicians can together address this problem in a meaningful way and give society its basic right to <Col N="1181" /> protection. I am disappointed the Minister did not accept this Bill. While it does not give all the answers, she agreed it gives some. I hope she adheres to her promise that if constitutional change is required she will provide for it next November.</P>

      <P>On researching the Bill I realised it deals with a very narrow area of crime and that the debate would be repetitious and wander into other areas. However, I did not expect to be brought down memory lane to the 1970s by Deputy Ahern. I do not recall Deputy Ahern being very loud about the injustices committed against innocent as well as convicted people then. It is amazing how in an effort to promote an argument people use, and in this case abuse, history. Members of Fianna Fáil at that time did not protest about people being held for too long or about people being abused while in custody. I am shocked that Deputy Ahern knew so much about this.</P>
      <P>In proposing how to deal with people who have committed crimes or whom we suspect of committing crimes, we should examine Deputy O'Donoghue's Bill in the context of its effects on for instance people from Caherciveen, a small community with which I am very familiar. To all intents and purposes, the measures proposed would involve virtual house arrest. The Garda would have the right to arrest people out on bail without warrant and have them brought before the nearest court. I could not imagine that happening in practice. Nor could I imagine the Garda knowing the exact movements 24 hours a day of those out on bail. Deputy Ahern referred to the drain on security forces in the context of Northern Ireland. Where would we get the necessary resources or gardaí to virtually live with a person while out on bail?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1182" /> We appear to have quickly forgotten the position &mdash; only recently sorted out &mdash;of the Guildford Four and the Birmingham Six. In those cases, it was a question of &ldquo;guilty and we will prove you guilty&rdquo; as opposed to the proper system of justice which prevails here. If at any stage I am confronted with the system of justice about which I speak, I hope I will have the protection of our Constitution.</P>
    <P>We do not have figures for white collar crime. Even if such people were caught, this Bill would not apply to them because, after all, they are gentlemen and would have committed the crimes in the interest of their lifestyles. As the Bill will relate only to those who commit petty crime and who cannot afford lawyers to attend a bail hearing, the matter must be given careful consideration. When the Criminal Justice Act, 1984 was introduced figures for crime committed by people out on bail reduced and although they have increased again they have not reached the level recorded prior to the introduction of that Act. Last year the figure, at 4,416, was half that recorded before the introduction of the 1984 Act.</P>
    <P>We are not tackling the problem correctly. The former Minister for Justice, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, estimated that a more stringent bail regime would necessitate the provision of 600 additional prison places at an estimated capital cost of approximately £80 million with annual running costs of £20 million. That is a very conservative estimate because, if only half those who were given bail in the first six months of last year were held in custody, a total of 1,000 additional places would have been required with the inherent capital and annual running costs. Are we really prepared to take the matter seriously and expend such a large amount of public money and energy on a system to keep offenders off the street?</P>
    <P>Would innocent people have a right to compensation for being kept in jail? Are we to go down the road of the French where a person can be interned for up to four years while awaiting trial? <Col N="1183" /> The main issue in all of this relates to the trial. While there have been improvements in recent years because of the efforts of the previous Government, there are still large waiting lists in our courts system. Should people who have to wait up to two years to have their cases heard in court be kept in jail in the meantime? How could that be justified if they are innocent? Should we not examine the causes of crime?</P>
    <P>It is extraordinary that every time the crime rate increases we examine ways of punishing the criminal rather than ways of treating the victim. Why have we not initiated a witness protection programme? Why should people give evidence against hooligans and thugs without being afforded protection? Cases were instanced today of people living in terror in their homes. Why are we not looking after those who support us? We should look at the causes of crime and consider having better rehabilitation programmes. Surely that is where the answer lies but there were huge cutbacks in education funding for prisons in recent years.</P>
    <P>Anyone who witnessed the recent events in relation to drug-related crimes would have to admit that drugs are having a major impact on society and are the cause of crime. Drug-related crime is usually vicious because of the extremes to which people are prepared to go to fund their habit. The question of bail and where we would put the people to whom we refuse bail must be very carefully considered. In recent weeks, Fianna Fáil made statements to the effect that this Government intends to engage in reckless spending and will lose control of the public purse, yet it produces a Bill such as this. Money should not be a barrier when it comes to protecting people or providing places of detention for criminals but this Bill does not provide the answer.</P>
    <P>If we had spent as much time discussing the causes of crime, as we have in discussing bail, we would probably have achieved something in the last decade. We would not now be discussing <Col N="1184" /> bail as it was discussed in 1984 in virtually the same circumstances. Bail only becomes an issue at the end of the criminal cycle. Unless we implement effective intervention mechanisms and speed up our pre-trial procedures, we will simply end up providing more prison places and putting more restrictions on individual liberties without having addressed the central issue, namely, crime prevention.</P>

      <P>During his contribution Deputy Ahern asked that we consider speaking with one voice. If we were to follow that logic, we would get into a dangerous area where dissent would not be allowed. It is important that we maintain the tradition of examining every legislative measure governing the way we live. If we speak with one voice we might develop a regime such as that which existed in Germany in the past. I am not suggesting that Deputy Ahern would advocate that type of regime, but that is the danger that faces us if we do not question and debate issues that are of great importance to us. Bail provides for a fundamental right of liberty and to deprive people of that is a serious matter and should be considered so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are being asked to respond to a serious challenge to law and order. The natural reaction is to do whatever is necessary to deal with the people perpetrating serious crimes. However, we must also consider the consequences for everybody who appears before the courts because when we legislate, we legislate for everybody. Unfortunately, when we cast the net into the sea we catch many things that we never expected. If the mesh is too small, we are sorry afterwards for having taken things we did not want. There is a danger that we might bring people into the judicial system who were never intended to be brought before the courts and, as Deputy Lynch so eloquently put it, what do we do with people who are found not guilty following trial? They may have been locked up for some time and deprived of bail. <Col N="1185" /> We must consider whether such a person has the right to bring proceedings against the State for wrongful incarceration. Changing the rules in regard to bail is not just a simple process of bringing forward a Bill, although there is a need to deal with the problem.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately the scales of justice have tipped in favour of the criminal, particularly the drug barons and those who commit crime to feed their habit by using the weaknesses in the system. That is a serious matter which must be addressed. The majority of people who commit crime while on bail are drug addicts awaiting trial. They continue to commit crime to feed their habit. The denial of bail in such cases should be seriously considered because it may help to break the cycle of crime.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lynch also referred to the numbers of people who commit crime while on bail. The number increased from 2,494 in 1990 to 4,416 last year. That is a substantial increase and we must consider what we can do about it. Many gardaí who work hard to bring people to justice become very frustrated when they see them walk free from the courts to immediately engage in criminal activity. With great difficulty the Garda obtain as much evidence as possible to bring people to court only to find they are released on bail thereby allowing them to commit further crimes against society.</P>
    <P>The items we must consider where bail is permitted, fall under two headings. Bail can be restricted where there is a danger that the accused will not attend court for trial. That is a reasonable proposition because if there is not a mechanism to ensure that people face the courts, our judicial system has failed. Bail can also be refused if there is a danger that the accused will interfere with witnesses or jurors. This is another serious matter as it could prevent the justice system from bringing the perpetrators of crime before the courts and sentencing them to an appropriate penalty.</P>
    <P>Obviously the Constitution must be looked at when we consider changing <Col N="1186" /> these rules. If we intend to change the Constitution, we must examine the wording carefully because in the past we found that reactive thinking produced complicated wording and prevented people taking appropriate measures in relation to this and many other subjects.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister's statement that we should await the report of the Law Reform Commission which will provide valuable information we should take into account when making decisions on the question of bail. The policy document, programme for <i>A Government of Renewal</i>, provides for examination by the Law Reform Commission of the subject and allows the courts to refuse bail when they consider it desirable to do so. The Minister is currently awaiting this report.</P>
    <P>The Minister also indicated to the House that her officials are examining a suitable form of wording for the amendment to the Constitution. I hope this will not take too long. Unfortunately criminals are usurping the privilege that people are innocent until proven guilty. It is serious when the home of a Garda Síochána, a member of the force that defends society, is attacked by criminals, people who have nothing but the destruction of society, as we know it, as their aim. This form of intimidation of the Garda Síochána, and in this case the senior member of the force on the case, is reprehensible. This House would do well to mark that and reassure the Garda Síochána that whatever can be done to bring these people to justice will be done.</P>
    <P>A number of other points should be considered when discussing bail. We are making the assumption that all criminals should be sent to jail. On many occasions we have considered the possiblity of introducing other measures such as community service orders, curfews and other forms of attachment such as financial penalties. These are important measures when considering the problem of habitual offenders or those who commit crime while on bail. We should ask what is the best form of <Col N="1187" /> punishment for the crime, being deprived of liberty or some other punishment. There is a simple answer. I assume the courts are adequately empowered to deal with all aspects of crime.</P>
    <P>It is easy to say that people must face the judicial system and suffer the penalties imposed on them without any regard to the controls that should be in place by parents. In many cases, young people who are not of an age to be brought before the court in their own right are brought before the juvenile courts. They are involved in joyriding, intimidation, serious house break-ins, robbery, thieving and so on. Many of the difficulties communities are experiencing could be addressed by severe penalties and restrictions on the households of the young criminals. We should try to design a system that recognises the good in people and consider those elements when deciding penalties for the crime.</P>
    <P>There are problems in every Dublin constituency and recently in the Cork area we witnessed an outbreak of crime that one could not possibly have envisaged. The media is now considered a suitable target. Drug barons seek to intimidate the media and make them report crime in a particular way. This is a sinister step and unless we take dramatic action against drug barons the very fabric of our democracy could be endangered. They have powerful weapons at their disposal, large sums of money, international networking and unlimited control in the area of weapons and easy prey. Young people who have been exploited by drug barons behave like zombies when hooked on drugs and will do anything for them. There is a serious danger to democracy and we should put every possible means to deal with the drug problem at the disposal of the Garda Síochána. The Select Committee on Security and Legislation formed a sub-committee to deal with the drug crisis. Members hope that the sub-committee will put people on notice that we are determined to co-ordinate <Col N="1188" /> efforts to put an end to this serious problem.</P>
    <P>We appreciate the various services dealing with this crime wave. The Naval Service has been successful in bringing to light large quantities of drugs being dropped at sea, the diligence of the customs service at airports and sea ports has uncovered large quantities of drugs being brought into the country and the gardaí hunt for places where drugs are stashed away for distribution. We need to give a signal that we support the operation of the security forces. A coordinated approach will enable more information to flow between the three services and we need to give them what is required to deal with this problem.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the people involved in community watch, they are brave enough to come forward with information and supply the gardaí with important intelligence. They are very seldom identified and operate quietly in the community. They pass on small pieces of information to the gardaí, often not knowing the significance of the information. This is an important resource and we should use it well. We should ensure that they continue this work that enables the system to work effectively and protects us from the criminal elements.</P>

      <P>I commend Deputy O'Donoghue on introducing this Bill which is a major contribution at two levels, first in addressing the issue of bail which the Minister for Justice handled disastrously. Without adequate preparation or even the courtesy of seeking the opinion of her Cabinet colleagues she promised to hold a referendum on the issue of bail but not long afterwards she realised the blunder and since then she has tended to remain silent on the issue. I hope this is not indicative of her actions behind the scenes. We are all <Col N="1189" /> well aware that in town and country the incidence of crime committed by people on bail has risen sharply in recent years. It is abundantly clear that the bail laws need to be tightened. However, a balance must be struck between the rights of the individual to personal civil liberty and the need to protect society from criminals. I agree with Deputy O'Donoghue that the best way of doing this within the present constitutional parameters is to give the court discretion to attach a wide variety of conditions to an order granting bail. This would have the effect of putting bail conditions on a statutory basis which the courts could apply to habitual criminals. The conditions include the power to exclude the accused person from a particular area, make a curfew order and forfeit the sum pledged by the bailsperson if the accused commits a crime while on bail.</P>
      <P>It is evident that most crime is committed by people who are addicted to controlled substances. In the Dublin city area it is estimated that they are responsible for upwards of 80 per cent of crime. I do not know the figure for Cork but there is an increase in crime committed by people involved with drugs. It is sad to see society developing in that way. As we know, those addicted to drugs do not take the consequences of their actions into consideration. They will do anything to get the next fix. Doctors who treat these people say they are not responsible for their actions when they are addicted to substances such as heroin. We must try to limit the opportunities for people who are likely to commit offences if they are on bail and one way of doing so is to have stricter bail laws.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill provides for the court to require an accused person to keep the peace, be of good behaviour and abstain from any form of criminal activity including the commission of an offence under section 3 of the Misuse of Drugs Acts, 1977 to 1984, for the duration of the recognisance. The Bill also empowers the court to require an accused person to attend a designated location on specified days and times for <Col N="1190" /> the purpose of providing a urine sample which may be analysed to ascertain if the accused is in breach of the aforementioned by consuming a controlled drug other than one prescribed by a medical practitioner as part of a recognised drug treatment programme. However, tests should also be carried out at unspecified times and at unspecified locations.</P>
    <P>Where an order is made in relation to drug offenders the court will be obliged to inform the accused person of the location of the nearest centre for drug addiction treatment and direct that an appointment be made for the person, if requested. If there is a breach of any of the conditions imposed by the court on granting bail, it will be empowered, subject to certain conditions, to retain all or part of the sum pledged by the bailsperson. This provision should be acted on as there is no point in setting down conditions unless they are adhered to. The law dealing with bailspersons would be further tightened by this Bill to ensure not alone the sufficiency of the bailsperson but also his ability and commitment to ensure that the accused will comply with the terms of the bail order.</P>
    <P>It is important to protect the presumption of innocence that underpins the judicial system and the right to liberty but it is also necessary to protect society from criminals determined to commit crime on bail while awaiting trial. The Bill is aimed at preventing well known criminals who have been apprehended and brought before the court being immediately released pending trial. The present law is based on a Supreme Court judgment in 1966 but the level and nature of crime today has altered considerably since then. So much crime is now drug related and the fact that addicts awaiting trial are frequently at liberty gives cause for serious concern when experience tells us that not only are they likely to commit crime while on bail but are almost certain to do so.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donoghue framed the legislation within the present constitutional parameters and the change to <Col N="1191" /> provide that bail could be refused on the basis of the likelihood that further offences would be committed would require an amendment to the Constitution. The Minister for Justice, Deputy Owen, gave a public promise that a referendum would be held on bail in the autumn but she failed to receive the public backing of either the Taoiseach or Tánaiste. Her commitment to a referendum rang hollow against the background of the failure to attempt to introduce legislation within the constitutional parameters. She has engaged in political foot dragging, prevarication and indecision. They are of little comfort to the victims of crime which is escalating day by day.</P>
    <P>The Government is in front of everything and behind nothing. It is talking but not acting. It is time to do something rather than say on radio and television what it will do. In Cork and around the coast drugs worth millions are confiscated. In addition to changing the bail laws we must extend the power of the Navy. The Naval Service needs new boats and facilities if it is to control entry to Ireland via the coast. The Navy is doing tremendous work under the strictures imposed on it. The Government should get its act together and give the necessary powers to the Naval Service and customs officers working on the south coast to allow them continue the fight against the importation of drugs. Otherwise there will be a continued growth in the sale and use of drugs and Ireland will be used as a gateway to Britain or the Continent.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House and hope the Minister will take it on board and ensure that it is enacted immediately.</P>

      <P>He was. The statistics prove that we are now living in bandit land. Our children live in fear, old people, particularly those living in rural areas, are terrified in their homes at night and ordinary citizens are apprehensive about walking the streets of our cities. We seem to have enshrined in our Constitution and legislation protection for individuals accused of crime. It is important to protect the rights of these individuals on the basis that they are innocent until proven guilty but in doing so we seem to have forgotten about the rights of the victims of crime. This Bill seeks to address this problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's inaction and her inability to appear on the &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme has sent the wrong message to ordinary people and the perpetrators of crime. What are people to think when the Minister states publicly that she intends to hold a referendum on this matter and is then silenced by the lord and master, the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Spring? How can people have confidence in a Government in which there is so much dissension on the basic measures which need to be taken to reduce the level of crime on our streets? There is no cohesive effort being made by the Government to deal with this problem, it has no outspoken and unanimous view on it. The public is well aware of this and that is why this Bill assumes such importance. Since the Government came into office five months ago we have heard nothing but announcements about reviews, hiring specialists and <Col N="1193" /> carrying out research programmes, all of which lead to procrastination rather than the urgently required determined action. In many ways the Government has failed to take a lead in the fight against crime, to implement proposals, to take initiatives or put together any cohesive policy. It is important to now call on it to ensure that this determined action is taken from here on in.</P>
    <P>The Garda Síochána are very frustrated at their lack of power to apprehend criminals and have them convicted. In many ways tá siad ag snámh in aghaidh easa. They are asking what is going on and why they are not given the necessary resources and manpower. There is nothing worse for the Garda Síochána than to see people with previous convictions being let out on bail during which they will continue their life of crime.</P>
    <P>Before referring to the necessity to change our bail laws, I wish to refer to the extremely serious problems in the court system in Cork. It is now estimated that 90 per cent of criminal cases in Cork are transferred to Dublin. The automatic right of people to apply to have their cases transferred to Dublin is causing untold problems and delays. Today a Circuit Court judge in Cork received nine applications for the immediate transfer of cases to Dublin, thereby creating a logjam in the Dublin courts and leading to the schedule for the Cork courts not being completed. The Circuit Court sits in Cork from 7-17 February, 9-12 May, 13-20 June and 31 October to 10 November. Even though there is a long waiting list in Cork only a certain number of cases are scheduled for each court sitting. The whole administration of justice in Cork is disrupted by the automatic transfer of these cases to the Dublin Circuit Court. My information is that because of what is happening, with the automatic right of transfer of cases from Cork to Dublin, there is a delay in Dublin from 18 months to two years. What happens during that period while people are out on bail? There is substantial evidence to <Col N="1194" /> suggest a tie-up between people on bail and their continuing to commit crime.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, as you well know as a representative of the people of South Tipperary, Tramore is one of our premier seaside resorts but it has a totally inadequate and antiquated sewerage system. I ask that positive steps be taken immediately to rectify a very unsatisfactory situation. A new scheme has been planned for a number of years, the first tranche of Structural Funds has been passed and vouched for but the scheme in Tramore has not proceeded. I want to ensure it proceeds within the scope of the second tranche of Structural or Cohesion Funds. The position is intolerable and we cannot put the future of the resort in jeopardy because of an inadequate sewerage scheme.</P>
      <P>There have been some points of dispute and two main structures are involved. The first is the sewerage treatment plant which is to be located in Riverstown close to a county council housing estate. The residents in that area feel aggrieved that such a plant should be sited so close to a built up area and one can easily understand their fears. I suggest the Department of the Environment site this treatment plant elsewhere in the back strand area, somewhere in the vicinity of the town dump and away from a built up area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second, and probably more contentious problem, is the location of the outfall pipe. The initial plan from the Department of the Environment indicated that this was to be at an area in the back strand quite close to the Saleen beach. This has proven to be totally unacceptable to local residents who see that a very valuable amenity could be <Col N="1195" /> destroyed if the sewage discharge pipe were located there. They have proposed an alternative method of disposal, the extension of the existing outfall pipe or the replacement in the same location by a much longer pipe for disposal of the treated sewage at the same location. That does not appear an unreasonable request.</P>
    <P>Apparently there is considerable friction between senior technical people in the Department of the Marine and the Department of the Environment concerning the location of the discharge pipe. There is a belief that the whole scheme may be held up because of the conflict between the two Departments. I want that conflict sorted out and the scheme to proceed with the outfall pipe going out to sea near the location of the existing outfall pipe.</P>
    <P>If the points of dispute are not settled then the scheme cannot progress. I suggest the Department of the Marine's scheme be accepted and that Tramore can have a sewerage scheme which will be of the highest standard and will replace the totally unacceptable antiquated system.</P>

      <P>Like you, a Cheann Comhairle, and Deputy Deasy I am a frequent visitor to Tramore and I always take delight in its attractions. I am pleased to address the problem raised by Deputy Deasy. The Minister for the Environment, Deputy Howlin, is aware of the need for an improved sewage treatment facility for Tramore, which depends very heavily on tourism; the existing system which involves the discharge of untreated sewage to the sea through a short sea outfall off the main beach is clearly unsatisfactory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In developing proposals for a new scheme to serve the town, Waterford County Council was conscious of the need to protect the quality of the main strand, which is of vital importance to the town. My Department approved the <Col N="1196" /> preliminary report for the project in January 1993, after the then Minister had certified an environmental impact statement subject to certain modifications. These modifications relate to the relocation of the sludge dewatering building, the incorporation of odour controls and relocation of the stage I treatment unit.</P>
    <P>Some difficulties concerning the location of the sea outfall have arisen in connection with Waterford County Council's application for a licence under the Foreshore Act, 1933. It may be helpful, therefore, if I provide some brief background information on this aspect of the proposal.</P>
    <P>Three outfall options from the proposed treatment works were considered by the council and their consultants in the design phase of the scheme. All three options were subjected to extensive investigation including effluent dispersal, modelling and marine surveys. An intermittent discharge outfall at Rinnashark was recommended. The environmental impact statement concluded that this outfall, subject to meeting certain conditions, was environmenttally acceptable. The Department of the Marine, in response to the foreshore licence application from Waterford County Council, has expressed a preference for an alternative location for the outfall pipe together with a long sea outfall. This would, however, add considerably to the capital costs of the scheme.</P>
    <P>Attempts to resolve this issue are continuing. In the meantime, planning of the treatment works element of the scheme is being advanced. The overall work is not dependent on the decision regarding the outfall location. The project has been approved by the European Commission for support from the Cohesion Fund.</P>
    <P>I indicated at the outset that the Minister is aware of the problems in Tramore. The need for a new scheme is accepted and Deputy Deasy can be assured that every effort is being made to advance it.</P>

He was told by the Department that they would not regard family income supplement as something that should be taken into account in this regard, that it was for the purpose of extending the income of people who were, perhaps, caught on the borderline between being on social welfare or on low income, and making it more amenable for people to go out to work rather than sit at home and claim social welfare. However, such people have found that, when they avail of the family income supplement, it is then taken back in some shape or form. The Department of Social Welfare informed my constituent that as far as <Col N="1198" /> they were concerned family income supplement should not be taken into account by State bodies as extra income in the type of assessment I mentioned.</P>
    <P>I recently put down a parliamentary question to the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment to find out how many local authorities are, so to speak, singing from the one hymn sheet, and the answer proves that there are different attitudes on the part of local authorities around the country. Only about 15 county councils, two of which are in my own county, take family income supplement into account while many more county councils, corporations and urban authorities do not. It is incumbent on the Minister responsible to ensure that there is equality as between areas.</P>
    <P>On the same day I put down a parliamentary question to the Minister for Social Welfare asking his attitude to this. He gave me a very nice reply to the effect that family income supplement is designed to provide cash support for families on low income to preserve the incentive to remain in employment. He went on to say that payment is not in general assessed as means against other schemes administered by the Department of Social Welfare. I had a conversation with a former Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Michael Woods, who informed me that after much hassle the health boards around the country agreed that the family income supplement would not be taken into account in assessments for medical cards. However, the word is not getting through to the Department of the Environment and local authorities in the context of differential rents.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Proinsias De Rossa, went on to say that in his view family income supplement should not be assessable as income for the purpose of determining entitlement under the differential rent scheme and that he proposed to take the matter up with his colleague, the Minister for the Environment. This is an urgent matter.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1199" /> The general public are probably not aware that this is happening. Not only are local authorities not singing from the one hymn sheet but Ministers and their Departments are not either. It is incumbent on the Minister for the Environment and the Minister for Social Welfare to work this out once and for all. Obviously I will be asking that family income supplement not be taken into account in the context of the differential rent scheme. If ultimately the assessment for differential rent is to be exclusive of FIS, as I hope will be the case, I ask the Department to investigate the possibility of refunding to those people who have been paying rent up to now on the basis of FIS being included in the assessment the money which was taken from them but which was not taken from other people in areas where the local authority regarded FIS as an incentive to people to remain at work rather than claim social welfare.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Ahern for his comments about my visit to Dundalk. I was delighted to be there to celebrate their victory, even though Cork City was not in the final shake up.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity of outlining the position in relation to rents of local authority dwellings. The determination of the rents of their dwellings, including the types of income to be taken into account in the assessment of the rents, is the responsibility of local authorities as an integral part of their housing management function. When this responsibility was devolved to authorities in 1986, my Department issued guidelines to ensure that the new rent schemes complied with broad principles in the following matters: the rent payable should be related to income and a smaller proportion of income should <Col N="1200" /> be required from low income households; allowances should be made for dependent children; a contribution towards rent should be required from subsidiary earners in the household; and provision should be included for the acceptance of a lower rent than that required under the terms of the scheme in exceptional cases where payment of the normal rent would give rise to hardship.</P>
    <P>Local authorities were also expected to ensure that their overall rental income reflects adequately, in so far as it is practicable to do so, the management and maintenance costs of the estate of houses under their control.</P>
    <P>The Government's programme emphasises its commitment to the strengthening of the role of local authorities and the discharge of as many functions as possible by them consistent with the local government reform programme. It is in keeping with this approach that local authorities have maximum discretion in the discharge of their functions such as the assessment of income and the determination of the rents for their dwellings.</P>
    <P>Within the guidelines I have outlined, authorities have wide discretion as to the types of income to be taken into account in the assessment of rents and how to deal with hardship cases, allowances for dependent children, poverty traps and any other anomalies that arise in individual cases. I should draw attention to the fact that one of the basic principles provides specifically for recognition of family circumstances, by requiring authorities to make allowances for children in a household.</P>
    <P>The guidelines do not specify for local authorities that a family income supplement should or should not be included for the purposes of income assessment for local authority rents. In particular, my Department has not taken a position as to whether or not FIS should be included. That decision rests solely with individual local authorities.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy McManus, is aware of the views of the <Col N="1201" /> Minister for Social Welfare in this matter. She would be slow to take any action which would detract from the autonomy of local authorities in matters such as rent assessment and the management of their housing stock which should manifestly be matters of local responsibility.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for allowing me to raise this matter and the Minister of State for coming in to reply.</P>
      <P>There are 55 Dublin Bus drivers out of work suffering from injuries and trauma caused by violent assaults suffered while providing a public transport service in this city. Every bus driver who takes his or her bus on to the city streets anticipates an attack, whether it be daytime or night-time, because of the increasing frequency of assaults in recent months. There are no safe areas so far as this form of crime is concerned. Syringes, screwdrivers, Stanley knives and lump hammers are some of the weapons used by the attackers whose motive is robbery of the fares collected from passengers travelling on Dublin city bus services. Staff at DART station ticket offices are at risk of similar attacks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These violent attacks can cause serious and often permanent injuries as well as inflict trauma and stress on the bus drivers who have been victims of criminals who carry out these attacks. <Col N="1202" /> Dublin Bus has now contracted the services of a psychologist to counsel staff who have been assault victims to deal with post-traumatic stress. There have also been requests from bus drivers for routine inocculation against hepatitis B given that many of the robberies are drug related.</P>
    <P>Very often these attacks result in restricted bus services which cause great inconvenience to customers of Dublin Bus. It is estimated that these attacks will cost the company in the region of £1.5 million per annum in its wage bill alone, not taking into account the revenue loss because of the robberies, disruption of services and the damage caused to vehicles and property.</P>
    <P>Let me give one example to highlight the recent alarming increase in this type of crime. All the regular bus drivers on the 101 route which operates from Clontarf garage are out of work because of assaults. This route, which also provides a feeder bus service to the DART station at Harmonstown, provides a bus service to Priorswood, Coolock and Beaumont Hospital. It is believed that the same individual is the perpetrator of all these attacks.</P>
    <P>This form of crime is increasing despite the provision by Dublin Bus of protective screens for drivers, deposit safes and the introduction of video cameras and radio control systems on buses. There is a need to promote the sale of prepaid bus tickets through discounted fares as an incentive to reduce the amount of cash carried on buses. Dublin Bus should offer a reward to members of the public who come forward with information leading to the prosecution of persons who perpetrate attacks against bus crews or vehicles.</P>
    <P>There is a clear need for special legislation to deal with anti-social behaviour on all forms of public transport, including trains and the DART. In the recent past new legislation has been promised but it is still awaited. The Garda Síochána should have the power to arrest without warrant those who attack public transport vehicles, the people on board or ticket offices. There is a need for a <Col N="1203" /> transport police unit to concentrate on this spiralling form of crime before it gets out of control. A quick response police unit is necessary to ensure that a public transport system can be provided which is fully geared towards serving the needs of the public.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. Currie) Austin Currie">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. Currie)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter. The issue of attacks on public transport workers is one which is of particular concern to me and the Minister for Justice, Deputy Owen. Less than three months ago, the Minister met senior management of Dublin Bus to discuss their concerns about attacks on bus drivers in the city. In this regard, the Minister was in a position to inform the Dublin Bus representatives that a particular individual who had perpetrated a number of these attacks had been dealt with by the courts and committed to prison. While I appreciate the problem of attacks on bus crews cannot be attributed to one individual, the individual in question was a cause of particular concern to the bus crews working in the west side of the city. As a Deputy for the constituency I had received innumerable complaints about him. The Deputy also referred to an individual.</P>
      <P>I am determined that everything possible must be done to deal with these attacks. The fact that the number of robberies committed on buses declined from 80 in 1993 to 46 in 1994 is to be welcomed. That this drop in the number of robberies has occurred against the background of a general decrease in the total number of offences committed on buses is also to be welcomed. In this regard, I am informed by the Garda authorities that 262 offences were committed on buses in Dublin in 1993. By 1994, this number had declined to 141.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, this decrease in the number of criminal offences committed on buses gives no room for complacency. One attack on a bus crew is one attack too many. People have a basic right to go about their business without being <Col N="1204" /> robbed or assaulted. This is especially the case for those who are providing a public service. There is a special onus on society to ensure that those who provide a public service can do so without fear of attack or intimidation.</P>
    <P>In order to reduce the incidence of such attacks, there are ongoing discussions between Dublin Bus and the Garda Síochána. Areas in the city which have shown the greatest incidence of this type of attack have been especially targeted by the Garda. The measures taken by the Garda, to date, include: intensified patrolling of known trouble spots, with particular attention to late night services, by uniformed gardaí; the designation of a garda inspector in all of the Garda districts within the Dublin metropolitan area with special responsibility for maintaining contact with bus drivers operating in their area and for monitoring and dealing with incidents that occur, and the introduction of a programme of talks by community gardaí to school children. The gardaí, in the course of these talks, highlight the importance of the public transport system to the local community and the consequences of anti-social behaviour.</P>
    <P>In addition to the measures taken by the Garda, I am aware that a series of measures have been taken by Dublin Bus. These measures include the provision of anti-assault screens on all new buses, the use of video equipment on buses for the purpose of surveillance and detection of criminal activity and the provision of radios to enable direct contact between bus drivers and their depots.</P>
    <P>I understand that the unions representing the bus workers have suggested to Dublin Bus a number of additional measures designed to reduce the incidence of these attacks and I look forward to hearing about future developments in this area.</P>
    <P>It is unacceptable that any group of workers should be exposed to such attacks. The Minister and the Garda authorities are determined to continue to do everything within their power to deal effectively with these attacks.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Foxe</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for affording me the opportunity to say a few words on this important topic. The problem about which I will speak arose last Friday week, 30 April. On that date the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry announced that it had suspended the CFP, the control of farmyard pollution scheme. This means, effectively, that no further applications for grants for the erection of buildings will be accepted. There are 16,500 applications on hand throughout the country some of which have been dealt with. In other cases, although schemes had been devised with the assistance of the Farm Development Service there was no one available to type them. Consequently, farmers could not proceed with the work.</P>
      <P>Under the rural environment protection scheme farmers received almost £50 per acre up to a maximum of 100 acres, or approximately £5,000 per year for a five-year period, amounting to £25,000 during that period. In the first year of implementation of the schemes farmers were required to put in place facilities to control farmyard pollution. That meant installing a tank or building a slatted house, involving an investment of perhaps £30,000 or £40,000. Since the scheme under which grants were paid has been suspended, grants will not now be paid in respect of such buildings. I am not sure whether the suspension is a temporary arrangement, but at present farmers cannot proceed with their plans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One might ask why there was such a delay between the time farmers applied under the scheme and a visit from the Farm Development Service officials. The spring of 1995 was very wet and many people suffered severe hardship from flooding. In Roscommon, 340 applications were lodged under the flood relief scheme &mdash; I presume the numbers in other counties affected are similar. That scheme was treated as urgent by the Department, and rightly <Col N="1206" /> so, but as a result the control of farmyard pollution scheme was neglected.</P>
    <P>The position in Roscommon has been compounded by a shortage of clerical staff. In some cases farms were visited and the necessary plans drawn up but there was no clerical staff to deal with the applications. Last September the Department was made aware of the shortage of clerical staff in Roscommon and has been reminded of it on two or three occasions since then, but action was not taken in time. About a fortnight ago, a young lady was appointed to the Roscommon office and she has done tremendous work, but it was a case of closing the door when the horse had almost bolted as the scheme was suspended a few days later, on 30 April. I ask the Minister to ensure that people who applied on or before Friday, 30 April are accepted for the scheme and that the grants are paid.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Deenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Foxe for raising this important matter on the Adjournment. Due to the unprecedented demand from farmers for aid under the control of farm pollution &mdash; CFP &mdash; scheme and in the light of the funding set aside for the scheme under the Structural Funds, my Department was forced to suspend the scheme on the 27 April. From that date no further CFP applications are being accepted until further notice. Similarly, formal approval of existing applicants also ceased on that date.</P>
      <P>Under the on-farm investment section of the Operational Programme for Agriculture, Rural Development and Forestry, an allocation of £195 million was provided for the period 1994-99. Approximately half of this amount was earmarked for the control of farm pollution scheme. My analysis of the on-farm investment schemes shows an under-funding of at least £60 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the launch of the scheme last September until its suspension on 27 April more than 18,500 applications were received. This demand was driven <Col N="1207" /> by the fact that a CFP scheme had not been in operation since April 1992, the need for some participants in the rural environment protection scheme &mdash; REPS &mdash; to have pollution work done under the CFP, the fear that funds would run out and pressures from local authorities and fisheries boards to address pollution problems.</P>
    <P>By 27 April nearly 6,000 of the CFP applications received had been approved to commence work. To make the payments which would flow from these approvals requires the bringing forward into 1996 of some of the moneys previously earmarked for later years. This will need European Commission and Department of Finance approval. I am confident that such approvals will be forthcoming.</P>
    <P>As well as endeavouring to have Structural Funds brought forward from later years, I will also be making a strong case for additional funding under the review of the Community Support Framework &mdash; CSF &mdash; which will be carried out by the Commission next year. If additional funding is secured, it will be possible to reopen the scheme to new applicants.</P>
    <P>I am very concerned about the impact this suspension will have on my efforts to build a modern, environment-friendly agriculture industry. I am, therefore, establishing procedures which would enable as many as possible of the 12,000 <Col N="1208" /> applications currently on hands to proceed with essential work. In this regard I have set up a consultative group involving officials of my Department, farm organistions and other interested parties with a view to establishing priority categories. I envisage giving conditional grant approval in certain circumstances which would enable such applicants to have approved works carried out with a clear commitment that grants will be paid as funds become available. The results of the group's examination of the matter should be available shortly.</P>
    <P>I am very concerned to ensure that the suspension of CFP will have minimal impact on the participation in REPS. REPS participants approved on or before 27 April who have applied for grant aid under CFP will have valid applications approved. Also I will be making stringent efforts with the European Commission in the coming months with a view to relaxing the provision that all pollution control works must be completed within 12 months of entering REPS.</P>
    <P>Many farmers are already substantially in compliance with the pollution control requirements for REPS and more than 30,000 farmers have been grant-aided for pollution control works under previous schemes.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.10 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 10 May 1995.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13, 17 and 26 together.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the carer's allowance is to provide an income maintenance payment to people who are providing elderly or incapacitated pensioners with full-time care and attention and whose income falls below certain limits. I share with the rest of the community a deep appreciation of the vital role played by people who devote their lives to the care of others. I agree that there is potential for further development of this important scheme in line with that objective and as financial resources permit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am pleased to have been able in this year's budget to continue the work undertaken by previous Governments in progressively improving the carer's allowance. This year, the allowance is being extended to include carers of incapacitated pensioners over 66 who are not in receipt of a social welfare pension, for example, those getting an occupational pension. Furthermore, the means test is being significantly eased through an increase from £100 to £150 a week in the amount to be disregarded in respect of working spouses and the application of that disregard to income from all sources. In addition, a free travel companion pass is being provided which may be used by the carer or by another companion which can assist the <Col N="981" /> carer in taking a break. These improvements will cost £1.9 million this year and will bring total spending on the carer's allowance in 1995 to over £20 million.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the statistics quoted by Deputy Wallace in relation to the total number of people in Ireland estimated to be providing some form of care on a daily basis. The carer's association estimate there are 30,000 in need of full time care. Of the 15,647 applications received since the allowance was introduced in 1990, 5,684 were in payment at the end of March 1995, 3,371 had ceased payment mainly due to the death of the pensioner and 5,532 were refused because they failed to satisfy the conditions of the scheme. Of those refused, 32 per cent were actually qualified but better off on their present social welfare payment, 28 per cent had means in excess of the limit, and the balance failed for a variety of other reasons.</P>
    <P>The carer's allowance, like the other payments mentioned, is subject to the relevant legislation and any person who considers they may have an entitlement should apply to my Department accordingly. A carer who is looking after an elderly or incapacitated person on a full-time basis could not qualify for unemployment assistance as they would not satisfy the conditions requiring them to be, <i>inter-alia,</i> available for work. Some carers may be in receipt of supplementary welfare allowance because they do not satisfy the conditions for receipt of carer's allowance and would, otherwise, be in need (for example, a carer not resident with the person being cared for).</P>
    <P>The question of further easing of the means test for carer's allowance would be a matter for consideration in a budgetary context and in the light of available resources. Similarly, any proposals to remove the means test altogether would have significant cost implications and would also have to be examined in the light of the scheme's overall objectives.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>While my Department will continue to strengthen and develop its information services, I recognise the valuable part that the independent voluntary sector can play in providing information and advice on social welfare services. <Col N="984" /> The publication of this booklet is a good example of that contribution.</P>
    <P>An advisory group chaired by my Department was set-up in September 1992, with representatives at superintendent community welfare officer (SCWOs) level from the eight regional health boards.</P>
    <P>The main purpose of the group is to review supplementary welfare practices in health boards and make recommendations to achieve uniformity, consistency and equity of application of guidelines and legislation. The advisory group has met on eight occasions since its establishment.</P>
    <P>The last meeting of the advisory group was in October 1994 following which two sub-committees were formed to review particular aspects of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme which included exceptional needs payments and diet supplements. At subsequent meetings of the sub-committee a draft of the revised guidelines on exceptional needs payments was brought to an advanced stage. These guidelines are near completion and it is intended that a plenary session of the advisory committee will be held in the coming weeks to finalise the text. The advisory committee has already completed its work on rent and mortgage guidelines which will be published at the earliest possible date.</P>

      <P>The right of residence of EU citizens in this country is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Justice. My officials have been in touch with officials in the Department of Justice <Col N="985" /> who will communicate directly with the Deputy on this matter.</P>
      <P>With reference to the right of EU citizens who are legally resident here to claim benefits in this country, the Treaty of Rome prohibits any discrimination on the grounds of nationality or based on nationality between workers of the member states as regards employment, remuneration and other conditions of work and employment. A distinction is drawn, however, in EU legislation and in the decisions of the European Court of Justice between workers and job-seekers. The court, particularly, has held that equality of treatment in relation to &ldquo;social and tax advantages&rdquo; is applicable only to workers. It would appear from this that under EU legislation, equality of treatment in relation to certain social advantages, which are generally taken to mean social assistance, does not apply to retired persons or job-seekers.</P>
      <P>The social security benefits for migrants are dealt with under EU Regulation No. 1408/71.</P>
      <P>With regard to domestic legislation. claims by non-nationals for social welfare payments are determined in accordance with the same statutory conditions as claims by Irish nationals. For example, in the case of a claim for unemployment assistance, the non-national concerned must be unemployed, must be both available for and actively seeking work and must satisfy the relevant means test.</P>
      <P>In relation to the reference to a particular judgment of the High Court in the United Kingdom the case to which the Deputy refers may have been the one which arose from a challenge in the UK to the provisions of the &ldquo;Habitual Residence Test&rdquo; introduced by the UK Department of Social Security. However, the scope of that legislation does not extend to Irish nationals.</P>

      <P>My Department is at present in the process of issuing a new type plastic social services card to social welfare customers generally. So far, cards have been issued to over a million people. Most young people in the 17 to 24 age group and people in receipt of unemployment payments have received social services cards at this stage. The issue of social services cards will continue over the next few years.</P>
      <P>The social services card is a standard plastic card similar to a credit card. The person's name and RSI number are printed on the front of the card and there is a panel on the back of the card for the person's signature. The card also has a magnetic stripe on which are encoded the person's RSI number and date of birth.</P>
      <P>The main purpose of this card is to facilitate easier access to social welfare services. The card replaces the cardboard registration card that was previously issued to people to notify them of the RSI number when entering the social welfare system. The card will also in time replace the &ldquo;signing card&rdquo; currently in use at local offices of my Department.</P>
      <P>The card is being used to provide speedier access to unemployment payments at post offices where the counter services have been modernised.</P>
      <P>The signature on the card is used as an aid to identification. Automated post offices can &ldquo;swipe&rdquo; the card through a card reader and automatically retrieve the customer's payment record which greatly speeds up the payment process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Pensioners and other categories of social welfare recipients will receive social services cards in due course and <Col N="988" /> this will open up the possibility of using social services cards for the purpose of collecting pension payments. However, it will be a number of years before we reach this stage.</P>
    <P>The facility to have payments credited to a bank account or a savings account with An Post is already available to people in receipt of child benefit, old age contributory pension, retirement pension, survivor's pension and facility is provided as an alternative to payment by books of pension orders. People in these categories who, for one reason or another, find this automatic payment facility more suited to their personal needs and preferences may choose accordingly. It is intended to gradually extend this facility to other pension groups.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Proinsias De Rossa)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department has taken a pro-active and work supportive approach to assist the long term unemployed to re-enter the active labour force. A number of measures have also been introduced to encourage the creation of new job opportunities for the unemployed and to assist employers in hard-pressed labour intensive sectors.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Back to Work Allowance</i>
      </P>
      <P>The back to work allowance was introduced in October 1993 as a pilot scheme designed to encourage the creation of new job opportunities for the long-term unemployed and lone parents.</P>
      <P>Under the scheme the unemployed and lone parents can retain up to three quarters of their weekly entitlement and a range of their secondary benefits for three years. This helps to provide a financial cushion during the early years of employment or self-employment.</P>
      <P>Even though the scheme has only been in operation for just over 18 months, some 9,373 jobs have been identified. Over 6,500 people have qualified for the allowance at an average payment, in the first year, of almost £70 per week.</P>
      <P>I am very pleased with the success of this scheme and in that connection a further increase of up to 10,000 places was provided for in the 1995 budget. We are currently preparing an evaluation of the scheme.</P>
      <P>It has undoubtedly encouraged the creation of new job opportunities particularly in the indigenous industries identified in the Culliton report as having potential for expansion.</P>
      <P>More importantly it has given a major incentive to the long term unemployed to engage in self-employment as is evident from the fact that almost two-thirds of existing back to work allowances are being paid to those who took up self-employment as a result of the scheme.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Area Allowances (Enterprise)</i>
      </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While overall responsibility for area <Col N="990" /> allowances rests with the Department of the Taoiseach and the 12 area partnerships set up under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> payments under this scheme are made by my Department through social welfare local offices.</P>
    <P>The area allowance is a special allowance, which was introduced in October 1992, which is payable to certain long term unemployed people and lone parents residing in designated partnership areas who set up an enterprise. At present there are approximately 1,000 participants who retain 100 per cent of their social welfare payments for 12 months along with secondary benefits.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Part-time Job Allowance</i>
    </P>
    <P>This scheme allows the long term unemployed to take up part-time employment and receive a special income supplement. The rates were £38.90 for a single person and £64 for a married person with an adult dependant. It encourages unemployed people to make the transition to full-time employment and there are currently appoximately 530 participants.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Employers' PRSI Exemption Scheme</i>
    </P>
    <P>This scheme is an incentive to employers to provide additional full-time job opportunities for unemployed people and this year's budget extended the scheme to young people under 23 years who are taking up their first employment.</P>
    <P>Under the current scheme, which commenced on 6 April 1995 exemptions have been granted in respect of 78 employees to date.</P>
    <P>Under previous schemes a total of 9,117 new jobs were approved.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Community Employment</i>
    </P>
    <P>The community employment programme is a matter for my colleague the Minister for Enterprise and Employment. Accurate statistics are not available in my Department on the numbers who move from the live register to this programme.</P>

      <P>Self-employed people are compulsorily insurable under the Social Welfare Acts since 1988. They are eligible for survivor's pension, orphan's contributory allowance and old age contributory pension.</P>
      <P>Contributions as self-employed persons, Class S, do not reckon for maternity benefit or for short-term benefits under the Acts.</P>
      <P>One of the conditions for entitlement to maternity benefit under social welfare legislation requires that the woman is in employment which is covered by the Maternity Protection of Employees Act, 1981 which is administered by the Department of Enterprise and Employment. This legislation is confined to employed persons and it does not apply to persons who are self-employed.</P>
      <P>There are no plans at present to extend maternity benefit to self-employed women. Any such proposal would have financial implications and would require consideration of the whole context of social insurance coverage for the self-employed as a group.</P>

      <P>This House will already be aware of my conviction of the need for all citizens to have access to an independent citizen's information service which would operate separately from statutory or official information providers. The programme <i>A Government of Renewal</i> contains a commitment to overhaul the facilities available for community information, building on the network already in existence in the voluntary and statutory sectors.</P>
      <P>It is proposed that these facilities should be examined in consultation with the National Social Service Board which has particular experience and expertise in the field of citizen's information generally. Information on social welfare matters represents by far the single biggest item among the public services dealt with by citizens information centres.</P>
      <P>Funds are being provided, £250,000, to assist the board to develop computerbased integrated social services information so as to enhance the value and the accessibility of that information.

      <P>Under the provisions of the <Col N="993" /> supplementary welfare allowance, SWA, scheme, health boards may pay a weekly supplement towards mortgage interest payments to people in receipt of social welfare or health board payments. The supplement is payable in respect of the interest content of the mortgage only.</P>
      <P>In 1994, approximately 46,500 new mortgages were taken out. In 1991, the last year for which there are statistics available, there were over 400,000 mortgage holders in Ireland. A total of 7,600 people on social welfare type incomes received assistance with their mortgage interest payments under the SWA scheme in any one month in 1994. This represents less than 2 per cent of the 1991 figure of 400,000 mortgage holders.</P>
      <P>The Department of the Environment introduced legislation which required building societies to arrange mortgage protection insurance on loans taken out after 29 February 1988. This insurance is to cover the payment of the principal due to the lending institution in the event of the death of the borrower.</P>
      <P>The introduction of mandatory insurance cover for all new mortgages would increase the financial burden on borrowers taking out mortgages; however, the introduction of such a requirement would be a matter for consideration by the Minister for the Environment in the context of overall housing policy.</P>

      <P>The use of comment cards is standard practice in many organisations and it is intended to introduce such cards into social welfare local offices in the coming months.

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>Ireland does not manufacture any conventional or other weapons. However, a number of Ireland's European Union partners are classified among the world's leading suppliers of major conventional weapons. These include France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom. We are aware that, in addition, conventional weapons are manufactured in most other EU member states. Detailed official information about types of conventional weapons manufactured in each member state is not readily available.</P>
      <P>Under the Common Foreign and Security Policy of the European Union, the Union is committed to the preservation of peace and the strengthening of international security. The Government, in accordance with its commitment in the programme, <i>A Government of Renewal,</i> is seeking &ldquo;a Europe which promotes peace and disarmament&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Although issues relating to arms manufacture fall outside the scope of the Treaty on European Union, the EU has developed common criteria with regard to the export of conventional weapons. In accordance with these criteria, EU member states refrain from arms exports to certain areas of actual or potential conflict.</P>
      <P>In addition, the European Union is working to achieve greater transparency, responsibility and restraint with regard to arms exports. The EU sponsored the introduction of a United Nations Register of Armaments to include information on international transfers of certain categories of conventional weapons. The UN Register of Conventional Arms, established in 1993, is playing a useful role in that regard. Furthermore, all EU partners have agreed to a set of principles governing conventional arms transfers in the context of the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe, OCSE.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government wishes to see more done in this area. At the United Nations, Ireland has proposed the elaboration of a Code of Conduct for Conventional Arms Transfers, of a more <Col N="999" /> universal character, which would encourage states voluntarily to exercise responsibility and restraint in their exports and imports of conventional arms and set out common principles to be observed in this area. Our European partners have supported this proposal for a universal, politically binding code of conduct, as an important step forward in the area of conventional arms control. Ireland is continuing to work to broaden support among UN member states for this approach.</P>
    <P>With regard to landmines, Ireland has supported concerted action at EU level. An EU joint action on anti-personnel landmines was agreed at the General Affairs Council last April. One key element in the joint action is an EU common moratorium on exports of anti-personnel mines. This comprises a total ban on exports of certain anti-personnel mines to all destinations, as well as a ban on exports of all types of anti-personnel mines to those states which have not yet ratified the 1980 Inhumane Weapons Convention, the principal international instrument which seeks to deal with landmines.</P>
    <P>The convention prohibits the indiscriminate use of certain conventional weapons, notably anti-personnel landmines, particularly in areas where there is a high concentration of civilians. Through the joint action, EU partners also commit themselves to active preparation and participation in the review conference on the convention, which will take place in Vienna next autumn. Member states agree to endeavour to foster the universal nature of the 1980 convention and to strengthen the provisions on landmines, in particular those on restrictions or prohibitions on anti-personnel mines. This would include provisions on the transfer of such mines.</P>
    <P>Ireland is an original signatory of the Inhumane Weapons Convention. Ireland recently ratified the convention and will, therefore, be able to participate, as a state party, at the forthcoming review conference. We have participated actively, as a signatory State, in <Col N="1000" /> preparatory work for this conference, where we have stated our position as one of support for a total ban on production, stockpiling, manufacture and transfer of landmines, if that can be achieved.</P>

      <P>The medical criteria for qualification as a disabled driver are specified in the Disabled Drivers and Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations, 1994. It is a fundamental requirement of eligibility for the scheme that an applicant must satisfy one or more of the criteria laid down in the regulations and obtain a medical certificate from the Director of Community Care and Medical Officer of Health in the local health board or, on appeal, from the independent Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal.</P>
      <P>The medical criteria in question were examined in considerable detail in the course of a comprehensive review of the operation of the scheme which was completed late in 1994. The review recommended that the existing medical criteria should remain broadly unchanged, apart from some minor modifications. I am satisfied that they are appropriate for the fair and effective operation of the scheme.</P>
      <P>I understand from the details supplied that the individual in question has been refused a medical certificate by the Director of Community Care and Medical Officer of Health. However, it is open to him to appeal to the Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal, 25 Clyde Road, Dublin 4, if he has not already done so. The Deputy will appreciate that I cannot intervene in this independent process of medical certification.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): I propose to take Questions Nos. 44 to 46, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>Treatment for hepatitis C positive persons is being provided at the following six designated hospitals:&mdash; Beaumont Hospital, Dublin, Mater Hospital, Dublin, St. James's Hospital, Dublin, St. Vincent's Hospital, Dublin, Cork University Hospital, University College Hospital, Galway.</P>
      <P>The treatment, including prescribed medication, is being provided by the public hospital service free of charge.</P>
      <P>The counselling service arranged by the Blood Transfusion Service Board is currently being reviewed to ensure that the service is responsive to the great variety of needs of those diagnosed positive for hepatitis C.</P>
      <P>The services put in place for persons who have tested positive for hepatitis C will be available for as long as they are required. The needs of those who have been diagnosed as positive for hepatitis C will be monitored and reassessed on an ongoing basis to ensure that the necessary support services are provided to meet their needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Blood Transfusion Service Board is currently implementing a targeted <Col N="1006" /> look back programme. This programme has two phases, the first phase will identify donors who have tested positive for hepatitis C, the blood product &mdash; whole blood, red blood cells, platelets and plasma, the hospital to which the blood product was issued and the recipient. The second phase will trace the recipient to invite him or her for testing and counselling. Phase one of the programme is well advanced.</P>
    <P>The policy document, <i>A Government of Renewal,</i> included a commitment to fair compensation for women infected by the hepatitis C virus from anti-D. The Government has decided to establish, as a matter of urgency, a tribunal which will assess compensation on <i>exgratia</i> basis in respect of anti-D recipients who are infected with hepatitis C antibodies/virus and the partners and children of these women who are also infected with hepatitis C antibodies/virus.</P>
    <P>A number of other groups which have members who are positive for hepatitis C are also seeking compensation. There is ongoing consideration of the position in relation to these people in my Department and discussions with these groups will take place in the coming weeks.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Howlin) Brendan Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 52 and 56 together.</P>
      <P>As announced at the time, the Government decided last October that the northern port access route should proceed on a priority basis, subject to: the route being constructed as a dual carriageway, mostly in tunnel, from the airport motorway at Whitehall to the North Port; the route being classified as a proposed national road, thereby placing its construction under the overall responsibility of the National Roads Authority; the implementation of the project being accompanied by traffic management measures, including tolling and a truck management system on the lines recommended in the DTI final report.</P>
      <P>The precise arrangements for access to the new route will have to be carefully considered during the detailed design of the project, taking account of the recommendations of the DTI final report and the feasibility and environmental impact study of the proposed route prepared for Dublin Corporation. It is likely that the route will be constructed as a motorway which would require the preparation of a motorway scheme, the holding of a public local inquiry and the carrying out of an environmental impact assessment. Since I would have to act in a quasi-judicial capacity in deciding on a motorway scheme and environmental impact assessment, it would be inappropriate for me to comment further on the issue at this stage.</P>
      <P>The Dublin Transportation Initiative was commissioned by the Government, with the support of the European Commission, to produce a long term transportation strategy, to 2011, for the greater Dublin area; prepare a mediumterm investment and implementation programme for the period 1994 to 1999, drawn from that strategy; and put in place a continuous transportation planning process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1011" /> The Government agreed last year that the transport strategy recommended in the DTI final report, as formally submitted to my predecessor, should provide the general policy framework for the future development of the transport system in the greater Dublin area. I will be publishing the report shortly, and announcing decisions on implementation arrangements generally.</P>
    <P>Already, the Operational Programme for Transport, agreed by the Government and the European Commission last year, outlines a major investment programme designed to implement the principal elements of the DTI recommended strategy. Over the period 1994 to 1999, an estimated £600 million will be spent on implementing road, public transport and traffic management projects, including the completion of the motorway C-ring, the construction of the northern port access route, the provision of the first phase of a light rail network, the introduction of quality bus corridors and the implementation of a wide range of traffic measures.</P>
    <P>The total cost from February 1992 to date of the DTI phase 2 study amounts to approximately £2.3 million. This figure includes fees for consultancy, public consultation, market research, traffic surveys and printing. The study has been assisted at a rate of 75 per cent from the European Regional Development Fund, with the balance being met from my Department's Vote.</P>

      <P>I refer to the reply to Question No. 50 of 27 April 1995.</P>
      <P>My Department has responsibility for securing EU funding for major water and sewerage projects, including individual projects included in the lower Liffey valley sewerage scheme. Projects are implemented by the local authority concerned, in this case Kildare County Council. So far under the scheme, a secondary treatment plant has been provided at Leixlip to service Leixlip, Celbridge, Maynooth and Kilcock.</P>
      <P>The European Commission is responsible for determining applications for assistance under the Cohesion Fund; its decision on the application covering the lower Liffey valley scheme is awaited.</P>
      <P>The local authorities concerned &mdash; Dublin Corporation, Fingal County Council, South Dublin County Council, Meath County Council, Kildare County Council and Wicklow County Council &mdash; are currently finalising a draft water quality management plan for the River Liffey. The draft plan indicated that just over half, 54 per cent, of the surveyed channel length in the Liffey catchment is completely free of pollution. Slight pollution-eutrophication affects almost one quarter, 22.5 per cent, of surveyed channel and more pronounced moderate pollution-hypertrophication affects a similar proportion, 22.5 per cent. Serious pollution is now confined to short stretches in two small streams, the Lyreen and its tributary and Clonshanbo Stream.</P>
      <P>The plan, which is expected to be adopted shortly, will facilitate the authorities in addressing the management needs for the river catchment on a comprehensive basis.</P>

      <P>It would not be appropriate or possible for local authorities to undertake works in substitution for those proper to the CFP scheme.

      <P>The higher education grants scheme, pre-1992, including the means test tables and the attainment requirements, applicable to a candidate is the scheme of the year he-she qualified academically for a grant. As the person involved in this case entered <Col N="1026" /> third level education in 1991 he is subject to all the terms of the scheme of that year. The reckonable income exceeds the limits set down in the relevant third level student support scheme and therefore no grant aid is payable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Ms Bhreathnach)</NameTxt>
      <P>The school referred to by the Deputy will lose its third assistant's post at the end of the current school year. This is because the staffing of national schools for a particular year is determined by the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous year. The total enrolment of the school on 30 September 1994 was 89 pupils, which warrants a staffing in the 1995-96 school year of a principal and two assistants. Accordingly, the third assistant's post will be suppressed at the end of the current school year. The teacher in question has been given the option of having his name placed on the diocesan panel for redeployment, which will not take place before 1 September 1995.</P>
      <P>I should also point out to the Deputy that, in addition to the staffing details which I have mentioned above, this school has the services of a full time remedial teacher as well as a concessionary post under the scheme for schools serving areas designated as disadvantaged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The role of the resource teacher is to act in support of ordinary teaching staff in dealing with handicapped children attending ordinary classes. To date, a total of 26 such posts have been allocated to the primary school sector. As I recently announced, I intend to allocate an additional ten resource teacher posts to primary schools in 1995. These posts will be allocated on the basis of priority of need following the collection of data by my Department's primary inspectorate. My Department has not received an <Col N="1029" /> application for a resource teacher from the school in question. However, if an application is submitted to my Department, the matter will be fully considered in the context of the allocation of posts in 1995.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Ms Bhreathnach)</NameTxt>
      <P>The eligible part-time teachers scheme was approved by my Department in 1989 following discussions with management and unions on Labour Court recommendations. Under this scheme eligible part-time teachers are employed on an annual contract. This contract is renewable subject to satisfactory performance and the continued need for the particular teaching service provided by the part-time teacher. Teachers on eligible part-time <Col N="1030" /> teacher contracts have pro-rata pay and conditions with permanent teachers.</P>
      <P>Any adjustments to the current agreement governing eligible part-time teachers are a matter for negotiation and agreement between the parties concerned and have to be considered under the relevant terms of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i>&mdash; PCW. The <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> provides for discussions with management and teacher interests with a view to agreeing a ceiling on the percentage of part-time teaching posts at post-primary and third level. This issue is being addressed in ongoing discussions between management and teacher interests. The Deputy will appreciate that the eventual outcome of these negotiations will have a direct impact on the number of whole-time permanent posts in schools and colleges.</P>
      <P>The sanctioning of permanent whole-time posts for part-time teachers or an across the board enhancement of their hours, as suggested by the Deputy, would inevitably result in schools and colleges having a teaching resource in excess of actual requirements. There are agreed procedures for filling permanent whole-time teaching posts. Part-time teachers who have been employed under the terms of the eligible part-time teachers scheme may apply for any advertised post in the normal way.</P>

      <P>In the organisation of school transport services, Bus Éireann plans routes in such a way to ensure that, as far as possible, every eligible pupil has a reasonable standard of service from the point of view of timetable, while at the same time ensuring that school transport vehicles are utilised in the most efficient manner. In <Col N="1033" /> order to do this, individual vehicles are generally required to operate a number of services to schools and, consequently, extended timetables often require some pupils to make an early start in the mornings and to wait for some time in the evenings.</P>
      <P>In the case of post-primary services, routes are planned, in conjunction with the transport liaison officer, so as to ensure the minimum possible travelling and waiting time daily.</P>
      <P>The arrangement which applies in the case of school transport to Balla post primary centre is that a double trip is in operation. This is a feature of the school transport scheme as operated throughout the country. The standard of service here is considered reasonable, and the present method of catering for pupils keeps waiting time at the school to a minimum. In these circumstances it is not open to my Department to offer anything beyond the service available at present.</P>

      <P>The &ldquo;one contribution&rdquo; requirement which the Deputy refers to is contained in EU Social Security Regulations 1408/71 and 574/72 and relates to unemployment benefit. These regulations provide for the co-ordination of social security schemes for workers, self-employed persons and their families moving throughout the European Union. With effect from 1 January, 1994, they also apply to certain EFTA states, namely Norway and Iceland and the new EU member states, i.e. Austria, Finland and Sweden. From 1 May 1995, these regulations are also applicable to Liechtenstein.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a number of options available to unemployed Irish people who last worked in an EU member state or one of the other states referred to above. They can, subject to satisfying certain conditions, have their unemployment benefit payments from the state in which they were last employed paid to them for up to three months when they return to Ireland in search of work. They can, on returning to Ireland, qualify for Irish benefit if they satisfy the conditions for entitlement based on their Irish PRSI contribution record. Irish unemployment benefit is, however, <Col N="1040" /> not payable for any period during which they are in receipt of unemployment benefit from another member state.</P>
    <P>If a person fails to qualify for Irish unemployment benefit based on his-her Irish PRSI record, there is provision, under the EU legislation referred to above, for taking into account periods of insurance or employment in all states to which the regulation applies in order to determine an individual's entitlement to unemployment benefit. In order for such periods to be aggregated it is necessary that the person was last insured or employed in the state in which unemployment benefit is claimed. In Ireland's case this necessitates the payment of at least one employment contribution, hence the reference to the &ldquo;one contribution&rdquo; rule. This provision, together with other provisions of Regulations (EEC) 1408/71 and 574/72, are directly applicable in and binding on all states concerned.</P>
    <P>The issue of improving the unemployment benefits provisions of the Regulations has been discussed in Brussels on numerous occasions. However, no agreement could be reached on amending the present arrangements. The European Commission's White Paper on Social Policy has promised that the matter will be pursued with a view to increasing the general flexibility of the existing rules.</P>

      <P>The average payment per person per week varies considerably across the various schemes administered by my Department. For example, the average payment &mdash; excluding secondary benefits &mdash; for the lone parent's allowance scheme at December 1994 was £83 whereas the average payment for family income supplement was £38.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110 and 113 together.</P>
      <P>I am very concerned at the fact that animals on a number of farms in the Askeaton area of County Limerick have been dying in large numbers since about 1989. My Department's Regional Laboratory first became involved in investigating this problem in April 1993 following receipt of a number of carcases from a farmer in the area. Since then my Department, together with other State agencies, other bodies and experts, has been seeking to identify the primary causes of the deaths. This work was undertaken by the different bodies and individuals in an unco-ordinated manner and various hypotheses have been advanced as to the factors contributing to the problem. While there was evidence to support some of the conclusions being drawn, there was also conflicting evidence, information gaps, misunderstanding of some findings and insufficient basis for the claims in some reports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because of this and concerns at continuing deaths and the failure to establish the reason so many cattle were dying, the Environmental Protection Agency &mdash; which had already decided to undertake its investigation &mdash; agreed, at my request, in early February 1995 to <Col N="1047" /> undertake responsibility for managing and co-ordinating the further necessary investigations.</P>
    <P>At a meeting held in Bunratty on 23 February 1995, which was attended by all interested parties, it was agreed to set up four working groups as follows: (a) veterinary-animal health; (b) industrial emissions; (c) soil and plants and (d) human health.</P>
    <P>My Department was assigned responsibility for the study on veterinary-animal health and has drawn up a protocol of work aimed at monitoring the biochemical-haematological-pathological-immunological-epidemiological status of animals on or from selected farms. Detailed arrangements for carrying out this work have not yet been finalised with the two selected farmers. The arrangements envisaged involve the removal of part of the herds from the farms and their replacement with other animals and continuous monitoring and testing of fluids and tissues from the animals in various environments. The tests would be carried our at both national and international laboratories. The arrangements also envisage the full or partial depopulation of the herds at current market values and the making of research payments to the farmers. A number of alternative arrangements have been proposed to the farmers but these have not yet been accepted. Efforts are continuing to reach agreement with the farmers so as to enable the full study to get under way as soon as possible. I do not accept that any of the arrangements proposed, which are based on the need to undertake a scientific approach to the investigation, would have the effect of destroying the livelihoods of the farmers in question. The main outstanding unresolved issues include claims for compensation for past losses and assurances in relation to the future.</P>
    <P>To date, samples from all the dead cattle received from farms in the Askeaton area have been subjected to postmortem examination in the Regional Veterinary Laboratory in Limerick to <Col N="1048" /> ascertain the causes of death and the results have been forwarded to the veterinary practitioners involved. In the case of recent mortalities, the results have also been sent to the owner. Some bone samples were also sent to a United Kingdom laboratory for assay of aluminium and fluorine, the results of which have also been sent to the owner. Further tests are to be arranged by my Department on the carcases received while other tests are being or are to be arranged by, <i>inter alia</i>, the Environmental Protection Agency. The significance of the results of aluminium levels found in some of the animals from this area is currently being assessed.</P>
    <P>Contact has been made with the persons of whom details were supplied. It is intended that an equine specialist from the Department's Veterinary Laboratory will visit the farm involved.</P>
    <P>Monitoring and investigations under (b), (c) and (d) above are being undertaken by the Environmental Protection Agency, Teagasc and the Mid-Western Health Board. These complement the work to be undertaken by my Department and involve extensive monitoring, sampling, testing, analysis, etc. and the use of a wide range of laboratories in and expertise from both Ireland and abroad.</P>
    <P>The overall investigation is to be coordinated by the Environmental Protection Agency through co-operation between the various working groups and all interested parties are to be kept informed of developments. Given the nature of the investigations, it is not possible to give a timescale for their completion.</P>

Equivalent standards of operational hygiene and protection of animal welfare are demanded of all abattoirs. However different structural requirements are prescribed to take account of the throughout of the abattoirs.</P>

    <P>The structural requirements for export plants are prescribed by the European Communities (Fresh Meat) <Col N="1102" /> Regulations 1987 (S.I. No. 284 of 1987), and those for domestic abattoirs by the Abattoirs Act, 1988 (Abattoirs) Regulations, 1989 (S.I. No. 152 of 1989). From 1 January 1996 all abattoirs slaughtering in excess of 1,000 livestock units (1 livestock unit = 1 bovine or 3 pigs or 7 sheep) per annum must meet the export standard requirements in order to comply with Council Directive 91/487/EEC concerning the production and placing on the market of fresh meat within the European Union.</P>

      <P>The protection of fish stocks in the portion of the River Erne catchment area located south of the Border is the statutory responsibility of the Northern Regional Fisheries Board. I am sure that the board will, in this regard, supply the Deputy with any information he may request. There is a long standing joint approach to practical issues of fisheries conservation and protection in the Erne catchment area as a whole through the River Erne Joint Protection Committee. The committee, which is an informal non-statutory body, is representative of relevant Departments and Fisheries Boards North and South as well as the ESB and exemplifies the high level of cross-Border cooperation on inland fisheries matters generally.</P>
