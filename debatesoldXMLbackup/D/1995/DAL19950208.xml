      <P>Over many decades this House has adhered to a certain tradition on budget day.  I asked the Taoiseach yesterday if he believed that tradition, whereby only a few items from the Budget Statement were leaked, was beneficial.  Is he seriously pleased that last night at least five Ministers, their programme managers and handlers were involved in the wholesale leaking of the contents of today's Budget Statement to the extent that we were told it contained 22 pages and were given enough data to work out the crucial information?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very important Bill and has been a long time in gestation.  Because we have waited so long it is important to get the legislation absolutely right.  In my earlier contribution last week I talked about the primacy of the parliament and the necessity for Government and legislators to acknowledge its primacy, that we all make our contributions and achieve a consensus which is in the best interests of our people and the many visitors who will come to enjoy the facilities offered by this great land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have a unique history of friendliness, openness and hospitality.  Since 1987 my party in Government placed a strong emphasis on heritage tourism and gave a major impetus to the promotion of Irish tourism around the world.  I am pleased that the Government is prepared to follow that track <Col N="1644" /> because tourism can underpin the buoyancy of economic growth.  While we anticipate that much of today's budget may be depending on buoyancy, despite all the leaks, it is important to create opportunities to increase our economic growth.  As an island nation it is vitally important that we get as many people as possible into Ireland to spend their money to underpin economic growth so that we can achieve an acceptable standard of living.</P>
    <P>When facilities are used whether in the private sector, owned by farmers and property owners, or in the public sector, owned by the State or semi-State organisations or voluntary bodies, we have an opportunity to enshrine in law immunity for people who have made their contribution either by making their facilities available on a voluntary basis or by working together, in a voluntary capacity, to provide new facilities or by the State providing modern facilities. I refer to forest parks, national parks, special heritage areas, major tourist scenic areas and religious and heritage areas throughout the country, all of which are visited by millions of people annually.  It is important not to enshrine in law obligations which heretofore did not exist.  While there has been a broad welcome for this Bill there are latent worries about it imposing responsibilities and obligations on property owners and organisers of various facilities which would render them liable, in certain circumstances, for people on their property.</P>
    <P>I suggest the insertion of a new section in the Bill to give immunity to farmers, property owners, the State itself or voluntary bodies in relation to people who enter their properties voluntarily, to enjoy their facilities and to voluntary organisations, sporting organisations such as the GAA, golf clubs and so on.  Not alone can they use the facilities for their enjoyment, they can also take people to court.  It is important to have clarity on this issue.  I would like a new section inserted in the Bill to give immunity to all those property owners. Following my contribution last week I <Col N="1645" /> had a short discussion with the Minister during which he made some important points.  While I take some of them on board there are sufficient laws in the State to protect the rights of individuals. We are all protected under the Constitution and we have property rights. There are laws on the Statute Book which give us other rights protected in criminal law and there are also common law rights.</P>
    <P>We have more than enough legislation but we must protect those generous enough to make their facilities available to other people.  Voluntary bodies who provide facilities for a commercial charge have obligations in the area of public liability.  People who use these facilities for enjoyment do so of their own free will and we should not put into law measures that would place serious liabilities on the organisers, trustees and owners of properties.  I would ask the Minister to consider that and to ensure that this Bill will provide for the freedom set down in our Constitution, the freedom of movement enshrined in the Treaty of Rome that is so important in the single European market to all the citizens of the European Union.</P>
    <P>Ireland should have a law that is simple and crystal clear.  Perhaps lawyers would say there is no such thing as simple law and as a consumer I would probably agree, but it is important that the message goes abroad that Ireland of the welcomes, of opportunity, hospitality, welcome and warmth, is a country where people can enjoy themselves, where properties are available for use and enjoyment provided people behave themselves.  Responsibility for those who come onto property lies with themselves and not the owner of the property. All of us are obliged to respect people's right to move and speak freely. Property owners or organisations who provide facilities for the use and enjoyment of others should not become victims of this Bill or any other laws.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister, his officials and the Law Reform Commission for the time they have spent on the Bill.  I served for almost eight years in six <Col N="1646" /> Government Departments and I know how much time it takes to get legislation through.  I am aware of the dedication of public officials who work on legislation and of the exigencies in the offices of the Attorney General, the parliamentary draftsmen and Ministers of the day in bringing legislation to Government and taking the advice of Members of this House.  I hope that collectively we will ensure this Bill serves our tradition and not only the people of Ireland but those who come to visit our country will enjoy our properties.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>I pay tribute to the Minister for Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Taylor, on bringing the Bill before the House.  I requested this legislation on many occasions in my two years in this House and I lobbied for it for many years in my role in a farm organisation.  In this period of openness and transparency it is important that I state I am still a farmer and property owner and therefore I have a personal interest in this Bill.</P>
      <P>I acknowledge the considerable work done by the Minister and his Department in addressing the issue of responsibility on property owners, particularly farmers.  Farmers and property owners generally have traditionally extended hospitality to tourists, visitors, sportsmen and others, which has resulted in the development of the Irish tourism industry and sporting activities.  We do not wish to see this development threatened. Amendments must be made to the Bill to address the child trespasser issue and to take account of farming and business practices that may pose a threat to entrants to property, in order to safeguard continued unrestricted access to the countryside.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's proposal to increase protection for occupiers of land against claims by trespassers and recreational users, which in turn will ensure that the recreational use of land is facilitated to the widest possible extent.  I agree with the Minister we must create a climate where occupiers will not be deterred from making land <Col N="1647" /> available for such use for fear of being sued for personal injuries.</P>
    <P>This is an important and complex Bill and I do not have the legal training to debate it line by line.  I appreciate the Minister has accepted there is much anxiety among property owners about its complexities particularly the proposed provision on minors, and I am glad he has agreed to review it, in accordance with the commitment in the Programme for Government.  He and his Department have been in close contact with the main farming organisations, and senior farming organisation leaders have strongly rejected the idea that farmers would be responsible for minors who enter their lands.</P>
    <P>Following a meeting last October between the Department of Equality and Law Reform and an IFA delegation, the IFA issued a statement that the strong indications were that nonacceptable provisions would be included in the Occupiers' Liability Bill to the effect that farmers and house holders would have an additional duty to care for child trespassers and other children who are not visitors entering land or household property.  This unacceptable and grossly unfair additional duty is over and above that owed to adult trespassers. It would not be the intention of farmers and householders to injure people intentionally or to act with reckless disregard to their presence.  The statement warned that the Bill, if unamended, would not go far enough to protect landowners' interests and would not ensure continued unrestricted access to the Irish countryside.  Those are not my words but those of senior farm organisation officials who gave the best advice possible in order that tourists, farmers and property owners in general can live, work and enjoy life together for the betterment of all concerned.</P>
    <P>With the ceasefire and the possibility of increased tourism North and South, this Bill is vital.  In common with other western democracies Irish society has become more claims conscious than <Col N="1648" /> ever before, as has been reflected in the increased number of claims for personal injuries.  There is greater need to reform legislation to allow for the increased use of the countryside for sporting and recreational purposes.</P>
    <P>A few days ago in this House we discussed the Heritage Bill and the importance of many of our national monuments and fine buildings.  Free and easy access to all these structures is of major importance to the promotion of our country and particularly to our emigrants and their families who may wish to come back to their ancestral homes and trace their roots.</P>
    <P>Last night I spoke to people involved in community work who are trying to obtain grants to improve fisheries and other activities in the Border region. These people visited all the farmers in the region and received verbal approval for the building of stiles and so on which would allow for the activities to take place, but when they contacted the fisheries board they were advised that unless they had written agreement the grants would not be forthcoming.  Farmers in these circumstances are reluctant to sign agreements accepting responsibility for fishermen and their families, which could include minors, entering their property.  This will have a major impact on whether grants will be paid, whether communities can go ahead with their proposals and whether tourism will become the major earner in the future. All these matters are very important.</P>
    <P>There is another issue that affects areas in such as my constituency of Cavan-Monaghan.  The Minister referred to the problem of open drains, shucks or whatever one wishes to call them.  In some areas people can see the drains full of water and are aware of the dangers.  However, in my area where there is drumlin soil the trenches are ten-12 feet deep.  Will I have to erect fences around these trenches to ensure that children who stray on to my land do not fall into them?  Recently I visited similar areas north of the Border which have received much more grant aid than <Col N="1649" /> we have to erect such fences.  Yet the people there are still worried about allowing free access to their land.</P>
    <P>I am glad some Opposition Deputies have reconsidered their position on this Bill.  I do not wish to refer to personalities but the Fianna Fáil spokesperson on Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Woods, has set up a special party committee to consider the changes required to the Bill so that his party can support it.  Deputy O'Dea said that Deputies on this side of the House had done a U-turn on this issue.  Fine Gael Deputies have always raised questions about this issue and when in Opposition the Minister of State, Deputy Deenihan, introduced a Private Members' Bill.  The Minister promised to follow up on the issue after the publication of the Law Reform Commission's report, we appreciate his decision to re-examine it, as it is vital to everyone's interest.</P>
    <P>We are not just talking about landowners, we are talking about business people who have expressed serious concerns about the Bill.  If these people are left to carry the can for children who trespass on their land then there will be serious implications.  The legal advice to most people is that it is better to settle a small claim than waste money fighting the case in court.  If this Bill gives out the wrong vibes then there could be many more claims, rightly or wrongly, against the owners of property.  The Bill gives us the opportunity to make the law in this area as straightforward and simple as possible.</P>
    <P>Farmers, property owners and others want to make their premises and lands available to tourists and others but they cannot be expected to put their livelihoods and future of their families at risk in doing so.  Last week there was a debate on heritage issues.  In many cases the only access to important buildings and sites is through farmers' land.  A farmer with a suckler herd has to keep a bull and there will be serious implications if he is responsible for children who enter his land and are chased by that bull.  This is just one of the problems which may arise.  Is it not proper <Col N="1650" /> that farmers should have the right to look after their own business?</P>
    <P>Problems can also arise in regard to the use of machinery during the cutting of silage and other crops.  Will a farmer be solely responsible for children if they are around these machines when they are in operation?  Will their parents or guardians have any responsibility for them?  Serious consideration needs to be given to this issue.  There was a reference to the use of sprays which are essential for growing crops.  Will property owners be responsible for children who, without proper guidance or care, enter such land?</P>
    <P>These are just some of the issues about which farmers are worried and which must be seriously considered if people are to be allowed open use of the countryside.  In some counties farmers have taken strong measures and will not allow people to use their property.  The majority of farmers in my area would not like to have to resort to such measures, but there is a lack of understanding among visitors and others about their concerns.  Many farmers do not realise the risks they face.  A recent survey by a branch of the IFA found that only 40 per cent of the farmers in the area had insurance, in itself a very serious problem.  If we do not get the law right and claims become the norm then farmers who take out insurance will find it very difficult and costly.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for introducing this Bill, which had been promised by previous Ministers and Governments, and hope he will take account of our anxieties and worries.  Regardless of the comments made both inside and outside the House, I hope he will introduce the necessary changes in the legislation to ensure that property owners, tourists, etc., can live and work together for the betterment of our nation.  This issue has a major role to play in the future development of tourism and I hope the Minister is successful in his efforts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this long overdue Bill.  In recent years questions were asked almost on a daily basis <Col N="1651" /> about the introduction of the legislation. The people who raised them knew that the Law Reform Commission had been asked for its views on the matter.  The previous Government was concerned to ensure that it would receive the best possible advice, and this is evidenced by the two Law Reform Commission reports.  In recent years farmers, property owners and community groups have become very afraid of claims being made against them.</P>
      <P>Traditionally, farmers and landowners were co-operative and would not dream of denying access to their property to huntsmen, fishermen or recreational users and those who did were subjected to much criticism.  When I was a youth there was a belief that the entire community should be allowed to make the best use of land and property.  I spent most of my spare time fishing and hunting.  It would be regrettable if the freedom the general public enjoyed for so many years was curtailed because the Government failed to introduce adequate legislation to protect the rights of property and landowners.</P>
      <P>The goodwill of landowners was reciprocated by land users who took the utmost care and acted responsibly.  They seldom had to be reprimanded for failing to close gates or causing damage.</P>
      <P>The Minister stated it was time the principles governing occupiers' liability were put on a statutory basis.  The Programme for Government refers to a further careful examination of the constitutional and legal position as it relates to minors.  Would it not be more appropriate for the Government to give us its collective view on this matter which has been a bone of contention?  During the past few weeks in the chamber of my county council, members of the Government parties, both Oireachtas Members and county councillors, seemed to be promoting the Bill proposed by Deputy Deenihan but having listened to Government speakers in this debate it seems very few of them are subscribing to what was contained in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Law Reform Commission <Col N="1652" /> expressed the view that the Bill proposed by Deputy Deenihan was stark.  It argued that we would turn the clock back in regard to common law and was scathing in its remarks.  Now when the promoters of that Bill have an opportunity to promote it they have failed to take it.  There are conflicting views and this is an indication of the muddled thinking of a muddled partnership Government.  We would have expected the Bill to be more specific given that the Government parties have for years been vociferous in arguing that if they were given the opportunity they would introduce a clear and definitive Bill.</P>
    <P>The Law Reform Commission has expressed the view that if a special exemption is not provided for child entrants the legislation could be found to be unconstitutional.  I hope that will be addressed in the Bill.  Trespassers, even those who enter property to engage in illegal activity, can claim for damages and have been known to be successful.  The Minister will have to rectify this serious anomaly.</P>
    <P>There have also been variations in court judgments whereby judges have taken differing views in almost identical cases.  No matter how long it takes it is imperative that all Members should express their points of view on Committee Stage to ensure that the best possible legislation is put on the Statute Book.</P>
    <P>The explanatory memorandum states that this Bill will not involve any charge on the Exchequer.  This would be a first as practically all Bills have imposed a charge on the Exchequer, either directly or indirectly.  In this instance reference is made to the Office of Public Works which has responsibility for national monuments.  It is being given extra responsibilities and this will lead indirectly to a charge being imposed on the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>Much interest is being shown in historical sites at present, including castles and holy wells.  These could be used to attract foreign visitors, forty per cent of whom indicated an interest in this area. In many instances in order to get to <Col N="1653" /> these sites one has to cross fields and laneways so it is important that measures are taken to safeguard the rights of landowners.</P>
    <P>Bord Fáilte has placed special emphasis on angling to attract foreign visitors. This is evident from the £13 million allocated under a recent tourism programme to the fisheries board for the development of waterways &mdash; this matter has been a bone of contention also. This is a clear indication that Bord Fáilte sees opportunities to promote regions such as my own constituency which would be an attraction for fishermen given the number of lakes and rivers in Cavan-Monaghan.</P>
    <P>Recently &mdash; this relates to the peace initiative, the promotion of good community relations in the region and the development of cross-Border structures &mdash; the Dungannon Development Association has been in contact with Monaghan County Council, to discuss proposals for major development of the Blackwater river.  The Office of Public Works carried out arterial drainage work to restore it as a salmon river. Along with the Ulster Way, this region could be developed for the benefit of cross-Border communities.  Because of this, it is important that we get this legislation right.  Efforts are being made by local groups to provide the necessary amenities in those areas, including accommodation on lakes and rivers, boats, fishing gear, etc.  The success of this depends almost completely on the good will of landowners in giving access to those facilities.  That highlights the importance and the necessity for this legislation.</P>
    <P>Walking as a leisure activity was not engaged in by people many years ago. In more recent times, however, people travel to Austria and other European countries for walking holidays.  It has also become a much more attractive leisure activity here.</P>
    <P>The Minister must get the balance right in this legislation.  I wish him well in his efforts.  He is engaged in a man sized job and if he manages to please <Col N="1654" /> everybody at the end of the day, he will deserve a crown.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on this Bill which is a major step forward in helping to resolve some of the uncertainty surrounding farmers, and other occupiers' rights and legal obligations to entrants onto their lands.  This Bill, when finally enacted, will put the principles governing occupiers' liability on a statutory basis but it is extremely important that we get it right on this occasion and that uncertainty is finally eradicated.  A clear statement of legal rights, obligations and liabilities must be fully set out.</P>
      <P>The Bill is important also for the development of our heritage tourism. This is now a major area in the context of promoting economic growth due to the huge number of visitors to sites of archaeological interest, which has been referred to by previous speakers.  It has important positive implications also for sporting and tourism interests and, indeed, for other property owners. Where I believe there are inadequacies or shortcomings in the Bill, I intend to highlight them with a view to having the Minister study and evaluate same. Hopefully, he will then be in a position to bring forward suitable amendments on Committee Stage to incorporate some of the concerns that have been outlined eloquently in this House to date and some which I intend to outline.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The law on occupier's liability and the exposure of property owners to substantial legal and financial risks has been of increasing concern in recent years due to the fact that landowners could be held responsible for any personal injuries sustained by people on their property. In Ireland, the law on this matter was governed by common law precedent as established by judicial decisions handed down in previous court cases.  In Britain and Northern Ireland, the situation has been updated <Col N="1655" /> and regularised by statute law enacted through parliament, namely, the Occupiers' Liability Acts of 1957 and 1984.  It is important that farmers have available to them a clear statement of their rights, obligations and potential liabilities towards the various classes of entrants onto their holdings or properties.</P>
    <P>It is useful to evaluate the impact of this proposed legislation by a perusal of the position on occupier's liability as it stands today.  In Ireland, landowners' liability up to now has been broadly categorised, in the absence of statute law, under the common law and judicial precedents as follows: (1) In the case of invitees, who are people present on a person's land with that person's consent and from whose visit or presence a property holder may benefit in some way, the duty was to protect them from unusual dangers, which they would not expect to find; (2) with regard to licensees, people who are allowed on the land for activities such as hunting, shooting, etc. &mdash; and since these people are getting free access onto the land, they must take the land as they find it &mdash; the duty was to prevent injury from hidden dangers upon the land, if the farmer or property owner was aware of such dangers; and (3) the main area of concern for farmers and property owners alike involved trespassers.</P>
    <P>As a result of the increased use of the countryside for sport and recreational purposes, farmers in particular found themselves in a situation whereby they were uniquely exposed to the danger of claims and legal costs arising out of personal injury to entrants while on their lands.  Indeed, it must be recognised that farmers, as custodians of the countryside, have been extremely generous in ensuring that there was relatively unhindered access for sports people or tourists, despite the problems arising from the possible threat of personal injuries claims.  This hospitality and generosity to tourists, visitors and sports people has resulted in considerable benefits to the development of our tourism industry and sporting activities.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1656" /> If I were to summarise the reservations expressed to me by farm organisations and others concerning the contents of the Bill, they would revolve around the special status afforded to children and, more especially, the departure from the Law Reform Commission's majority recommendation that there should be no special status for children.  I appreciate that two members of the Law Reform Commission felt that any exception in this regard would be unconstitutional and they recommend an exception for child trespassers under the age of 12 on the basis of legislation enforced in Alberta, Canada.  I am aware of the difficulties in this regard but I am setting out what has been related to me by various people and organisations.</P>
    <P>While undoubtedly the Bill recognises the special position of children, and in determining whether an occupier's duty has been discharged, the child's age and his or her capacity to appreciate danger will be taken into account.  This is counterbalanced somewhat by the recognition that where a child is accompanied by another person, such as a parent or guardian, account will also be taken of the extent of supervision which such a person might reasonably be expected to exercise over the child's activities.  It would also appear, on reading the Minister's Second Stage speech, that this might be as far as he can go to meet the concerns of occupiers dealing with minors as there well could be a question of constitutionality if the Minister did not make special provision for children.</P>
    <P>While a minor is classified as somebody under 18 years of age, and while the courts would be in a position to differentiate between children who were close to adulthood &mdash; somebody of 17½ years of age &mdash; and those of very tender years &mdash; somebody of 7½ years of age &mdash; Perhaps the Minister might consider defining a minor for the purpose of this Act as somebody who is of an age less than 18.  I appreciate this might prove <Col N="1657" /> difficult due to the requirement of consistency of definition of &ldquo;minors&rdquo; for other legislation, especially in the social welfare and family law areas, but I believe in this case an examination along those lines might be warranted.</P>
    <P>I have listened carefully to the contributions of the various speakers in this important debate.  They were reflecting the concern of the main farming organisations who feel that they should not be held responsible for children trespassing on their land.  They believe this would place them in the role of childminders. They are concerned also about the additional duty which is being imposed over and above that which is afforded to adult trespassers.  The question posed by these organisations, and which obviously must exercise our minds as legislators, is this: why should a farmer or a home owner be held responsible for children he or she did not know were coming onto their land or property? That is the kernel of their concern if one were to summarise the position.  It might be useful to explore the concept of concurrent wrongdoers.  Possibly in the case of minors the device of the rebuttable presumption might be inserted in section 4 (3).  My suggestions are intended to be helpful and I understand the legal constraints but they might exercise the Minister's mind between now and Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The ICMSA has indicated that there should be a clear definition of &ldquo;unlawful&rdquo; set out in section 1.  I would be in favour of inserting such a definition to avoid doubt.  An unlawful entry or presence might be defined as &ldquo;the entry upon land without the expressed permission of the occupier or remaining thereon after his right to remain on has been withdrawn by the occupier or has ceased to exist&rdquo;.  This would mean a consequential adjustment in the definition of a trespasser.</P>
    <P>The aim of the Bill is to increase protection for the occupiers of land against claims by trespassers and recreational users.  For many years farmers and landowners have allowed unhibited and unrestricted access to their properties. <Col N="1658" /> The Bill deals with the conditions of the premises, i.e., danger is defined as that which is due to the state of the premises only.  Premises has been defined widely to include land, buildings, scaffolding and electricity pylons, dwellinghouses, playgrounds, etc., so that the Bill covers much more than agricultural land.  That is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for three classes of entrant &mdash; visitors, recreational users and trespassers.  These categories are somewhat vague.  It is for this reason that I have suggested that &ldquo;unlawful&rdquo; be defined more precisely as clarity is important in a Bill of this nature.</P>
    <P>Section 4 sets out the type of duty which an occupier owes to recreational users or trespassers.  That duty is (a) not to injure the person or damage his property intentionally, and (b) not to act with reckless disregard for the person or the property of the person.</P>
    <P>The section then goes on to state seven circumstances all of which shall be taken into account in determining whether an occupier has acted with reckless disregard.  Does the occupier have to satisfy all seven tests enumerated in section 4 (2) in order to be judged not to have acted with reckless disregard, or is it necessary just to meet some of the tests?  It would appear that the tests enumerated in the section deal specifically with the occupier's knowledge, actions or inactions, or the character of the premises in question. What obligation does the recreational user or trespasser have as an entrant on to a premises?  A case might be made for the elaboration of such obligations, if any, by means of tests enumerated in section 4 (2).</P>
    <P>Section 5 deals with the modification of the occupier's duty to entrants.  It provides that an occupier may by agreement or notice restrict, modify or exclude his common duty of care towards visitors and, by so doing, decide that it should only be the duty which is owed to trespassers.  For such restriction to take effect it has to be reasonable. For example, where the occupier uses a notice, he or she is obliged to take <Col N="1659" /> reasonable steps to bring the notice to the attention of the visitor.  The exact mechanism by which the occupier's duty of care to a visitor can be modified or restricted should be more clearly defined.  The reasonable steps required to ensure the notice is brought to the attention of the visitor could be outlined in the Bill.  For example, should a notice placed at the entrance to the property, or a notice circulated in a local newspaper, be sufficient to exclude or restrict the duty?</P>
    <P>Each year there are notices circulated relating to shooting on certain lands which serve as notice to the general public that a landowner will not allow shooting on his land.  Sometimes formal notices are put up on trees by gun clubs with the permission of the landowner; some are put up by landowners themselves. Is that what is intended?  It would be helpful to set out exactly what is envisaged to ensure absolute clarity. Further, are there subdivisions of the visitor category; does the same notice cover any or all of such subcategories?</P>
    <P>I pose these questions to indicate the difficulties that might be experienced in the absence of clear guidelines.  Such warnings are important because, if they are heeded by the visitor, they absolve an occupier from liability.  Therefore it would seem important to set out the means by which such notices should be brought to the attention of visitors.  If we could provide that a notice at a gate or usual entrance to a premises is sufficient, we will have done a good day's work.</P>
    <P>I appreciate what the Minister said on Second Stage indicating that the purpose of the Bill is to strike a balance between a wide range of competing interests and note that he remains open to workable amendments.  I have suggested some that I think might be workable. I hope due consideration will be given to them between now and Committee Stage because they might meet some of the concerns of farming, sporting and hill walking organisations and <Col N="1660" /> the assortment of organisations that have expressed their worry.</P>
    <P>It is vital also that the views of the farming organisations and other groups, such as the National Association of Regional Game Councils, are listened to carefully as their legislation is very important, particularly in rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on bringing forward this legislation which is important also to landowners who have national monuments and other items of our heritage located on their property which attract thousands of visitors.  All such monuments are part of our national heritage and it is in everyone's interests that access to them is not constrained by unnecessary fears about potential liabilities.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will note Members' reservations and concerns about the Bill.  When enacted, I hope the legislation will allay the fears of property owners who have given unhindered access to their properties for many years.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Bill.  Occupiers' liability is an issue that has come to the forefront of the public consciousness in recent years and it is about time we grasped the nettle and dealt with the issues that have to be resolved. However, I agree with the previous speaker that we need to strike a balance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the explanatory memorandum I noted references to common law principles which presumably predate the Constitution.  However, I would have thought that the criteria that would apply to a Bill being introduced at this time is the Constitution.  The way to find out whether the limiting of liability to children is constitutional is to pass the law and let the courts decide.  Over the years many issues were said to have raised constitutional difficulties but with <Col N="1661" /> the passage of time, without constitutional amendment, they tended to fade away.  In the sixties and seventies there was a great debate on setting limits to compensation in certain cases of planning and so on which it was felt could not be brought in because of constitutional difficulties, but the law was changed and it seems to have been effective and there has been no change in the Constitution in that regard.  If people are citing constitutional difficulties &mdash; and I note the comments in the Law Reform Commission report &mdash; it is important that they are spelt out clearly and if there is a doubt about the constitutionality of the issue, the way to find out is to refer the matter to the courts. I have no doubt that if there was a question about the constitutionally of a matter, the President, in her wisdom, would refer the Bill to the Supreme Court.</P>
    <P>We are trying to strike a balance between the rights of the property owner and the rights of a person using property but I think it should go further and strike a balance between people's fair right to compensation in certain circumstances without making things so restrictive that property owners cannot allow people on their land, in other words, if we make it so difficult for property owners in general to allow people on to their property we are, in effect, curtailing the right of the individual. A case in point is children's playgrounds in rural areas.  It became so impossible to get insurance for such playgrounds that, effectively, we were taking away the right of community groups to provide such facilities.  Not only were you causing problems for the land owner you were also causing problems for people who legitimately want to provide recreational facilities for children in reasonable circumstances.  We heard from insurers and others that even if you had a ten foot fence around a children's playground which was locked every night and somebody climbed over it in the middle of the night, you could be held liable if they injured themselves.</P>

I understand from contacts with the farming community that the IFA and other farming lobby groups very much wanted to contact the Fianna Fáil MEPs but, to their horror, they discovered that they were not accessible because the telephone numbers to the hotels in Guadeloupe were not widely available.  The Fianna Fáil Party would want to stop making attempts to embarrass this Government on such issues as its response to the very tragic plight of people in the west when, in fact, all six Fianna Fáil MEPs were high flying and sunbathing in Guadeloupe where the average rainfall is so low one would wonder what they were doing and why they could not leave telephone numbers where the IFA could contact them.</P>

It is one of the most historic rivers in the capital.  I witnessed at first hand the havoc caused by this tiny stream in flood in the Harold's Cross, Kimmage and Whitehall Road areas of my constituency.  We remember the damage caused by Hurricane Charlie when the floodwaters of the Dodder River overflowed.  Very fine cottages along the Dodder bank were destroyed as were fine houses in Donnybrook. Little Bray was devastated in the recent past and has suffered flooding on successive occasions.</P>
    <P>I extend my sympathies to farmers who have lost property and livestock. Flooding occurs somewhere in the country every year.  No party is to blame and no party has a panacea.  I welcome the Minister's comments regarding arterial drainage.  Floods are an act of God, though some people would describe them as an act of nature.  However, some of them are as a result of an act of man.  Man tried to contain the Poddle River by using concrete pipes to take its flow but they were not big enough to take the waters when the rains were sufficiently heavy to cause a flood.</P>
    <P>We have tampered with nature, reclaimed moorlands and turned them into set-aside lands which are particularly susceptible to flooding.  We must review our land use policy and strike a balance between the needs of the farming community and the environment.  I welcome the Minister's announcement yesterday that the Office of Public Works will compile a list of 90 urban areas known to experience flooding.  It is clear that the Office of Public Works is the only office capable of co-ordinating measures in this regard.  There must be a co-ordinated policy for the management of our waterways and for local authorities.  This is a contentious issue in some areas but we will not be able to avoid it in the long term.  However, in the short term, EU assistance for flood <Col N="1665" /> victims is welcome.  It is just as well we were not depending on MEPs from the Fianna Fáil Party to get those few shillings for us.</P>
    <P>As we saw on television, many areas in the European Union have been devastated by flooding.  The EU should try to devise a long term policy aimed at preventing flooding as a result of man made causes and at minimising the effects of floods.  There could be an exchange of expertise and technology, grant aiding research into the problem and compensatory funding of the kind being provided.  Unless both national and EU measures are put in place we will continue to have this debate on a yearly basis.</P>
    <P>The Government's policy and its recognition of the hardship caused by flooding is worthy of a Government of this composition.  Fianna Fáil need to be more honest in putting down Private Members' motions if they are to be taken seriously as a party in Opposition.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimKemmy" hpid="Mr. Kemmy Mr. Kemmy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kemmy</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputies Kavanagh and Connor. We are closing the stable door after the horse has bolted.  We have seen the horrors of flooding in County Galway, Sixmilebridge in County Clare and Cappamore in Limerick on television and read about it in our newspapers.  There have been graphic illustrations of how flooding has caused distress and inconvenience to many people.  Anyone who has suffered from flooding, even where a water tank overflows, knows the misery involved trying to clean up and dry out carpets, lino, books and furniture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I went to see the damage at first hand at Sixmilebridge and Cappamore where I met the Minister of State, Deputy Hogan.  As a young man in 1963 I went to Holland to study the building industry.  I saw Dutch engineers and construction workers building dams and dykes and reclaiming land from the sea. Most of Holland is below sea level. Despite the fact that it is no bigger than Munster it feeds 14 million people and exports surplus food not only to this country and to Limerick which is the <Col N="1666" /> heart of the Golden Vale but to other parts of the world.  The Dutch are practical people but despite their ingenuity, this time much of their lands were flooded.  However, we can learn a lot from them.  I would like to see local authority engineers spend some time in Holland learning how the Dutch keep the sea at bay and how they reclaim land.  We can learn a great deal from the Dutch.  Engineers, particularly those working for local authorities should spend some time in Holland seeing how the Dutch cope with excessive waters, reclaim land and keep the sea at bay most of the time.  Many of them could well benefit from such experience.</P>
    <P>On the television programme &ldquo;Questions and Answers&rdquo; on Monday evening last Mr. Ken Magennis of the Ulster Unionist Party spoke about flooding in response to a question put from the audience.  He made some very pertinent, if not profound remarks, drawing attention to the contradiction where on the one hand, many of our farmers and others with agricultural interests are reclaiming wet, sloblands while, on the other farmers are being paid to set aside land.  Surely there is something wrong in that equation, highlighting the need for greater co-ordination and a more positive policy in that respect?  Recently due to more extensive intensive farming, dykes, trenches and ditches which absorbed rain have been eliminated so that the water now flows uninhibited into rivers and streams causing the water to rise higher than adjoining lands in many regions.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Eric Byrne that prevention is better than cure.  There is no point in our throwing our hands up in horror at the problems caused by flooding in recent weeks, contending that it is a tragedy or an act of God. That is a simplistic, facile response. Rather, we must investigate regions wherever such flooding occurs, ascertaining whether it can be prevented in the future.  There is need for a co-ordinated policy between the Office of Public Works and engineers working for <Col N="1667" /> local authorities.  There is no reason, with such co-operation and planning, a recurrence of this flooding cannot be prevented.  There is no reason we cannot channel that water into rivers that can take it.  That should be a simple expedient.  Since we were able to build canals in the last century to divert waterway traffic into our rivers, there is no reason we cannot now build other canals to take this water.  A very good axiom is: a stitch in time saves nine.  A properly, co-ordinated policy involving the Office of Public Works and local authorities can prevent future flooding.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>The subject of this motion is worthy of urgent debate. Those of us representing counties badly affected by recent flooding deserve to make our cases publicly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is the first occasion I have had to congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy Hogan, on his appointment.  I know he is taking a particular interest in this problem.  Since we do not receive much publicity in Wicklow, I would ask him to take note that my county too has been very badly affected in recent weeks, while not as badly as it was during Hurricane Charlie in 1986.  Although many Wicklow residents work in RTE it appears they leave their cameras at home when they come to work, perhaps preferring to focus on other areas.  At our most recent county council meeting on Monday last we were given an estimate of the cost of repairing damage wrought on County Wicklow roads, the area engineers reporting that it amounted to some £550,000.  Yet, in our annual estimate there was no provision for it so that, if repair works are to be carried out in the course of this year, Wicklow County Council will require an additional subvention from the Minister's Department.  While flooding has not been an enormous problem for householders in County Wicklow, some households were affected recently.  The overall county roads structure has been badly damaged, particularly in the areas <Col N="1668" /> of Greystones, Bray, Wicklow, Blessington and Tinahely, all reporting considerable damage.  In one area, a road stretching for approximately half a mile in the direction of Luggala &mdash; where an interpretative centre was being constructed &mdash; was already in such bad condition, it was practically washed away in recent floods.  It is strange to observe so much money being spent on an interpretative facility while the roads leading to it remain in such bad condition, now almost beyond repair.</P>
    <P>I must emphasise that all local authorities are already very badly stretched in their estimates even to maintain their present roads structures, particularly county roads.  Indeed, the removal of practically all local authority outdoor staff by a former Minister for the Environment, now Commissioner Flynn, has meant that cuttings, gulleys and so on which were very effective in taking water from roads have become totally clogged up.  It is only at times like these that one observes such damage.  It is a quasi-saving if enormous works have to be undertaken to repair or reinstate roads formerly maintained by local authority outdoor staff who kept cuttings and gulleys clear during drier periods.</P>
    <P>Although we in Wicklow did not receive much publicity for the problems recently encountered in our area, the damage perpetrated is estimated to be in the region of £0.5 million which is not available to us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies Kavanagh, Kemmy and Eric Byrne for allowing me share some time with them.</P>
      <P>Flooding always has been an issue in Ireland, particularly along our west coast where it has constituted a serious problem.  There are very few winters when flooding does not occur.  It has been particularly acute so far this year. While welcoming the opportunity to debate the issue, one must comment on the authors of this motion which reads:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann calls on the Government to provide emergency <Col N="1669" /> funding immediately to compensate for the extensive losses incurred by our rural communities as a result of severe flooding in recent weeks.</P>
    <P>Those are fine words and we fully accept that it is a problem to be addressed.  Nonethless, that is a far cry from Fianna Fáil's response when in Government, to the flooding that occurred in my constituency and in the west generally in 1990, when it was of much greater severity than recently.  Not a single shilling was provided by the then Fianna Fáil-dominated Coalition Government when hundreds of people in my constituency had to leave their homes in the Suck and Shannon valleys. Therefore, it is a little too much to have to take some of the declaiming, cant and barefaced hypocrisy of Members opposite last evening, advising and lecturing this Government on what it should do about flooding.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NedOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. E. O'Keeffe Mr. E. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Do we experience flooding only when the Deputy's party is in Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>That is somewhat hard to take given their record on the issue.</P>
      <P>However, I welcome the fact that the Minister of State, Deputy Hogan, is to address this problem, first, by establishing an inter-Departmental committee to examine flooding nationwide. What has bedevilled our response to flooding here more than anything else has been the lack of a co-ordinated approach to its resolution.  I take it that included in the composition of that inter-Departmental committee will be the Commissioners of Public Works, for which Office the Minister of State is responsible, along with the Departments of the Environment and Agriculture, Food and Forestry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must take into account also the changed nature of practices in agriculture and industry generally, for example, those employed by Bord na Móna and their effects on the capacity of our rivers systems to carry additional waters.  For instance, over the past 40 <Col N="1670" /> years in the midlands, or even more recently, tens of thousands of acres of high boglands have disappeared, having been turned into commercial turf cutting areas, yielding milled peat and so on, particularly on the Bog of Allen and those bogs fronting the Shannon in Counties Longford, Roscommon, Offaly and elsewhere.  Nature ordained a role for those great areas of peatland and high bog which acted as huge sponges in times of heavy rainfall, absorbing billions of gallons of water and discharging it slowly into the river systems.  Nowadays, that work of nature is being interfered with, leading to water being discharged in much greater volume and at speed into our river systems.  There has been no response to this problem certainly not by way of any policy on drainage.</P>
    <P>Rather than engage in drainage of major arterial catchments, I welcome the approach to respond immediately to the type of flooding that has occurred in south Galway, in the Gort area, and to what may well happen in the Suck or Shannon valleys in counties Galway, Roscommon or Westmeath, Longford and so on.</P>
    <P>Under current legislation the Office of Public Works, the main agency which deals with flood problems, could not respond.  The new flexibility promised by an amendment to the arterial drainage Act is welcomed.  The last arterial drainage scheme was sanctioned by the then Minister for Finance, Deputy John Bruton, in the 1981 budget in which he sanctioned works on the Boyle-Bonnet drainage scheme, the headquarters of which was located in Ballaghaderreen in my constituency.  It is 14 years since the last arterial drainage scheme was sanctioned by a Government.</P>
    <P>While I agree with almost everything the Minister said last night, I notice he stated that the Boyle catchment drainage scheme will be closed later this year. I utterly disagree with that decision.  The Boyle River drainage catchment scheme will take a further two years to complete and it would be absolute folly if a decision were taken to terminate it.  If it <Col N="1671" /> is not properly completed it will result in further land and road inundation and other adverse effects of heavy rainfall.  I appeal to the Government, the Minister for Finance and his junior Minister, whom I know sympathises with me on this because I have spoken to him about it to ensure that the drainage scheme is completed.  There is no point in terminating it prematurely at the end of this year because many of its upper reaches still cause major flooding.  It would be regrettable if this scheme were terminated to facilitate generating funds to address problems elsewhere.  I regret I did not have more time as this is a subject I could debate all day as indeed could the Acting Chairman.  Thank you, Sir, for your indulgence.</P>

      <P>It is a pity because the motion put down by the Fianna Fáil Party does not adequately cover the problems that have arisen around the country.  It merely mentions the granting of compensation to rural communities for flooding damage that has occurred. It omits compensation for storm damage, it omits urban communities and any reference to the need for a study of the cause of the serious extensive flooding that has taken place, the need for a solution and how it might be brought about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The severe storms and exceptional rainfall in recent weeks left a trail of destruction across the country that has caused extreme hardship to many people living in rural and urban areas. In one sad case in Spiddal, County Galway, the storms caused mountainous seas to crash across the main road sweeping a motor car and its driver into adjoining fields resulting in the driver's tragic death from drowning.  During the night of that terrible storm coastal communities in the west, particularly along the Galway coast where the storm struck most severely, suffered a terrible battering from the high winds and seas that smashed piers, washed away roads and walls, damaged houses and other property and caused serious coastal erosion. In the Salthill-Claddagh area of Galway city private houses and business <Col N="1673" /> establishments were flooded to a depth of several feet.  In a new house which I inspected the flood waters reached a depth of seven feet in the basement. Floods in urban areas caused the added hazard of sewage overspill which, in the Galway city area, added greatly to the distress of the occupiers of houses. People in the Salthill area who had just completed mopping up after the tidal flooding had a recurrence of serious flooding within a few days because of exceptional heavy rainfall which again resulted in a backing up of the inadequate sewerage system to a depth of several feet.  I mention this because any survey of flood damage must take account of inadequacies in local authority infrastructures, the effects of new developments, pipes that may have been laid incorrectly or of the wrong size.  All of those matters contribute to serious flooding with major financial consequences for occupants of houses.</P>
    <P>The damage from the storms is extensive and local authorities should be requested to submit information to the new interdepartmental committee established under the chairmanship of the Minister of State, Deputy Hogan.  I wish the committee well but, from my experience of previous investigations carried out by Government Departments, very little action was taken subsequent in regard to damage caused by storms.  There is plenty of evidence along the Galway coast of broken piers, damaged roads and fields that have been washed away where there has been no compensation or action undertaken to rebuild the piers or repair the roads. That regrettable evidence highlights the neglect of rural communities.  Kilmurvey pier on the Aran Islands was smashed in a storm several years ago and has been neglected for many years because money has not been provided to repair it and a Government Department has not taken responsibility for it despite the fact that Galway County Council sought funds from the Department.</P>
    <P>The extensive flooding results from the extremely high rainfall and has caused serious hardship over a wide <Col N="1674" /> area of the country.  I have seen much of the damage in my constituency.  I have also seen some of the damage caused in County Carlow when I passed through it.  The consequences for the people who have suffered is horrendous. I note that the Minister in his speech last night stated that the compensation fund which the Minister will announce in the budget this afternoon will only cover non-insurable risks as a result of flooding.</P>
    <P>In all of these things where there are promises of help, the rules and regulations that apply to them exclude many deserving cases.  I hope that this clause referring to non-insurable risks will not eliminate many people who have suffered financial loss because of the damage from the storms and the floods.  The other speakers in the debate have listed the effects of the flooding on the farming community such as farmers and towns being cut off.  In my district of County Galway a national primary route has been flooded on three or four occasions over the past four years, at Kiltiernan on the Gort-Galway road and also at Labba.  It is extraordinary that with a national roads authority a national primary route linking Galway and Cork and all the southern counties can be flooded to such an extent, causing problems for passing traffic.  Any low motor vehicles would have difficulty getting through the water at its highest point.</P>
    <P>The fact that as a result of the flooding farmers are not able to grow root crops should be highlighted in any estimate of compensation because the floods in south Galway which occurred in 1990, 1991, 1994 and again in 1995 are unique.  They have occurred in an area where there is no river to take the water to the sea.  The flood water cannot escape to the sea except through subterranean streams and rivers because of the unique local geological structure.  As these floods have occurred with such frequency and been so extensive, it is surely incumbent on the parties in Government to take some positive action to ensure that they will not recur.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1675" /> The flooding in south Galway is unique because of the geological structure, the lack of an outlet to the sea for the water and, in particular, because it takes such a long time for the flood waters to recede.  Farmers there tell me that it will be April before the waters recede, which means that having lost last year's opportunity to plant root crops they are denied that opportunity again this year. The consequences of that for any farming operation are horrendous. Additional problems are caused by stock being marooned at lambing time, foxes taking away the young lambs and lambs dying from neglect in isolated areas as it is not possible to bring them where they can be watched by the farmer.  Farmers usually like to keep young lambs close to the house.</P>
    <P>Despite the pleas of Deputies, Senators, MEPs, the president of the IFA, the ICMSA, the Bishops' western conference and hundreds of individuals, nothing positive has yet been done to seek a solution to the problem in south Galway.  The lack of concern at official level has been most disappointing.  The lack of appreciation of the seriousness of this problem for the people affected, and the refusal to come to their assistance over recent years, is unforgivable and difficult to understand.</P>
    <P>Compensation is only of short term benefit.  Property owners do not want to have to live in fear of floods year after year, which is the situation that obtains in south Galway.  Up to now, their plight has been ignored by successive Ministers. Small compensation amounts were paid to some of those who suffered in the 1990 floods in south Galway but no serious effort was made to take any action that might help to avoid the flooding in later years.  We have had visits from different Ministers over those four or five years.  The most recent visit was by the Minister of State, Deputy Hogan.  Is it any wonder that cynicism about politicians is growing in the area due to a lack of action?</P>
    <P>I have files of correspondence and replies from Ministers on the issue. <Col N="1676" /> Different Ministers have been in office over the period but the result was very much the same.  We were told the matter is being looked into or there are no funds.  I wish to quote the following from a letter from the Office of Public Works:</P>
    <P>As none of the rivers in this region are included in the programme and as our resources are fully committed to our responsibilities under this programme, we are not in a position at present to pursue this matter (of undertaking drainage work which would relieve the situation).</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture and Food wrote:</P>
    <P>There are no funds available to my Department through the Exchequer or from EU sources, including the Structural Funds, for restoring agricultural production or paying compensation for losses.</P>
    <P>He said the EU disaster fund was of no use either, as it was intended to meet the immediate needs of families suffering the consequences of bad weather.  In all the efforts to try to get compensation the response has been pathetic and only last week, the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Howlin's response was most disappointing.  He went down the same road of saying that he had no responsibility, he had no funds and he generally was not going to do anything. I am pleased that this motion has at least brought about a reaction from the Government.  It has formed a committee with the Minister as chairman and there is a commitment that some funds will be paid in compensation.</P>
    <P>I wish to explain the unique position of south Galway.  A Geological Survey of Ireland report, which I commissioned as Minister for Energy, and reported in January 1992, was the only serious study undertaken in regard to the problem of flooding in south Galway.  None of the recommendations in this report have been acted upon by any of the Ministers or Governments that have been in office since it was published.  The report states:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1677" /> Water flows in several streams off Slieve Aughty and sinks underground shortly after the streams flow onto the cavernous limestones.  All the water within the large area &mdash; over 500 km² &mdash; must flow underground to Galway Bay.  (This is the point I want to emphasise.)  There is no surface outlet to Galway Bay.  The capacity of the underground drainage system to allow water to flow to Galway Bay depends on</P>
    <P>(i) the size of the conduits and caverns and</P>
    <P>(ii) the degree of clogging of the conduits.</P>
    <P>Coole Lough apears to be the hub of an extensive underground drainage system taking water from a vast area including Slieve Aughty and the limestone area to the south west.  The water then flows underground from Coole to Kinvara.</P>
    <P>The Gort-Ardrahan area is unusual and even unique in a national and European context in that</P>
    <P>(a) it contains a lowland karst limestone landscape with all the typical karst features &mdash; swallow holes, springs, turloughs, etc; and</P>
    <P>(b) it is relatively untouched by human activities, in particular by arterial drainage.</P>
    <P>According to local farmers, major flooding has occurred three times in living memory (this is a 1992 report) &mdash; 1924, 1959 and early 1990.  So (up to recent years) major floods have occurred every 25-30 years.</P>
    <P>A Preliminary Assessment of Flood Alleviation Problems [this is the Geological Survey's solution]</P>
    <P>There are four principal possible ways of alleviating the floods in the Gort-Ardrahan area:</P>
    <P>(i) Drainage channels or tunnels;</P>
    <P>(ii) Planning of forests on Slieve Aughty;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1678" /> (iii) Interception dams on Slieve Aughty; and</P>
    <P>(iv) Reduction in clogging of the swallow holes.</P>
    <P>The only way [it states] to reduce flooding is to construct extensive drainage channels or tunnels.</P>
    <P>Constructing drainage channels or tunnels would have major benefits for local people.  There would be less disruption during periods of excessive rainfall, less concern about possible flooding in the future and increased agricultural production.</P>
    <P>The report goes on to list the obstacles and disadvantages which the construction of drainage channels or tunnels would cause.  One of them, of course, is the fact that to provide such a channel from the Coole Lough area to the sea at Kinvarra would cost several million pounds, but unless that option is taken by the Government, flooding is going to recur practically on an annual basis in this part of Galway.  I urge the Minister to take remedial action in regard to the future flooding as well as the moves they have taken to provide compensation because otherwise farming in that area will become a dead loss.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NedOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. E. O'Keeffe Mr. E. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>It gives me no joy to speak on this very important motion. We all know about the hardship that many people have suffered.  I wish to congratulate the Minister on his appointment.  I am sharing my time with Deputy Ellis.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on his courage in coming in here to listen to the debate and I also want to wish him well in his position.  I look forward, as both a farmer and a politician, to working with him.  He has got off to a very good start and I compliment him on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This motion is very important.  Storm damage and heavy rain have caused massive hardship on people throughout the country.  On storms, I wish to refer to a vitally important matter and we do not have any terms of reference or code <Col N="1679" /> of practice in that area.  I refer to the great danger caused by the many trees growing on roadsides.  No one seems to have the authority to have those trees removed or to have them cut back.  They cause difficulties for people when they fall and can be a danger to life.  Local authorities should be empowered in some way to have this corrected because if not they will be the cause of loss of life.</P>
    <P>Heavy rain is part of the Irish way of life, I suppose and it has caused irreparable damage to roads and land as well as flooding rivers.  The biggest problem arising from this is that of household insurance claims.  If corrective action is not taken by the authorities people will not be able to insure their household goods because of the high cost of insurance premia.  For that reason it is vitally important that corrective action is taken by the Government.  We can talk for as long as we like about county councils and engineers.  They have the expertise to do the job but they do not have the funding to carry out the necessary works.  The county councils have many files documenting the corrective action and works that could be carried out.  I commend the engineering staff in many local authorities who, year after year, come to grips with the problems of flooding and storm damage.</P>
    <P>County roads are in a deplorable state.  We heard recently about the liner <i>Lusitania</i> and a preservation order for it is being talked about.  Given the existing potholes we will be boating on our county roads if something is not done.  I am concerned about people living in rural areas who cannot travel because of the state of the county roads.  The potholes are full of water &mdash; that is the new technology for filling potholes.  Dykes on the roads are also becoming quite a problem.</P>
    <P>I drive every week to Dublin and on the Cork side of Cullahill I have seen a mass of water on the main arterial road and no corrective action taken.  I was surprised that as late as Sunday of this week when I was travelling to Dublin <Col N="1680" /> the problem was still there.  It is highly dangerous and I appeal to the Department of the Environment to take corrective action on that road to remove the danger caused by the flooding.  It is an ongoing problem, it did not just happen this year.</P>
    <P>I listened with interest to Deputy Kemmy.  Tragically, all Fine Gael and Labour Governments have always been identified with bad weather.  We lost a hay crop under a Coalition Government and there was little compensation available to farmers &mdash; it was an historic year in agriculture.  Deputy Kemmy spoke about Holland.  Had our flooding been as bad as Holland we would all have been drowned because of the policy of this Government.  Many areas in Holland are below sea level and dykes have been built to protect them.  The Deputy talked about the leaks; there have been more leaks this week than ever before. The budget has been leaked and, like the rain, it is flooding.</P>
    <P>A sum of £2 million for flood damage is practically worthless.  We have to be realistic; £2 million would not solve the problems of County Cork.  I live in the Blackwater valley and we were lucky this year that the area did not flood. However, I can remember years when we had three huge floods which destroyed the towns of Mallow and Fermoy, and many of the villages and the farming land in the area.  We were promised support and funding in the past but we never got it.  We are an island nation but we will have a great number of islands inland if we do not take corrective action.</P>
    <P>Rivers are not being cleaned; they are overgrown with trees, briars and scrub which further aggravates the problem. Because of the floods there have been large losses of livestock and sheep which many farmers can ill afford.  There was a loss of fodder where farmyards were flooded, etc.  Compensation must be provided in those cases.  Farmers' livelihoods have suffered severely and they have no way of making a living unless they get compensation.  It is the small farmers who suffer most.  I am proud of <Col N="1681" /> Fianna Fáil's record with regard to compensation; we have always looked after the people in rural areas, especially the small farmers.  It is the party which has always done what it could for rural Ireland and I am proud to speak on this motion.</P>
    <P>An interdepartmental committee is being set up by the Office of Public Works, the Department of the Environment and the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry.  I am glad the Minister of State, Deputy Hogan, is to be its chairman.  He was involved in co-ordinating the budget, and it appears to be a good budget.  If he has the same clout and can put the same effort into this committee there will be a lot more than £2 million available.</P>
    <P>Slurry at farm level is of concern to everybody.  We have huge volumes of slurry now stored at farm level and the problem is aggravated by the heavy rainfall.  I suggest that the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry make funding available because it is important that assistance is given to the farming community by way of a new grant system. The volume of effluent at farm level at present is huge; it cannot be disposed of and if it overflows it will affect many rivers and cause problems.  This serious problem caused by the volume of effluent and intensive agriculture must be recognised.  Unlike other countries where intensive farming is practised, no farmer here, big or small, has the storage capacity to cope with the weather in Ireland.  A special concession must be made available to Irish farmers for the storage and disposal of slurry. This must be looked at in a special light. I have no doubt the Minister will take the matter in hand.</P>
    <P>Flash floods are highly dangerous; they have serious effects in many areas. Heavy downpours cause hardship to many people, including the elderly. They can damage carpets, furniture and homes.  A more sympathetic approach should be adopted by the community welfare officers and the health boards who should rescue and assist those <Col N="1682" /> people.  Damp homes are not comfortable or desirable for old people.  There are solutions to these problems and the health boards should be advised by the Minister for Health and the Minister for Social Welfare to deal with them in a sympathetic way.  In many instances this is not done because a flood is seen as an act of God.  I support the motion.  I have no doubt we will see more than £2 million provided in the budget to meet this problem.  I am glad to see the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry is here to listen to what I have to say about the farming community.  I know his heart is in the right place and I have no doubt that he will take note of my appeal for grant aid for slurry storage given the weather we have had.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>Having listened to the Minister of State last night I am worried about what he proposes to do <i>vis-à-vis</i> changes in arterial drainage legislation. A reply to a parliamentary question I put yesterday states:</P>
      <P>The proposal to amend the provisions of existing drainage legislation will provide the mechanism to enable the Commissioners of Public works to deal with localised flooding, in particular urban flooding, on a countrywide basis as opposed to the existing catchment scheme approach.  These proposals are under consideration in the Department of Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This shows that the Minister of State does not intend to do anything about some of the problems which have arisen in my constituency with regard to unfinished work.  I was glad to hear Deputy <Col N="1683" /> Connor say he was not happy about the unfinished work on the Boyle river scheme.  The Office of Public Works will now act like Pontius Pilate and wash its hands of what had been agreed by the previous Minister of State, Deputy Dempsey, that a revision of the arterial drainage legislation would allow for the introduction of small alleviation schemes for farm loss caused by flooding. I hope that at this late stage the Bill as originally proposed by Deputy Dempsey will be enacted.</P>
    <P>It might be more appropriate to raise this matter if the Ceann Comhairle were here, but a question I put down to the Minister for the Environment to know if he will give supplementary grants to local authorities to repair damage done to county roads caused by the recent storms, and the amount he will provide to each local authority was refused.  It was refused because the Minister for the Environment is not prepared to tell the people of rural Ireland what he intends to do with the allocations in the budget for county and regional roads.  I hope that what I have heard on the grapevine is not true, that is, that it is intended to cut the amount that will be available for county and regional roads.</P>
    <P>I see the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry smiling.  He represents a rural constituency, but perhaps not as rural as the area I represent, County Leitrim, which only has 11 miles of national primary roads.  If the money for county and regional roads is cut by the drastic amount which we are led to believe, rural dwellers will be left in the same position in which they were left by the last Coalition when it cut the allocation for county roads on an annual basis in its period of office.  The result was that every rural road was left in a mess and the incoming Fianna Fáil Government had to deal with the problem. This continued to be dealt with during the Coalition with the Progressive Democrats and during the lifetime of the last Government &mdash; the Fianna Fáil-Labour Government &mdash; when substantial improvements were made.  The <Col N="1684" /> work which the Department of the Environment did under Deputy Smith by providing money for the improvement of county and regional roads is a credit to him.  I hope what I have heard is not true, but I am reliably informed that the cuts will cause major problems for local authorities.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister for the Environment to provide money to deal with the recent storm damage to roads but it appears that he is not prepared to do this.  Local authorities and rural dwellers will be left to suffer as they have before under Coalition Governments.  We are aware of the damage caused to farmland by flooding; we have seen the frightening pictures of flooded farms.  Last night on television we saw houses where water levels had reached the window boards.  This calls for immediate action. Although Deputy O'Keeffe mentioned £2 million as a possible allocation, I believe £20 to £50 million is needed.</P>
    <P>The establishment of an intergovernmental committee to examine the position is not the way to deal with this problem.  I am puzzled as to whether it was an afterthought by the Minister of State last night because it did not appear in his speech to the House yesterday. It was probably because he felt the heat was being turned on. Intergovernmental committees examine and report, but they cannot do anything if the necessary funds are not provided. The Government must provide sufficient funds.</P>
    <P>Proper and long term assistance must be given to deal with the problems caused by this storm.  There is no use saying that when the floods subside everyone will be all right.  In my area I have seen land which was flooded as a result of work on the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell Canal.  The damage which has been done to that land is permanent even when the flood subsides.  This means that while compensation is paid in some cases, it is still under consideration in other cases.  I appeal to the Government to provide sufficient funds <Col N="1685" /> in today's budget for the farming community and local authorities to get them over this hardship.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no doubt that the recent flooding has caused considerable problems and indeed individual trauma for those living in the affected areas. Neither I nor the Government need any convincing about that fact.  My immediate concern is the impact on the agricultural sector and on farm families in particular. Large areas of agricultural land have been subject to flooding of varying degrees of severity.  This flooding has impacted on pastures, farmyards, buildings and silage pits.  There have been losses of feed and some loss of livestock. I am aware of the hardship experienced from my travels, from meetings and from meeting with Deputies and Senators from my party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department has carried out a preliminary assessment on the consequences of flooding, which I asked for early last week.  While a lot of the flooding has receded, local problems still persist. My officials are still receiving reports on a daily basis from different counties.  The preliminary report suggests there are severe problems in Counties Galway, Roscommon, Clare, Carlow, Westmeath, Limerick and Offaly.  While these reports are not complete, a considerable volume of data has been assembled.  There are precedents <Col N="1686" /> for relief measures, for example, in 1986 and 1990.</P>
    <P>I will refer to some of the speeches made.  The sum of money made available in 1990 was £700,000 and in 1993 and 1994 no moneys were made available for mainline farming, although there was something for fruit and vegetables. In fact, one of the difficult files I have inherited relates to individual farmers who incurred substantial losses and who nearly went out of business in 1993 and 1994.  I am now endeavouring to resolve that difficulty.</P>
    <P>I want to achieve an adequate response which will be available quickly.  I understand the consequences for farmers whose feed has been destroyed and whose pasture has been flooded or waterlogged.  My colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Hogan, referred to the establishment of an interdepartmental committee last night and my Department will actively participate in it. There have been suggestions that this should be the responsibility of one Department.  I do not believe that is realistic because flooding by nature impacts on different sectors and activities. A range of skills, expertise and resources are required from different Departments to deal with this effectively. I assure Deputies that the full and active co-operation of my Department will not only be forthcoming but will be vigorous.  In the long term we must look at the amendment of the Arterial Drainage Act to give the Office of Public Works more broadly based and effective statutory powers.  This would be an important step.</P>
    <P>I would strongly support a programme which would find solutions to localised flooding.  I am confident that farmers will be able to recover.  My colleague, the Minister for Finance, will deal with this matter this afternoon in his budget statement.  I do not wish to pre-empt any announcements he may wish to make.  However, I am satisfied that the resources which will be available from any Government decision in this regard will be adequate to meet <Col N="1687" /> agricultural needs.  I advise farmers with particular problems to contact the Farm Development Service and Teagasc to have their losses of livestock and fodder validated and independently verified. As far as my office is concerned, there will be the utmost co-operation in ensuring that losses of livestock and fodder will be met.  While I do not want to get into specifics, I would like to accord my appreciation of the understanding which I have received on this matter from the Minister for Finance and my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Hogan.</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>No, because there is an interdepartmental committee and a number of Departments will be involved.  My area of responsibility is in relation to fodder and livestock losses. The Minister for Finance will address this matter and I am satisfied that any scheme will be as good as the previous one, not the fruit and vegetable scheme but the nationwide scheme which applied in 1990.</P>
      <P>The compilation of the report in relation to the worst affected areas is nearing completion.  We want it to be as full and as accurate as possible.  I hope that will be done shortly.  Arising from what the Minister for Finance will say this afternoon, if administrative arrangements are necessary, I will not be tardy in facilitating any scheme put in place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some of my colleagues, including Deputy Flanagan, have asked about disadvantaged areas and the reclassification and extension file which has been going on for many years.  When I took office on 14 December I was dissatisfied with the lack of progress which had been made on this issue.  I am meeting a Commission official on Friday to convey to him what I have already conveyed to Commissioner Flynn, that is, that I am not satisfied with the way this issue has been dealt with to date.  I will <Col N="1688" /> ask that early progress be made.  There are a number of problems but I sympathise with the point made by Deputy Flanagan.</P>
    <P>I assure the House that the Government is understanding, sympathetic and concerned with the losses that many people, particularly those in the agricultural sector, have suffered.  Having heard the Minister for Finance's statements on the matter this afternoon, any fair and reasonable minded person will have to conclude this Government is acting positively and decisively in this area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>As I represent much of the waterlogged part of the country, comprising the bulk of the Laois-Offaly constituency.  I am pleased to have the opportunity to participate in this debate.</P>
      <P>I compliment my party colleagues, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Yates, and his junior colleague, Deputy Hogan, who is also in charge of the Office of Public Works, for the speed with which they reacted to this serious problem.  I have no doubt that in the Budget Statement this afternoon will be some type of compensation package that constituents of mine have been seeking over the last few weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My constituents, especially those in west Offaly and south-east Laois, have experienced much trauma due to flooding. I am speaking particularly of the lands comprising the Shannon basin and those farmers attempting to farm land in the basin of the rivers Clodigh and Brosna in west Offaly.  Areas like Clara and Shannon harbour, Mucklagh, Belmont and Rahan have been under severe pressure over the last few weeks. Livestock has been lost and fodder has been depleted.  The difficulty experienced must be considered in the context of parts of County Offaly being under water for months on end annually, curtailing farming activities.  This simply has to stop.  Householders in Gregcullen, at the far end of my constituency, are being subjected annually to evacuation from their private dwellings. Houses and householders in parts <Col N="1689" /> of my constituency are unable to obtain adequate insurance cover because of the high risk involved and that too should be addressed.</P>
    <P>I take some solace from the fact that the Minister of State is moving swiftly to set up the interdepartmental committee. I look forward to an early report but I now call on the Minister to co-ordinate all the agencies involved &mdash; the local authorities, Laois and Offaly County Councils and the relevant State agencies.  The ESB and Bord na Móna, for example, have a constructive approach to containing flood waters with special reference to the River Shannon.  There is a role for the farming organisations, the IFA, the ICMSA, the UFA, the Department of Agriculture Food and Forestry, the Department of the Environment and the Office of Public Works in this effort.  We need a co-ordinated approach rather than allowing one Department to take responsibility on one occasion and another on the next.  The approach must be to provide assistance to people who are suffering, farmers and householders in particular.  That committee must also ultimately produce a programe of action to avoid this hardship during the months of January, February and March of each year.  I address these points particularly to the Minister for Agriculture Food and Forestry, the Minister for the Environment and the Office of Public Works.</P>

      <P>I welcome this new interdepartmental committee and compliment both the Minister for Agriculture Food and Forestry and the Minister of State at that Department for setting it up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why does it take a drastic flood before people realise that something is wrong?  In south County Mayo, for instance, small farmers in the Ballinrobe area have had this problem for 15 years and this year is no different.  I have written to the Department of Agriculture Food and Forestry and the Office of Public Works asking them to investigate this problem.  I know of a small farmer <Col N="1690" /> whose holding is flooded for nine months of the year.  He has to travel 15 miles to get around to his farm.  It takes flooding in the midlands and elsewhere to highlight this problem.  The Minister should not wait, the problem gets worse every year.  I agree with Deputy Flanagan that the county councils, the Office of Public Works and other interested parties should get together in the months ahead, especially during the summer months, and not just pass the buck as has happened in the past.</P>
    <P>I will keep a close eye on the Minister over the next seven months to see what is happening.  I hope we get some funding from the European Union to tackle this problem, but I also hope problems which have occurred for the past 16 years will also be examined.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the intention to amend the Arterial Drainage Act.  The river Maigue was dredged a few years ago but some of its tributaries and streams have created problems over the years, especially for farmers who live adjacent to them.  It is frustrating that these tributaries cannot be dredged at present but I hope they will be dealt with when this amendment is made.</P>
      <P>With regard to the recent excessive rainfall and flooding, our hearts go out to those we saw on television in various locations around County Galway who had to use boats to gain access to their properties.  The village of Foynes in County Limerick, which is in my constituency, has been subjected to flooding on two successive occasions.  I visited some of the premises in the area and saw the frustrations of the people and the havoc that can be caused by flooding. Responsibility probably comes down to the local authority and the Office of Public Works.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When one analyses the cause of a flooding problem one often discovers that culverts were blocked with pallets and all kinds of debris and watercourses were not cleaned out.  Maintenance is an aspect, that could be considered here. Within local authorities there has been a considerable erosion of the manpower <Col N="1691" /> allocated to work on the roads so that culverts and drains are not properly maintained.  Officials, have told me this is because of constraints on manpower resources.  I would like to think people would be taken from the community enterprise development programme to do this kind of work.</P>
    <P>It is sad to see excessive flooding on national primary and secondary routes, which also take a heavy volume of traffic.  One would have to ask why this happens?  It happens in many cases due to a drainage problem on the sides of those roads because the local authorities do not have the manpower resources to properly maintain watercourses and drains and to open up culverts.  This interdepartmental committee should address this specific area or else there will be a similar problem when excessive rainfall occurs next this year and the following year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MJNolan" hpid="Mr. Nolan Mr. Nolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Matt Brennan and Deputy Cowen.</P>
      <P>Serious flooding has affected County Carlow for the third time in five years. Houses and businesses have been seriously damaged by the recurrence of this flooding.  Since February 1990 there has been a regular pattern of flooding of the river Barrow south of Athy.  Prior to 1990 farmers, business people and householders living and working in low-lying areas of the river Barrow could expect to be affected by an overflow from the river on a very irregular basis, mainly as a result of unusually heavy rainfall but, since 1990, the pattern of flooding has been once every 18 months.  One must assume from this pattern that this will be an ongoing problem and must be faced up to by the authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The area most affected by flooding is the low-lying area of Carlow town, where the river Burrin flows into the river Barrow.  A combination of continuous heavy rain in south Leinster has resulted in this part of Carlow being <Col N="1692" /> subject to flooding which is caused by the back-up of the River Burn and the River Barrow overflowing its river walls upstream off Carlow town.  The recent flooding has caused the closure of the national secondary route, the N9 at Kennedy Street, Carlow.  The result of the closure of this road means that traffic travelling from the south-east, most importantly from the ferry port in Rosslare, to the midlands and west, who use this access have had to divert through Athy, Ballylynen and Stradbally. Commuters using Graigcullen bridge have had to use a six mile diversion to get from one side of the river to the other.  The flooding has brought business in this part of Carlow town to a stop.  While motorists have had to endure the discomfort and nuisance of making a detour to avoid this section of road, it was a very minor annoyance compared to the hardship inflicted on the householders and businesses immediately affected in the low-lying area of the town.</P>
    <P>Until 1990 businesses and individuals in the affected area had little difficulty in securing storm and flood damage insurance for their properties.  However, they have now found it impossible to get insurance for their own property.  They have told me that no insurance company will now even quote them for cover.  If something is not done immediately for these unfortunate families by the Government or the Department, they will be left in a very serious financial situation. An immediate and very effective means of giving help to these individuals would be to subsidise their insurance premia.  Insurance companies have confirmed that there are only two or three areas in the country where they will not quote for flood damage insurance because of the history of claims in these areas.  This part of Carlow town is included as one of these black spots for flood damage insurance.  I ask the Minister to consider mandating insurance companies to impose a small levy on all household and commercial insurance to cover the extra risk in granting <Col N="1693" /> insurance to individuals affected by this problem.</P>
    <P>It should be pointed out that the history of flooding has meant that individuals have taken certain precautions to minimise the damage caused by flooding. It should also be pointed out that people who live and work in this area are aware, at least a few hours in advance, of the possibility of flood water damaging their premises.  They always make every effort to move their goods and household effects to reduce the risk of damage.  The Minister might also consider giving a small subsidy to the insurance companies to cover their increased exposure as a result of insuring families unfortunate enough to live and work in the affected areas.  In the motor insurance business the Minister for Enterprise and Employment can insist on insurance companies quoting individuals who previously had motor insurance with them.  Perhaps the same regulations could apply to flood damage insurance.  This is an area at which the Minister can look sympathetically.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MattBrennan" hpid="Mr. M. Brennan Mr. M. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister, Deputy Yates, and the Minister of State, Deputy Hogan and wish them every success.  This has been a terrible year for flooding, not just in Ireland but all over Europe.  I will briefly dwell on flooding in my own constituency. This has been a problem for a number of years on the Arrow and Owenmore river basins.  I fully understand and appreciate the concerns of people living in these areas.  For many years they have had to put up with waterlogged farms and holdings and have watched helplessly as their lands were flooded during heavy rainfalls, not just in winter but in summer.  They have sometimes lost crops, hay and silage and their grazing and pasture lands have been damaged because there was no effective drainage scheme.  County roads, in particular have also been affected.  This flooding covers approximately 29,000 acres and over 3,000 farmers are affected.  Many of these farms are small and fragmented, with an <Col N="1694" /> average size of 35 to 40 acres, much smaller than farms in the Minister's constituency.</P>
      <P>When Deputy Nealon spoke on this motion last night, he stated that just as these rivers and the Mulcair came to the top of the list and were about to be drained, the previous Government decided to abandon arterial drainage. This is not the case.  I remind Deputy Nealon that when his party was in Government in 1986, the priorities attached to arterial drainage were changed and, as a result, the European Commission took a decision not to support arterial drainage.  It was not until Mr. Ray MacSharry became Minister for Agriculture in 1987 that an environmental impact assessment was ordered on the Arrow and Owenmore rivers. During the Order of Business last Tuesday, this was raised in my absence when I was attending a Council of Europe meeting.  Deputy Dempsey asked the Taoiseach when he expected the amending of legislation to allow arterial drainage to be brought forward.  The Taoiseach's reply was that legislation had not been promised by the Government. I hope the work done by Deputy Noel Treacy and Deputy Dempsey to change the Arterial Drainage Act will be continued by the Minister of State, Deputy Hogan, and I am sure it will be. Until this Act is changed, rivers like the Arrow and Owenmore rivers cannot be drained.</P>

      <P>I hope the officials in his Department will be as accessible to me as they are to certain vested interests. An indication has been given that they will be and I am sure this is so.  We are delighted, as a result of the motion we put down, that the alternative Government on this side of the House is getting <Col N="1695" /> some response to what has been a catastrophic month for many people because of the unprecedented flooding throughout the country.  As Deputy Brennan pointed out, in this House we got a commitment from the Taoiseach that he knew of the existence of a proposed reform of the arterial drainage legislation and, after much following up by himself and me last week in the House, he agreed to prioritise that legislation. That was indicative of the indifference this Government has had towards a catastrophic situation for many families throughout Ireland.</P>
      <P>The farming sector is most vulnerable and has been hard hit.  Smaller livestock farmers, dry stock and suckler farmers, the 70,000 dry stock farmers who have an average income of £3,300 per year, the small farmers of west Offaly, south Roscommon, east and south Galway, Clare, west Limerick and west Tipperary have suffered year in year out over many years.  According to the Minister with responsibility for the Office of Public Works the recent floods are the worst since 1947 and I have no reason to disbelieve him.</P>
      <P>We have not seen the type of response one would expect from a Government to what has been an unprecedented problem.  I take no comfort from the Minister's undertaking to the House that we will have a scheme as good as the 1990 scheme to deal with that local problem.  There is an unprecedented flooding problem &mdash; the worst in almost 50 years &mdash; spanning ten or 12 counties, and we are being told that the Government will at least meet the more localised needs similar to the 1990 scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In response to this motion, we expect a scheme which is just as unusual as the flooding.  The Government has only acted in response to the alternative Government on this side of the House which tabled this motion.  There were no speeches in the PR machine from Minister Yates or Minister Hogan who was a bit slower off the draw.  We have had no such commitment, just a &ldquo;please get <Col N="1696" /> in touch with us immediately if you have any problems&rdquo;.  That is the first time we have heard that, and it came today in response to the Fianna Fáil motion.</P>

      <P>A man in my parish lost 58 ewe lambs which were drowned last week on a Clara farm.  I am sure the Minister can expect a registered letter from him.  According to my inquiries, no one is aware of any detailed evaluation taking place, within the farm advisory services in particular, to decide the level of loss.  Last night the Minister of State, Deputy Hogan, in his excuse for a speech, said that &ldquo;the question of compensation should be examined.  I will bring the matter to the attention of the appropriate Ministers.&rdquo;  He went on and said he was very concerned at the widespread hardships that flooding was causing and expressed his concern for all those who have suffered hardship, and his appreciation for the magnificent response of the emergency services everywhere.</P>
      <P>If we had half the magnificent response from our Government as we have had from the emergency services trying to deal with a catastrophe in half this country, perhaps we would not have heard the mealy-mouthed assurances we heard in this House last night and today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is the most leaked budget in the history of the State and we were told last week about a £7.5 million compensation scheme.  In this morning's <i>Irish Independent</i> we are told that it is £2 million, so there is obviously a bit of shaking down going on at the moment. Quite clearly when there are three parties in Government everyone has to get a piece of the action and a piece of the cake.  I am sure we will have many claiming credit for it before the evening <Col N="1697" /> is out.  It may be that that is the reason for the afterthought about an interdepartmental committee, because it is not in the Minister's speech.  I listened to &ldquo;Morning Ireland's&rdquo; Oireachtas report this morning and first on the list was the important announcement by Minister of State, Deputy Hogan, that we will have an interdepartmental committee to look into this problem.  It was not so important that he could include it in his speech.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>Clearly it was an afterthought when he was coming to the House.  He asked his colleagues, &ldquo;is there anything else I can say, apart from this, which is aspirational to the tune of `we'll have a united Ireland but not yet'?&rdquo; It is a clear case of a Government that has no strategy to deal with a catastrophy. Perhaps the reason we have not seen such a great response is because it affects smaller farmers &mdash; the small livestock, dry stock and suckler farmers &mdash; who are not particularly flavour of the month with the parties in power.  They are not from the strong milk lobby nor the big grain lobby.  Many of them are part-time farmers on an average annual income of £3,300.  We want action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the midlands we have had an unprecedented increase in acreage due to previous extensions and reclassifications under the disadvantaged areas scheme operated by the former Ministers for Agriculture, Senator Michael O'Kennedy and Deputy Joe Walsh.  Up <Col N="1698" /> to 72 per cent of my county was thus affected.  We have always said that the Shannon valley basin was a case that needed reclassification as of right because of the perennial problem there.</P>

      <P>The Tánaiste and I had a very constructive meeting on 3 February with an Alliance Party delegation comprising Dr. John Alderdice, Mr. Seamus Close and Mr. Seán Neeson.</P>
      <P>This was the third in a series of meetings with Northern Ireland political parties. Developments in the peace process dominated our discussions.  The Alliance delegation placed special emphasis on the early completion of the framework document as a basis for a process of political dialogue towards an agreed settlement.  They are strongly supportive of all efforts in that regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry, Sir, I have not because the purpose of the Taoiseach's meeting with the Alliance Party was to discuss the peace process and this has a bearing on it.  Does the Taoiseach know who might have been involved in placing that bomb?  Is he satisfied that the Provisional IRA was not involved?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously this matter was not discussed at my meeting with the Alliance Party because that meeting was held before the event to which the Deputy referred.  I am not in a position to comment on the matter at this stage, but I hope to be informed about it as soon as possible.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no question of a delay in the publication of the framework document.  Much progress has been made on the issues which remain to be dealt with.  A few issues remain to be settled and they are being actively pursued at official level.  The Tánaiste will meet Sir Patrick Mayhew again in the near future &mdash; I think on 14 February &mdash; and we expect to make continuous progress on the matter.  I understand the concern of everybody, including the Alliance Party, that the framework document is concluded as soon as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach concerned at the fact that based on last week's leaks a Unionist alliance is being formulated to object in advance to certain sections of the framework document? Would it not be better to give factual information to the people in Northern Ireland rather than have alliances established based on false information?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The idea of people and parties forming a bloc is particularly unhelpful.  It is very important that parties on all sides of the traditional divide keep an open mind on the framework document until it is published.  I have assured all concerned that from this Government's perspective &mdash; and I am confident the same applies to the British Government &mdash; it is intended to produce a balanced and fair document that will create circumstances in which people from both traditions in Northern Ireland feel at home in their communities and valued for their traditions and contribution to the future.  The difficulty in regard to Northern Ireland is that in different senses both communities have not felt like that in the past; for one reason or another they have felt a sense of isolation.  The purpose of the framework document is to create those conditions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>To my recollection I do not believe they expressed particular concern in that regard.  The Alliance Party indicated it is not in favour of a general amnesty for paramilitary prisoners, something which is not contemplated. However, it understands fully that the commitment of certain organisations to give up violence creates new conditions in which it may be necessary to objectively re-evaluate individual prisoners, the length of their sentences and the likelihood of them reoffending. That is what this Government has been doing.</P>

      <P>The Fianna Fáil Leader, Deputy Leader and myself also attended the excellent meeting with members of the Alliance Party last Friday. In response to an earlier question from my party leader relating to the framework document, the Taoiseach placed great emphasis on the work being done by the Civil Service.  Does he accept that the experts have done months and months of work and what is required at this stage is a political input at the highest level, namely, by the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister? Does the Taoiseach agree that it is in everybody's interest that there should be an early meeting &mdash; not just a signing ceremony &mdash; to complete the negotiations? Will he take the initiative in organising such a meeting?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The factual position is that substantial progress was made at every meeting which took place between officials to date.  The number of issues on which the sides are at variance has been reduced steadily by the officials who are extremely familiar with all the issues involved.  I am satisfied with the progress they are making.  I have, of course, maintained close contact with the British Prime Minister, I have spoken to him in the past week or so about the matter.  Whenever I feel an intervention is necessary to move things forward.  I will make it.  The officials, particularly the Tánaiste, are handling this matter in a purposeful and effective manner.</P>

No obligation has been placed on any officeholder to publish a statement of their interests on a centralised basis.  The declarations I have received are not in a form suitable for publication because some of the information provided deals with interests of third parties such as spouses and other relatives.  I do not believe it was envisaged at any stage that such information would be published, even under the Ethics in Public Office Bill.  The decision I have taken, <Col N="1706" /> which I outlined in response to a previous question by the Deputy in regard to Cabinet Ministers, will also apply to Ministers of State.  Government members will publish all information promptly, in full compliance with the Ethics in Public Office Bill when it becomes law, having been finalised by both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>

      <Quest>the specific changes, if any, which have been introduced since November 1994, in the Attorney General's Office in relation to the handling of extradition matters in the wake of the Brendan Smyth affair,; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The new extradition arrangements, which were put in place by the former Attorney General, Mr. Harold Whelehan, SC, following the Brendan Smyth case, continue in operation under the present Attorney General. These are that the Attorney General is notified, in writing, immediately every request for extradition is received in the office and that he is given details of the request.  Thereafter, he is given, in writing, regular reports of the progress in the office on the request.  These arrangements enable the Attorney General to be personally aware, at all times, of all extradition requests and to monitor their progress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Are these changes a recognition that the role of the Attorney General in extradition matters is quasi-judicial? Will the Taoiseach give a guarantee that the handling of such extradition cases will not be delegated to officials in the future?  Will the Attorney General, should the need arise, be permitted to address this House to account for the discharge of the functions of his office?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The latter is a separate question.  In regard to the first two questions it is arguable that the role of the Attorney General in these matters is quasi-judicial.  The difficulty is that it raises questions in regard to political accountability in regard to quasi-judicial activity.  For example, judges are not made accountable to the Dáil. Obviously this raises a number of very fine judgments about the appropriate constitutional proprieties.  So far as delegation of these files is concerned, it <Col N="1708" /> would not be practical to assume that any Attorney General could handle these files entirely on his or her own without the assistance of officials.  The arrangements which were put in place by the previous Attorney General but one are that he must be notified on the arrival of each application and he must be notified regularly of the progress of the case.  Those arrangements will preclude a recurrence of the Fr. Brendan Smyth type case.  The main concern in that area was in regard to the delay which had occurred.  By ensuring that the Attorney General has an appropriate tracking system in regard to any files, for which he must be responsible, delays of that kind are far less likely to occur than was ever the case previous to the introduction of those arrangements.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach accept that under the Extradition (Amendment) Act, 1987, the Attorney General had an obligation to deal with those matters?  Will he now accept that that Act was breached in the Brendan Smyth case?  Will the Taoiseach agree that one of the most glaring issues highlighted by the Brendan Smyth affair was that in some cases the role of the Attorney General as political adviser to the Government can be in conflict with his separate role as protector of the public interest?  This is a view on which the Fine Gael Party was vocal in Opposition. Will the Taoiseach accept the need to examine the role of the Attorney General in the long term?</P>

      <P>The second part of the Deputy's supplementary is a separate question; it is an attempt by the Deputy to ask the third part of her last question in a different form.  It would be better if she tabled a question on the broad issues of the role of the Attorney General if that is a matter she wishes to ventilate.  It would not be proper for me to give an answer to the first part of the question because that matter is under examination by a committee of this House which has yet to report.  If I were <Col N="1709" /> to attempt to answer the Deputy's question which suggests there was a breach of the 1987 Act in this case by a particular person, I would be encroaching on the proper functions of the committee and I do not think the Deputy would expect me to do that.</P>

Is it intended in the Dáil reform package, as suggested, that the Government would call officeholders before committees?  Is it intended that the Attorney General would also come before these committees in future?

I cannot answer those questions.  They are separate questions and I would be grateful if the Deputy would table questions about them.  The question I have been asked by Deputy O'Donnell concerns the handling of extradition matters.  So far as extradition matters are concerned I can assure the Deputy that the most effective systems of information technology will be used to speed up the processing of these cases, in addition to the safeguards I have already outlined where the Attorney General must be kept personally acquainted of the case on an ongoing basis.  That is the position so far as the question is concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of staff in the office is 28, of whom 12 are lawyers. However, one of these legal positions is filled on a job-sharing basis.  The efficiency of the office has been the subject of constant internal scrutiny and review and no external review has ever been deemed necessary.  Nevertheless, I will continue to keep the efficiency of the office under review and examine all possibilities for its further improvement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach accept that the efficiency of this arm of the criminal justice system is vital to a credible criminal justice system?  The fact that there has never been an external audit or evaluation of the efficiency or accountability of that office is a matter that will have to be considered.  I remind the Taoiseach that he and the former spokesperson on Justice, Deputy Gay Mitchell, were foremost in this House in expressing the need for greater accountability.  Will the Taoiseach agree that no public office should be so independent as to be unac-countable?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a difference between efficiency and accountability. The independent Director of Public Prosecutions and his office must operate to the highest standards of efficiency.  I encourage all offices in the Government service to have from time to time an external audit of their efficiency.  One should not be complacent that no such audit has been carried out in the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions. It should be a normal and unthreatening <Col N="1714" /> process for any office to invite an independent review of its efficiency from time to time, and I will pass on that view to all offices under my aegis.  On the accountability of the Director of Public Prosecutions' office, that is an entirely different matter.  We are talking here about accountability to the Dáil for the prosecution or non-prosecution of particular cases and that raises extremely difficult and separate issues.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the Taoiseach's reply but does he not accept there is a genuine reason for concern in this regard?  Some mechanism should be considered as a matter of urgency to ensure that cases are dealt with as efficiently as possible.  I note the Taoiseach said no outside review has taken place and perhaps that is one mechanism that could be considered.  For example, four years ago as Minister I referred the Aer Lingus Holidays case to the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions and I am not sure whether it has been dealt with.  Are there other such examples and will the Taoiseach publish a list of the cases that have been there for one year, four years or five years?  That would, without transgressing on the independence of the office, allow for answerability or accountability to this House, which is dear to the Taoiseach's heart.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important to point out that section 2 (5) of the Prosecution of Offences Act, 1974, which established the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, states specifically that the director shall be independent in the performance of his functions. Conducting an independent audit of the way that office works is among his functions and his independence in that regard is guaranteed.  I am not in a position to direct him to take action along the lines suggested by the Deputy. The Deputy's question is well thought <Col N="1715" /> out and I have no doubt that the reasonable suggestions implicit in it will be considered, as they should be.</P>

Will he consider amending the Act to permit the office holder, whoever that may be, to come before a Dáil committee from time to time?  Members of my party and, I understand, some members of his party, put forward that proposal at various times.  At one stage we discussed this possibility with the Labour Party during our negotiations for Government.  I understand this proposal is central to the Taoiseach's view on how the Dáil should operate.  Senior office holders should come before committees in a dignified way and give appropriate information to them.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The establishment of the independent office of the Director of Public Prosecutions was a major step forward in the sense that it took the decisions about prosecution in particular offences out of the political or quasipolitical arena.  Hitherto this matter was ultimately for decision by the Attorney General who was the legal adviser to a Government which was politically composed. There were always concerns about the risks of politicisation of decisions in regard to prosecutions and non-prosecutions.  A good decision was taken to cut the link between the political system and the decisions about prosecutions. The difficulty is that the measures now being urged to increase the accountability of the office would narrow the gap between the political system and the decision making system and bring the operation of the office back into closer conjuncture with politics, which would not necessarily be a good thing.</P>

      <P>The application from Ireland for the URBAN initiative is under discussion with the European Commission.  These discussions will be progressed as quickly <Col N="1720" /> as possible, in particular, with a view to finalising the areas which will participate.</P>
      <P>In terms of the needs of the north Dublin area, I appreciate the desire to maximise the funding available to the area.  Substantial funding for the area from the local urban and rural development programme will be channelled through the county enterprise board, partnerships in Ballymun, Finglas and Coolock-Darndale, as well as the local authorities.  These funds will support various activities with the objective of countering disadvantage in all its manifestations and of improving the socio-economic and environmental situation in north Dublin.</P>

The previous Government proposed five of these initiatives.  I understand from the European Commission office that two of the five proposals do not meet the criteria set down and it will accept a maximum of two of the remaining three proposals.  However, many of the proposals have merit and it is proposed that the interdepartmental committee on local development will consider how they might be assisted through other means.</P>

      <P>I am aware that there is a tremendous need in the north Dublin area for funding such as that available under the URBAN initiative and I hope that that region will be successful. It is clear that if only a maximum of two can be considered the sponsors of 42 projects will be disappointed.  Does the <Col N="1721" /> Minister of State see any prospect of a substantial increase in funding under the URBAN initiative as it compares poorly with the funding available for rural areas under the Leader programme? Will he be pushing the door to secure extra funding?  Does the Minister of State see any prospect of direct funding from his Department for the successful projects, many of which he indicated were worthy of support?</P>

In many cases these Irish projects will meet the same objectives as the URBAN initiative.  A maximum of two areas will be considered.  The decision will not be made by me but by the European Commission.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mrs. Doyle)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 and 45 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have recently been appointed as chairperson of the interdepartmental committee on the commemoration of the famine and 1798.  While I am not yet in a position to announce plans for commemorating the famine, I would hope to be in a position to do so in the near future.  In the meantime, I can assure Deputy de Valera that there will be no question of confining commemorative activity to Dublin.  I reassure Deputy Smith that, as I understand it, a number of local authorities are already planning <Col N="1723" /> for the kind of activities he refers to, from within their own resources.</P>
    <P>I am conscious of the need for sensitivity in spending money to commemorate the 150th anniversary of our great famine while so many in the world today have to endure famine.  I am sure Deputies will appreciate that I must be selective in deciding how and where money is to be spent and understand the reasons.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed that the plans have not yet been finalised but at least it has been agreed in principle to commemorate the famine. As I am sure the Minister of State is aware, 1845 is not the only year in which there was a famine in Ireland; there were many famines both before and after that year.  I appreciate that the Minister of State may not be in a position to answer this but is it her intention to ensure that the programme will cover the period up to 1997 in order to commemorate the great famine of 1847? While I understand that money cannot be made available for every project, the reference to famines around the world is an important one.  We should also take this opportunity to heighten awareness of the difficulties and great hardship endured in such circumstances. Does the Minister of State intend to include our emigrants in commemorating the famines of the 1800s?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Two weeks ago I took over as chairperson of the interdepartmental committee from the Deputy's colleague, Deputy Tom Kitt, under whose chairmanship the committee was established in May 1994.  The committee held a number of useful &ldquo;think-ins&rdquo; and representatives of the committee met with interested bodies such as the Irish Famine Network of Historians and the Famine Commemoration Committee in Tullamore.  Because of the dissolution of the last Administration no specific Government plan was put in place.  The Deputy will realise I could not be expected to do in two weeks what the <Col N="1724" /> last Government failed to do in seven or eight months although we have been working extremely hard on the matter.</P>
      <P>Our emigrants will be involved and they are extremely interested.  I have received a large volume of correspondence not only from people here who are interested in commemorating the great famine but from all corners of the world, particularly from America and Canada, including requests for funding, all of which will be dealt with.  I have set up a commemoration office in the Department of the Taoiseach which will be staffed permanently for the next few years to handle requests relating to the commemoration of the famine and 1798 given the level of interest expressed both here and throughout the world.</P>
      <P>Initially, in September we will commemorate the first outbreak of blight spotted in Fermanagh 150 years ago in September 1845.  I hope also that there will be a North-South dimension.  The details have yet to be worked out with the various groups who have made proposals I would then hope to concentrate the bulk of Government involvement in the Famine commemoration to a six month period between September this year and the end of 1997.  It is not possible to keep famine commemoration at the top of the agenda and I do not think that is ideal or justifiable.  Famine fatigue would set in and we might lose the dignity and sensitivity with which this issue needs to be handled.  I fully agree with the Deputy that we should use the commemoration of the tragedy on our island 150 years ago to increase awareness on ongoing tragedies in other parts of the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister spoke about sensitivities in commemorating our famine and ongoing tragedies in other disadvantaged areas of the world. I would draw to her attention another sensitivity which I see looming in the period we commemorate the famine.  I am an historian but not a revisionist one and clearly the whole idea of the famine and the echoes it will invoke in the minds and hearts of Irish people are <Col N="1725" /> those of some bitterness towards the country which occupied us at that time. That may seem simplistic but to many people it is not.  It is a fact of history not to be revised.  We are living in delicate times with regard to relationships between this country and the United Kingdom and these issues, as well as the obvious one of sensitivity with regard to the famine here and famines elsewhere, could be dealt with by the new committee. One should not allow history to be revised but, at the same time, there is the need to put it in context.</P>

I am putting it to her that it is a very sensitive issue and she is now the Minister for the Famine as well as Minister of State at five other Government Departments.  Obviously the Minister of State's remit is so vast it would be difficult to trace her.  Will the Minister accept the sensitive points I have put to her and will she put them to her committee?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I indicated at the outset that I intend to deal with the great famine commemoration with sensitivity and dignity.  The maturity of this Government in dealing with the Anglo-Irish axis of the famine and the problems of that time will be reflected in the way we commemorate it.  I have no difficulty &mdash; nor have our colleagues on the neighbouring island &mdash; in commemorating the famine honestly and recognising what happened at the time.  The Deputy need not fear any revisionism in the way we do it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and/or persons responsible.  I suggest that the commemoration office will probably handle communication. One of the reasons we have set up one room as an office is the volume of interest in the famine, at home and abroad, and in 1798.  Interest in this is mainly concentrated at home but I know there will be more interest from abroad as we get closer to the anniversary. I suggest there will be a need for <Col N="1727" /> the Government to seriously consider the commemoration and celebration of the millennium and perhaps the commemoration office will be designated that role by the Taoiseach.  I cannot assume that, however, until I am given the job.</P>

I have no doubt that over the coming period there will be many worth while and imaginative local commemoration projects, even without special funding or assistance from the national committee.  There may, however, be a case for providing some limited funding to encourage such activity and I am currently considering how best this can be achieved.  There can be no question, however, of throwing money at the commemoration of the famine and I underline that point.  It would be entirely inappropriate and I am sure the Deputy accepts that. Depending on whether we get good news this afternoon, I hope to have some limited funding and I will then consider how best to spend that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <askee>Minister for Justice</askee>
      <Quest>the number of gardaí in the Garda Síochána as at 1 January 1995; the number of anticipated retirements in 1995; the proposed number of new recruits in 1995; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The strength of the Garda Síochána at 1 January 1995 was 10,837.  Three hundred and fifty gardaí will be recruited to the force this year and a total of 430 gardaí will be attested to the force this year, that is, they will have completed the first three phases of training and will have the full powers of a garda.  It is anticipated that there will be 492 retirements this year.  This level of recruitment is aimed at maintaining the strength of the force at about 11,000 members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The important requirement is to ensure that the operational strength of the force is optimised.  Increasing civilianisation of what are not essentially police duties within the force, together with the introduction of greater information technology, will free up more gardaí to be out on the streets in their primary task, which is the fight against crime.  There are now almost 700 civilian employees in the force and that number will be increased by 200 by the end of 1997, releasing an equivalent number of <Col N="1730" /> gardaí for operational duties.  I also plan to recruit 350 in 1996 and 1997.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>My objective is to ensure the availability of the maximum number of gardaí.  I am doing this through recruitment of new gardaí and also through the employment of civilians and the introduction of information technology. Gardaí are made available not just by recruitment but also by freeing gardaí from jobs which are not essentially policing duties.  I am satisfied that with the programme I have in place and the money that is available the force will be kept at a strength of about 11,000 members.</P>

      <P>It is a statistical question and I would remind the Deputy that the Garda strength and resources in place are what Fianna Fáil put in place when in Government.  I am satisfied that the programme I outlined &mdash; the recruitment of 350 gardaí in 1995, 350 in 1996 and 350 in 1997, allied to the release of gardaí for duties of the kind the public expect the gardaí to do as a result of the employment of more civilians and the improvement in technology &mdash; will ensure that the force is kept at a strength of 11,000.

      <P>Perhaps the Deputy could table another question.  The Deputy is aware that the programme of civilianisation is releasing gardaí for crime fighting and crime detection where heretofore they had to spend time writing reports etc., work which is now being done by civilians.  I hope that by the end of 1997 there will be approximately 700 civilians in the Garda Síochána on work which can be done by civilians and not by gardaí whom we need on the beat.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Justice</askee>
      <Quest>when she will introduce measures pursuant to section 32 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1994, to prevent money laundering; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[2700/95]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 32 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1994 requires banks and other financial bodies to take certain measures, in particular in relation to the identification of customers, in order to assist in the prevention and detection of money laundering.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In April, 1994 &mdash; in advance of the enactment of the 1994 Act &mdash; a steering committee was established under the <Col N="1732" /> auspices of the Department of Finance to make administrative arrangements for the implementation of the anti-laundering provisions of the legislation with special reference to the preparation of detailed guidelines for the parties who would operate those provisions.  The membership of the steering committee includes representatives from the Departments of Finance, Justice and Enterprise and Employment, the Registrar of Friendly Societies, the Garda Síochána, the Central Bank, the Irish Bankers Federation, the Irish Insurance Federation, the Irish Building Societies Association and the Stock Exchange.  Its terms of reference are: (1) To define the broad scope of the guidelines required to facilitate the proper implementation of the money laundering provisions of the Criminal Justice Act; (2) to co-ordinate and ensure consistency between the guidelines to be drawn up by the sub-committees; (3) To ratify the guidelines drawn up by the sub-committees before issue; and (4) to review, at not less than six-monthly intervals, the implementation of the guidelines as reported to it by the sub-committees, and to assess their impact.</P>
    <P>For the purpose of clarifying the reference to sub-committees in the terms of reference I should explain that a separate sub-committee was set up for each of the major sectors covered by the laundering provisions of the 1994 Act&mdash; banking, insurance, etc.</P>
    <P>As I have indicated, I have personally raised with my colleague the Minister for Finance my concerns that the relevant section of the Act be brought into force as quickly as possible.  I am informed that the committee met again earlier this week and I understand that the current position is that it is close to completing its work on the guidelines and that this is likely to happen in the very near future.</P>
    <P>I, of course, remain anxious to make a commencement order bringing section 32 into operation as quickly as possible but Deputies will appreciate that the making of detailed administrative arrangements in this area by the various <Col N="1733" /> groups involved inevitably takes time; not least because of the fact that thousands of employees will require detailed training on matters completely new to them.  It is vital that if the section is to work successfully it should be introduced effectively and comprehensively from the beginning.</P>
    <P>At this stage I anticipate that the commencement order will be made within a matter of a few weeks and that it will allow as brief a period as possible before it comes into operation in order to ensure the proper implementation of the necessary administrative procedures. As I have mentioned, I am doing, and will continue to do, all that I can to have section 32 of the 1994 Act in force at the earliest practicable date.</P>
    <P>Before I conclude there is one further point I believe should be made in relation to section 32.  While the section is important it should not be lost sight of that it is in fact supplemental to section 31 of the same Act which provides for the offence of money laundering and which came into effect last November.  Furthermore, the confiscation provisions of the 1994 Act, and the power to obtain restraint orders to seize and freeze suspected criminal proceeds, are also fully in place.  In addition, section 63 of the Act now enables the Garda, on foot of orders made by the District Court, to obtain access to information, including records of bank accounts, for the purpose of an investigation into money laundering or other serious offences.  Thus, it is clear that the major parts of the Criminal Justice Act, 1994 which allow the strongest measures to be taken against serious crime are already in operation and I am confident that that will also be the case with section 32 in the very near future.</P>
    <P>I should mention also that sections 57 and 58 (2) of the 1994 Act are related to section 32 and will be brought into force at the same time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister accept that there is a possibility, if <Col N="1734" /> not a probability, that one of the greatest money-laundering operations in the history of the State may have been facilitated by the Minister not bringing in emergency legislation pursuant to section 32 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1994 in the immediate aftermath of the Brink's Allied robbery?  In this respect could she tell the House if she has met the committee drawing up the guidelines, or requested such a meeting?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought the Deputy would have understood that the sections of the Act which are in force &mdash; they were brought in in November 1994 &mdash; are crucial parts of the Act which allow the Garda to proceed to examine bank accounts and to seek a District Court order to do so.</P>
      <P>Section 32 is yet a further measure which will mean that banks and financial institutions will have to notify the Garda Síochána if they have suspicions that money being lodged in their institutions is the proceeds of criminal activity.  The Act is already in place and what is happening now is the implementation of one section of that Act which will copperfasten the powers of the Garda Síochána.  Let me remind the Deputy that the sub-committee established to bring about these new regulations was set up in mid-April before the Bill became an Act and in September the group chaired by the Department of Finance agreed to operate on the basis that the section of the Act would come into operation on 3 April 1995.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since coming into office I have sought to expedite the bringing into operation of this section ahead of the schedule that the then Government gave the committee.  I think the Deputy must recognise that if the section is to be operated effectively thousands of people working in these financial institutions will have to know how to identify the proceeds of crime and be able to pass that information on to the Garda Síochána without fear of prosecution for having broken the confidentiality that <Col N="1735" /> must exist between a bank or financial institution and its clients.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that by the time this section is in operation all the powers will be available to the Garda Síochána. Already very strict powers exist for the Garda to do the job the Deputy says they do not have the power to do.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>She has not met the sub-committee.  Does the Minister accept that there is no power in the Criminal Justice Act, 1994, which would allow the Garda Síochána to freeze moneys in a financial institution which are the subject matter of a criminal investigation?  Does she accept in the aftermath of the Brinks-Allied robbery she should have brought in emergency legislation to give the Garda Síochána power to freeze moneys suspected to be the proceeds of crime and that it was her duty to do this in order to ensure that a major laundering operation, the biggest in the history of the State, would not take place?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>The type of measures that are required to deal with situations such as the recent Brinks-Allied robbery are those which are provided for in the 1994 Act and are already in operation. They were put into operation by the Deputy's colleague, the then Minister for Justice, who is sitting beside him.  They allow for the confiscation of criminal proceeds, to make restraint or freezing orders in advance of a confiscation order and to obtain access to material held by banks and other bodies which might help the Garda Síochána in their investigations.  All these measures are in place as we speak.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10 and 15 together.</P>
      <P>I am anxious to give the Deputy as much information as I reasonably can about the circular to which she refers.  I am under certain constraints, however, one of which is that the issue of this circular is the subject of High Court judicial review, now listed for hearing on 16 February.  I am sure the Deputy will understand that, in the circumstances, there is a limit to what I can say.</P>
      <P>The circular was issued by the Garda Commissioner on foot of legal advice he had received.  That advice was to the effect that it was an integral element of the direction and control of the Garda Síochána, which is vested in the Commissioner under section 8 of the Police Forces Amalgamation Act, 1925, that disclosure of sources should be made to a senior officer of the Garda Síochána of the very limited nature provided for in the circular.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The particular circumstances which gave rise to the issue of the circular will <Col N="1737" /> be outlined to the court and it would be wholly improper for me to outline those circumstances in advance of the court proceedings.  I can say, however, that the central issue was that of accountability of Garda investigating officers in criminal cases.  I think it important also to stress that the circular had and was intended to have quite limited effect &mdash; there is no question of disclosure of sources to a senior officer being demanded in the normal course of events.</P>
    <P>If I am in a position, following the court proceedings, to give the Deputy more information, I shall be glad to do so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>When commenting on the Brinks-Allied surveillance and intelligence the Minister said that good intelligence is the life blood of all police work.  Does she agree that this directive will mean that police informers can no longer be given the anonymity which they have grown to expect and which is essential to the relationship between detective gardaí and police informers? Is there any connection between the issuing of this directive and a case involving the threatened dismissal of two detective gardaí from the drug squad which is pending?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy that great care must be taken in respect of confidentiality in the relationship between an informant and a member of the Garda Síochána.  A breach of this confidentiality through carelessness or any other way could cause quite serious repercussions to both the gardaí involved and the informer.</P>
      <P>As I understand this circular, it is of very limited nature and was introduced by the commissioner only after legal advice.  I do not think it is appropriate for me to answer the second part of the Deputy's question because of the judicial review that is coming up but if after the judicial review I can give further clarification, I will certainly do so.</P>

      <Quest>in relation to the Criminal Justice Act, 1984, if she will outline for each calendar year since the commencement of the Act the number of times the Criminal Courts have and have not imposed consecutive sentences on persons convicted of indictable offences or on offenders who committed a further indictable offence or offences whilst on bail; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>Court statistics do not separately record the number of cases in which the section of the 1984 Act to which the Deputy is referring &mdash; that is, section 11 (1) &mdash; is applied by the Judiciary.  I find that, as things stand, court statistics appear to be maintained <Col N="1739" /> primarily for the purpose of measuring activity levels and thereby measuring resource requirements for the courts. The Deputy will understand that this is the situation as I have inherited it.</P>
      <P>I acknowledge, as my Department does and I am sure Deputies generally do, that there is a real need for a more sophisticated and informative statistical system for courts and indeed for the criminal justice system as a whole.</P>
      <P>The Department has planned to expand the use of information technology in court offices which will allow for the recording and retrieval of much more detailed statistics in the future.  In planning the expanded use of information technology for the courts area close attention is being paid to the need for integrating statistics between the courts, prisons and Garda Síochána.  In this regard, the Garda Síochána Research Unit which was established in September 1994 to undertake practical and targeted research of relevance to a modern police force, is now examining the question of integrating the statistics which will be provided by the different branches of the criminal justice system.</P>
      <P>It will take time, expertise and commitment to get us to the stage where we have an adequate set of criminal justice statistics coming on stream each year.  I will be interested in securing progress in this matter in any way I can.</P>
      <P>I have no reason to believe that the courts are not applying the provisions of section 11 of the 1984 Act in the manner intended by the Oireachtas, but if the Deputy has any indications to the contrary and provides me with details, I shall be glad to consider whether any further changes in the law may be required.</P>

Has she received the Law Reform Commission's interim report on the matter?

      <P>It is a radical budget.  It sets out to achieve a number of objectives and is very far-reaching in its consequences.  It is a budget for people at work and especially for those in modest circumstances. It will have profound effects upon families.  It will give heart to young people seeking to broaden their horizons. It will demonstrate a commitment to the social fabric of our community, one of the most valuable assets we have.</P>
      <P>It is also the first of three budgets which this new Government intends to introduce before the next general election. Accordingly, I want to set out three objectives for the budget.</P>
      <P>This budget will reward work, promote enterprise and strengthen social solidarity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Work is the key to our success as a people and as a society.  It is the way that we fulfil ourselves as individuals.  It is the way that we create wealth as a community.  We must have more people at work.  We must ensure that they are rewarded for working.  We must provide the opportunity to work for those without work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To achieve this, we have to develop, foster and promote enterprise throughout our society, in both the public and the private sectors.  We have to promote excellence and demand quality in the services and products which we provide and sell both at home and abroad.  We must encourage companies to prosper and grow.  We must assist people to start their own enterprises.  We must help families who want to develop their own businesses.  We have to ensure that those businesses can pass safely from generation to generation.  We must encourage employees to participate in the prosperity of their own enterprises by encouraging them to purchase shares in the companies in which they work. <Col N="1803" /> Above all, Ireland must become a good place to do business in, and to do business with.</P>
    <P>We should do all these necessary things, which I have just described, so that we can afford to do the worthwhile things which we want to do.  In our concept of a republic and a community, we are committed to equality and to solidarity. That means recognising that every individual has an equal right to belong, and an equal right to a full measure of human dignity.  Neither age nor disability, lack of educational opportunity nor individual resources, can be allowed to deprive any member of our community of that dignity.  Ours is a community that is willing to reach out, to reconnect and redirect the energies and strengths of our people towards each other.</P>
    <P>In short, this budget represents a &ldquo;growth dividend&rdquo; for the people.  Our economy could not be in the strong position that it is in, without considerable sacrifice on the part of many thousands of families and people at work.  The years that we have spent reconstructing the economy, and building a firm base for the future, would not have been possible without that sacrifice.  Now is the time to start recognising that, and to ensure that everyone gets a fair share of the growth being generated.</P>
    <P>
      <i>The Economy in 1994</i>
    </P>
    <P>Last year was a good year for Ireland. The Irish economy was one of the best performers in the European Union.  All the main economic indicators showed positive signs of growth.  In turn, this strong growth resulted in an impressive increase in the numbers at work.</P>
    <P>&mdash;Employment increased by 36,000 last year or 3 per cent.</P>
    <P>&mdash;Average unemployment fell by 12,000 from 294,000 to 282,000.</P>
    <P>&mdash;Investment in our economy grew by over 7 per cent in real terms, and consumer spending increased by 5 <Col N="1804" /> per cent as domestic confidence improved.</P>
    <P>&mdash;Our exports are estimated to have increased by 10.5 per cent and this strong performance reflected both the continuing success of Irish industry in overseas markets and the improved international environment.</P>
    <P>We achieved all this while continuing to have a low rate of inflation at 2.4 per cent on average for the year.</P>
    <P>
      <i>The Outlook for 1995</i>
    </P>
    <P>The position now for 1995 looks favourable.</P>
    <P>&mdash;Overall GDP is projected to grow by about 6.25 per cent while GNP will grow by about 5.25 per cent.</P>
    <P>&mdash;Inflation will remain at about 2.5 per cent reflecting moderate domestic cost pressures and low inflation internationally.</P>
    <P>&mdash;Growth in personal consumption is projected to increase by 5.25 per cent.  With business and consumer confidence remaining strong, an increase of 9.25 per cent in the volume of investment is projected.</P>
    <P>&mdash;The balance of payments surplus will remain substantial.</P>
    <P>&mdash;Employment will increase by some 31,000 jobs.</P>
    <P>&mdash;Unemployment is forecast to fall by a further 16,000 on a live register basis giving an average level of 266,000 for the year.</P>
    <P>&mdash;On exchange rates, our policy is to pursue a stable exchange rate for our currency.  This is essential to the maintenance of low inflation and competitiveness.  On interest rates, basic mortgage rates are at their lowest levels since the mid-1960s. These low interest rates have cut costs for business and increased the attractiveness of investment. Our adherence to the Maastricht criteria on the public finances will continue to support the currency and interest rates, contributing to the overall competitiveness of the <Col N="1805" /> economy and, thereby, to employment.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Review of the 1994 Budget Outturn</i>
    </P>
    <P>The budget outturn for 1994 produced an Exchequer Borrowing Requirement of £672 million or 2.2 per cent of GNP.</P>
    <P>&mdash;This outturn was £131 million below the EBR of 2.7 per cent of GNP which was targeted in that budget; for the first time since 1966-67 the current budget returned a surplus of £15 million; the general Government deficit, which is calculated under the arrangements agreed in the Maastricht Treaty, is estimated at 2 per cent of GDP compared with the budget estimate of 2.7 per cent.  The general Government debt declined as a proportion of GDP from 96 per cent in 1993 to about 90 per cent last year, and this outturn places Ireland among the strongest in terms of fiscal performance in the European Union in 1994.</P>
    <P>At this point I want to acknowledge and pay tribute to the performance of my predecessor as Minister for Finance. The fiscal achievements of the previous Coalition Government, in which Labour was a partner, have provided me as Minister for Finance with a very positive opening position.</P>
    <P>However, I want to pay a special tribute to the Irish workforce which has, in the course of last year, made possible the very impressive performance which I have just described.  I hold the view, strongly, that without the planned and responsible contribution which the workforce has made through the <i>Pro-gramme for Competitiveness and Work</i> many individual firms and, indeed, the overall Irish economy, could not have recorded the figures I have just outlined. I also want to pay tribute to the many small Irish companies which weathered the currency turbulence of 1992-93 and went on to develop and grow in 1994.  I salute the leadership and <Col N="1806" /> the contribution of the social partners and assure them of the Government's appreciation of their work.  We will continue to work closely together to maintain and develop the progress that has been achieved to date.  The <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> is the foundation upon which that progress will be made.</P>
    <P>I should point out that full details of the performance of the economy over the past 12 months and prospects for this year are being circulated today in the Economic Background to the Budget.  Details and costings of many of the measures which I will be announcing today are contained in the Principal Features of the Budget.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Public Service Management</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Government is committed to the reform and development of our public service, to improve the quality of its work, the efficiency of its performance and the accountability of public servants.</P>
    <P>The Strategic Management Initiative, launched by the previous Government, will be supported and implemented by this Government.  In addition, the 1924 Ministers and Secretaries Act will be amended to provide for needed reforms. We will modernise the public service to ensure greater devolution of responsibility and accountability.  We will provide for improved financial and personnel management, greater transparency and openness.  In addition, we will introduce simplified procedures with a new emphasis on treating the citizen as a customer who is entitled to an efficient and effective service.</P>
    <P>If we are to achieve our overall economic and employment targets, we will have to adhere strictly to the cost parameters of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> pay agreement in both the private and the public sectors. This Government will honour in full the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> commitments to public servants.</P>
    <P>Provision has been included in the <Col N="1807" /> Estimates for the general increases arising under the programme and for honouring the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> commitment to negotiations on claims outstanding from the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> However, the Government expects in return that these negotiations will result in the achievement of genuine change which raises the level of efficiency, effectiveness and quality of public services and that the cost parameters agreed with the social partners will continue to be observed.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Public Service Pay Determination</i>
    </P>
    <P>Agreement was reached late last year on a new scheme of conciliation and arbitration for the Civil Service.  The amended scheme for the Civil Service provides a model for other areas of the public service and negotiations are continuing in these areas.  I would expect that the negotiations will be finalised in the coming months, so that a more transparent and realistic system of pay determination can be seen to operate throughout the public service.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Debt Management</i>
    </P>
    <P>The 1995 debt service estimate of £2,410 million takes account of £59 million in savings carried over from 1994 and a target of £100 million in savings to be achieved by the National Treasury Management Agency in 1995.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge the important and valuable work which has been done by the agency.  Indeed its success has attracted complimentary international attention.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Public Finances</i>
    </P>
    <P>As outlined in <i>A Government of Renewal,</i> firm management of the public finances is a necessary part of this Government's approach to employment and social justice.  In the light of the heavy burden of existing debt, which pre-empts valuable resources each year in servicing costs, we must reduce that <Col N="1808" /> debt as a proportion of GNP and restrain borrowing comfortably below the 3 per cent GDP limit envisaged in the Maastricht Treaty.</P>
    <P>We must also keep expenditure to levels which we can afford within this constraint.  We said we would keep the increase in current expenditure this year to 6 per cent over last year, and we have done so.</P>
    <P>I am not adopting a restrictive approach to the public finances just because of the Maastricht criteria; still less for book-keeping purposes.  It is simply that lower borrowing is the best course for growth and employment. Lower annual deficits will encourage lower interest rates, thus encouraging investment and enterprise.  Continued employment growth on a sustainable basis is impossible without such investment.</P>
    <P>The opening Exchequer borrowing requirement, allowing for balances of £58 million, is £594 million.  Having made provision for the measures I am announcing today, my targets for this year are:</P>
    <P>Exchequer Borrowing Requirement £813 million or 2.4 per cent of GNP;</P>
    <P>Current Budget Deficit £310 million or 0.9 per cent of GNP;</P>
    <P>General Government Deficit 2.5 per cent of GDP.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>These targets represent continued budgetary discipline and today's improvements have been formulated within that framework.  There are special one-off factors this year which allow for such an approach.  These will not of course be available in 1996 while the full-year costs of the measures concerned will also have to be borne at that stage.  This will reduce considerably the budgetary room for manoeuvre in future years.</P>
      <P Just="Center">
        <b>REWARD WORK</b>
      </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1809" /> Let me turn now to the first of the three objectives of this budget and indicate how I intend to reward those at work.</P>
    <P>
      <i>PRSI and Income Tax</i>
    </P>
    <P>In order to direct relief to those on low incomes generally, including those outside the current income tax net, the Government has decided to introduce an allowance of £50 per week for full rate PRSI contributors.  This means that for such workers, £50 of their weekly wages will be disregarded in calculating their PRSI contributions, thus affording a significant reduction in PRSI to those on lower pay.  It has also been decided to renew the existing income tax PRSI allowance available to full rate contributors at £140 per annum rather than £286.</P>
    <P>For example, for full rate PRSI contributors, this will result in gains up to £143 per annum or £2.75 per week for those exempted from income tax or on marginal relief.  For those on the 27 per cent income tax rate the gain will be up to £103 per annum or just under £2 per week, and for those on 48 per cent the gain will be up to £73 per annum or £1.40 per week, before any income tax changes.</P>
    <P>It has also been decided to provide a £10 per week allowance to those on the modified PRSI rate and to the self-employed. These groups do not get the income tax PRSI allowance.  The PRSI ceiling applicable to employees and the self employed will increase from £20,900 to £21,500.</P>
    <P>The standard rate income tax band is being widened by £1,400 to £17,800 for married couples and by £700 to £8,900 for single persons.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NedOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. E. O'Keeffe Mr. E. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>We had expected better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The personal allowance is being increased by £300 to £5,000 per annum for married couples and by £150 to £2,500 per annum for single persons with an increase of £150 being applied <Col N="1810" /> also to widowed, single parent and widowed parent allowances.</P>
      <P>The increases in the personal allowances and the standard band provide substantial relief for the vast majority of taxpayers even after taking account of the reduction in tax relief on mortgage interest and VHI premia which will occur in 1995-96 as provided for in last year's budget.</P>
      <P>The general &mdash; under 65 &mdash; income exemption limits below which no income tax is payable are being increased by £200 to £7,400 per annum for married couples and by £100 to £3,700 per annum for single persons.  To provide greater assistance to the elderly, the exemption limits for those aged 65 or over are being raised by £400 in the case of married couples and £200 for single persons.</P>
      <P>The thresholds for payment of the employment and training levy and the health levy are being indexed in line with the 2.5 per cent general basic pay increase in the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i> The threshold is being raised by £250 to £9,250 per annum or by £5 per week, from £173 to £178 per week.</P>
      <P>The impact of the tax-PRSI package on a family with two children and only one spouse earning £15,000 on full PRSI and PAYE will be to leave them better off by £185 per annum or £3.56 per week.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that all these changes taken together will remove 10,000 taxpayers from the tax net.  In addition, the percentage of taxpayers paying tax at the lower rates will be increased from 62 per cent in 1994-95 to 64 per cent in the coming year or, in other words, almost two-thirds of all taxpayers will pay tax at the standard or marginal relief rate.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Preferential Loans</i>
      </P>
      <P>I propose to reduce by half of one per cent the specified rates used to determine the benefit-in-kind charge for preferential mortgage and other loans made to employees by their employers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1811" />
      <i>Profit Sharing Schemes</i>
    </P>
    <P>To promote worker participation and involvement in their companies I propose to increase the existing annual limit on relief for approved employee profit sharing schemes from £2,000 to £10,000.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Taxation of UB/DB</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Government's policy agreement states that the method of taxing unemployment benefit and disability benefit will be restructured, to improve the position of those most adversely affected.  This commitment is being met in the first instance by the income tax improvements which I have already announced.  However, a number of special additional measures are also being introduced.</P>
    <P>Firstly, to assist families, the child dependant additions payable with unemployment benefit and disability benefit will be exempt from tax.  Secondly, the special relief for systematic short-time workers introduced in the Finance Act, 1994, will be extended for a further year and broadened to include all such workers.  Finally, the first £10 per week of unemployment benefit will also be exempt from tax from 6 April next.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Rent Relief for Persons in Private Rented Accommodation</i>
      </P>
      <P>For the first time I am introducing a tax relief for all tenants living in private rented accommodation.  The new relief will be effective from 6 April next and will give an annual allowance, at the standard rate, of £500 for a single person, £750 for a widowed person and £1,000 for a married couple.  The over 55s will continue to enjoy the existing scale of reliefs.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Tax Allowance on Service Charges</i>
      </P>
      <P>Arising from the commitment by the Government in its policy agreement, I will be providing an income tax allowance at the standard rate up to a maximum of £150 in respect of local authority service charges which are paid in full and on time.  This allowance will commence in the tax year 1996-97 for charges paid in respect of 1995.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Business Taxation</i>
      </P>
      <P>I will deal first with business taxation. This area covers employers' PRSI, corporation tax, capital gains tax and capital acquisitions tax.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Employers' PRSI</i>
      </P>
      <P>I have decided to increase the income threshold below which the lower rate employers' PRSI of 9 per cent applies from £9,000 to £12,000 or from £173 per week to £231 per week in terms of weekly earnings.  This measure will cost £28 million in 1995 and £46 million in a full year.  An increase from £9,000 to £12,000 in the threshold for the application of the lower 9 per cent rate of employers' PRSI will assist employers in maintaining and creating employment. For example, a business employing 20 people each earning about £11,000 a year or £210 per week would see its labour costs reduced in a single year by £7,000 or £135 per week.  This measure will support some 170,000 existing jobs and reduce the cost of taking on new employees.  Nothing like it has ever happened here before.</P>

In order to encourage the rapid development of the physical infrastructure of the centre, I have decided to extend the deadline of the urban renewal tax incentives for the area for a further two years, to 25 January 1999. Also, I am applying the terms of the <Col N="1817" /> seed capital scheme to trading activities on the Dublin Exchange facility with a view to facilitating local involvement in trading on the Exchange.

I am also introducing improved instalment payment provisions for capital acquisitions tax on agricultural property similar to those proposed for business property. These changes will give further assistance to the transfer of family farms to young farmers.</P>

In accordance with the commitment in the Government programme, a new scheme of stock relief at a rate of 100 per cent is being introduced for young qualifying farmers for a limited period.  This new scheme is targeted at this particular group to <Col N="1819" /> enable them to establish economic viability.  In cases where a farmer has to restock as a result of the compulsory disposal of his entire cattle herd in compliance with a statutory disease eradication programme, 100 per cent stock relief is also being allowed over a two year period on the profits arising from this disposal and reinvested in replacement stock.</P>

      <P>On child income support, the Government's policy agreement proposes moving towards a basic income for children. Briefly, this will involve moving away from the current general reliance on child dependant allowances and the existing family income supplement and towards a child benefit supplement. This supplement will be paid to social welfare recipients and low to middle income families.  When fully developed, this new approach will help alleviate many of the employment and poverty traps inherent in the current system.  I intend to develop the system in an integrated way so that, for the future, I will be relying on a more selective or targeted approach, via a child benefit supplement rather than the universally available and more costly child benefit.

I do not share the naive belief that market forces will solve this matter.  The State must play its role.  Throughout the European Union, structural long term unemployment has become the major social and economic problem facing member states.  Ireland is not alone.  The ESRI forecasts of positive economic growth for Ireland between now and the end of the century also indicate that long term unemployment will not simply go away.</P>
    <P>The National Economic and Social Forum is one of the bodies that has looked in detail at our problems here. Its analysis is clear and comprehensive. We have to develop new methods and new systems to intervene systematically with the necessary help and assistance which is required.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Employment Service for the Long Term Unemployed</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Government's policy agreement proposed that an intensive guidance and placement service should be established for the long term unemployed which would be based on the concept developed by the National Economic and Social Forum.  I am today providing a sum of £6 million to enable this service to be introduced on a pilot basis.</P>
    <P>Following the NESF report, a task force was set up to examine the report and make proposals for better targeted and more effective services for the long term unemployed.  The recommendations of the task force will form the basis on which final decisions on the new service will be taken by the Government.</P>

      <i>Community Employment</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Community employment programme was introduced in March 1994 to replace a number of existing employment schemes.  Average participation on these schemes last year was 31,000 at a cost of over £195 million.  Provision for <Col N="1826" /> an average participation level of 35,000 in 1995 has already been made in the Estimates at a cost of £232.5 million.  I am today making an additional net provision of £11 million so as to achieve an average participation of 38,500 this year.</P>

      <P>The Government's policy agreement contains a commitment to payment of the legally determined entitlements of married women to social welfare equality payments.  We undertook that a budget and timescale for the payments would be set out, having regard to budgetary constraints and the costs involved, and that the process would be completed within four years.</P>
      <P>The judgment of the High Court on this matter was delivered last Friday, 3 February.  The judgment will require careful consideration by the Government, advised by the Attorney General, given the costs and the importance of the legal issues involved.  While it has not yet been possible to fully complete that consideration, I am including a provision of £60 million as a first step this year.  Should it prove necessary to spend more on these exceptional payments this year, there are funding possibilities open to me through the disposal of State assets.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Beyond Ireland's shores, many parts of the world are, unfortunately, enduring war, pestilence and hunger.  In the Third World, famine has become a plague in a World of plenty. Irish people have instinctively responded to this human tragedy and many Irish organisations are actively involved on the ground in trying to alleviate this human plight.</P>
      <P>Our response is out of all proportion to our numbers.  Perhaps it is because we still carry with us, as President Robinson said last Thursday, some memory of the horror of our own great famine, which began this spring one hundred and fifty years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I intend to mark that anniversary by providing tax relief at the standard rate on donations by individuals to designated Irish Third World charities.  Taxpayers will be able to make their contributions in the range of £200 to £750 to the designated Third World charity of their choice.  That body will receive the <Col N="1828" /> tax associated with the contribution from the Revenue Commissioners.  This means that a donation of £750 will be worth just over £1,000 to the charity concerned.</P>
    <P>This new measure will, for the first time, allow people to exercise choice with regard to the agency to which they wish the State to contribute part of our official development assistance.  We are committed in the programme for Government to increase, each year, our ODA.  This measure will help us to continue to do that as the tax component of the donations will form part of our ODA assistance.</P>

      <P>In conjunction with this change, I am extending the restrictions which currently apply to parent-child covenants to all covenants.  This entails the application of a 5 per cent income limit and the abolition of tax relief on covenanting to minor children other than incapacitated children.  These changes will apply to new covenants taken out on or after today and to existing covenants from 6 April next.  In addition, from next year when fees are abolished, I will be abolishing tax relief on covenants generally.  Tax relief will be retained for certain covenants, including those for the elderly and incapacitated, as set out in the Principal Features.  The changes do not affect covenants for maintenance payments between separated spouses.</P>
      <P>Provision will be made for tax relief on fees paid to private colleges in respect of approved courses.  This relief will be introduced for the academic year 1996-97.

      <i>Medium Term Outlook</i>
    </P>
    <P>While I acknowledge that this year's budget is benefiting from certain once-off factors the absence of which will create pressures in future years, I want to confirm that the central direction of this budget will underpin the policy of this Government, as set out in <i>A Government of Renewal,</i> over the next two years.</P>
    <P>We will need firm discipline and strict adherence to our commitments if we are to meet the targets we have set for ourselves in the policy document <i>A Government of Renewal.</i></P>
    <P>I am therefore inviting people to begin to plan for the future within the parameters in this budget and set out in the Government's programme.  The provision of certainty in a rapidly changing world is one of the major positive components which a government can provide to a community which needs to plan and wants to invest.</P>
    <P>In this regard the existence of the social partnership, and the framework for dialogue and consultation which it provides, is an essential part of our way of doing business.</P>
    <P>The existence of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work,</i> the National Development plan, and the commitment of this Government to maintain its budget strategy, which I have outlined here today, provides a secure future within which I am inviting the Irish people to plan and invest.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Vision 2010</i>

The year 2010 is only 15 years away, which may seem a long time forward, but is as close to us as 1980.</P>
    <P>Our political, economic and social energies must be co-ordinated to focus on a set of goals to which we can aspire and which we can also achieve.  Nobody else will do this for us.  As a sovereign people, we must do it for ourselves.  In 15 years time Ireland should and can <Col N="1833" /> have the average per capita income of the European Union, provide full employment for those seeking work&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>These goals, which can only be achieved with leadership, teamwork and imagination will, if implemented, transform our lives and the lives of all of the Irish people who will come after us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All of the components required to enable us to achieve these goals are <Col N="1834" /> within our control.  We are truly, at last, a sovereign people.  What we need to do now is to begin to exercise that sovereignty.  We can build a society which admires success, rewards work, celebrates excellence and also promotes opportunity, demands equality and treats misfortune with compassion and solidarity.</P>
    <P Just="Center">CONCLUSION</P>
    <P>This budget is but one small step in that direction.  Some of the measures it contains may not work as effectively as we intend.  If so, in time, we will correct them, but all of them, taken together, will move us in the direction of the objectives I have described.  They will reward work, promote enterprise and strengthen social solidarity.</P>
    <P>Beyond that they will enable us, as a people, to embrace the future with confidence and to shape it with courage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have the honour of being the last Opposition spokesperson to reply to a formal Budget Statement such as the one given today because if the events of the past fortnight are anything to go by and if the contents of the Budget Statements are leaked in the way this one was, this will be the last time we will have to go through this charade.  There will be no need for the Government to hold a constitutional referendum on Cabinet confidentiality if what happened before this budget continues to happen.  As my party leader said this morning, in the past we may have been too concerned about budget secrecy.  It is a serious matter when all of the budget is leaked in advance.</P>
      <P>Even as we sat here today a Minister of State decided to issue a press release at 4.08, when the Minister for Finance had only been on his feet for eight minutes, discussing the budget and the various matters contained therein.  The Ceann Comhairle asked Members of the House not to do this during the Budget Statement.  This release was issued during the speech this evening and I take it the Ceann Comhairle will take up this matter with the Committee on Procedure and Privileges in the near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can laugh at myself and many aspects of my life and I do not take myself seriously all the time.  However, when dealing with serious matters of State there is a need to treat them as such.  We cannot allow a situation where a Government &mdash; Whether it is made up of three or any number of parties &mdash; can allow the kind of leaks that have occurred in the recent past.  I know the Taoiseach will heed my concerns in this regard.  I ask him to take action because, if it had been planned to increase the bank levy or make other major taxation changes in today's budget, there would have been a run on the financial markets. Ministers who have recently joined <Col N="1846" /> the Government should be conscious of that before telling their programme managers and advisers what is in the budget.</P>
    <P>This is being observed from abroad and Deputy Quinn, who is a student of history, will recall that a British Chancellor of the Exchequer, when walking into the Chamber to deliver his budget speech, happened to mention an aspect of his budget to a person who told a journalist.  Arising from that the Chancellor resigned that evening, not because it had made any difference to the financial markets but on a point of principle.  I hope this will be the last time we proceed like this.  I am open enough to say that perhaps the spending Estimates of the budget could be discussed long in advance but we cannot have the position we have had recently.</P>
    <P>One of the newspapers this morning, in giving all the details of the budget, said the Department of Finance was leaking like a sieve.  To my certain knowledge, the permanent civil servants in that or any other Department have not been involved in the leaking of this budget.  It is a slur on the public servants who have served this State long and well&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and especially on the Department of Finance, which if I may say so goes to the other extreme. They would hardly say what day tomorrow was if it could be avoided.  It is a pity that has been said and I hope an opportunity will be taken to correct it.</P>
      <P>When I was a student a colleague of mine, Deputy Power, used to bring me in here to listen to the budget.  I sat in the Public Gallery.  One day I wanted to take notes because I was an accountancy student and an usher told me I could not even do that.  That shows what a serious change has taken place.  I do not say this lightly.  Not everything should be covered up &mdash; I am all for openness &mdash; but in a matter like the budget I ask the Taoiseach not to proceed on this basis in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1847" /> I say this at the outset because I regard it as serious.  There are matters about which I can be flippant or goodhumoured but this is not one of those matters and I am sure the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance fully agree with me.</P>
    <P>This budget has been the best heralded in the history of the State.  When Deputy Quinn talked about the 2010 strategy, one of the backbenchers on this side of the House referred to a space odyssey.  I would describe this budget as being rather like the &ldquo;Star Trek&rdquo; TV programme, which has the great line: &ldquo;Beam me up, Scotty&rdquo;.  This budget is more like &ldquo;Beam us up, Ruairí&rdquo; into a world of fantasy where no one will pay bills either now or in the future.  If the lessons of the past are not learned by the politicians of today, we will all pay a heavy price.</P>
    <P>I am good humoured about political, private and other aspects of my affairs. I have paid a heavy political price for warning years ago about the dangers of a Government or political parties going down the road we did.  It took us a long time to recover from it.  I say this with the utmost sincerity.  Certain Members on the opposite side of the House agree with me although they may not be in a position to do anything about it &mdash; and that includes certain members of the Government.  If we go back the road from whence we came we are making a fundamental mistake for which this generation of politicians will not be forgiven by anyone.</P>
    <P>I toyed with a number of options as to how I might open my address on budget day 1995.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps with a few bars of &ldquo;The Rose of Tralee&rdquo;?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The first was to reread into the record of the House the budget contributions from the last number of years by Deputies Bruton, De Rossa and Rabbitte, comparing their then proposals with what has been <Col N="1848" /> offered today by the Minister for Finance. I will spare the blushes of the Deputies opposite, not out of any generosity on my part.  What useful purpose would it serve?</P>
      <P>One could argue that as a result of such an <i>exposé</i> an amount of political embarrassment would accrue to the parties now forming the rainbow coalition. However, it has been decreed from the pinnacle of the high moral ground on Carrauntwohill, as enunciated and given an imprimatur by the high priests of political correctness, that only Fianna Fáil does political u-turns.  All other political parties make policy adjustments in the best interests of the country but never in their own interests, that being the preserve of those uncouth, muck savages, unprincipled and power hungry members of Fianna Fáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I also considered a second option in approaching my address.  This involved my Fianna Fáil colleagues and I, especially the members of the last Government, breaking down in tears at a prearranged signal and lamenting our luck in being out of Government at this time. Whether our opponents inside or outside the House care to acknowledge this, it is the policies of Fianna Fáil-led Governments since 1987 which have put the economy into its healthy state today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The House will be glad to know I discarded the approach of crying in public. Although it had much to recommend it to me, it was out of tune with our carefully crafted media image of being untruthful, heartless, unprincipled, etc. However, I feel like shedding a tear for the unfortunate Irish taxpaying public which in the last few months has had thrust upon it an inter-party Government of such divergent philosophies, policies and ideas that it is difficult to imagine any coherent medium-term <Col N="1849" /> strategy being followed, let alone long term planning.</P>
    <P>There are positive aspects of this budget and these I heartily welcome. Although it has been said previously, it can be stated honestly on this occasion that rarely if ever in the history of the State has such an opportunity been afforded to any Minister for Finance.  I have some sympathy for the predicament of the present Minister but even he cannot reconcile the irreconcilable. His colleagues have been spending the largesse in advance.</P>
    <P>As I pointed out on the publication of the Book of Estimates, it did not provide for expenditures which the Minister and at least some of his colleagues know must be paid for in 1995.  I also pointed out that over £180 million in spending financed by the tax amnesty was included in the 1994 base figures, which means the underlying rate of rise in the 1995 figures was about 6.5 per cent, not 4.1 per cent as announced on 27 January.  If a Government is not prepared to face up to the realities at the outset of its term and make decisions on priorities, what chance is there of tough decision making as we head nearer to a general election?  The answer is absolutely none, which is another blow to openness, transparency and accountability.</P>
    <P>Without a shadow of doubt the success of the past eight years has been bought at a high price.  For a certain number of politicians the price has been to be sent to this side of the House, or to be in Dáil Éireann no longer.  More than anything else, however, much hardship was imposed on some sectors of the Irish community, and necessary decisions had to be made.  The irony of the current situation is that the 1987 election campaign was run on the basis that we could not, with an overall majority, be trusted with the State's finances.</P>
    <P>The areas of borrowing, interest rates and inflation are interlinked.  Low interest rates and low inflation were the biggest contributors to economic improvement in the last eight years.  The <Col N="1850" /> record of the Fianna Fáil Party in Government &mdash; governing alone from 1987 to 1989, then with the Progressive Democrats and following that with the Labour Party &mdash; led by Fianna Fáil Ministers and Taoisigh contributed to that success.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance knows that interest rates have started to rise internationally. He and other Members of the House know that prudence is required.  I have always been dubious when analysts and experts agree on a point or when they say that things will lead in a certain direction.  It is a little like politicians and political commentators predicting how things on the political scene will be for some time to come.  We have seen in the recent past how foolhardy were the predictions made by all of us.  The Minister will be aware that difficulties face us in the future.  Interest rate hikes will affect the gains in this budget in taxation, welfare and all other areas.  They sap and erode confidence, lead to higher debt service costs and send us on the downward spiral again.  Inflation is the enemy of the poor.</P>
    <P>I wish to outline for the benefit of the House and those commentators who over that period of eight years have not given us the credit we deserve regarding the country's finances and economy &mdash; not that they will write anything flattering about us in the morning &mdash; the situation as it was at the end of 1986 when we came into power.  The Exchequer borrowing requirement at the end of 1986 was £2,145 million which was 12.1 per cent of GNP.  The current budget deficit was £1,395 million or 7.9 per cent of GNP.  At the end of 1994 the total Exchequer borrowing requirement was published as being only £672 million or 2.2 per cent of GNP but it was even lower than that, because in answer to a question I asked two weeks ago the Minister for Finance conceded that about £130 million of EU money which was scheduled to arrive in 1994 had not arrived and had been pencilled in for 1995.  If one adds in special once-off payments to Aer Lingus, An Post, etc. <Col N="1851" /> it is obvious that we had a lower Exchequer borrowing requirement.</P>
    <P>Despite such payments there was a current budget deficit of zero for the end of 1994 &mdash; in fact, there was a surplus of £15 million.  Fianna Fáil politicians see the difficulty in winning either way.  Some of the criticism levelled against our leader, Deputy Bertie Ahern, was that he was not being tough enough on the public finances while he was Minister for Finance.  Yet he achieved in three years something we had not achieved in the previous 27. This was the first current budget surplus for 27 years.  I made a semi-political career out of being tough about the public finances, together with the late Deputy John Kelly &mdash; a man of eminent common sense.  Deputy John Bruton proposed at one stage in the 1980s that if we ever achieved a current budget surplus we should introduce a law so that never again would that barrier be broken.  That was considered not only by Deputy Bruton but also by a wide cross section of opinion in this House. However, today we seem to be hellbent on going back to where we were.</P>
    <P>I welcome individual features of the budget but its overall financial strategy is flawed.  Its most serious defect is the Government's refusal to plan for a balanced current budget in 1995.  Some people would say that we should plan for a surplus in 1995 as we are probably at the top of the economic cycle now and prudence dictates, in business or in running a country, that that is the time to make the tough decisions, not when one is at the bottom end of the scale because that day will come as well. Officials who have served in the Department of Finance would agree with me. Many Members of the House, not least the Minister for Finance, might agree with me but it has not been done.  For the first time in a quarter of a century a small current account budget surplus arose last year.  It is quite extraordinary that a Government led by Deputy John Bruton would in this economic climate <Col N="1852" /> even countenance a return to the policy of running a current budget deficit.</P>
    <P>While it should not be a mortal sin for a politician to change his or her mind &mdash; except, of course, if one is a Fianna Fáil politician &mdash; I refuse to believe that Deputy Bruton and other Fine Gael Members have so changed their thinking on this policy issue.  It has proved exceptionally difficult for successive Governments, with attendant hardship for the public depending on public services, to get the public finances into some kind of order over the last eight years.  The policy experiment of current budget deficits was the main contributory factor in nearly bankrupting this country in the 1980s.  I repeat what I, Deputy Bruton and others said many years ago on this topic &mdash; as an experiment or option, there was nothing inherently wrong in adopting a policy of current budget deficits in the short term. However, the policy was a failure.  Of their very nature current budget deficits have no lasting economic benefit.  Worse still, they increased our national debt problems to mountainous proportions, the servicing of which imposes a severe financial burden on the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>It should be remembered that although our financial problems have improved, servicing the debt will cost over £2,100 million in 1995.  Politically, it proved nearly impossible to correct that slide.  Surely, we as politicians have learnt some lessons from the policy errors of the past.  The difficult corrective process took its toll not alone on politicians but on the public.  The vast majority of the public accepted the tough medicine but they did so on the explicit understanding that, having corrected the imbalances, no Government would ever repeat those mistakes.  It is amazing that Deputy Bruton and his party, who were passionate advocates of correcting the stupidity of the policy of current budget deficits not so long ago, have now been silenced.  Having got back economically near to the point from where we set out a quarter of a century ago it is daft to re-start the same crazy economics again.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1853" /> The Minister for Finance had the opportunity to plan for a balanced budget and make a bulwark decision which would make it practically impossible for any future Administration &mdash; regardless of what parties it included &mdash; to stray from that policy except in the most exceptional political or economic circumstances.  As the Minister has not done that today it will never be done, at least not in my political lifetime.</P>
    <P>In the recent past there has been considerable debate inside and outside this House about the disrespect in which politicians and the political process are held.  This phenomenon did not start in 1994.  It had its genesis in the foolhardy economic decisions in the 1970s.  We were not then prepared to live within our means as a nation and Governments of all persuasions were politically unable to stop the merry-go-round.  In 1995 there was an opportunity for this Government to make a categories statement in this regard which would have lasted into the future.  I am not just saying this to embarrass my good friends the Minister, Deputy Quinn.  Most sensible people and people who have thought about the way we have progressed in the past 20 years &mdash; indeed since the time Deputy Quinn and I were students in Earlsfort Terrace &mdash; realise that we have made chronic mistakes economically. At least my party, as was demonstrated in the past eight years, has learnt from them.</P>
    <P>Many things were said against our party in the 1970s and 1980s.  Everybody spoke about the problems, there were programmes to eliminate budget deficits and get the finances in order over four or five years and so on.  Everybody said that Fianna Fáil would never do it, but Fianna Fáil started the process, and in fairness to everybody, did it.  Former Deputy Garrett FitzGerald, the late John Kelly, the Taoiseach, Deputy Bruton, Deputy Dukes and others spoke about it, but no party was able to do it. Despite the best will in the world it was politically impossible to proceed until former Deputy Haughey came to power in 1987 and set in course the trail which <Col N="1854" /> my party, at least, has followed, resulting in Deputy Bertie Ahern's arrival and the happy situation which exists today.</P>

      <P>There is an inextricable link between the levels of taxation and the level of public service.  There is no economic or political benefit in any Government or parties creating the impression that levels of public service can increase without an attendant rise in taxation or an increase in economic activity.  Our high rates of taxation are a direct result of high borrowing to finance day to day expenditure from the past.  There is little point in promising more services if, as a nation, we do not create more economic wealth to be in a position to pay for them.  Deputy Quinn must have been livid when every morning for the past two weeks he read in the papers parts of what he intended to do in the budget.  He was not responsible for this, nor were any of his officials or anybody who works for him, even in a political context.  I have asked the Taoiseach to take corrective action on this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The largesse we have today would not have been possible without Fianna Fáil, who created it.  However, social welfare recipients have not benefited.  The Minister announced that they will receive a 2.5 per cent increase.  However, despite the problems and difficulties since 1987 no Fianna Fáil-led Government ever announced an increase of this kind of less than 3 per cent since then.  We gave <Col N="1855" /> an increase of 3 per cent in 1987, when things were at their worst, 3 per cent in 1988 and 1989, 5 per cent in 1990, 4 per cent in 1991 and 1992, 3.5 per cent in 1993 and 3 per cent in 1994.</P>

      <P>Deputy Rabbitte said on budget day last year that this modest increase of 3 per cent for social welfare recipients would not take effect until July 1994 &mdash; brought back by Deputy Quinn today in his budget &mdash; while other measures, such as the tax on unemployment benefit would take effect from 5 April 1994.  However, according to Deputy De Rossa's programme manager, or adviser, who leaked it this morning to the <i>Irish Press</i>&mdash; and I even recognise from the photograph the nice slogan I thought up while I was Minister for Social Welfare &mdash; the present budget is wonderful.  Regarding the moneys being provided to social welfare.  Deputy De Rossa, speaking on the Social Welfare Bill, 1994, stated in the Official Report, 1 March 1994; Vol. 439, cols. 1128 and 1129:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1856" /> This Bill is a totally inadequate response to the plight of those dependent on social welfare.  While the Bill contains some marginal improvements, such as increasing social welfare benefits in line with inflation, there is no evidence of any overall coherent strategy on social welfare reform, no acknowledgment of the seriousness of the plight of those on social welfare and no indication that the fight against poverty is to be moved up the political agenda ...</P>
    <P>... Those on social welfare had a right to expect some measures to substantially improve their position but once again they were passed over and virtually forgotten.  Most of the increases provided are minimal and will do nothing to improve their living standards.  The miserable level of most increases tell their own story [this excerpt is really good] &mdash; £2.10 extra for a contributory old age pensioner; £3.40 for a pensioner with a dependant aged over 66 and the figures for non-contributory pensions are worse &mdash; £1.80 and £2.90, respectively...</P>
    <P>... It is fair to anticipate that not too many bottles of champagne will be cracked open when these increases are eventually paid.  The wonderful increase of 40 pence per week for the child of a person on disability or unemployment benefit would scarcely pay for a bottle of milk, never mind a bottle of champagne.</P>
    <P>While I was Minister for Social Welfare, the Department produced statistics which have been published.  These include social welfare statistics for 1993 and weekly rates from July 1994.  The 2.5 per cent increase announced today is not even that, because it only applies to the personal rates, and, for the first time, it does not apply to the child dependency allowances.  Those who are receiving social welfare benefits today and who, therefore, believe they are to receive an increase of 2.5 per cent will be disappointed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1857" /> A principal feature of the budget is that an old age pensioner, for whom Deputy De Rossa said last year that an increase of £2.10 was not enough, will receive an increase amounting to the wonderful sum of £1.80 per week.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy De Rossa may go on to talk about the child benefit allowances.  According to statistics from the Department of Social Welfare, the numbers of people in receipt of old age pension contributory, old age pension non-contributory and retirement pension amounted to 241,272 recipients in July 1993, covering, with dependants and children, a total of 293,959.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding the miracles of hormonal science, it may be taken for granted that most of those people will not benefit from the child benefit allowances in the next few months.  Therefore over 250,000 people will receive no benefit from the child benefit allowances. Not too many bottles of champagne will be cracked open when these allowances are paid.  Bill McLaren, the well known Scottish rugby correspondent, was inclined to remark when Wales was doing well: &ldquo;Oh they will be singing in the valleys tonight&rdquo;. However, Granny Maloney in Finglas will not be dancing tonight, whatever else she may be doing.  These increases are less than those granted at any time previously.  No matter how bad the circumstances, we never gave 2.5 per cent. If we are not prepared, when things are going reasonably well, to look after old people it is not the kind of society I wish to be part of.</P>
      <P>I welcome the increase in child benefit allowance and I agree with the commitment in the Programme for Government that more resources will be devoted to that area.  I support those reforms which have been advocated in excellent reports to various Ministers over a long number of years.  The expert analysts have had enough say, it is time to get on with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1858" /> The increases to the old in our community are miserable.  They are not members of an organisation with large numbers of programme managers and press advisers who will be giving out leaflets and appearing on television tonight to say how wonderful things are. Those 241,000 people have to live from day-to-day and I am proud that my party provided well for the old and the sick over the years.</P>

      <P>People who regard themselves as being of the left persuasion in Irish politics think they are the only people who ever did anything for the old.  Various Taoisigh and Ministers for Finance and Social Welfare of this party brought about major improvements for the elderly over a long period.</P>
      <P>I could hear loud sighs from my former Cabinet colleagues on the Fianna Fáil benches when the Labour Minister for Finance announced changes in the residential property tax.  I am sure that I speak for all my colleagues in the last Government when I say that we are pleased to witness another Pauline conversion of the Labour Party, particularly on residential property tax, so beloved by it since the mid-1980s.  It was so loved in the 1990s that it had to be changed for the 1994 budget.</P>
      <P>In this era of transparency, I do not think that I am letting out a secret in telling the House that it was in the interests of partnership that my party agreed to the changes suggested by the Labour Party for the 1994 budget.  Let it be a lesson to Deputy Bertie Ahern, if he is in such comfortable position again, that that was what partnership taught us in the end.  I always thought that the residential property tax &mdash; and it has been sold as such &mdash; was the brainchild of the Labour Party because it first came into being in the Labour-Fine Gael Government of 1982-87.  Some time ago, I had the great privilege of reviewing a book &mdash; I must admit that I did not read all of it but I read most of it &mdash; by Dr. Garret FitzGerald entitled <i>All in a Life.</i></P>

Is this the same Eithne Fitzagerald who is now a Minister of State?  It looks like it.  I always thought that the Labour Party loved this idea and that it was theirs. However, he seemed to get a bit uppity that he did not get the credit for it.  On page 437 he says: &ldquo;Naturally enough, when I put this to Dick Spring during our post election discussions he was happy to accept my proposal, which came to be seen in due course as a &ldquo;Labour&rdquo; tax, despite the fact that I never made any secret of the fact that it was my idea&rdquo;.</P>

    <P>I am willing to give credit to Deputy Fitzgerald for the idea.  I can visualise Dr. Garret FitzGerald and Minister of State, Deputy FitzGerald &mdash; or councillor as she was then &mdash; at a barbecue, and while someone else was cooking the <Col N="1860" /> steaks, they were discussing this wonderful idea about residential property tax.  It looks as if it was a Fine Gael idea taken over by the Labour Party.

I will not surprise Deputy Quinn, or any other members of the Labour Party who were in Government with me, when I say that I regard this tax as nonsensical. The record of the House will show that in various budget speeches, since the tax was introduced in the 1980s, I always referred to it as a nonsensical tax.  It was dreamt up between Dame Eithne and Dr. Garret at some family function.  I give a commitment on behalf of my party that we will abolish residential property tax when we are back in power.</P>

      <P>I welcome the changes in pay related social insurance, tax bands and allowances; however, there is nothing tremendous about <Col N="1861" /> them.  In 1994, allowances for a married person were increased by £350, the band was increased by £1050 and the income levy was abolished.  We had agreed with the Labour Party that in the lifetime of the Government the PRSI thresholds would go from £9,000 to £11,000 to £13,000 to £15,000.  This began with the changes brought in by Deputy Bertie Ahern last year, as Deputy Quinn well knows.  I welcome the fact that he has continued that process and exempting the first £50 is a good idea.  However, there are difficulties in doing this because it creates other problems.  I do not want to say too much on that area in case I would be seen as knocking the idea with which he has come forward or his continuing the idea which we began in last year's budget.  The Minister and others will recognise that setting thresholds creates other problems.  However, I welcome the changes.</P>
      <P>The whole idea is to get more people at the lower levels out of the tax net. The simplest way, of course, of doing that is to increase the thresholds.  It is quite expensive but the greatest improvement can occur there.  Widening tax bands does not benefit the low earner because he never reaches the 48 per cent level and pays a great amount in PRSI.  The classic situation is that working does not make him better off. If the Minister can keep increasing the thresholds in this way, he will shortly arrive at a point where it will seem better to lower the rates overall.  Perhaps, in the longer term, that is a better approach.  However, I recognise what he has done.</P>
      <P>I see that the Minister is paying for the £60 million provision for equal treatment payments by taking £50 million from the Social Insurance Fund.  Will the Minister for Social Welfare explain that when he addresses the House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Minister for Social Welfare explain, when he comes before the House, what the Minister for Finance is doing there because I note in his Budget Statement that he is taking credit for departmental balances.  However, he is raiding the Social Insurance Fund and <Col N="1862" /> distorting the expenditure figures and I want to know what he is doing in that regard.  As far as I know there are no underlying assets remaining in the fund. Will the Minister for Social Welfare clear up this point because in the year of openness and transparency it is important to know exactly from where everything is coming?  On taxation measures, Fianna Fáil Ministers for Finances since 1987 took a responsible attitude towards the State's finances and introduced various measures, as circumstances allowed, such as the widening of bands.  There are conflicting economic theories as to whether low rates of taxation always stimulate economic activity.  Although there is not universal agreement on that &mdash; Deputies on my extreme right might disagree &mdash; there is full agreement that high rates of taxation are a disincentive not only to PAYE workers but to the self-employed, whether they are farmers, shopkeepers, builders, factory owners or whatever.  Although politicians on the left of the political spectrum would have us believe otherwise, the most successful economies in the world are those where people are allowed to work without massive State intervention.  This is people empowerment in its fullest sense.</P>
    <P>The State should from employment taxation redistribute services to those in society who are not so lucky.  However, if a taxation system reaches a point where the incentive to people to work is lessened, legitimate economic activity grinds downwards, the black economy flourishes and less taxation is collected in order to provide services.  Borrowing is then increased to make up the shortfall and/or desirable services must be cut and we continue on the downward spin. It may surprise some, but I do not believe in a low rate of taxation <i>per se.</i> An economy approximately 3,000 miles west of Ireland has very low rates of taxation, but an ordinary person would have to mortgage his home a couple of times over to pay medical expenses if he had to spend a period in hospital.  This is not the type of system in which I <Col N="1863" /> believe and neither does my party or the vast majority of Irish people.</P>
    <P>I welcome the change in the budget which alleviates the burden of PAYE and PRSI on the low paid.  Perhaps the Minister could have gone a little further, but I welcome the change as a step in the right direction.  Changes in PRSI for employers are to be welcomed.  It is difficult for outsiders to make sense of a system which imposes a tax on employers for keeping people at work while, at the same time, 280,000 people are unemployed.  There is a myriad of schemes, agencies and support services to get people back to work, but, at the same time, a tax is placed on employers who take them on.  This contradicts the objectives of the job creation measures. High levels of taxation on income or capital results in extraordinary non-productive resources being devoted to ways of avoiding making a payment to the State.  These are constructed in such a way that no payment at all is made to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>It should now be evident that there would be a greater return from the State's finances if capital gains tax was levied at the lower rate.  Such thinking may not necessarily appeal to socialists. They prefer high rates and little return, rather than a realistic rate and a good return to the State.  Less capital gains tax is collected but any financial adviser in this city will tell one that a large proportion of the major deals are organised so as to minimise liability to capital gains tax.  Would it not be much better to have a realistic rate of such taxation? There would be a better return to the Exchequer, a pro-business culture would be assisted and business people would devote more of their energy to wealth creation and less to devising schemes to hold onto their wealth and avoid State taxes.  The ongoing battle of wits between the Revenue Commissioners and tax advisers, with one side finding loopholes and the other closing them in successive budgets, would lessen and the released intelligence could be far more productively employed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1864" /> The Minister changed corporation tax from 40 per cent to 38 per cent.  While I welcome the Minister, Deputy Quinn's commitment to downward rates of corporation tax, he has gone about it the wrong way, because the banks will be the main beneficiaries.  The Minister announced the amount the levy will bring in over coming years and has entered an agreement with them.  It may surprise people that the take from corporation tax is made up approximately as follows: 64 per cent of total coporation tax is from companies at the 10 per cent rate, while the remaining 36 per cent is at the 40 per cent rate.  Over £170 million was taken in 1994 from companies in the Financial Services Centre.  It has been an outstanding success and those who thought of the idea should be congratulated, rather than denigrated. Fianna Fáil ran with the idea, although it came from Mr. Desmond &mdash; I will make no secret of the fact that he is a friend of mine &mdash; who was pilloried inside and out side the House for a long time.  It was fundamentally his idea and Mr. Haughey and the Fianna Fáil Government ran with it.  It is a big success storey and it is only fair, given the level of denigration that man suffered, to state that it was his idea.  He made a lasting contribution to the State not alone because the Exchequer receives corporation tax, but because it has given Dublin and Ireland a profile as a place in which to do business.  It has enhanced the value of doing business in Ireland and made it a respectable place for financial people in which to operate.  This is also why &mdash; and the Minister knows I mean this &mdash; leaks about the budget harm our image.  I make political points at various times but these leaks damage our respectability as a financial centre. We should not lose that respectability.</P>
    <P>If the Financial Services Centre, construction companies and banks, which pay approximately £140 million in corporation tax, are omitted, one is left with quite a small figure.  It would be much better to go down the route of targeting a much lower corporation tax rate, perhaps 25 per cent in year one, <Col N="1865" /> down to 10 per cent in year two.  This has been recommended by all those who have submitted reports on the services sector.  Reducing corporation tax by 2 per cent for everyone is not a targeted or structured approach and not one report has recommended such a move and continuing that downward spiral. The Minister knows that the rainy day will come and the temptation for any Minister for Finance, irrespective of political party or Administration, will be to push it up again.</P>
    <P>The services sector where jobs are being created could be targeted.  All the growth in the number of jobs in the past number of years has come from this sector and small Irish companies.  There used to be a corporation tax system under which profits below a certain figure were liable to a lower corporation tax rate.  I advise the Minister, between now and his next budget, to go down this route.  It will be of more benefit because those companies are contributing. There are approximately 160,000 small companies and why not have a lower corporation tax rate for profits, for example, below £80,000?  It would be easy to work it out and I ask the Minister to target particular companies.  It is worth considering.</P>
    <P>The question of third level fees is a priority but the Minister has not dealt with this properly.  As the public finances improve, there is merit in abolishing third level fees.  It first appeared as a commitment from Fianna Fáil in the 1992 general election but it is not the way to go now, given the constraints on the public finances and the number of people in education.  There are various expert reports and much agreement on this matter.  It is politically attractive to do it and I do not deny that but I do not think it is the route we should take. We had a debate in the House quite recently and there was a good airing of views but the Minister's proposal will not give one additional third level place in education and that is where the problem fundamentally lies.  All experts agree that the more educated people <Col N="1866" /> become the better chance they have of getting a job and all that follows from that; the better lifestyle a person is going to have.  It is attractive politically and if there was plenty of money about, I would certainly do this in the manner the Minister has done now, but I do not think this is the time to do it.  Certainly before the election, presumably in 1997, it should be done.  That is my only quibble about it.</P>
    <P>As someone who was elected in 1977, like lots of Deputies here including the Minister, Deputy Quinn, the abolition of local authority rates springs to mind when I see the abolition of third level fees.  It was well heralded and everyone welcomed it.  It was a good idea but it starved local authorities and took away their independence.  They are now paying the price.  I am afraid the same thing will happen regarding universities and in a few years every university will have other devices to get money from people.</P>
    <P>I welcome the tax change the Minister made regarding students attending private colleges etc. and going abroad. Perhaps that is the route he should have taken in regard to the whole area.  I am sure it is an option he would have considered. It would have been less expensive and he might have worked towards the abolition of fees in due course.  What is the equity of a person earning £70,000, a Cabinet Minister for example, receiving free fees?  The Minister may argue that covenants are being ended, and I will come to that later.  Instead of giving the £70,000 earner partial tax relief on fees by way of covenant, the Labour Party is deciding now to give them the whole lot.  I am sure the socialist conscience of Deputy Quinn, well heard of when he was in University College Dublin, knows that it is a nonsense. It just does not add up and there is no redistribution.</P>
    <P>I welcome what the Minister said in his speech regarding covenants and how he is going to deal with them.  I ask him to be very cautious in that regard.  I am sure the Revenue Commissioners have been looking at these figures quite lately but I would be very uncertain that they <Col N="1867" /> will be able to extract exact numbers and loss to the Exchequer, despite a parliamentary reply quite recently as to the exact numbers of people benefiting from educational covenants.  It is not an easy figure to extract.  I know he intends not to adopt a broad blanket approach and is going to allow covenants to the handicapped.  Religious orders will also have to be accommodated.  People in religious orders covenant their income to the order or covenant it to older priests, brothers or nuns in that order. He would want to be careful.</P>
    <P>Private third level colleages will be disadvantaged too.  I think, and this is really a Finance Bill approach, that there are certainly likely to be court challenges to his proposals, if they go ahead.  Section 49 of the Income Tax Act, 1967 restricts the type of covenant that will qualify for tax relief.  One of the key requirements for the type of covenant affected by the Minister's proposal is that the convenant be paid for a period of six years.  The changes that the Minister is putting into place will change those rules.  It is very much like abolishing, say, industrial buildings allowances for hotels.  A person building an hotel would have been told that for the next ten years they would be allowed to write off 10 per cent of the cost against taxable income.  If the relief was abolished half way through it would lead to a court challenge under the doctrine of legitimate expectations.  Many people have entered into legal obligations in this regard and I do not think it will be very easy for the Minister to extricate himself in this respect.  It is a matter that will have to be considered in the Finance Bill but I, at least, am uncertain.</P>
    <P>The Minister has granted £1,000 tax relief for the motor trade and I welcome it.  I cannot for the life of me see how it will have a tremendous effect but the Society of the Irish Motor industry has supported the idea and I congratulate the Minister on taking up the idea.  The Minister for Finance last year made a change in VRT which had a tremendous <Col N="1868" /> effect on the number of new cars sold and a large number of jobs was created. I do not think this change will have the same effect as Deputy Ahern's change last year but I welcome it for what it might do.  I am sure the Minister took the view that it cannot cost a whole lot and we might as well try it.  I welcome the type of thinking.  The change in VRT last year was a monumental change.  It was a gamble by the Minister for Finance and the Government but it worked well and I hope this one works half as well.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister is proposing some change, presumably in the Finance Bill, in benefit-in-kind legislation regarding cars and I think he should. The story is well told, and there is not much point in repeating it, that the reason for change in the benefit-in-kind legislation is that it was probably thought up by a civil servant who was on his way to work one morning and got a little upset to see the managing director of some company going by.  It might just be like that.  It should be changed.</P>
    <P>I also ask the Minister to consider some additional relief in the Finance Bill for workers living in the Republic but working in Northern Ireland.  It may be possible to introduce some type of allowance to get over the problem of certain cross-Border workers.  I caution the Minister, as I can see further anomalies being created by changes that might be made there, but it is something that should be considered, particularly in the light of events of the past six months or so.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister also on his change in capital acquisitions tax.  I hope something further can be done there.</P>
    <P>As a former Minister for Tourism, I note the idea regarding holiday resorts throughout the country.  As the Minister for Finance well knows, that was a hobbyhorse of my own and we were hoping to get it into the budget this year.  I was considerably helped and I knew I would not have difficulty incorporating it into <Col N="1869" /> the budget because I too was going to include Ballybunion.</P>

      <P>It is welcome because some resorts have been declining since the 1960s and some of the people in business there have suffered bad times. Not all resorts are like that but some are decrepit and run down.  A tax break scheme is a good idea.  I welcome the Minister's idea and I hope it works well for him.  The tourism industry can help create more jobs than any other sector. There is a projected increase of 35,000 over the next few years and that is before we ever had the results of peace and of the ceasefire.</P>
      <P>What has happened to the third banking force?  The Minister has included £83 million, presumably from the sale of Irish Life shares, in the Estimates as published last weekend.  Has the third force been forgotten about and what is going to happen?  If he goes ahead with the third force there will be a gain to the Exchequer of a considerable amount of money.  What is he going to do with that fund?  I hope it is not going to be spent on current expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think we should take some credit on this side of the House for the public capital programme.  The public capital programme this year is up by 18.6 per cent from £2,242 million to £2,659 million. It is the highest public capital programme since 1990 and it is as a direct result of the EU funding which the last Government secured in Europe.  We suffered a lot of abuse, both inside and outside the House, as to that whole debate.  This is the result of it and many worthwhile projects of a capital nature, which will have a spin-off in jobs and lasting economic benefit to the country, are the result of it.  I would like people <Col N="1870" /> to give us some credit in that particular regard.</P>
    <P>The buzz word is transparency.  In this budget speech and in the Estimates you are unlikely to see better examples of the opaque as opposed to a policy of transparency.  I am not decrying the Government or this Minister in following the footsteps of many others.  If transparency is to mean anything it must mean that the Government does not, at worst, seek to deceive or at a lesser but still unforgivable level seek to confuse or obfuscate and in general use language and procedures which are not readily comprehensible.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Estimates I would guess that a maximum of six people in the country fully understand what they are about. I may be flattering myself but I think I fall into a larger but still very small group of people who have a reasonable grasp on most of the issues involved.  I am not among that six, I can assure you.  That is not because I am a chartered accountant.  The reason is that I have spent many years trying to decipher the Estimates.  They aggravated me so much that I spent that amount of time trying to understand them.  Exactly the same is true of the budget.  The figures are presented with the deliberate intention of deceiving.  I know that is a strong thing to say but I think we are so far away from clarity that we have moved through the stage of deliberate confusion and into the stage where deception is the order of the day.  Why does the Minister not begin by saying: &ldquo;We owe approximately £30 billion, of which £12 billion is for non-Irish institutions and individuals. The balance is owed to Irish-based institutions and individuals.  Our income this year from taxation will be approximately A coming from the following sources [and list them].  We estimate that we will spend X on the following. The shortfall will be made up by borrowing Y.  That means that at the end of the year we will owe X minus Y plus the outstanding amount we begun with. Projections for future years include the <Col N="1871" /> following ...&rdquo;.  At this point the Minister could go on and explain his medium and long term strategy.  That is not the way it is done.</P>
    <P>I intend to bring up in the future something I mentioned recently.  We will have to change the Irish national accounts and the New Zealand method is the one to copy.  Before we get to the method of accrual accounting we should have gross accounting because the accounts or the Estimates do not show the true picture.  For agencies and other bodies it is a total mess.  Agencies spend time at the end of the year devising ways and methods to confuse the situation. I urge the Minister to go down the route I advocate.  You cannot plan at all unless you know where you are or where you are going.</P>
    <P>Regarding investment, this budget has been heralded as pro-jobs.  I hope that improvements and the numbers of people in work increase and multiply over the figures from last year which was the most successful year ever for the creation of jobs.  More people were at work at the end of 1994 than ever in the history of the State.  What is wrong with making Ireland an attractive tax location for the wealthy?  Is it not better to have the wealthy residing in Ireland with resulting economic investment here?  I do not understand the mentality of politicians and opinion-makers who appear to advocate a type of financial puritanism in this area.  Maybe it is another virulent form of political correctness.</P>
    <P>The furore over the so-called passports for sale debate makes me wonder if I am living in the same island economy as some commentators.  The economy in which I reside has 280,000 persons unemployed.  It is situated on the periphery of Europe, has a population of only 3.5 million, has too small a demand economy, does not have any great indigenous resources of wealth, needs entrepreneurs to start and encourage business development and is very short of equity and low in capital at realistic rates.  Our economy is not one <Col N="1872" /> which can afford to turn away £1 million investments in Irish business.  In my experience it is Irish business starved of cheap finance who are seeking foreign investors, not the other way around.  Certainly let us provide adequate safeguards for the integrity of the Irish passport.  Let us also be pragmatic and realise that what we need here is more, not less, investment.  Just in case that has not yet dawned on some we have competitors for such investment. We Irish are justifiably proud of the Irish passport but it has no greater kudos than many others.</P>
    <P>Something which has always struck me as peculiarly Irish is our unique form of begrudgery.  It seems to be particularly flourishing of late.  The disease has reached epidemic proportions in the last decade.  The virus would appear to be particularly prevalent among certain politicians, certain segments of the middle class and wildly contagious in the media.  The exponents of this uniquely Irish phenomenon hold that for a business person to make a profit is quite unseemly.  No account can be taken of the fact that that particular person may have worked exceptionally hard, taken risks and created jobs for many.  This person &mdash; be it a farmer, shopkeeper, financier or factory owner &mdash; is to be castigated at every opportunity. Strangely, the same people also appear to know what is right for the underprivileged and the poor, although very few of them come from ordinary working class backgrounds.  If this country is to succeed we must encourage the risk-taker, give him or her a fair return for their investment, have a taxation system that rewards incentive, and not alone encourages the business person but gives hope to the unemployed and the less well off so they can succeed in life.  I am proud of my party's record over the past eight years.  I am proud of the way we have turned this country around economically, with great difficulty. Many people would have said we would not have been prepared to do it and we would never have succeeded in doing it.  That was the sense of despair <Col N="1873" /> prevalent at the end of 1986.  I have sympathy for all the political problems there were in the 1980s but no one did it except us.  It is time our party activists around the country were proud to take credit for that, not just the politicians in this House.</P>
    <P>I conclude by saying that the budget is a major disappointment.  It has been heralded so well in advance that there have been no surprises.  That is not the real disappointment.  I am really disappointed that we have not learned anything from the mistakes of the past.  We ought to have more people employed next year.  Everyone should have a chance of a proper return.  I say this to those of a socialist, hard-left persuasion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Whether one is a business person, a person at home or unemployed everyone likes some incentive. People of the left say they will create jobs.  No Government anywhere in the world ever created a job.  If it did create them it was in the public service, paid for by the taxation of others.  Business people create jobs or the unemployed person goes out and does something in the expectation of getting a small margin. Depending on the scale of the operation the business person says &ldquo;I won't invest unless I get a 10 per cent return&rdquo;. A person in a small business will invest money if there is an even chance of getting it back with a small return.  Encouragement should be given to the unemployed person at home so that if the opportunity arises of doing some work he or she will take that opportunity rather than say they are better off sitting at home.  That is the problem in Irish life which we have to face.  &ldquo;Profit&rdquo; and &ldquo;incentive&rdquo; should not be dirty words. The tax breaks the Minister has introduced should be linked to job preservation or job creation.  There is no point in having a wide range of agencies and supports throughout the system if people simply take the money and cut down the number of jobs.  We must find some method of linking those breaks to <Col N="1874" /> the supports that are given.  Governments do not create jobs.</P>
      <P>I am sorry the Minister for Finance has been put in a position that he has not been able to do the things he would realistically want to do himself.  He did something I expected of him.  He gave some credit to his predecessor, Deputy Ahern, for the improvement in the public finances in the past year.  That I welcome. Maybe it shows a realistic appreciation by the Minister of what was achieved in the past eight years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy McCreevy pointed out, and rightly so, that in the 1945-50 Labour Government in Great Britain the then Chancellor of the Exchequer, Hugh Dalton, was forced to resign because of an inadvertent leak which came from his lips and went into the public domain.  I was thinking of the difference in standards between that man, who certainly did not intend to leak anything, and this administration, which tells people who receive faxes to contact programme managers for more information and that they will hear more, presumably.  That is a most remarkable change in 50 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was also thinking about that Labour administration because it brought to mind a phrase about Clement Attlee, the then Labour Prime Minister, that he was &ldquo;a modest man with a lot to be modest about.&rdquo;  I wondered about this Minister for Finance and whether that applied to him.  I do not think he can claim to be modest but this budget is one about which he has a lot to be modest. The Minister claims on the first page of his Financial Statement that this is a &ldquo;radical&rdquo; budget.  By the end, I am glad to see, reality had dawned because on the last page we are told that this budget &ldquo;is but one small step in that direction.&rdquo;  Something is radical on page 1 but by the end it has petered out and whimpered out to the point of being one <Col N="1877" /> small, faltering, tottering step towards improving our tax system.</P>
    <P>I also note, and this is one of the most alarming confessions of intellectual and political bankruptcy that I have ever heard, that this budget amounts to a distillation of the best ideas brought to the Cabinet table.  God save us from the worst ideas.  We should look at what is in this budget and look at real people and what effect this budget will have on ordinary Joe Soaps and Josephine Soaps around the country.  We should sweep away the propaganda and the verbal hype.  Let me put before the minds of Members an employee earning £240 a week somebody who is earning below the average industrial wage, earning about £13,000 per annum.  That person is £5 per week gross better off, on the Minister's calculations.  That person, if one takes into account the fact that he or she may make VHI and mortgage payments, is probably going to have the price of 20 or 30 cigarettes extra in his or her weekly wage, after the increase today.  That is the change for somebody earning below the average industrial wage.  We are asked to accept that that is radical change and that this is a radical budget, that to give somebody who is paying tax at 55.75 per cent, including PRSI, £3 a week more &mdash; or £5 if he or she has no mortgage or VHI payments &mdash; is radical change.  If this is the best that the Labour, Fine Gael and Democratic Left Parties can do for single workers earning below the average industrial wage, if this is their best shot in good budgetary circumstances, I say: &ldquo;Go now and get out now.&rdquo;  I fear that when the budgetary circumstances become significantly worse and one has a tighter budgetary situation, which the Minister has presaged in his budgetary speech, there will be a complete end to any sensible and far-reaching tax reform.</P>

      <P>We will come to that in a moment.  At every single hand's turn, there has been a simple, cynical lack of determination in relation to the taxation system.  It was the Labour Party that introduced &mdash; and let us not forget this &mdash; the infamous 1 per cent levy on incomes.  The Labour Party imposed a fifth new tax on work which was only in position for one year and was then abandoned when the trade union movement threatened to rebel.  That is what happened.  It was the Labour Party that introduced the income levy and abandoned it.  It was the Labour Party that insisted on widening residential property tax.  Deputy McCreevy told us how they managed to persuade Fianna Fáil, at the eleventh hour, to do that.  This year, in coalition with two other parties, the Labour Party abandons it.  I wonder what it is about the Labour Party that it seeks two new taxes, residential property tax, which has this peculiar parentage that Deputy McCreevy told us about&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash; and the income levy, which was thought up by a Labour-dominated coalition &mdash; and abandons them within a year.  Why is it so lacking in any overall vision of the taxation system that it brings in measures of this kind and abandons them in such short order?  Perhaps this is what should be called 10:22 a.m. &mdash; type Government.  Perhaps the real measure of the Labour Party in Government is that it can change its mind cynically by putting up its finger and feeling what way the wind is blowing, either on which party it will coalesce or what it actually believes in.  There is no central philosophy to this budget and what the Minister has said about solidarity and enterprise and rewarding effort is, I suggest, an overblown piece of rhetoric that does not stand up to examination when you look at the real effect on a real person.</P>

      <P>Somebody earning below the average industrial wage still has to pay tax on the margin at 55.75 per cent after this Labour Minister's budget. They still have to pay on the margin. More than half of their extra earnings, increases or overtime or whatever, has to go to the Minister of Finance.  That happens to people who are below the average industrial wage.  If this is the Labour Party's vision of how our tax system should be, I despair.</P>
      <P>We have a system where the standard rate of tax is 27 per cent, which is far too high.  On top of that PRSI is levied at 7.75 per cent which means that a level of 33 per cent tax applies to people who are even lower down the wages pecking order.  The simple fact is that we have an anti-work tax system and that this particular set of changes is nothing like radical reform.</P>
      <P>If you look at the proposal to increase the single person's standard rate band by £700 it sounds like something until you realise that when you hold it up to the light it is very little indeed.  In real terms it is half its nominal value, because it is 6 per cent of the wages level at which it comes into effect and if you allow for 2.5 per cent or 3 per cent inflation it really means that we are dealing with a total change in the real value of that band of approximately 3 per cent.  That is not radical tax reform, nor is the £150 increase in the personal allowance.  If it was indexed to a 3 per cent inflation rate it would have to go up by more or less half that amount, so when you are talking about the tax allowances and the tax bands that have been altered in this budget, allowing for inflation, there is a change of between 3 per cent and 4 per cent in real terms. That is not the stuff of radical tax reform.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I endorse abolishing PRSI on the first £2,500 worth of income because it is a step in the right direction but I am surprised that portions of it are clawed back immediately by an elimination of <Col N="1880" /> the PRSI tax allowance for those who are working.  In any event, it still leaves the infamous levies of 1 per cent and 1.25 per cent on all income because the exemption of the first £2,500 applies to only those paying the 5.25 per cent PRSI rate.  This will not be dealt with in marginal incremental changes over a number of budgets.</P>
    <P>The tax system took more in 1994 out of the income tax payers' pockets than it did in 1993 and it will take more in 1995 out of their pockets, despite all these changes, than it did in 1994.  The reason for that, of course, is that income tax grows at a faster rate than the rate of inflation because it is paid by people on the margin.  If you have 2 per cent or 3 per cent inflation in any given year you will have a 5 per cent or 6 per cent automatic rise in the yield of income tax in the same year.  Therefore, Ministers who claim that they are giving away tax and that there is money available for tax reductions never acknowledge, at the end of the year when they again crawl sheepishly into the House to explain what happened in the last year, that more people ended up paying more money into the Exchequer because of the viciously progressive tax system which exists in this country.</P>
    <P>I note that the Minister, Deputy Quinn, went through the annual ritual of announcing that 10,000 people would be taken out of the tax net this year.  Dr. Séan Barrett, the Trinity College economist, has gone through old budget speeches to see how many people have in fact fallen out of the tax net and he has come-up with the interesting statistic that in recent years over one third of a million people have been counted out of the tax net by various Ministers for Finance at the beginning of a year by reference to changes in marginal relief, tax exemption levels and the like, but when it comes to the end of the year they are back in there again.  Like the commentator on the Falklands war, you count them all out and count them all in again and they all come safely home to roost like jackdaws at the end of the day.  They will be back where they were, <Col N="1881" /> paying tax, because we have this viciously anti-work tax system which takes account of inflation.  The Minister may claim that on paper 10,000 tax payers are exiting the tax paying class this year but they will be back.  However, they will all receive increases of varying amounts during the year and they will be back paying tax at the end of the year, as always happens on these occasions.</P>
    <P>What this country needs is radical tax reform.  There is something radically wrong with our tax system and it needs something radical to put it right.  An incrementalist, marginal view of the world which changes the real value of income tax allowances and bands by 3 per cent in real terms has nothing to do with radical tax reform.  A system that leaves people who earn below the average industrial wage paying 55.75 per cent of their overtime or extra earnings to the State is radically wrong.  Such a system needs extensive surgery to make it right but nothing that has been done in this budget even suggests that this message is understood in Merrion Street.</P>
    <P>There is a reason we cannot afford to continue our complete obliviousness as to the effects of our tax system in future. Now that the peace process is in train and we have peace on our island, now that investment decisions as between, say, Dundalk and Newry are real decisions about which real foreign investors will have to make up their minds, we must face up to the fact that anybody who intended to locate a labour intensive industry in the north east of this island would be simply mad to locate it in Dundalk if he or she could get any similar terms for locating it in Newry.  The reason of course is that the difference between what the British Exchequer imposes by way of income tax and payroll levies on the wage bill on a factory in Newry is dramatically less than the Irish Exchequer imposes on a factory of a similar kind located in, say, Dundalk or Drogheda.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1882" /> We must now face up to the fact that we now belong to a single labour market with the United Kingdom.  Of course there are barriers in terms of travel and establishment for Irish workers going to and from the United Kingdom, but we now know that in Border counties, workers are crossing the Border in pursuit of employment.  They know the very dramatic difference between paying United Kingdom tax and Irish tax on their income and that will have a magnetic effect in drawing employment and employment centred investment north of the Border.  We are living in a fool's paradise in this country if we believe that we can maintain our system of high payroll taxes without any regard to what are, in economic terms, laws as immutable as the law of gravity.</P>
    <P>The difference between this party and other parties in this House is that we believe that tax rates matter.  I note that in our negotiations recently with the Labour Party, which were inconclusive, we were told that tax rates do not matter. Of course they do.  As Deputy McCreevy pointed out, when someone risks their capital or their effort in any enterprise, they want to know what the return is.  If the State, for its part, insists on taking half of the return back to itself, it has about the same effect as if Deputy McCreevy, when betting at Naas racecourse, faced a 50 per cent tax on his winnings.  It would definitely make him much slower to put money on odds-on favourites.</P>
    <P>The tax system has the same effect on enterprise in this country.  It is not the case that people simply carry on as normal and resent the rate of tax.  People change their behaviour to meet the tax system and I agree with Deputy McCreevy that our system of capital gains tax radically affects business decisions made daily in this city and country.  Many people have gone abroad because of our capital gains tax system and many deals are done in a convoluted way to minimise exposure to capital gains tax.  That is why I put down a question recently to the Minister for Finance to ask him what would the cost <Col N="1883" /> be to the Exchequer of reducing the 40 per cent rate of capital gains tax to 20 per cent.</P>
    <P>The remarkable answer was approximately £14 million per annum.  That £14 million, which in budgetary terms is insignificant, has nothing to do with real tax equity.  However, it has a massive disincentive effect on real enterprise in Ireland.  As Deputy McCreevy said, our rates of capital gains tax are so penal that most people avoid the transactions which would attract that taxation in the first place, whereas if one were to look to lower rates of taxation one would in the last analysis increase the volume of transactions dramatically and thereby increase the return to the Exchequer. That applies not only to capital gains tax but also to income tax.</P>
    <P>The universal international experience is that low marginal rates tend to attract into the tax net and out of the black economy, out of tax avoidance and evasion and into the real economy where it can be taxed a significant flow of income.  This country should not be afraid to have lower rates of tax.  As long as we maintain high rates of tax, particularly on employment, as long as we continue to tax work as though it was a luxury in an economy where it is a dire necessity, as long as we continue to tax work and effort in the way we do, this country will not escape from the vice the present tax system constitutes as far as enterprise is concerned.  We need something radically different and we need politicians above all who are determined to seek something radically different.</P>
    <P>It is clear beyond contradiction that the provision for tax reform in this budget is minimalist; it is a few percentage points here and there and will not have a dramatic effect on the Irish economy. Furthermore, all the public comment of the politicians involved in framing this budget has been universally of the kind that so much money will be available for tax reduction at the end of the budgetary negotiation process.  I believe in a totally different approach to <Col N="1884" /> budgetary policy.  Any Government worth its salt should say &ldquo;Over three or four years, this is the tax system we will achieve; these are the stages by which we will achieve it; expenditure and borrowing must conform to arriving at this particular tax model at the end of the four year period&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>If taxation was regarded not as the residual, the bottom line balancing item in the budgetary process, but was regarded as the cornerstone, the point of departure for every budget in the life of a Government, and if a Government set out to achieve a radically different tax reform and insisted that public spending must play second fiddle to taxation reform and must be controlled in the interests of taxation reform, then this country could have taxation reform. It is clear beyond contradiction from this budget that the Government does not believe in that.</P>
    <P>If one looks at <i>A Government of Renewal</i> programme there is not one single measurable taxation target.  When this Government goes out of office &mdash; the sooner the better &mdash; there is not one single thing by which people will be able to say that it did or did not achieve what it set out to do in relation to taxation because it has set itself no targets of any kind.  That is the difference between this Government and the Government that might have been had the Progressive Democrats participated in it.  We would have insisted that tax reform be the cornerstone, the point of departure and the ultimate measuring stick of budgetary policy, and we would have driven a process which could have transformed this country into a pro-work, pro-enterprise economy in a matter of years.</P>
    <P>As it is it will fall to other politicians &mdash; hopefully ourselves &mdash; to achieve that result sooner, I hope, rather than later. We pledge ourselves never to abandon our conviction that taxation reform is the single most important step that any Government can take to bring about a pro-enterprise, pro-employment society. It is not just we who say that; it was embodied as a central canon of the Culliton committee's report.  It said that if <Col N="1885" /> there was one thing Government could do to affect the economy in a fundamental way and make our economic policies make sense, it was to tackle the issue of taxation reform.</P>
    <P>There are two problems with the political system in this country in relation to tax reform.  First, we have had, unfortunately, a generation of politicians who do not understand the problem.  Second, they are advised fundamentally by people who are unsympathetic to the notion that our tax system at present is part of the problem rather than part of the solution.  Therefore, we have in large measure advice coming into the Government system which suggests the tax system should be used to stimulate economic activity rather than an acknowledgement, which I believe lies at the heart of economic truth in this country, that the taxation system is the problem rather than the potential solution to our economic problems.</P>
    <P>I have advanced the view that one could easily have over four budgets, if one decided to divert economic growth into resources available for tax reduction and tax reform, a system which was fundamentally far fairer than the present system, far less antagonistic to work and enterprise, and far more geared to economic participation.  There is room for a system which has a standard rate of tax of 20 per cent and a top rate of tax of 40 per cent.  It is possible to achieve that and to get rid of employee PRSI in a four year programme. It is possible to transform employer PRSI into a single digit payroll levy without a ceiling at a much lower rate than the present 12.2 per cent.  It is possible if a Government acknowledges that PRSI is simply a tax and sets out to integrate the taxation system and the PRSI system and have a dramatically different code of taxation which favours work.</P>
    <P>The real tragedy of this budget is that the circumstances have never been better to set off on the first stage of the journey from tax madness to tax sanity. All we have had is a weak-minded whimper of a budget in which the <Col N="1886" /> changes are marginal at the very best. For instance, we have in real terms a 3 per cent increase in the value of the standard rate band and a 3 per cent increase in real terms in the value of the personal allowance.  The Minister, Deputy Quinn, has the remarkable political cheek to describe that as a radical budget.  We are told that is the distillation of the best thinking of the Ministers in this House.  It is a sad reflection on the poverty of imagination and the utter absence of political will as far as tackling our tax problem is concerned.</P>
    <P>It is a curious irony that the New Zealand Government has done more with our Commission on Taxation report than we have.  The reason is that a generation of politicians have made day to day, darn and stitch decisions to keep in place the mad anti-work tax system we have rather than face up to the painful political decisions which tax reform involves.  Saddest of all is that now, with comparatively good budgetary circumstances, when the pain would be all the less in radical tax reform this Government chose to cast aside the opportunity and to attempt to achieve many things, to run in many directions which are mutually contradictory.</P>
    <P>It is also strange that the Minister should announce that in next year's budget an allowance will be introduced in respect of local government charges. Why is that being announced this year for next year?  Why is that commitment being made this year for next year?  It does not make sense as a tax allowance; it does not add to the sanity or the order or rationality of our tax system.  It seems to be a sop to the Democratic Left and it makes little economic sense.</P>
    <P>The day it was first announced in this House, I described it as Tommy Cooper economics, which is precisely what it is. It moves from one thing to another, but it makes no sense and it complicates a person's tax code immeasurably.</P>
    <P>As regards the system of taxation generally, there is a better way.  It requires political courage and vision and a sense of strategy which is totally absent from a set of parties which have <Col N="1887" /> engaged in U-turn after U-turn in recent years in relation to taxation.  As I said, this Government would do us all a favour if it put aside its ideological divisions and settled down to a programme of radical tax reform or quit office at the earliest available and least embarrassing opportunity.</P>
    <P>I welcome some features of this budget, in particular the decision on child benefit, because they deserve our support.  It is correct to use that mechanism to redistribute income in our society to those who need it most.  It is the most direct way of achieving social justice for those who are not even guaranteed a place in the employment market.  It is something which I would never criticise. Since we have a demographic tide flowing with us in relation to the provision of support for children, we should avail of it and be brave.  Each year approximately 30,000 children fall out of the category entitled to receive child benefit because of a decline in the birth rate. That in itself married to economic growth gives this society a unique opportunity to divert resources towards families with children in a way which does not distort the economic behaviour of adults.  Some have suggested that there should be a basic income for children, which is a good concept.  This society should go in that direction as circumstances permit.  By contrast, I do not believe that the notion of a basic income for adults is sensible.  The universalisation of benefits would have two effects; it would alter people's participation rate in the economy, while at the same time it would put downward pressure on the process of redistribution targeted at those who need it.</P>
    <P>It is worth saying that the rate of increase for social welfare recipients at 2.5 per cent in circumstances where the Minister for Finance will not state as a matter of certainty that inflation this year will be held at 2.5 per cent &mdash; he is vague on that subject in his budget speech &mdash; is one of the meanest examples of cheese-paring and retrenchment I have ever seen.  One sees the <Col N="1888" /> Democratic Left and the Labour Party in Government bringing in a series of social welfare increases which seem on the face of it to be pegged only at the most optimistic estimate at or below the rate of inflation in a growing economy. It is remarkable to contrast that with the fact that those of us who are accused from time to time of not being as caring as the left wing parties have never, while in office or supporting a Government, produced such a mean minded result for those most in need in our society. Although there are two left wing parties in Government, the increase in benefit for an old age pensioner is pegged at or below the rate of inflation in a society where there is economic growth.  Where is the solidarity there?  I suggest that the only solidarity is between the ears of the ideologues who believe that because they are left wing they can get away with meanness to the point of injustice. I wonder how Democratic Left and the Labour Party can endorse a budget in which they have pegged benefits to those who most need them, non-contributory and old age pensioners, at or below the likely rate of inflation.  What is it about this society this year that convinced the left in Irish politics that they must punish those who have least in terms of resources and a capacity to fend for themselves?</P>
    <P>As far as the spending of this Government is concerned, much has been made &mdash; and Deputy Hogan's much talked about press release made more of it &mdash; about the wisdom of the financial decisions and the curtailment of expenditure which was implicit in this budget. A black political lie is being peddled by those who claim <i>A Government of Renewal</i> contains a commitment to sensible economic policies as far as expenditure is concerned.  The published net current supply services, the day to day expenditure of Government, last year was £8.3 billion from which one must take once-off amnesty-related expenditure of £192 million.  That was adjusted in 1994 to £8.165 billion.  This year's Estimates are for expenditure of £8.703 billion.  If one adds budget day <Col N="1889" /> increases of £162 million to that, we have a revised expenditure this year of £8.865 billion.  If one leaches out of last year's figure the once-off fruits of the tax amnesty, there is an underlying growth in public spending in 1995 compared to 1994 net of tax amnesties of 8.6 per cent.  That is the real measure of expenditure growth this year.</P>
    <P>In claiming a 6 per cent growth in expenditure, the Government is pretending to the electorate that the once-off tax amnesty is something which happens each year in some shape or form. The facts speak for themselves.  If one leaches the tax amnesty out of the figures, one is left with expenditure growth of 8.6 per cent in circumstances where inflation, about which old age pensioners will know much in the coming year, is 2.5 per cent, there is a substantial growth in public spending and a growth rate which is not paralleled by any other Government in the EU.</P>
    <P>If the Government could practise the virtue of fiscal continence and keep expenditure and taxation down and divert the real fruits of economic growth into making available resources to reduce and reform the tax system, we could achieve radical results with little pain as long as the current rate of growth of between 3 and 5 per cent of GNP persists.  I believe the contrary has been demonstrated today.  This Government which had all the opportunities to effect some economies in areas where there must be waste &mdash; we are all aware of waste in public expenditure &mdash; has completely shied away from doing that.</P>
    <P>We work in a building where £10 million is to be spent on refurbishing and adding new wings.  This Government proposes to give £50 million to Irish Steel.  This Government is proposing to plough £175 million into Aer Lingus and take away from Bord na Móna its accumulated debts, which are horrendous in proportion, and pretend they are a separate account either to be funded by taxpayers' money or to be given to the National Treasury Management Agency to look after as if it had nothing to do with the organisation <Col N="1890" /> which incurred the debts in the first place.  We live in a society where there is a massive wasteful expenditure and in circumstances in which growth in public spending, both capital and current, is not under control.  It is that absence of control that creates the conditions in which public spending grows and the opportunity for tax reform is lost.</P>
    <P>I have never made a habit of researching what the Labour Party in my constituency thinks on various issues, but when it published a pamphlet yesterday on this subject, I felt that I should impart it to this House.  It was part of a document in which it was examining the proposals of the Minister for Education on the question of third level education.  The Labour Party in Trinity College proposed this pamphlet. I do not want to go into the details of what it proposed &mdash; much of it makes a lot more sense to my mind than that which its more senior party colleagues are trying to peddle to the public &mdash; except to say that I am struck by its final paragraph.  It states: &ldquo;We, as Labour Party Members, as socialists, as people committed to social justice and above all, as people seeking a fair and just society, believe that this Labour-led Government, with its Labour Party Minister for Education and its Labour Party Minister for Finance, has an obligation to this country to examine these proposals with the utmost expediency.&rdquo; The phrase that struck me was that, in the view of the Labour Party, this is a &ldquo;Labour-led Government.&rdquo; That is what members of the Labour Party think.</P>
    <P>I searched today's budget to see if there is evidence to the contrary.  Is this an exaggerated claim made by a group of young students whose political ambitions are overvaulting themselves? On the contrary, it is not.  If one looks to this budget to see where Fine Gael's rhetoric about enterprise, risk taking and the individual taking responsibility for himself is to be found, there is not, in the last analysis, one sentence which makes even the slightest obeisance to that point of view.  This budget is about <Col N="1891" /> increased public spending at an 8 per cent level over 1994's real level.  This Government's budget is about tinkering with the tax system, not radically altering it.  It makes a few cosmetic changes to the tax system but leaves in place a system where ordinary people earning below the average industrial wage in Ireland, alone of any country in the European Union and the OECD, find their earnings confiscated by the State at 55.75 per cent.  That still exists and this Labour and Democratic Left dominated Government has done nothing for the single worker earning below average industrial earnings except to make a minimalist gesture in their direction.</P>
    <P>Another feature of this budget which has been brought to my attention is the concession to the Society of the Irish Motor Industry on the scrapping of old cars and a £1,000 reduction in VRT for those who exchange a ten year old banger for a brand new car.  I do not know precisely what group of the population are masochistic enough to drive a ten year old banger which would be worth scrapping because it is worth less than £1,000 and have sitting at home in the piggy bank enough money to buy a brand new car and are waiting for the stimulus to do so.  I was impressed by the SIMI's statement that it believes this has worked in other countries.  What worries me about such a proposal is that, in the last analysis, it may well be that the improvement the SIMI did deliver last year on employment was as a result of pent up unwillingness on the part of the people to buy cars because of the VRT system that existed until lastyear and that it will not be able to replicate the same results this year.  I hope I am wrong and I wish it every success in putting together new jobs in its industry.</P>
    <P>If the Government would only expedite the MOT testing to make Irish cars of whatever age &mdash; especially older ones &mdash; safe, there would be far more employment created.  That is not only a matter of employment creation for its own sake.  We are obliged, by membership of the EU, to bring about such a <Col N="1892" /> transformation in the car maintenance laws.  That would have a much more dramatic effect on employment in the motor industry than this proposal.</P>
    <P>However, the idea is a striking one. The SIMI is showing a deal of radicalism. It is willing to get rid of the ten year old bangers in favour of something brand new.  That contrasts with the spirit behind this budget.  We are dealing with a Government of ten year old bangers, a clapped out tax system and a vehicle whose wheels are wobbling, if not already fallen off.  This Government is a car with four wheels; I emphasise four because there is no steering wheel anymore. It goes in this direction or that, depending on what the Labour Party perceives to be its political interest.  It goes forward and backwards on employment levies and the residential property tax.  This banger, this clapped out wreck of a Government, has the neck to come into this House and say that it has something new on offer.  It has no such thing. Today's budget was the greatest lost opportunity and we will, over the next few years, realise how serious our tax situation has become by reason of the failure of this Government, due to ideological confusion and political cowardice, to face up to the challenge of tax reform.</P>
    <P>There, are those in our society who seem to believe that risk taking is wrong, that an entrepreneur is in some way a chancer, that profit is somewhat dirty and that growth in a man's business represents some kind of selfish preoccupation rather than hard work.  The extract from Dr. FitzGerald's memoirs, which were read here by Deputy McCreevy, containing words which are part of what I believe is a failed view of Irish society, from a group of social democratic social engineers who believe absolutely that the higher the tax rate, the greater the opportunity to create social justice.  I deny that proposition completely.  High tax and social justice are not allies; they are mutual enemies. A society that goes for a high taxation option always ends up with injustice.  In Ireland, we do not have the resources, <Col N="1893" /> sophistication, location or the entrepreneurial heritage to sustain a system of taxation which is more savagely anti-work than that in Sweden.  However, we have, by contrast, a group of politicians who behave as though we had an economy of that kind.</P>
    <P>I was struck by the words of Eoghan Hynes, the Chairman of the Irish Small and Medium Enterprises Association, on the fate of the Irish entrepreneur.  He said something on which many of us should reflect in today's <i>Irish Independent.</i></P>
    <P>He wrote that an owner/manager on a gross salary of £30,000 per annum &mdash; established in business, exporting and giving employment to 15 people &mdash; will take home £1,000 less than a civil servant on the same salary and £400 less than any of his own employees to whom he pays a wage equivalent to his own. That is how we treat entrepreneurial activity in Ireland.  We tax, hound and harrass it.  Although we have not yet made it unlawful, we have done our best to ensure that in our society it is dealt with as though it is economically dishonourable. We need a radically different approach to enterprise and risk taking. If this budget was serious about this matter, for £14 million the Minister for Finance could set out in the Finance Bill to halve the rate of capital gains tax to 20 per cent and let real economic activity flow and emerge.</P>
    <P>Hugh Daltons's Prime Minister, Clement Attlee, was described by his rather sharp-tongued opponents as a modest man with a lot to be modest about.  This budget was introduced with a fanfare of exaggeration and rhetoric. It was represented as radical.  The Taoiseach says it is the best budget the country has ever had.  If that is the best budget we have ever had, we have had a very sorry litany of budgets to date.  If this is radical, I would hate to see the Minister, Deputy Ruairí Quinn, in a conservative humour.  He may think that as a socialist he has to cosy up to the enterprising elements in Irish society and represent himself as socialism's <Col N="1894" /> uncle Tom to the capitalists in our society.  If this is his best effort, God help us if things get significantly worse next year.</P>
    <P>This party, for its part, will continue to advocate and build public support for radical change in the way our economy is run.  We will deny the mantle of tax reform to those who produce 3 per cent changes and call this a major pro-jobs and radical budget.  We will make the arguments at every level in our society that social justice and high taxation are enemies and that the greatest ally of social justice is participation.  A budget which plans for 266,000 people out of work, even though there are to be 38,000 people in social employment schemes, represents a fatalistic and downhearted approach to the problems of this country.  There would and will be a dramatic change in Ireland when the people have a Government in place which will set out a four year programme to change dramatically Ireland's budgetary and taxation policies. Until that happens the claims made by Deputy Quinn for this budget will be repeated in more or less similar terms next year but with very little effect.</P>
    <P>He concluded his speech by asking people to consider the kind of country we will have in 15 years time.  He talked about it being only 15 years to 2010.  The 2010 vision of Deputy Quinn is a new concept.  It sounds cock-eyed to me because none of the things he held out as the fruits of industrial growth will result from budgetary policies of this kind.  The only thing I guarantee he will achieve from his wish list is that Irish people will have the average EU disposable income but this will come about because by 2010 half of eastern Europe will come into the EU.  Failed socialist experiments will push us up the average league.  That will be a lasting monument to red Ruairi's socialist vision of 2010.</P>

      <P>We will decide at 8.30 p.m. whether or not it is agreed. This financial resolution will create great hardship for people who smoke but I am not one of those.  For the benefit of discussion perhaps the Taoiseach would give us an indication of the rates of duty on cigarettes the rate of increase last year and the expected revenue yield for 1995?  Will he give a progress report on the new cigarette stamp regulations, the implementation of which I was involved in last year.  That is important in protecting our revenue base and the income received from excise duty on cigarettes.  We have taken great care to develop this scheme which will protect our revenue base.  Perhaps the Taoiseach will give us a report on that matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal first with the last issue the Deputy raised.  The introduction of tax stamps for cigarettes is designed to help minimise sales of smuggled cigarettes.  When the stamp regime is introduced all packets of cigarettes on sale in the State will have to have an Irish tax stamp affixed.  The tax stamp on each packet will indicate that excise duty has been paid in the State, and any packet that does not have a tax stamp will be clearly of suspect origin. This will greatly assist customs officers in their efforts to counteract illegal trading.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Planning for the introduction of tax stamps is continuing with the full co-operation of the tobacco industry.  The necessary enabling legislation was included in last year's Finance Act and the new system is expected to be introduced in September 1995.  A period of six months has been agreed with the tobacco industry before the introduction of the penalty provision which will make it an offence to sell unstamped cigarettes.  The six months period will allow retail outlets time to clear unstamped packets of cigarettes in <Col N="1898" /> stock.  On the other points raised by the Deputy&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>On the issue of cigarette stamps, the revenue base is vitally important to the State and that is the reason so much time was spent on that matter.  I am sure the Taoiseach will be aware that in more recent times &mdash; I am not saying it started on 15 December &mdash; cigarettes sales on the streets have been increasing.  Cheap cigarettes are being sold in Dublin city centre, particularly at weekends, by a huge number of people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>In fairness to casual traders, even those selling in areas other than designated areas, this is a different issue.  I will not deal with normal casual trading but I think the Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, will be aware of the kind of trade that is going on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanMcGahon" hpid="Mr. McGahon Mr. McGahon">

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I said, it did not start on 15 December.  I was glad to work with the tobacco industry and the Revenue Commissioners on this matter.  They worked very hard to devise a scheme of stamping which will help the domestic market and protect the revenue base &mdash; my concern is very much to protect the revenue base.  The selling of smuggled cigarettes has not been in operation for only about the last two years, I raised this issue with the Garda authorities and the Revenue Commissioners.  The problem is getting worse by the month and the volume of sales is clearly affecting the revenue take.  If one walks though the streets any Saturday &mdash; I am sure these people operate on other days also &mdash; they will see the level of sales of cheap cigarettes. Most penalties in other casual trading areas have no effect whatsoever and I am not sure why these laws are on the Statute Book when they are of little use.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In terms of protection of the revenue base on cigarettes, which is very high, <Col N="1900" /> what progress is being made on this matter and will the laws be implemented?  We on this side of the House take no great issue with the increase of 12p but we would take issue if the price is simply increased every year without implementing the necessary controls.  There are probably 100 regular salespersons selling smuggled cigarettes for which the State gets no duty and that is a serious matter.  If that practice was regulated there would be no necessity to put 12p on a packet of cigarettes.  I would ask the Taoiseach to outline the penalties, controls and regulations envisaged and also the progress being made in tightening up this flagrant abuse which is taking place on the streets of this city and, I am sure, elsewhere.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The powers dealing with tobacco smuggling go back to the Customs (Consolidation) Act, 1876, which provides that any person who improperly imports a product into the State without payment of duty is guilty of an offence and liable to a penalty of £1,000 or treble the value of goods, whichever is greater.  Section 106 (6) of the Finance Act, 1992, provides that any person who imports into the State excisable products which have borne excise duty in another member state and fails to comply with certain conditions, including the payment of Irish duty, is also guilty of an offence.  In addition, smuggled tobacco products may be seized under the law.  Customs officers have wide-ranging powers in dealing with illegal importations.  They may stop and question people and search, detain and seize baggage, goods vehicles etc. on reasonable suspicion.</P>
      <P>It appears there has been an increase in this practice.  The Deputy will find it interesting that the number of seizures of cigarettes has increased from 56 in 1991 to 302 in 1994 while the value of seized cigarettes has increased from a mere £82,000 in 1991 to £4.7 million in 1994.  Clearly this is a significant problem, as the Deputy is fully aware from his previous office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1901" /> There were initial difficulties in initiating prosecutions for the illegal importation of tobacco products under the new Internal Market legislation.  In addition to the usual difficulties of proving criminal intent, doubts have been expressed about the adequacy of some aspects of the new offence provisions in the law dealing with tobacco products imported from other member states of the Union. These doubts on which I am not in a position to elaborate without further inquiries, have been largely resolved and prosecutions can be expected shortly.</P>
    <P>Deputies might be interested to know the countries from which smuggled cigarettes mainly originate.  The three locations particularly suspect are tax warehouses in the Netherlands; the Canary Islands, Gibraltar and Spain and third countries, particularly the United States.  Obviously it is not possible to quantify the loss to the Revenue from smuggled cigarettes &mdash; it is impossible to quantify the loss in any area of tax evasion.  There was an increase in legitimate deliveries of tobacco products during 1994, so obviously smuggled cigarettes are not swamping the market.</P>
    <P>The Garda, who have powers under the casual trading Act, can act in regard to unlicensed trading.  In a joint operation in Dublin city centre on 28 July 1994 they seized 4.24 kilograms of tobacco from 12 individuals.  If the Deputy requires more information I can get it for him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>As a Deputy from a Border constituency, I welcome the decision not to increase the price of petrol. Prior to the introduction of the budget it was suggested that the price of the old reliables, including petrol, would be increased.  Thankfully, it has been decided not to proceed along these lines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to elaborate on the points made by my party Leader about the increase in the price of cigarettes.  When Fianna Fáil was in Government I objected at parliamentary party meetings to the decision to increase the price <Col N="1902" /> of cigarettes by 10p or 20p.  These decisions are made by people behind the scenes and obviously politicians go along with them.  Do they ever think of the effect of these increases on the cigarette industry?  The very fine cigarette factory in my home town employs a significant number of people but, unfortunately, there has been a reduction in the workforce in recent years due to some extent, to the increase in the price of cigarettes.  My constituency colleague, Deputy Brendan McGahon, and I are at one on this issue.</P>
    <P>An effort was made in last year's budget, through measures on stamping and branding, to deal with the ever increasing illegal importation of cigarettes sold on the street with no return to the Exchequer.  Tighter controls in this area would lead to a better return for the Exchequer than increasing the price of cigarrettes by 12p this year and 10p next year, the easy option taken by successive Governments.  When I objected at parliamentary party meetings to the decision to increase the price of cigarettes I was in a minority of one or two.  It must be recognised that people earn a good living from the manufacture of cigarettes, not only for home consumption but also for export. I ask that some consideration be given to this point if not this year then next year.</P>

      <P>I want to protest against this unwarranted increase in the price of cigarettes.  An increase of 12 per cent is totally unjustified as it is above the rate of inflation.  I accept that cigarette smoking poses a health hazard &mdash; Deputy O'Hanlon made this point very strongly in recent years &mdash; but there is much hypocrisy associated with the assault on cigarette smoking.  How many people die every year from alcohol abuse and related illnesses?  How many children are interfered with by people under the influence of alcohol?  How many families have been devastated as a result of the widespread abuse of alcohol? Given our tolerance of alcohol and the ambivalence in the political world to the dangers it poses &mdash; we recently saw the power of the publicans' lobby &mdash; we turn a blind eye to this problem and do not curtail the advertising of this substance which causes misery for thousands of people.  It is easier to home in on an ailing industry for which the bell is tolling than increase the price of drink.</P>
      <P>The cigarette industry provides gainful employment for 300 people in Dundalk. I join Deputy Dermot Ahern in protesting against the increase in cigarettes. The final irony&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The time has come for all political parties to accept that the cigarettes industry provides gainful employment.

This illegal industry is already established in every town, and this will lead to a loss of Revenue.</P>

      <P>A number of Deputies are offering.  The question must be put at 8.30 p.m. so brevity should be the keynote of our proceedings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I sympathise with the views expressed by Deputy McGahon. The proposal to increase the duty on cigarettes is unwarranted from a number of points of view.  First, no effort was made by the Government in the budget to save money, and on that general ground I am against increasing taxation of any kind.  Second, as a member of a party founded by Deputy O'Malley it would be disloyal of me to sell the pass and support this increase. On a more serious note, I take the point that this increase is above the rate of inflation.  Since Deputies De Rossa and Rabbitte have only delivered to old age pensioners an increase directly in line with inflation, for those old age pensioners who enjoy cigarettes there will be a significant reduction in their disposable income as a result of this change.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>From that point of view I have a difficulty with this resolution and will oppose it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second matter I want to draw attention to was dealt with briefly and concisely by Deputy Ahern, that is the scourge of illegal trading.  The figures mentioned by the Taoiseach clearly indicate that what Deputy Ahern said was correct.  If the value of illegal cigarettes seized suddenly jumped from £82,000 in 1993 to £4.7 million in 1994 there is clear evidence of a massive illegal trade throughout the country.  To increase the price of legal cigarettes further while leaving illegal trading uncountered is irresponsible.

    <P>The imposition on cigarettes does not affect me personally but the increase on cigars does because I enjoy the odd Havana.

      <P>I understand it is normal to close excise warehouses for a period before the budget is introduced to prevent speculative purchases in anticipation of a Financial Resolution of this kind.  Did that happen on this occasion?

      <P>Is the return to Revenue from the sale of tabacco diminishing? Is the Taoiseach aware that, apart from the illegal importation of cigarettes, the theft of cigarettes from supermarkets and stores throughout the country constitutes a serious problem? In some cases this is the only item stolen.  The Taoiseach indicated that the number of seizures increased from 56 to 302 in the space of one year.  Do these figures include the number of seizures of stolen cigarettes or only the seizures of illeglly imported cigarettes?</P>

    <P>I am conscious of the health hazards &mdash; Deputy McGahon referred to this &mdash;<Col N="1906" /> associated with tobacco products.  There is no harm reminding ourselves that 5,000 people die each year while 16,000 are hospitalised.  How much extra revenue does the Taoiseach expect to raise from the sale of tobacco products in the current year and how much was lost during the past two days, when everybody knew that there would be an increase of 12p on each packet of cigarettes, in the rush to the wholesalers?</P>

This is understandable as in this budget a savage and vicious attack has been launched on the tobacco and cigarette industry, particularly in the Dundalk area.  Cigarette and tobacco manufacturers will feel the draught when the proposed increase takes effect.</P>
      <P>We have to be realistic.  Unfortunately, at all times the cigarette industry &mdash; not particularly for health reasons &mdash; has been the target in collecting additional revenue to replenish the coffers of the State.  This increase is exceptionally steep, savage and vicious.  One can only envisage the impact it will have on employment in companies such as PJ Carroll in Dundalk, where employment is diminishing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>Of the four Deputies who represent County Louth I am the most qualified to speak on this subject as I smoke 40 Carrolls a day, seven days a week while my three colleagues are non-smokers.  If everybody were to follow their example Carrolls would have closed down a long time ago.  It always amazes me when I hear non-smokers argue that we should keep the price of fags down, or cigars for the matter.</P>
      <P>Naturally, I am concerned about the threat to employment, but employment at Carrolls has declined during the years and this has as much to do with the introduction of new technology as it has with the price of cigarettes.  It would not matter to me if the price of a packet of 20 cigarettes was £5; I would still smoke. It is not the price that is important in persuading people not to smoke but the danger it poses to their health.  Deputy O'Hanlon touched on this issue.</P>
      <P>I hope that the price can be kept as low as possible to maintain a balance, having regard to the illegal importation of cigarettes.  These are being sold openly on stalls on the streets in Dublin and other urban areas at knockdown prices.  The cigarette industry is dying while those who smoke are a dying race. Successive Ministers have increased the price.</P>
      <P>In my own parliamentary party there are only three smokers.  There was a time when two-thirds, perhaps more, smoked.  I am sure the position is the same in the Fianna Fáil Party, Fine Gael and other parties.  If everybody were to follow the example of Members of the Oireachtas, PJ Carroll and other cigarette factories would be wiped out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support the increase, although I admit it is a large one, but I do not think it will have an effect on employment at PJ Carroll.  Two years ago I was in the Canary Islands where I could buy Carrolls No. 1 for 50p per packet.  At that time they were £2 per packet here. Those cigarettes were exported from <Col N="1908" /> Dundalk to Spain and the Canary Islands where they could be bought for such a low price.  They were manufactured at 50p per packet in the factory in Dundalk.</P>

      <P>It is a long time since Deputy Ahern spoke and I had indicated that I wished to speak, but I will be brief nonetheless.  I wish to ask the Taoiseach, in the light of this resolution, if it would be possible to estimate the loss to the Exchequer resulting from information on this resolution being made available a number of days before it was enforced and the opportunity that provided for unscrupulous people to stockpile cigarettes, thereby avoiding paying the additional money.  In addition to the revenue to the Exchequer from tobacco excise duties, would it be possible to estimate the cost to the health service as a result of the effects of tobacco smoking?  Mention was made of the number of hospital beds taken up by smokers.  It would be interesting to compare those figures because I believe it would highlight the fact that tobacco sales do not generate revenue or create jobs.  In fact many more people could be employed if we were to use that revenue more gainfully. We have been talking here for almost an hour about one noxious weed which is a non-food crop.  Will the Government give at least as much attention to the potential of another non-food crop which is completely neglected in this <Col N="1909" /> budget, namely, the raw materials for bio-diesel and ethanol which are important for&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will put that in proportion. An increase of 1 per cent on social welfare would have cost the Government approximately £20 million to £30 million.  The total take from the residential property tax is £12 million. The entire reductions in income tax in the budget come to £88 million and, if one adds on £22 million, that would bring the figure to £110 million.  Is it not worthy of attention that on one measure such as this the Government brings in £25 million?  We then have four days of publicity surrounding income tax concessions, which in most cases amount to £3 or £4 per week.  Are the proportions of this budget not totally out of kilter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, am concerned about the early release of this information. I worked for a cigarette manufacturer for many years and I am aware that many people were anxious to buy pre-budget cigarettes in order to make a profit.  It had been signalled for quite some time that the price of cigarettes would be increased by 10p per packet and they will now be increased by 12p per packet.  That represents £2 per carton and any wholesaler who bought thousands of cartons over the past few days will make an enormous profit.  I would remind the Taoiseach that the <i>Titanic</i> sank as a result of only one leak, but worse could befall this Government <Col N="1911" /> with the leak to which I have referred. An inquiry should be made as to the number of people who pre-ordered exorbitant amounts of cigarettes and any profits gained should be paid in income tax or whatever other tax such people are liable for.  It was the most blatant abuse of a revenue I have ever seen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>The cumulative effect of these increases on the cigarette industry over the past number of years means that we are now approaching the point of diminishing returns.  If one examines the figure given by the Taoiseach of £4.7 million in seized goods, one could hazard a conservative guess that the total value of the growth industry in the sale of illegal cigarettes coming onto the market must be in the region of £20 million to £25 million.  I might even be generous in my estimation.  The point has been made earlier, which is unfortunate, that many old people living alone enjoy a cigarette and they will now be faced with a derisory increase in their pensions and an increase of 12p per packet of cigarettes.</P>
      <P>Reference has been made to jobs in the industry.  I am a smoker and we should not forget that the tobacco industry has given great support to the arts and sports in particular.  Many jobs are sustained by the income that is made available through the cigarette companies, both directly to the Exchequer and to many worthy causes.  It should not be forgotten that many events would not have taken place were it not for the support of the tobacco industry.  We have now reached a point where it is becoming impossible to enjoy a cigarette at a reasonable price.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to ask the Taoiseach one final question.  I thank him for the statistics he gave in regard to the raids and the amount of money collected on one day in July of last year.  I acknowledge that this matter has gone on for some time, but during the course of the coming weeks will the Taoiseach <Col N="1912" /> appoint a Minister or a Minister of State to take responsibility for investigating what is major abuse?  I believe millions of pounds of excise are being lost to the State by what is happening in the streets.  Some people say that the situation is not that bad but I can tell the Taoiseach from personal experience that is horrendous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Many points were raised in the course of the debate and I hope I will manage to answer most of them.  The total revenue derived from cigarette taxation is £522 million.  The increase in revenue this year is £25 million as a result of this measure.  We estimate that will yield £30 million in a full year.  A number of Deputies suggested that we are reaching the point of diminishing returns in respect of cigarette taxation. The evidence is to the contrary. There was a 2.3 per cent increase in tobacco consumption last year, there having been a decline the previous year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>That is legally obtained tobacco, I presume.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is taxed tobacco. Obviously there was a further increase when one includes illegally obtained tobacco.  Consumption of tobacco is only 7 per cent lower than it was in 1994, a relatively steady adjustment which, even in 1984, was foreseeable by the manufacturers.  It was obvious that there would be considerable pressure on cigarette consumption because of health considerations, apart from taxation, and manufacturers realised that they would have to diversify and adjust.  They have attempted to do so with mixed success. I would point out to Deputy McGahon that the increase is 4.6 per cent, not 12 per cent &mdash; a 12p increase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanMcGahon" hpid="Mr. McGahon Mr. McGahon">

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not necessarily unfair.  It has been settled policy for some time to discourage tobacco consumption by tax measures.  That there has been a disproportionate increase in the tax on cigarettes in this budget is nothing new, but the decline in tobacco consumption has been relatively slow. Deputy Bell was accurate in describing some of the reasons for the decline in employment in the industry as being more attributable to technology changes than to falls in the consumption of tobacco.</P>
      <P>I have no information for Deputy O'Hanlon about the theft of cigarettes. On the question of the withdrawal of cigarettes from bond, which was raised by Deputy McDowell and others, there is a voluntary agreement between the manufacturers and the Revenue, not a formal legal agreement, whereby they undertake to restrict the delivery of supplies out of bond to normal levels in the period leading up to the budget.  My understanding is that there has not been any abnormal egress of cigarettes from bond in recent days, despite the speculation about the likely increase on excise duties on tobacco in the budget.  I am advised that in practical terms a retailer would not be able to gain much advantage by doing this because of the amount of money he would have to tie up to make any significant gain.  The value of the cigarettes, the fact that this is only 4.6 per cent increase and the fact that they would have to carry the whole cost of the cigarettes for the time they were in stock are limiting factors.  Furthermore, the commercial insurance companies place further limits on the amount of cigarettes for which a retailer would be covered in the event of theft.</P>

That situation is covered by the undertakings given by manufacturers not to allow increases in the rate of egress of cigarettes from <Col N="1914" /> bond in the run up to the budget.  I will make inquiries to see if there was any unusual movement in recent days, but I am confident that when those inquiries are complete we will find that there were not.  Either way, I will let Deputy Cullen know the result of my inquiries.</P>

A huge amount of money is being made available by the industry in areas where the State is not making funds available.  Does the Taoiseach have any idea of the amount of moneys donated by the industry to that budget, because it is an important aspect of funds for small communities? In some instances there are quite large contributions and it should not be forgotten that that is a valuable source of funding.</P>

Virtually every Minister for Finance wants to increase the tax on cigarettes just enough to maximise the revenue without killing the goose that lays the golden egg.

    <P>(a)  in section 439, by the substitution of the following subsection for subsection (1A) (inserted by the Finance Act, 1979 (No. 11 of 1979):</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(1A) (a) This subsection applies to a disposition or dispositions of a kind or kinds referred to in paragraphs (ii) to (iv) of subsection (1) made, directly or indirectly, by a person being an individual (in this subsection referred to as the `disponer') except in so far as, by virtue or in consequence thereof, income is payable or applicable in a year of assessment, in the manner referred to in paragraph (iii) or (iv) of the said subsection (1), to or for the benefit of a descendant of the disponer who is permanently incapacitated by reason of mental or physical infirmity.</P>
    <P>(b)  Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (1), in relation to a disponer, any income which&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  is payable or applicable in a year of assessment by virtue or in consequence of a disposition or dispositions to which this subsection applies, and</P>
    <P>(ii)  is in excess of 5 per cent. of the total income of the disponer for the year of assessment,</P>
    <P>shall be deemed for the purposes of this Act to be the income of the disponer, if living, and not to be the income of any other person.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1917" /> (c)  In a case where this sub-section has effect, in relation to any disponer, for the purpose of determining, for income tax purposes, the amount of income which remains the income of persons other than the disponer for the year of assessment by virtue or in consequence of a disposition or dispositions to which this subsection applies, the aggregate of the income so remaining shall be apportioned amongst those other persons in proportion to their entitlements under such disposition or dispositions for that year.</P>
    <P>(d) In this subsection, `descendant' means a child or a child of a child.&rdquo;,</P>
    <P>(b) in section 443&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i) in subsection (1), including the proviso thereto (inserted by the Finance Act, 1971 (No. 23 of 1971)&mdash;</P>
    <P>(I) by the substitution of &ldquo;a child&rdquo; for &ldquo;a child of the settlor&rdquo;, in both places where it occurs, and</P>
    <P>(II) by the substitution of &ldquo;child or children&rdquo; for &ldquo;child or children of the settlor&rdquo;,</P>
    <P>and</P>
    <P>(ii) by the insertion of the following subsection after subsection (4):</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(4A) This Chapter shall not apply to any income which, by virtue or in consequence of a settlement and during the life of the settlor, is in any year of assessment paid to or for the benefit of a child, not being a child of the settlor, if such child is permanently incapacitated by reason of mental or physical infirmity.&rdquo;,</P>
    <P>(c) in section 444, other than in the definition of &ldquo;property&rdquo;, by the <Col N="1918" /> deletion of &ldquo;of the settlor&rdquo;, in each place where it occurs, and</P>
    <P>(d) in section 445&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i) by the substitution of &ldquo;a child&rdquo; for &ldquo;a child of the settlor&rdquo;, in both places where it occurs, and</P>
    <P>(ii)  by the substitution of &ldquo;such child as aforesaid&rdquo; for &ldquo;such child as aforesaid of the settlor&rdquo; in each place where it occurs.</P>
    <P>(2)  THAT the amendments to Part XXVIII of the Income Tax Act, 1967, provided for in this Resolution&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  shall apply in respect of every disposition and settlement (within the meaning of Chapters I and II, respectively, of Part XXVIII of the said Act) made on or after the 8th day of February, 1995, and</P>
    <P>(b)  shall also apply, as on and from the 6th day of April, 1995, in respect of every disposition and settlement (within the said meaning) which was made before the 8th day of February, 1995.</P>
    <P>(3)  IT is hereby declared that it is expedient in the public interest that this Resolution shall have statutory effect under the provisions of the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act, 1927 (No. 7 of 1927).</P>
    <P>I am sure it will come as no surprise to those who are familiar with the way in which covenant tax relief has been used that the Government has come to a decision to curb its use.  It has become apparent from the growth of the cost of tax relief on covenants in recent years that they are in fact being promoted actively as a tax shelter.  Financial Resolution No. 2 will have the effect of restricting the cost of covenant tax relief by curbing their use as a tax planning device.  It will restrict the use of covenants in two ways: first, it will abolish relief for covenants to minor children other than those in favour of incapacitated minor children; second, it will limit <Col N="1919" /> the total amount of tax relief that any one individual can get from the covenants provision.  This is being done by extending the 5 per cent limit, which already applies to the parent-adult child covenant to all covenants made by all individuals in favour of all other individuals.</P>
    <P>The change will apply to all new covenants taken out on or after today and to all existing covenants from 6 April next.  It is estimated that these changes will yield approximately £6 million in 1995 and £10 million in a full year.</P>
    <P>These changes have been brought in to curb the use of covenants as tax planning devices and to curb the cost of covenant tax relief.  It will also help fund, as the Minister for Finance has announced, the phasing out of third level fees.  I will give an example of the type of tax planning; it usually involves covenants to minor children by adults who are not their parents.  From what one can judge from the data available, the average size of a covenant to nephews and nieces &mdash; strangely, not to one's own children &mdash; is well in excess of those from parents to their own adult children and the amount seems to be set just at the level to maximise the tax saving and not for any other purpose.  It has also been regarded as unfair that some taxpayers can reduce their income tax bill substantially by having very large covenants.  The size of covenants from parents to their adult children is limited to 5 per cent of the covenanter's total income but this is not the case with other covenants.</P>
    <P>Finally there is one current exemption from the 5 per cent limit, that is in respect of covenants by parents to incapacitated adult children.  It is proposed to allow this exemption to continue on an exceptional basis in the case of parents only in view of the long standing recognition of the role and duty of parents to care for incapacitated children. It is interesting to note that the average income of those making covenants to non-related persons is somewhere in the <Col N="1920" /> region of £40,000 per annum, a substantial income.  If £40,000 is the average one can imagine that some of those who engage in this practice have very large incomes.</P>

      <P>There has been a great deal of pressure on the Opposition parties to back up the statement made by the Ceann Comhairle at 3.50 p.m. today.  I raised the issue this morning and notwithstanding what I said then I understand the Taoiseach could not acknowledge what was in the papers was fact but it is a bit more serious than that now.  I am reluctant to do what is being advised in the resolutions.

      <P>It has come to my attention that a press statement was issued today about noon on behalf of Deputy Phil Hogan, Minister of State at the Department of Finance.  This statement contained some material on the budget.  Immediately on hearing of the issuing of this statement I personally initiated inquiries and I spoke to Deputy Hogan.  It appears that the statement in question was intended for release by the Minister of State, Deputy Hogan, and was prepared on the basis that it would be issued after the Minister for Finance had concluded his speech but, unfortunately, the statement which was prepared for issue at that time was issued inadvertently, unintentionally and prematurely at about noon by the Minister of State's office.  It was furthermore accidentally accompanied by one page of budget material intended for limited background briefing purposes following the Minister for Finance making his Budget Statement. It is fair to say that neither document contained market sensitive information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although the issue of both documents was done entirely in error and without malice &mdash; there are some mitigating circumstances &mdash; I am satisfied that it was entirely inappropriate and wrong that a statement of this kind should have been issued in the way it was done.  I wish to apologise without reservation to the House for what has happened.  I regret the disrespect that issuing it shows to Members of the House and Deputy Hogan deeply regrets what has happened. He has conveyed his deep concern to me on the matter and I am convinced having spoken to him that it was purely accidental inadvertence in his office, for which of course as Minister of State he is responsible.  I very much regret what happened and the disrespect issuing in this manner of any <Col N="1922" /> material concerning the budget constitutes to this House.  That is all I can say about it at this stage.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>(1)  THAT, as respects any payment or crediting of relevant interest (within the meaning of Chapter IV (Interest Payments by Certain Deposit Takers) of Part I of the Finance Act, 1986 (No. 13 of 1986)) made on or after the 6th day of April, 1995, subsection (1) of section 31 of the Finance Act, 1986, be amended by the substitution in paragraph (a) of the definition of &ldquo;appropriate tax&rdquo; (substituted by section 22 (1) (a) (i) of the Finance Act, 1992 (No. 9 of 1992)) of &ldquo;15 per cent.&rdquo; for &ldquo;10 per cent.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>(2)  THAT, as respects the year of assessment 1995-96 and subsequent years of assessment, subsection (3) of section 14 of the Finance Act, 1993 (No. 13 of 1993), shall apply and have effect as if this Resolution had not been passed.</P>
      <P>(3)  IT is hereby declared that it is expedient in the public interest that this Resolution shall have statutory effect under the provisions of the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act, 1927 (No. 7 of 1927).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This resolution provides for an increase in the rate of deposit interest retention tax on special savings accounts from 10 per cent to 15 per cent with effect from 6 April 1995.  Interest paid or credited to a person's account prior to 6 April <Col N="1923" /> 1995 will be subject to DIRT at the current 10 per cent rate while interest paid or credited on or after this date will be subject to a 15 per cent rate of deposit interest retention tax.</P>
    <P>Special savings accounts were introduced in 1993 following the abolition of exchange controls to counteract the threat of capital outflows while preserving deposit interest retention tax revenues as far as possible.  Their introduction was dictated by the failure to reach agreement at EU level on common rules governing the taxation of deposit interest.  These accounts which have attracted funds in excess of £3 billion have enhanced the competitiveness of Irish financial markets and have contributed to a stable, healthy deposit base in the country.  The Government is satisfied that such benefits can continue to be achieved with a 15 per cent deposit interest retention tax rate.  This will help to reduce the imbalance between taxation on earned and unearned income while maintaining an attractive fiscal incentive for deposits to remain in the State.</P>
    <P>A 15 per cent rate, being the final liability to tax on interest received, will still leave depositors with a competitive after tax return on their investment.  The increase in the rate of deposit interest retention tax will yield an estimated £4 million in 1995 and £7 million in a full year.  No change is proposed in the 10 per cent rate applying to special investment accounts operated by stockbrokers, insurers and unit trusts.  The Government consider it appropriate to have a lower rate for these investors which, unlike investors in special savings accounts, are required to invest at least 55 per cent of their portfolio in Irish equities with 10 per cent of the portfolio in small to medium-sized companies.</P>

      <P>Will the Taoiseach comment on the case made by Deputy McCreevy who asked if the Government is satisfied that it will not be open to legal challenge on the abolition of <Col N="1924" /> covenants?  The de Buitléir report commissioned by the Minister reported on tax covenanting for education and advised the Government that certain tax covenants are for a five or six year period and it had entered into a contract with those taxpayers.  The Government has gone against the spirit of the report and its recommendation that tax covenanting should be phased out, with existing covenants being allowed run their course.  The Government should be seen to deal honourably with the people in whatever contracts it enters into with them.  One could argue that a dishonourable approach is being adopted towards these people.</P>
      <P>There are 90,000 students in third level education and 60,000 of them do not pay any fees.  Some 30,000 students will benefit from the abolition of fees but it is estimated that 38,000 students benefit from tax covenants.  There are 8,000 students who will lose out completely as a result of this measure.  We do not know who they are; they may be the parents of PLC students.  There are 12,500 post leaving certificate students who may benefit from tax covenants. They do not pay fees so they could lose substantially.  A con job is being perpetrated on PLC students.  It is appalling for the Government to pretend it is abolishing fees for students who do not pay any fees.</P>

      <P>We are talking about low <Col N="1925" /> socio-economic groupings in many respects, people who may not be able to attend university or other third level institutions.  As was illustrated yesterday, it will be cheaper for higher income earning groups to send students to university than it will be for someone earning £7,000 or £8,000 to send a student to attend a PLC course in Ballyfermot. That is the reality.  We need clarification on this.  We have not been given much information on the breakdown of revenue yield.</P>
      <P>As regards tax covenants, the de Buitléir report estimated that the Exchequer has foregone £20 million. Two weeks ago during a Private Member's motion the Minister for Education estimated that it would be £25 million and today it has been estimated that it will be £34 million.  There is confusion about the estimated yield.</P>

      <P>As regards covenants, measures to close off gross abuse are a step in the right direction.  There is still inequality in the way covenanting operates. Those with highest incomes are set to benefit most by the use of covenants even after the measures taken in the budget.  Those on low incomes cannot avail of the procedure.  The fact that covenanting exists, even as a temporary measure pending the abolition of third level fees, highlights the need to replace it with something along the lines of a maintenance grant.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>These two resolutions require separate analysis.  I have no difficulty with increasing the 10 per cent rate to 15 per cent.  I have always believed that the 10 per cent taxation rate on these accounts was remarkably generous bearing in mind other tax rates which people have to pay.  We tax those earning below the average industrial wage at 57 per cent of their marginal earnings.  It often occurred to me that it is a strange society which does that and then says that somebody with a significant amount of money to put on deposit in one of these accounts should get 90 per cent of their interest tax free.  I <Col N="1926" /> appreciate that the 10 per cent rate was established in order to prevent an outflow of capital but people who must work hard to get money must blanche when they see a person with money in one of these accounts having the income from their interest taxed at 10 per cent while if they work an extra hour of overtime they are taxed at 55 per cent. Therefore, it is sensible to endeavour to introduce rationality into all of this. While the lower rate was established to prevent an efflux of capital, it may be that over time all income will be taxed at the same rate and there will not be these special concessions for particular accounts.  I take the distinction drawn by the Taoiseach between equity-based investments and simple deposits; at least in the former category there is some element of risk, whereas in the latter there is absolutely none.</P>
      <P>In relation to covenants, while today is not the day to discuss education policy, I strongly recommend that the Taoiseach read the pamphlet prepared by Labour Party students of Trinity College, Dublin on the issue of what is being done.  It is fair to say that it we are being asked to amend the law in relation to covenants, we should realise the context within which and the purpose for which it is being done.  Having taken everything into account, including the cynical views as to whether or not this is politically popular, I have to say it is deeply wrong and offensive to my conscience that these reforms proposed by the Minister for Education should be proceeded with within a society in which there is so much social disadvantage and educational exclusion.  To apply scarce resources to that category of society, irrespective of their means, who are paying university fees at a time when only 3 per cent or 4 per cent of university students come from working class backgrounds, when children from those backgrounds need remedial teachers, need more money put into primary education, need greater opportunities to remain in secondary education, seems to me to be an outrageous proposal from a Labour Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1927" /> The Taoiseach should obtain a summation of what the Labour Party students of TCD contend the Minister is endeavouring to do.  He will be gratified to read that they are shocked at this proposal coming from what they term &ldquo;a Labour-led Government&rdquo;.  I would ask the Taoiseach to assert some leadership in favour of what is right&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash; and stop taking on board what is wrong.</P>
      <P>In relation to the technicalities of covenants, I was contacted by people on Sunday and Monday last asking whether they should make covenants.  My advice to them was that they should because it is highly unlikely that the Government will be able to introduce retrospective legislation.  I believe that the leaking of some of the contents of the budget is substantially wrong and gave some people, who gave credence to what they read in the newspapers, substantial advantage over their neighbours who might have thought that this was mere speculation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I accept the apology the Taoiseach has tendered to the House on behalf of the Government, it is not simply an apology that is required but an investigation as to why somebody thought it right to reveal the contents of the budget in the way that has been done over the past few days.  It has been deliberate and consistent, to the extent that people would telephone me and ask whether or not they should act on those leaks.  That is most unfair.  Whatever about the explanation of the Minister of State, Deputy Hogan, to the Taoiseach &mdash; that he intended this to go out later &mdash; if one looks at the front page of the document in question, it is very clear that somebody knew precisely what they were doing because they wrote the time of the release on it and urged people to contact the Minister's programme adviser for further information on the budget.  That is not good enough. <Col N="1928" /> Many people today will wonder whether they were right or wrong to have missed the boat on Sunday or Monday last. Many who dithered on whether they would execute a covenant realise today that those people who took the leaks seriously have a very significant advantage over them.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach referred specifically to what he considered to be a somewhat suspicious tendency on the part of uncles to give nieces and nephews money.  If one thinks about it, there is a common sense explanation for that. Normally, parents give their children what they can.  Very frequently a parent may ask a slightly better-off relative to do the needful for young John or Sheila who wants to go to university by using the covenant facility.  From my experience very frequently &mdash; and it is not an abuse &mdash; a better-off uncle who wants to do something for a married sister or brother with a large family will do his bit by executing a covenant in favour of a niece or nephew, who is a deserving case of assistance, to attend college.  It is not good enough to say simply that they seem to do more than parents.  Parents have many draws on their incomes and better-off relatives very frequently, out of the best of motives, try to do something for nieces and nephews, to give them a leg up, because, for instance, the farm or family business has been left to one of them or whatever.  It is not fair for the Taoiseach to imply there is something suspect about an uncle giving a niece or nephew money.  In my view it is perfectly natural.  It is decency that inspires the execution of most of these covenants.</P>

      <P>I can bear out what Deputy Michael McDowell has just said because a number of accountants have contacted me over the past few days inquiring whether leaks that appeared in the newspapers were correct, asking <Col N="1929" /> whether they should accede to requests from their clients to make covenants on their behalf.</P>
      <P>While I accept the Taoiseach's explanation, to put it at its mildest I find it somewhat inadequate.  I have a specific question to pose to the Taoiseach on this matter.  My understanding is that the Government's strategy is to abolish fees for third-level students.  However one might feel about the validity or otherwise of that proposal &mdash; and I have certain misgivings about it, particularly at present &mdash; in order to compensate for it I note the Government is introducing a strategy on covenants which would appear to me to be two-fold.  First, the usual type of 5 per cent of gross income &mdash; restricted covenant in favour of children is being abolished and, second, it would appear from a reading of the Resolution, that the Government is extending the 5 per cent restriction to all other covenants, that is covenants that will not be abolished.  I do not think one leg of that strategy necessarily follows from the other.  I can see what the Government proposes to do in relation to covenants in favour of students whose parents henceforth will be relieved of the responsibility of paying fees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the Government must bear in mind that covenants are used by many other people for many other purposes. For example, people covenant money to secondary schools to enable those schools to make up the shortfall not provided by the Government in relation to the teaching of natural sciences and such subjects.  I am not too worried about that because it would be most unusual for a parent or resident to covenant more than 5 per cent of their gross income to such a school.  I might point out also that many people who must provide for elderly relatives, particularly in nursing homes, use the covenant system for that purpose.  The Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance, and certainly the Minister for Health will be aware &mdash; as will most Members working on the ground &mdash; that the provision made for the nursing home regulations, <Col N="1930" /> which implement the subvention system for nursing homes, is pitifully inadequate to meet the need.  The only way many people can maintain their elderly relatives in nursing homes in relative comfort is to use the covenant tax concession. If it is the intention of the Government to restrict this to 5 per cent of gross income it will cause catastrophic hardship in individual cases.  Is that the Government's intention and, if it is an unintended consequence of the manner in which the Resolution is drafted, could it be changed?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I support my colleagues, Deputies Martin and O'Dea. Those who pay income tax will not be very satisfied with what they heard today from the Minister for Finance. Last year, when the present Taoiseach, then Leader of the Opposition, opened the debate on the budget he told the House that Fine Gael had costed to the nearest penny the widening of the income tax bands, that they could extend them to £20,000, constituting an increase of £5,000.  It must have come as a major shock to the public today that those bands have been increased to only one-third of that projected figure.</P>

    <P>On the question of covenants, the case has been well made by Deputies Martin, O'Dea and Michael McDowell.  I would advise the Taoiseach to tread with caution here.  The Government has recognised the problems of the incapacitated, who will be exempt from the exclusion from such covenants.  I have not the slighest doubt that if we pass this Resolution this evening there will be very many other deserving cases, at present benefiting from covenants for bona fide reasons &mdash; not because somebody wants to evade paying tax, but because they are genuinely supporting or helping some other person with a particular need who will suffer considerable hardship.  The Government should consider the position even at this late stage and ensure that we do not need to come back here to tell it that some people are genuinely <Col N="1931" /> in need and are dependent on covenants, but will not be able to avail of them because of this resolution.</P>
    <P>Does the Taoiseach consider it wise to tell people who have covenanted for seven years that from 6 April they can no longer benefit from them?</P>

      <P>Some people may have genuine bona fide reasons for supporting people with a particular need. They are now being told having signed a contract that they can no longer avail of tax relief and that may pose a problem for them.  It is anti-rural for the Government to abolish covenants on the basis that third level education fees will be paid by the State next year. Many aspects of the budget are anti-rural, such as, the reduction in the allocation for county roads and the 2.5 per cent rise in respect of social welfare. The real problem facing people in rural areas is student maintenance costs. While rural students will benefit from the State payment of third level education fees they are disadvantaged <i>visà-vis</i> people who live in towns and cities in which there are third level institutions.</P>
      <P>On special savings accounts is the Taoiseach satisfied that increasing the interest rate to 15 per cent will not result in a withdrawal of money from accounts because the State has benefited substantially from investment in them over the years?  With the freer movement of money within the European Union now, is there any danger that an increase in the interest rate will result in money being withdrawn from institutions?</P>

      <P>On the special savings account I understood the Taoiseach to have said he envisages £4 million extra revenue in 1995 and a further £7 million revenue in 1996 as a result of new budget measures.  Is the Taoiseach aware that many old age pensioners with two pensions and savings are taxed on interest they receive?  Will the new budgetary measures affect them financially?  The Taoiseach asserted that people use convenants to evade tax or gain the best possible benefit from tax measures.  A family earning £30,000 per annum who can afford to invest 5 per cent of their income in a convenant and pay tax at 47 per cent would probably save in the region of £700 in income tax whereas fees cost a minimum of £2,000 <Col N="1933" /> per annum.  I cannot understand the Taoiseach's logic in saying he is changing the provision in respect of covenants in order to save money and prevent people avoiding tax, while at the same time giving them a saving of £2,000 per annum in fees.</P>
      <P>Families earning £17,000 to £22,000 do not qualify for education fees or maintenance because their income is above the maximum qualifying threshold which is in the region of £16,500 per annum.  Their children are now allowed take up places in third level colleges and do not have to pay fees. However, many people will not be able to pay the maintenance costs to put their children through third level colleges. Will the Government introduce any measures to increase the bands for maintenance purposes?</P>

      <P>I do not propose to <Col N="1936" /> respond to all the points raised, but Deputy Martin raised a very interesting matter, one which occurred to the Government when considering this issue.  He referred to the possibility of a legal challenge to the removal of tax relief from an existing arrangement. There will be no legal difficulty in that regard.  I understand tax provisions relating to existing covenants were changed in 1937 and 1979 and those changes were not challenged.  It is also fair to say that there has never been a legal challenge to the Government's right to change the tax treatment of existing life assurance policies, mortgages or other long term arrangements. To the best of my knowledge, the question of a constitutional legal difficulty does not arise in this regard, but there may be a policy difficulty about which the Deputy is entitled to argue. However, the ingenuity of lawyers knows no limit.</P>

In the debate of the Finance Bill Deputies may refer to specific cases and I am sure the Minister for Finance will be willing to consider them in a reasonable light.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In response to Deputy McDowell, evidence shows that there are very heavily organised tax covenants, not between uncles and nephews and so on but between complete strangers who realise that under the present arrangement, to which the 5 per cent limit does not apply, they can have a circle of covenants.  This does not just involve covenating from one person's child to another and from that person back to their child, but a &ldquo;coalition&rdquo; of covenants, perhaps 15 or 20 back to back covenants and all those involved benefit <Col N="1937" /> from tax relief.  That carousel of covenants is an obvious abuse of the system and will be brought to an end tonight.</P>

When the Taoiseach has recovered from his comic interlude perhaps I could have a response.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach was courteous and good enough earlier to give us an explanation of the action of his Minister of State, Deputy Hogan, who came into the House and disappeared rapidly when what he had done became known at 12.15 p.m.  I put it to the Taoiseach that some months ago that same Minister of State stood here and lambasted a member of our Government on a much smaller issue, called for his resignation and treated him in an outrageous fashion.  Yet the Taoiseach stood here tonight and expressed no amazement or outrage.  We have been startled by the way the Taoiseach has treated the issue. If the Taoiseach was in Opposition and we were in Government there would be no end to the hullabaloo he would create.  There would be no end to the outrage he would express and store up and we would be treated as if we had committed an act of treason.  Yet the Minister of State has done something which no Minister has done on the occasion of a budget since the foundation of the State&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>As a person who has benefited to a limited degree from the covenant scheme I believe, irrespective of the arguments put from the other side of the House, that it is a fundamentally flawed system.  It is fundamentally flawed on the basis of the defence which Deputy Michael McDowell tried to advance in favour of the retention of the covenants, that is that uncle John can <Col N="1941" /> covenant his nephew young Willie for an unrestricted amount.  He does that on the basis that he is able to feed finance from one member of the family to another.  That is not the way to advance. That type of cross covenanting is what has discredited the entire system.  The principle is fundamentally good but the operation is bad.  The figures given by the Taoiseach prove that point.  Deputy Martin made a valid point on post leaving certificate courses because, in those circumstances, people who have been covenanted in good faith will lose out. We have to approach the problem from the angle that PLC students do not pay fees&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Does Deputy Martin realise that fees for law and European studies in the university in Deputy O'Dea's constituency are £1,980 or, to an average middle income family, £40 a week?  That is real money, it is not a tax allowance.  When you give a tax free <Col N="1942" /> allowance you get 27 per cent or 48 per cent.  Every pound gained by way of a concession in regard to fees is a pound in the pocket.  In two years time a person who has three children attending university will get up to £6,000 by way of a saving.</P>
      <P>Crocodile tears have been shed in this House tonight.  A former Minister for Education, Deputy Seamus Brennan, introduced a 40 per cent increase in the grant thresholds for maintenance but it failed miserably to iron out the warts in the system.  At the end of the day it was still based on gross income, not on net income.  It did not take into consideration mortgage, medical expenses and all the other running costs of the average household and it proved that the system is flawed.  At the end of the day, irrespective of how well meaning and substantial these reforms, it means that the son or daughter of a garda, a teacher, a health board worker or the average civil servant still cannot qualify. Under this series of measures they will qualify for up to £2,000 for each student each year.  Let nobody dismiss that as being insignificant.</P>
      <P>I was a teacher and I looked down at my own protégés who were capable of getting top points and getting into university. I welcome students' entry into university and access to all faculties. That is what the system is about.  Some of my teacher colleagues helped students obtain a high standard of education while their children were unable to attend college simply because they could not afford the fees.  We should not disparage the most significant package of education reform in relation to helping the middle income groups.</P>

I am sorry Deputy McDowell is not here because I was very amused at that Deputy posing as the great advocate of social equity.  He argued against the abolition of covenants and in turn the abolition of college fees on the basis that it is not socially equitable.  I know Deputy McDowell is held in high esteem by many Members of this House, but in their wildest dreams nobody would consider him as the great advocate of social justice or social equity.

      <P>I am not surprised that a member of the Law Library is one of those most vocal in opposing the abolition of covenants because it is the highest earners in the land who benefit most from covenants.  The richer you are, the more you benefit.  Among the highest earners are people in the Law Library who can commend £1,800 per day or more.</P>
      <P>I strongly support the abolition of third level fees and paying for them by the phasing out of covenants.  The question of maintenance grants is not addressed; that is an associated but different question.  To hear Deputies talking one would think that those who pay fees do not pay maintenance costs. Those who pay fees also pay maintenance costs.  As a Deputy who has been elected for 20 years mostly by working class urban votes, I know many constituents who had the qualifications to go to university but whose parents simply could not afford to send them because their gross earnings were above the grant limit.  I heard of two cases last year where students had the necessary points but their parents did not have the means to keep them in college.  I have heard of so many such cases down the years that I discussed with a number of people the idea of setting up a special scholarship fund to assist people in that category.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The measure announced today by the Government will greatly help those whose income is above the means limit for grants.  It amounts to a transfer from the very rich to those on middle income. People on middle income deserve relief because generally they are the people <Col N="1946" /> on PAYE, those who pay their mortgages and are not entitled to medical cards.  Many of them are the new poor. The relief in today's budget is socially equitable, but that is not to say that these measures are the last word in improving the position for those in third level education.  Undoubtedly there is a question of maintenance costs, but that should not be confused with the abolition of third level fees and covenants.</P>
    <P>When I spoke to a group of students in the College of Marketing in my constituency yesterday I met one young student who said that she receives a maintenance grant of £40 per week, but if she was on a FÁS course she would receive £70 per week.  She said that she and her family are under severe pressure and that it would be much easier for all concerned if she went on a FÁS course.  These are issues that will have to be addressed.  Today's budget is only one step in the right direction and further reforms are needed.</P>
    <P>There are many other issues to be addressed such as overcrowding in our universities and the unfair pressure put on students in terms of points requirements for third level education.  I appeal to Deputies to welcome the abolition of fees as a move in the right direction.  It should be acknowledged that in most other European Union countries, particularly in north-western Europe, there are no tuition fees.  By this measure, we are achieving equality with the United Kingdom and other European Union countries, which is welcome, but more needs to be done.</P>
    <P>I thank the Taoiseach for coming in so readily with an explanation about the Minister of State.  He has set a headline which should be followed by future Taoiseach and Ministers when something goes wrong.</P>

      <P>The indiscipline that has occurred in the Fine Gael Party could undermine the Taoiseach's authority and credibility and everything he yearns for.  It is extremely serious and merits further debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The abolition of third level fees will be well received because obviously people who pay £2,000 a year for a university course will be glad to see the end of those fees.  Last year when three of my children were in college I paid £6,500 and was unable to avail of any grant.  From a political viewpoint this measure is opportune for the Government and will be well received, but I wonder down the road if it will be considered economic madness.  I know the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, will agree that this scheme was not designed for the person earning £50,000, £60,000, £70,000 or £100,000 a year.  I do not think that is what the Government had in mind.  The problem with this measure is that while the Exchequer is well endowed at the moment the day will come when we may not be able to afford the amount required for third <Col N="1948" /> level education and PLC courses.  The great sufferers then will be the colleges and schools running those courses.  As happened in the case of local authorities, there will be inadequate Exchequer funding and colleges and universities will have to levy a capitation grant which will be increased every year.</P>
    <P>I accept that there were major inequities in the system.  The perception was that the self-employed and the farmers did very well out of the system, thus leaving the middle income group feeling very hard done by.  Those who can afford to pay fees should be asked to pay them and should not be given any thanks for doing so.  This decision will be well received from a political point of view but the day of reckoning still has to come.</P>
    <P>This measure will be very costly and will not lead to even one extra student admission to a third level college or a PLC course.  This will be the major problem in the future.  Despite the fall in the birth rate and the decrease in the number of students attending primary and secondary schools, the number of students seeking third level places will continue to increase dramatically for many years to come.  The Government has not addressed this problem.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to PLC courses, many of which are run in vocational and secondary schools.  Many of the students attending these courses live at home and there is no maintenance factor.  In many cases the cost of the course is negligible, it is an affordable commodity.  The vast majority of people attending these courses come from the lower socio-economic group.  Students on PLC courses whose parents are unemployed will believe that a social inequity has been perpetrated on them by the decision to abolish third level fees for those students whose parents have a business and may be earning £70,000 per year.  I appeal to the Taoiseach to give special consideration to PLC courses and the maintenance element. Many of the students attending these courses are already at a disadvantage and I ask the Taoiseach to introduce a <Col N="1949" /> provision which will alleviate their hardship.</P>
    <P>One must be rational when referring to covenants.  The carousel to which the Taoiseach referred is intolerable and should be rooted out.  However, many of the families availing of the covenant are on a standard salary of £11,000. These families will find it difficult to pay the maintenance fees for their children. While people on salaries of between £11,000-£15,000 do not benefit greatly from the covenant system, it nevertheless eases the burden on them.  I urge the Taoiseach not to make this the final word on the covenant system and to consider the introduction of a system which will enable people in that income group to avail of a tax relief option which will be of benefit to them and their children.</P>

      <P>I very much welcome the measure in the budget which will ease the burden of third level costs on parents and students.  There was no problem for those who came within the grant eligibility threshold while those in the higher income brackets could avail of worthwhile covenants.  The people who have borne the burden in recent years have been just over the threshold limit for grant eligibility; they are the people whom the budget will benefit. The majority of students come from this group.  Teachers, nurses and gardaí have had to endure an unbearable burden in order to give their children a third level education.  There is no third level college in my constituency and the families whose children did not qualify for a grant had to bear the cost of maintenance and fees.  I do not know how the Deputies opposite can criticise the abolition of fees and support the covenant system.</P>

Each Deputy opposite knows that people cannot cope with the cost of third level education.</P>
    <P>There is another matter that needs to be addressed: students from Dublin have to travel to Cork to pursue a science course and <i>vice versa.</i> This is dictated by the points system.  Nevertheless, additional costs are imposed on parents who are not in a position to meet them.</P>

      <P>This is a step in the right direction.  I have argued in favour of it for a long time.  Many third level students are happy today.  I say to those students who are studying for their leaving certificate in 1995 that at least they will not have to cope with the fear that their parents may not be in a position to fund them through college.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Government for having the courage to make this brave decision.  The Deputies opposite have mentioned that there is a need for equity but they have not told us how we can guarantee it.  Our young people deserve an education.  No student should be denied access because their parents are not in a position to send them to third level.  Many have to go abroad where the fees are covered and to seek employment.  We should send them abroad educated.  This is a good investment from which there will be a return of which this Government can be proud.</P>

      <P>I wish to refer to the matter of third level education which arises from this resolution.  I accept what the Taoiseach said that certain covenants between non-relatives are abused. One hears stories to this effect.  I could never understand why this facility existed, but what is wrong with a parent covenanting income to meet the cost of <Col N="1953" /> educating his child as it seems to be perfectly reasonable?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Nothing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>This is being abolished&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it is not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in the same way as all the others were abolished.  If the system is being abused we should by all means eliminate the abuses but if something is perfectly straightforward and normal why should it be removed?  I fail to see the point in this.</P>
      <P>During the past few days since the proposal was leaked the justification given is that it will only do at third level what Donogh O'Malley did at second level.  I feel I am qualified to express a view in regard to what he did.  The argument that is being put forward in respect of this proposal is fallacious.  Donogh O'Malley did what he did &mdash; Deputy Mitchell stated that he acted without this agreement, consent or support of the Fianna Fáil Party &mdash; in aid of poor or would be students who could not in 1966 gain access to second level education. Those who already had access and could afford to pay the fees did not benefit.  This was commendable and has been regarded ever since as such.</P>
      <P>What is being proposed today is very different.  The effect of what is being proposed, if expressed in second level 1966 Donogh O'Malley terms, will be not to give access to second level education to those who cannot gain access but to pay the fees of those who attend Belvedere, Gonzaga, Glenstal, Clongowes and elsewhere.  There would have been an outcry if Donogh O'Malley had done this at second level in 1966.  Hundreds of thousands of young students throughout the country have been in a position to attend a second level school ever since, including those who live in relatively inaccessible parts of the country up to 20 miles from a secondary school because a bus service is provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is being proposed will not allow <Col N="1954" /> any student who is unable to attend university to get there.  This is regrettable because the degree of participation by the lower socio-economic groupings in our society in third level education is extremely low.  One of the great drawbacks is that Donogh O'Malley did not follow through to third level education; there was a genuine opportunity until the end of second level, but suddenly it all came to a stop.  The presidents of the universities here will tell us that between 3 and 4 per cent of undergraduates come from the lower socio-economic groupings.  This does not constitute equal opportunity and is regrettable. We should be aiming to change this but instead we are aiming to perpetuate this inequality.  This is wrong.  The Taoiseach and the Government may say that this was not their intention, but that will be the effect.  We should consider the consequences before this proposal is finally implemented.</P>
    <P>It is not particularly easy to say this as I know a great many people, including myself, who will benefit in the short term and I have been through the mill more than most on this issue.  I had one horrendous year when I had four children attending third level simultaneously. Happily, this lasted for only one year, but I had at least two children attending third level for many years and the pressure and strain were enormous.</P>
    <P>I agree that this proposal will ease the burden and from that point of view I am glad, but in judging this and any other budgetary proposal one has to ask not whether it will benefit A, B, C or D but whether it will benefit our society as a whole.  That is the criterion by which it should be judged.  The criterion in regard to third level education today should be whether we can increase the level of participation by the economically weakest in our society.  They may be economically the weakest but they are not the weakest intellectually and they have the same rights at third level as they have at second level and have enjoyed at first level for a long time. That matter should be rethought in that <Col N="1955" /> light and should not be put across in an inaccurate way.</P>
    <P>I will conclude by again referring to what the Taoiseach said about what the Minister of State, Deputy Hogan, did today.  I inquired from the Taoiseach whether he proposed to dismiss Minister Hogan; he said he did not.  Perhaps the Taoiseach might tell us why he does not propose to dismiss him.  The Taoiseach made an apology to this House and I acknowledge that but I notice Minister Hogan has not made any apology and I wonder why.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to comment on a few points made by a number of Deputies in the debate.  Some Deputies expressed concern about the cost of maintenance of students in third level. They pointed out, quite justly, that fees are not the only cost involved in third level education and, for some, they are not even the principal cost.  Maintenance grants will be increased in line with the consumer price index from 1995-96 and income limits will also be increased in line with wage movements.  There is, however, a commitment in the Programme for Government to further improvements in the area of maintenance and to improving access to third level education.  The provision in regard to the abolition of fees is just one of the Government's aims in regard to third level education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Points were made by a number of <Col N="1956" /> Deputies which they might wish me to answer.  Deputy O'Rourke inquired about postgraduate students.  I am sure she is well aware that postgraduate students who satisfy the means test will continue to qualify for maintenance and fee support under the existing scheme. That is not affected in any way.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The position was aptly put by Deputy Batt O'Keeffe where he pointed out that the abolition of third level fees will be a popular measure.  To listen to some speakers one would think there was something wrong with a measure just because it was popular and that only unpopular measures should be put forward.  Critics should ask themselves &mdash; if Deputy O'Keeffe is right and I believe he is &mdash; why the abolition of fees is a popular measure.  I believe it is popular for two reasons which justify it as a decision.  It will assist a group who were finding it particularly difficult to maintain their families in third level education, those who are above the limit for qualifying for fee <Col N="1957" /> and grant support, who are not on a very high income and to whom the cost of third level education is a matter of indifference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Furthermore, it is worth pointing out &mdash; and this was not mentioned by anyone in the debate and it is quite surprising &mdash; that the biggest benefit from any tax allowance and, in particular, a covenant tax allowance is achieved by people who have the largest income.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The greater benefit from this will be for those with the largest incomes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In fact, a tax relief on a covenant system of support for third level education is regressive in that the more one earns, the more one benefits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The point that Deputy Ahern and others made was that we had a peculiar system of third level education support with high levels of support at the bottom of the income scale &mdash; those who were below the limits qualified for everything; virtually no support for those in the middle income bracket where one paid the fees and, at the top income bracket, where one could obtain the maximum benefit from covenants, there was even greater support. That irrational situation is now being changed by giving support in the middle income area, particularly where fees are an important factor.  That is the first argument I wanted to advance which does not seem to have been taken on board by some of the Deputies, although it was undoubtedly understood by Deputy Batt O'Keeffe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another important reason and this point was validly made by Deputy O'Malley when he pointed out that in certain socio-economic groups <Col N="1958" /> only 3 to 4 per cent of students are in third level education&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>One per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;or even lower, and I will concede the point to Deputy O'Rourke if it is 1 per cent, come from that group.  It is fair to ask ourselves why that is the case because fees are certainly not a problem for that group nor is maintenance because they qualify for maintenance grants.  I believe it is primarily a psychological, socio-economic and cultural issue in that people from that group in society do not have relatives who have been in third level education and, therefore, its benefits are not immediately obvious to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the ways in which that will be changed will be by the abolition of fees because the fact that third level education will now be free will create a sense that it is now accessible to people.  It is not simply a question of doing the arithmetic on the finances of the matter.  The fact that no fees are charged and that it is now free, as secondary education is free, will have a disproportionate psychological effect in that they will know that third level education is accessible to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that from a rational point of view, as the Deputies pointed out, if they take the trouble to make the inquiries, they will find their income is below a level where the fees do not arise.  By abolishing fees, however, one creates a sense that third level education is open to all in much the same way that Aneurin Bevan, by introducing the free health service in Britain in the 1940s, created a sense that <Col N="1959" /> health services were available to all.  It could have been argued that the idea of a free health service &mdash; no prescription charges even for people who were millionaires &mdash; was not, strictly speaking, economically rational.  However, from the psychological point of view of conveying to people that the health service was an entitlement freely available to them, the introduction of the free health service had a disproportionate psychological effect.</P>

      <P>Let me put the debate in perspective.  The litmus test of measures should not be whether they are popular or unpopular but whether they are socially progressive or regressive. Resources will become available as a result of this measure and as a result of the abolition of tax covenanting.  The issue is how we apply those resources in a truly equitable manner across the full spectrum of education.  We accept the inequities of the present education grants scheme as articulated by Deputy Ahern, of which I was a victim.  Because my bus driver father worked too many Sundays and too much overtime, my brother and I did not benefit from the third level grant scheme.  I need no lectures from anybody about how inequitable, unjust and harsh the system was for many middle income groups.</P>
      <P>There are other options.  Only two weeks ago in a Private Members' motion we asked the Government to increase substantially the income threshold levels.  We could have simply implemented the recommendations of the de Buitléir report, increased income thresholds to £30,000 and brought in marginal relief and a sliding scale so that the higher up the income scale one is the less one gets back in grants and the lower down the more one gets.  Up to 24,000 students in the third level system are excluded from the measures being adopted.  I refer particularly to the 17,500 post leaving certificate students who will receive no maintenance grants and will also be denied the option of covenanting.  There are over 7,000 post graduate students also.</P>

Can the Taoiseach give an absolute commitment that in four years time we will not see the introduction of university service charges or other mechanisms which would amount to fees under a different name?

      <P>There have been abuses of the covenanting system and we should strive to cut out the anomalies. However, for several years I have often found myself recommending covenanting as a device to get around other anomalies or injustices.  For example, if one employs a State registered nurse as a carer at night to look after an elderly parent, one gets tax relief, but not if one brings in a carer. The solution was to execute a covenant. I have dealt with a constituent in receipt of lone parent's allowance who gave up her £76 a week to go straight and <Col N="1962" /> officially live with her boyfriend who was working while she was not.  Because they are not married they are treated as single persons for tax purposes.  The only thing that could be recommended to them was the taking out of a covenant. In that case the limiting of the covenant to 5 per cent of income would seriously affect them.  Minister Rabbitte proposed that amendment to the Finance Act last year but was turned down. This anomaly affects people like the couple I mentioned.  I am not of the liberal wing of any party, but this measure will also affect people involved in divorce if it is introduced.</P>
      <P>We look on covenants as being for educational purposes and yet a close friend of mine was refused because his son was not 18 years by the required date, so he did not get the benefit of any covenant during his first year in college. However, I accept the analysis of the Taoiseach and Deputy Theresa Ahearn. I welcome the abolition of fees &mdash; I pay £2,730 for my own son.  Why did the Minister not go the whole way and include post leaving certificate students?  A large group of people earning between £18,000 and £25,000 were hugely discriminated against, particularly in families where more than one child was attending a third level course. The Minister has certainly solved that problem.  In 1992 Fianna Fáil were the first to recommend the abolition of fees. When Deputy Seamus Brennan recommended it then it was looked on as an election gimmick and the suggestion was shot down.</P>

      <P>I accept that the two major anomalies have been removed. However, the Government has done nothing for the post leaving certificate <Col N="1963" /> students who comprise the other huge and much more deserving category.  The Government has abolished university fees for people whether they are earning £30,000 or £130,000.  The person who attends a PLC course at the local vocational education committee is being bypassed.  The step forward is great, but why did the Taoiseach not take the second one?</P>
      <P>Only 1 per cent of those in the lower social category go on to third level but many of them do a PLC course where they can get exemptions before proceeding to a third level course.  Many do not get the minimum maintenance they could get and have to be up all night trying to earn a few bob, which hinders their progress to third level education proper.  In Dublin nobody attending a PLC course lives away from home and the maintenance amounts to only £8 per week.  I would prefer if the Taoiseach would take the step of providing maintenance for those attending PLC courses as well as taking the huge step of abolishing fees.  The fees for PLC courses range from £250 to £300 and of that only £50 is regarded as fees and the balance is usually a registration fee to a professional body.  I wonder if that will be included when the fees are abolished?</P>
      <P>I welcome this step but there are certain anomalies in the resolution and I would like to hear how the Taoiseach will address them.  The Taoiseach is creating anomalies as well as eradicating them.</P>

In this family of four, two of the children have received third level education and have been lucky <Col N="1964" /> enough to get jobs while the two younger family members are in third level education.  The father and the two who are working have taken out covenants to try to educate the others, one of whom is doing medicine, and they have a six to seven year plan to try to fund this serious drain on the family's resources and to ensure that the person can complete his studies.</P>

Much of what the Taoiseach has to say is eminently sensible, strategic and coherent; but this throws overboard all the proposals on the table that have not been debated in this House and which, I am quite sure, have not been debated in Cabinet.  Yet, the Taoiseach and the Government run in one <Col N="1965" /> direction, but nobody in the education system &mdash; neither students, educators nor economic advisers &mdash; has come out vociferously in support of this measure. I appeal to the Taoiseach not to proceed with this proposal.</P>

    <P>Finally, the transfer of EU funds under the Community Support Framework runs to £800 million.  On the one hand we are telling our European Union colleagues that we need substantial assistance for education, but at the same time we have the ability to remove university fees.  The human resources operational programme report has not yet been published.  I wonder why it is one of the last reports to be published. To my mind it is illogical that we spend millions of pounds of EU funding on a current basis and at the same time we turn around and remove university fees. I think the Taoiseach will rue the day, <Col N="1966" /> because this is a short term benefit and will do nothing for the provision of extra facilities at third level education.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach was pondering on the question of why some socio-economic groups succeed in getting only approximately 1 per cent of their children to third level education. Perhaps I can be of some assistance to him.  He came up with a novel view that it is some sort of psychological cultural problem.  By coincidence I had tabled questions to the Minister for Education one of which also posed the same question, and I will quote briefly from the Minister's reply which might be instructive for the Taoiseach.  She states that all the available evidence indicates that the struggle against disadvantage is won or lost at first and second level and consequently it is essential to target resources at primary and post-primary level in disadvantaged areas.  Equally, by coincidence I had a letter from the board of management of a primary school in my own constituency and I am sure Deputy Mitchell got a similar letter today.  It states:</P>
      <P>Our school caters for 542 pupils. Because of approximately 80 per cent unemployment in the area our school has been designated disadvantaged. Despite its special status the school receives no support funds from the Department of Education for equipment to train for computer literacy, a skill which we feel would be essential to our students particularly as we accept that whereas some will progress to third level education most will not.  ...Fund-raising at a local level is ongoing but extremely difficult due to the high unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By another coincidence a principal of a second level school in my area telephoned me and pointed out that he was experiencing great stress in having to ask students in second level classes to bring in the fees for the junior and leaving certificate examinations because in many instances unemployed families <Col N="1967" /> had two children in the school, one sitting the junior certificate and the other the leaving certificate, the combined fees for which are nearly £100.  We were talking about free second level education earlier.  People in those circumstances simply could not possibly afford this money and, in turn, this teacher was under pressure from the Department of Education to send in the examination fees before the end of February.</P>
    <P>A very large primary school in my constituency is pleading for one additional remedial teacher and I tabled a question about it.  I suggest these are the reasons that children in disadvantaged areas do not get through second level never mind third level.  It has nothing to do with psychological or cultural problems but with social inequality.  This measure and the abolition of third level fees has nothing to do with education and reform, it is simply political opportunism of the worst order.</P>

      <P>I want to put it in context and cut through the socio-economic jargon we have heard from the Government side for the past two hours.  Those who do not earn enough and satisfy the means test will not benefit from the proposal and those who do will benefit from it.  It is peculiar that this measure forms part of a budget which gives a miserly increase of £1.50 a week to people in receipt of unemployment assistance and to those on disability benefit and increases the living alone <Col N="1968" /> allowance by 10p per week.  That is the reality.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>There is also a miserly increase in the maintenance grant for students.  What will be done for the thousands of post-graduate students who will not benefit from the abolition of fees but who will be penalised as a result of the change in covenanting? What will be done for those whose income is so low that it satisfies the means test but who must use covenants to support their children at college? Those who do not satisfy the means test because their income is too high will benefit.  What is the position in relation to people covenanting for elderly relatives in nursing homes?  Is the amount they covenant restricted to 5 per cent of their gross income?  How will the 5 per cent restriction apply in the case instanced by Deputy Ahern?</P>
      <P>I have no hang up about increasing DIRT to 15 per cent.  The special 10 per cent rate was brought in at a time when exchange controls were removed to prevent the flight of capital out of the country to avail of higher interest rates abroad.  Have Irish interest rates on deposits increased to such an extent that we can increase DIRT on special savings accounts to 15 per cent without creating this danger?</P>

      <P>I appreciate that, Sir, <Col N="1973" /> but the funding of the abolition of third level fees is being provided through the cessation of tax benefits to those who are very rich.  It is more equitable if those in the middle income bracket receive more benefit than the very rich whereas at present the opposite is the case.  This proposal is equitable.  Fianna Fáil produced a draft budget when still in Government and proposed a lesser increase in public expenditure than is proposed in this budget.  Yet in their contributions this evening they call persistently for more money for everything. They cannot have it both ways.</P>

      <P>I share a constituency with Deputy Gregory who dismissed the notion that the drop-out factor, particularly in second level, in the less well off regions has no cultural dimension.  It has a cultural dimension and, if that is not recognised, we will never solve the problem.</P>

I know of many parents in my constituency who want their children to remain in school but cannot persuade them because they see their peers dropping out.  It is a cultural phenomenon.  Deputy Gregory is wrong to criticise the Taoiseach for having said so.  To solve a problem, it must first be properly identified.  To dismiss the cultural dimension of the practice to which I have just adverted is a mistake.</P>

      <P>Much has been said on the subject of covenants and education grants but we cannot ignore the contents of Resolution No. 3 which is an attack on the small saver and depositor, proposing a 50 per cent increase in deposit interest retention tax.  This is another attack on the small saver, the PAYE worker.  I am astounded that Members on the Labour benches would allow such an imposition on small savers. Savings to the banks will amount to some £12 million in any given year whereas approximately £7 million will be extracted in a full year from the small saver.  This is a retrograde step, representing a further kill of the people we should be endeavouring to foster and promote.</P>

    <P>We must look at the budgetary provisions in their entirety and the possible proposal to sell some State assets, such <Col N="1975" /> as Irish Life and the like.  This proposal is making way for that type of disposal of State assets.  I listened with pride today to the Minister for Finance speak about the success of the National Treasury Management Agency.  Its establishment can be attributed to none other than our former Leader and Taoiseach, Deputy Charles J. Haughey whose brainchild it was.  That agency is working very effectively and is much envied by many people involved in the financial sector.  We must give our former leader credit for many things achieved over the past seven years, including the benefits of this budget.  Were it not for his ability and the austere measures put in place during his term of office we would not be enjoying our present growth rates and the Government opposite would not have the give-away of which they have been so boastful.</P>

It is my belief they are on an inflationary road again, that they pose a danger to our economy.  If we have a further spiral of inflation we shall find ourselves in the same circumstances in which the former Taoiseach found himself when he assumed office some seven years ago.  It is my firm belief that, before the end of this year, we shall see the introduction of another budget to take corrective action to put this economy right because inflation may well take off at a frightening rate.</P>

I made telephone calls to my constituency office this evening on the difficulties that will arise for them.  It is my firm belief that next time Members meet the electorate on the doorstep those people with small deposits will treat them in the manner they deserve, remembering that this administration took 50 per cent of the interest yield on their deposits.  That is not the way to treat small savers.  Rather they should be encouraged in that type of small scale investment, which is best for our economy, giving everybody a share of the benefits within our society.</P>

    <P>Another group of people to whom Deputies referred are families who wish to send two or more members of their family to third level education.  There were references from the Opposition benches in respect of people who are well off.

      <P>The honour the Taoiseach did me by complimenting me is a dubious one and I will not return it.  His brain seems to have gone into overdrive and he seems to have passed his speed limit when he suggested that by removing third level fees there would be a rush of people from the lower socio-economic group entering third level education and that their problems were psychological.  That certainly does not smack of fundamentalist thinking and it is so far off the mark that I am extremely worried about the thinking behind the removal of those fees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Does the Taoiseach understand the position that will pertain when fees are abolished?  The Government and the Exchequer will be on one side and colleges with their demands on the other. The demands of colleges for increases in fees will not be entertained by Government. Therein lies the impasse and the only way it can be overcome is for the colleges to put an additional capitation fee on new students.  That will bring us back to square one.  How will the Taoiseach address that problem?  In line with what Deputy Cullen said, a report has been presented on access to third level education.  A unit cost analysis, a matter which I raised at a Committee of Public Accounts, of universities, regional technical colleges and PLC colleges has not been carried out.  A cursory look at the comparative costs of attending UCC and Tralee Regional Technical College will reveal that it cost the Government approximately £4,500 to put a student through UCC and approximately £2,500 to put a student through a regional technical college.  An <Col N="1982" /> analysis would also show it is likely that the costs would be lower than those figures. It is proposed to remove fees before the most effective approach to providing additional places for our students has been established.  The proposal is based on a false premise.  It is popular at present but it is not soundly based economically and I do not want to come back here at a later stage to say that.</P>
    <P>Regarding the PLC courses and maintenance grants, the vast majority of students attending those courses come from a lower socio-economic background. Minister Rabbitte's brain must have gone into reverse since he went into Government because the concern he showed for the less well off in society appears to have evaporated.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Justice</askee>
      <Quest>the number of visitors to Ireland in 1994 who were victims of crime during their visits; the nature of all such crimes; and the conviction rate of the perpetrators of such crimes.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen) Nora Owen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that Garda statistics are not compiled in such a manner as to enable me to say how many visitors to Ireland were the victims of crime during their visits.</P>
      <P>I have already said in reply to the earlier question by Deputy O'Donoghue that there is need to improve the statistical output of the criminal justice system.  The fact that I am not in a position to tell the House how many visitors to this country were attacked last year is proof positive that change is needed in this regard and should have been brought about before now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Both the Garda Síochána and I are conscious of the traumatic effect which crime can have on visitors.  The gardaí liaise closely with Bord Fáilte and other <Col N="1742" /> tourist interests with a view to preventing such criminality.</P>
    <P>A number of measures have been taken by the gardaí to deal with the problem.  These include the deployment of additional Garda patrols, both uniformed and plainclothes in areas of high tourist interest and the provision and distribution of an information leaflet by the gardaí which is written in three different European languages and gives advice to tourists on how to protect their property and personal belongings. These leaflets are also available at all seaports and airports.</P>
    <P>Another measure designed to help in tackling the problem is the provision of the Garda office which opened in March 1990 in O'Connell Street, Dublin.  This serves as a centre for advising tourists on preventive measures which they can take to safeguard themselves and their belongings.</P>
    <P>The Garda community relations unit have launched a street map for tourists in Dublin, which lists places of historical and current interest and also includes crime prevention advice.  Supervised car parks are depicted on the maps.  It is intended to extend this project to other larger populated areas frequented by tourists.</P>
    <P>I understand from a victim support survey that the major locations of crimes committed against tourists are:</P>
    <P>O'Connell Street, Christchurch, Wicklow Street, Grafton Street/ St. Stephen's Green and James's Gate (the Guinness Brewery).</P>
    <P>Gardaí deploy additional patrols in these and other areas frequented by tourists and they supply information leaflets in three European languages which advise tourists on how to protect their property and personal belongings.</P>
    <P>A new initiative in the area of crimes against tourists is the establishment of the Dublin Tourist Victim Support Service which was launched on 14 April 1994 and which is being operated by the Irish Association for Victim Support (IAVS).  This new concept is modelled on the existing Amsterdam Tourist <Col N="1743" /> Assistance Service and provides tourists who have been the victims of crime with a practical support in order to assist them in overcoming the initial trauma of their experiences.  The Garda Síochána have been involved in the setting up of this service and have provided premises for its operation at the Garda Dublin Metropolitan Area Headquarters at Harcourt Square.  A co-ordinator with a victim support background has been appointed to head the team of volunteers who possess a wide range of foreign languages.  All volunteers have received extensive training to allow them deal effectively with tourists who become victims of crime while on holiday in Ireland.  I am confident that this service will prove to be of immense benefit to visitors to this country who suffer the misfortune of becoming victims of criminal activity.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Question Nos. 14, 24, 35, 63, 67 and 70 together.</P>
      <P>I am conscious that the relatives of the victims and the House have been waiting for a statement on the outcome of the Garda investigation into the issues raised by the Yorkshire Television Programme on the Dublin and Monaghan bomb outrages shown in July 1993 for some time.  The matter has been ongoing since then, nearly 18 months.  It is my intention that the matter will now be brought to a conclusion and that a statement be made as quickly as possible on the investigation.</P>
      <P>I can assure the House that I will honour the commitment made by the former Minister to meet with the families of the victims of the bombings to advise them of the outcome in advance of issuing that statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of holding a public inquiry is one of the issues I will need to consider carefully.  I am far from convinced that this course would serve any <Col N="1745" /> useful purpose and might actually be damaging.</P>
    <P>My reason for doubting the value of a public inquiry &mdash; and I stress that this is a preliminary view on which I am being honest with the House &mdash; is that it would not assist in any way in identifying and convicting the perpetrators. This is something which can only be achieved by means of a trial, based on actual evidence presented in a court of law.</P>
    <P>The potential damage lies in the fact that the criminal investigation file in this case remains open &mdash; a public inquiry could damage rather than assist the criminal investigation.  I repeat that I am giving a preliminary, but honest, assessment of the likely value of a public inquiry.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Justice</askee>
      <Quest>if she will assist the National Graves Association with their proposal to re-inter the remains of nine of the ten executed Volunteers (details supplied) from the yard in Mountjoy Jail to the republican plot in Glasnevin Cemetery as their surviving family members are most anxious that the re-interring takes place.</Quest>
      <QRef>[1327/95]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen) Nora Owen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen)</NameTxt>
      <P>In February 1994 an application by the National Graves Association for the removal of the remains of ten volunteers buried in the grounds of Mountjoy Prison for re-interment in the republican plot in Glasnevin Cemetery was received from the Minister for the Environment.  This request was considered by my predecessor who agreed to the proposal subject to the observance of the normal procedures in these matters.  It was clearly understood by this that the permission of all of the next of kin would be an essential prerequisite. When it emerged shortly afterwards that one of the families concerned had not, in fact, consented, and were not prepared to consent, to disturbing the <Col N="1746" /> plot, the then Minister had no option but to withdraw her agreement.</P>
      <P>The layout of the plot today following the erection of a monument on the site in 1961 does not correspond exactly with the drawing which accompanied the application to the Minister for the Environment.  The precise location of the various remains within the plot is, therefore, uncertain.  The remains of the volunteer whose family have withheld their permission were interred in the same location as five others on the same day in March 1921 and in these circumstances it is clear that no exhumation of the remains could be attempted without risking an infringement of the clearly stated wishes of one of the families concerned.</P>
      <P>In all the circumstances I regret that I cannot agree to the request from the National Graves Association.</P>
      <P>I am sure it will be clear to the Deputy that there is no objection, in principle, to the proposal put forward by the National Graves Association. There is, however, the competing principle that a grave should not be disturbed &mdash; and we should not run the risk of disturbing remains &mdash; against the wishes of surviving relatives.  If there is a proposal which would effectively meet the concerns of the family who are against the disturbance of remains, I will be glad to listen to it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I too have read of the claims referred to by the Deputy.  I want to assure the Deputy that there has not been any reduction in the amount spent on Garda overtime.  In 1993, £8.5 million was allocated on the Garda Vote for overtime <Col N="1747" /> purposes and £13.5 million was actually spent.  Last year £12 million was allocated and £14.5 million was spent on overtime.  This represents an increase of almost 10 per cent in actual overtime hours worked in 1994.  This year £12.5 million has been allocated for overtime purposes.</P>
      <P>Almost £1 million has already been spent on overtime in the month of January this year compared with £664,000 in 1994.  Clearly there has been no reduction in expenditure on overtime and these figures speak for themselves.</P>
      <P>The Deputy has indicated his concern about parts of Dublin without being specific.  In the DMA South Central Division &mdash; which will be of particular interest to the Deputy &mdash; the amount spent on overtime last year compared to 1993 rose by almost £147,000 from £1,440,380 to £1,586,924.  Indeed, the amount spent on overtime last year in the DMA as a whole was £7.2 million, compared with £6.3 million in 1993 &mdash; an increase of almost £900,000.</P>

    <P>The reduction in the threat to the community, arising from the cessations announced by the PIRA and the Combined Loyalist Military Command, provides a significant opportunity to use, <Col N="1748" /> for other Garda purposes, a proportion of the resources which have until now been assigned exclusively to security-related tasks.</P>
    <P>Following those developments, the Garda authorities have conducted a high level review of security commitments to ensure that the resources assigned to them are appropriate having regard to the needs involved and the overall demands on Garda services. Deputies will understand that, as a matter of prudence, there would be need to allow for a reasonable time interval between the ending of a major and sustained campaign of violence which, as we all know, continued for 25 years, before the security adjustments which became possible as a result of that momentous development can be put into place and become fully apparent.</P>
    <P>Some of these changes are already under way and while I do not want to be too specific at this point I can say that Garda checkpoints on the Border have already been withdrawn, Garda manpower commitments at some prisons are being reduced and other proposals from the Garda authorities affecting the allocation of Garda resources to security-type duties are under consideration.</P>
    <P>My intention is to work with the Garda authorities to ensure that where desirable and where the security situation allows, those opportunities are realised taking account of the policing needs of all the areas concerned as well as the needs of the Force.  I am most anxious, as is everybody else in this House, to see gardaí reassigned from Border duties at the earliest opportunity. Assuming that the security situation remains as positive as it is at this time &mdash; and I am in no doubt that we can look forward to continuing peace &mdash; I would expect worthwhile redeployment of Garda manpower and resources to take place during the current year.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Question Nos. 19 and 28 together.</P>
      <P>As Deputies will be aware, a considerable body of criminal legislation has been enacted in recent years.  A number of these statutes contain provisions which are particularly relevant to the fight against white collar crime. In that context I might mention the Criminal Damage Act, 1991, which made computer hacking a criminal offence and the Criminal Evidence Act, 1992, which allowed computer evidence to be admitted in evidence in criminal proceedings.  In addition the Criminal Justice Act, 1994, provides for the confiscation of criminal proceeds and enables the Garda Síochána, on foot of orders made by the District Court, to obtain access to information, from banks etc., for the purpose of carrying out investigations into money laundering and other serious offences.  In the course of the reply I have given to Priority Question No. 9 from Deputy O'Donoghue I have also given a commitment that additional provisions of the 1994 Act which are designed to combat money laundering will be brought into operation as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>I am at present preparing legislation on fraud which will be based on the report of the advisory committee on fraud and the report of the Law Reform Commission on the law relating to dishonesty. My proposals for legislative reform will be comprehensive and wide-ranging and will be brought forward as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1750" /> I will shortly be putting proposals before my Government colleagues for the establishment of a National Bureau of Fraud Investigation under the control of a chief superintendent who will be appointed to head the new bureau.  Two additional detective inspectors and three professional accountants will also be assigned to the new bureau in line with the recommendations contained in the committee's report.  I have also made provision in this year's Estimates for the purchase of specialised fraudrelated information technology equipment.</P>
    <P>The strength of the fraud squad has varied over the years and there is a number of vacancies at present.  I am determined that the Garda Síochána will have the necessary staff and resources available to it to combat serious fraud and I will shortly be putting proposals to Government on the establishment of the National Bureau.</P>
    <P>Once this matter is approved by Government, I will be taking whatever steps are necessary to ensure that the National Bureau will have available to it all the staffing and resources considered necessary by the advisory committee in its report.  In relation to existing vacancies, I will be consulting with the Garda Commissioner in order to ensure that the Garda Fraud Squad as presently constituted has the necessary staffing resources to fulfil its role in advance of the establishment of the proposed National Bureau.</P>

      <P>I <Col N="1751" /> am informed by the Garda authorities, who are responsible for the allocation of Garda manpower to individual areas, that an extra three gardaí and one probationer garda were assigned to Blanchardstown station in January 1995.  This brings the current strength at the station to 69 gardaí.</P>
      <P>I am also informed by the Garda authorities that an additional four gardaí were assigned from within that strength to the community policing unit at Blanchardstown station last month, bringing the current strength of the unit to one sergeant and 11 gardaí.  These community gardaí perform regular foot patrols throughout the Blanchardstown district and liaise on a regular basis with local community and residents groups, as well as being involved with youth activities in the District.  There are two neighbourhood watch clinics in the Blanchardstown district which are attended by the community gardaí.  The local juvenile liaison officer is actively involved in setting up a neighbourhood youth project in the Blakestown area. This will enable the community to respond to youth needs and is aimed at diverting young people at risk away from crime.</P>
      <P>There are also six mobile units attached to Blanchardstown Garda station and these are used to ensure regular mobile patrols are performed throughout the Blanchardstown district.</P>
      <P>The Garda authorities are confident that the increased Garda presence in Blanchardstown will improve the policing arrangements for the area.  The size and growth of this area requires ongoing review of policing arrangements.  I will make whatever decisions are required to recognise the developing nature of this new town.  However, if the Deputy has a specific case in mind where a delay in the Garda response occurred and if he can supply me with details, I will have the matter examined by the Garda authorities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity to set out in detail the resources being made available this year to the Garda to deal with the crime situation.  I am satisfied that this package of measures will enable the Garda to effectively meet the many challenges that they face, especially with regard to violent and serious crime.</P>
      <P>A total of £413 million is being provided for the Garda Síochána this year &mdash; the highest amount ever.  The allocation of an amount of this magnitude will be of assistance to the Garda in the fight against crime by enabling the following measures to be taken: the recruitment of 1,050 gardaí during the next three years; recruitment of an additional 200 civilian clerical/ administrative staff to release an equivalent number of gardaí for operational duties; recruitment of civilian for certain specialist/managerial posts in the Force; replacement of the Garda Fleet on a five year basis; implementation of an information technology plan for the Garda Síochána; upgrading of the Garda communications network; installation of closed circuit television cameras to combat crime in certain areas; further development of community based measures in areas of disadvantage, and measures to combat serious fraud, including the implementation of certain non-legislative proposals of the Government's advisory committee on fraud.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These measures will ensure that the strength of the Force is maintained at <Col N="1753" /> about 11,000 and they will also ensure that the Garda authorities have sufficient funding to purchase whatever equipment they require to tackle crime.</P>
    <P>It is not just, of course, a question of resources for the Garda.  There is a number of other elements to be considered in our integrated approach to the crime problem.  Criminal law reform, particularly the new Juvenile Justice Bill and the Fraud Bill, is an essential component in the fight against crime.  In addition, I will be bringing proposals to Government which are designed to improve and enhance the co-ordination and cohesion of the various law enforcement agencies in the fight against drugs.  A commitment has also been given to a review of the provisions of the Courts and Court Officers Bill, 1994, to ensure that the measures adopted are adequate to tackle the backlog of cases.  Furthermore, a five year plan for the management of offenders has been announced.  I am confident that these measures, taken together, provide for a comprehensive considered response to the problem of crime in our society.</P>

      <P>A total of 355 applications for refugee status were received in 1994; one applicant was refused recognition as a refugee; 22 applications were withdrawn and the remainder are being considered in accordance with the provisions of the 1951 UN Convention relating to the Status of Refugees as amended by the 1967 New York Protocol and in consultation with the Department of Foreign Affairs and the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1754" /> I do not believe that it would be proper to disclose information on the nationalities of the applicants having regard to the general and understandable desire on the part of individual applicants to ensure that an application for recognition as a refugee is processed in confidence.  As the number of applicants of some nationalities is small, it would be relatively easy in some instances to identify particular individuals if nationality statistics were provided.  Such identification could have serious implications, particularly if members of an applicant's family are still in the country of origin.  However, the number of applications in 1994 shows a significant increase over previous years and it is no secret that the increase is due primarily to a large number of applications by Cuban nationals, of which there are 239.</P>
    <P>On balance, I would consider it important that confidentiality be maintained in these cases and, therefore, I would not be in favour of giving the nationalities of all who have sought refugee status in the State.</P>

      <P>As the Deputies will be aware, the Government's policy agreement, <i>A Government of Renewal,</i> includes a commitment to draw up a charter for victims of crime and an immediate review of the criminal injuries compensation scheme.  It is also proposed to establish a restitution fund to which offenders could contribute.</P>
      <P>I have already met with representatives of the Irish Association for Victim Support and discussed with them these commitments and how the association views the implementation of the commitments, as well as the ongoing work of the association.  I would like to avail of this opportunity to express my gratitude to the members of the association for their work and to repeat my commitment to continued support for the association.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The application of judicial review to obtain an order of prohibition in respect <Col N="1757" /> of criminal proceedings is a matter for the courts to determine in each individual case.  I am aware that orders of prohibition have been obtained on grounds of delay or lapse of time in a number of criminal proceedings and not just in cases relating to sexual abuse.</P>
    <P>The courts have held that every accused person has a constitutional right to a fair trial which includes the right to a trial with reasonable expedition. Where the lapse of time is such as to prejudice a person's defence, to proceed with a prosecution would deprive a person of his or her right to fair procedures and a fair trial.  Where the lapse of time is particularly lengthy the courts have taken the view that depending on the circumstances, a fair trial may no longer be possible and that there is no need for any specific prejudice to be shown by the accused.</P>
    <P>The exercise of a person's constitutional rights in the context of court proceedings is a matter for the courts and I do not think that it would be appropriate for me to express a view on the decision of the courts in such cases.</P>

      <P>The format of identification parades and the manner in which they are held are pro-cedural matters for the Garda authorities and are not governed by any positive rule of law or practice of general application.  A point worth mentioning is that there is an obligation to explain to the suspect that he or she is not required to take part in the process. No inference may be drawn from a failure to take part.  Comprehensive guidelines on the procedures to be followed by all gardaí are in place and have been circulated to each member of the force.</P>
      <P>In regard to amending the existing procedures, I should state that there are very important considerations to be borne in mind when approaching this issue.  First, there is an obvious need to ensure that the identification process is above suspicion and able to meet any legal challenge which may be raised in the subsequent court hearing.  Second, while at all times taking into account what may be a traumatic experience for the victim, the rights of the suspect cannot be overlooked and every possible effort must be made to avoid erroneous identification.

      <P>My Department caters for the detention of <Col N="1760" /> male offenders aged 16 years and over and female offenders aged 17 years and over.  Offenders under that age cannot be sent to prisons or places of detention operated by my Department except in special circumstances provided for in sections 97 and 102 of the Children Act, 1908.  Such offenders may be sent to special schools.  These schools are the responsibility of my colleague, the Minister for Education.</P>
      <P>Recidivism rates among juvenile offenders committed to St. Patrick's Institution, Dublin in the latest year for which figures are available are given in the following table.  The information in respect of other institutions is not readily available.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Austin Currie, has been given responsibility for the co-ordination of policy in relation to children as between the Departments of Education, Justice and Health.  He will take special responsibility for the comprehensive new juvenile justice legislation being prepared at present.  One of the areas receiving particular attention is the question of pro viding the courts with the power to impose a wide range of communitybased sanctions and measures on juvenile offenders.  Such sanctions and measures coupled, as they often are, with supervision by the probation and welfare service tend to reduce the rate of recidivism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He will also take a special interest in the Government's various programmes for the diversion of young people away from crime at a much earlier stage.  The urban crime and disorder report is of particular relevance in this connection. He will be reviewing measures that have been taken, including Garda community programmes in various urban centres including Dublin, Cork and Limerick, the nationwide Garda juvenile liaison scheme and initiatives taken in the area of truancy and drugs awareness by the Departments of Education and Health. The importance of these measures lies in the fact that it is extremely difficult to achieve results in terms of diverting <Col N="1761" /> juveniles from a life of crime when they have reached the point where the courts have no alternative but to commit them to custody.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to inform the Deputy and the House that I have decided to proceed without delay with the provision of a new closed prison for 150 adult male offenders on the site of St. Patrick's Hospital, Castlerea, County Roscommon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Construction of the prison perimeter wall and associated works is well advanced and is due for completion <Col N="1762" /> about the middle of this year.  Provision of the main prison complex will be by means of a design and build package contract.  The Office of Public Works expects to be in a position to issue invitations to tender for this contract in the very near future.  Construction of the main complex is likely to commence in early autumn this year and to extend over a period of about 18 months.</P>

      <P>I am very concerned by the extent of the delays in the hearing of cases in the courts.  It was to address these delays that the previous Government gave approval for the appointment of two additional judges to the High Court, seven additional judges to the Circuit Court and five additional judges to the District Court.  The legislative provisions to enable these appointments to be made were to have been contained in the Courts and Court Officers Bill, 1994.  Under our Programme for Government we are committed to reviewing the provisions of this Bill to ensure that the measures it contains will adequately address the need to tackle the backlog of cases to be heard in all the courts.</P>
      <P>This review is being carried out at present and it will not be possible for me to indicate the number of additional judges to be appointed until this review is completed.  The review is, however, receiving urgent attention and I hope to be in a position to give a firm indication of my plans in this regard in the near future.</P>

      <Quest>the circumstances surrounding the suicide of a young prisoner and the attempted suicide of another over the weekend of 28 and 29 January 1995; the steps, if any, that are being taken to prevent the recurrence of such suicides, especially among addicted prisoners who are at high risk.</Quest>
      <QRef>[2825/95]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen) Nora Owen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should first like to say that I am very concerned at any loss of life in prison custody, and particularly by suicide. Every such death is a tragedy not just for the relations and friends of the deceased but also for the prison service. I intend to do everything I can to support prevention strategies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The person who was found dead in Mountjoy had been out on temporary release on 28 January 1995, in the company of a prison officer, to visit his mother at home.  He honoured the conditions of the release.  At unlock at 8.15 a.m. on 29 January 1995 the deceased did not respond and on examination appeared to be unconscious.  He was removed by ambulance to the Mater Hospital where he was pronounced dead.  There will be a coroner's inquest into this death, as there is in the case of all deaths in custody.  The detailed circumstances will be made known to the coroner.  However, the information at my disposal suggests that there is no basis at this time, for the suggestion that this death was a suicide.  Without wishing to prejudice the coroner's findings, and out of concern for the family involved, it should be said that present <Col N="1765" /> indications suggest that there were natural causes involved in this case.</P>
    <P>The person who attempted suicide in St. Patrick's Institution on 28 January 1995 was being held in a treble cell.  At 11.30 p.m. the alarm was raised by the offender's two cell-mates banging on the cell door.  Staff found the offender hanging in the toilet.  He was lifted down and the ligature removed.  The medical orderly attended to the offender until an ambulance arrived and removed him to the Mater Hospital at 11.40 p.m.  He regained consciousness the following day.  This attempted suicide was, fortunately, detected in time, and I should like to pay tribute to the cell-mates, staff of the institution and of the Mater Hospital for their success in saving this young life.</P>
    <P>I am reviewing the preventive measures in place to deter suicides.  I understand that 50 of the 57 recommendations of the Advisory Group on Prison Deaths which reported in August 1991 have been or are in the course of being implemented.  The report of the advisory group was published and is available in the Dáil Library.</P>
    <P>All deaths which take place in custody are, as I have indicated, the subject of a public inquiry in the form of a coroner's inquest.  The circumstances of each death in custody are also examined by the suicide prevention group in each prison.  These examinations cover the background and circumstances of each death.  Their objective is to identify, where possible, measures which might be taken in the future to contribute to the prevention of tragic deaths of this nature.  This is an important mechanism for absorbing the lessons to be learned in each case.</P>
    <P>There are, also, procedures in place for identifying and providing for offenders at special risk.  Such offenders are usually placed under special observation. However, we cannot escape the fact that where an offender is datermined to take his or her life, and not infrequently there is no prior warning of any such intent, the scope for prevention is limited.  The advisory group itself <Col N="1766" /> acknowledged in chapter 4 &ldquo;that it has to be accepted that if a person is sufficiently determined to take his own life, it is virtually impossible to prevent him&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Drug abuse, which has been mentioned specifically by the Deputy, is of course a serious problem in prisons and efforts must be made to deal with it. One of the unfortunate consequences of drug abuse is the risk of accidental or deliberate over-dosing.  The best way to avoid drug abuse is to prevent all illegal drugs coming into the prisons.  Steps which are being taken to keep drugs out of the prisons include a high level of staff vigilance, closed circuit video surveillance, screening of prisoners after visits and regular searches of the prisons.</P>
    <P>The policy document The Management of Offenders &mdash; A Five Year Plan which was published in June last and which I broadly endorse contained in chapter 13 a discussion of the drug problem. It also indicated that it was planned, through the medium of the departmental steering committee which is in place to implement the recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Communicable Diseases in Prisons, to carry out a full review to establish how best to manage the problems of both access to drugs and the treatment &mdash; rehabilitation of drug-addicted offenders.  I have asked that the work of this committee be speeded up so that we may assess the options available to us to tackle the drug problem in prisons.</P>

      <P>I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that income from this source would be normally chargeable to income tax under the self assessment system.  The amount which is chargeable is the net profit arising i.e. gross income less expenses which are incurred wholly and exclusively in earning that income. Under the self assessment system the person receiving the income should make a payment of preliminary tax on 1 November each year and also submit a return of income form by 31 January <Col N="1771" /> following the end of each tax year involved.</P>
      <P>However, in cases where the net profit is not substantial, the taxpayer, if already dealt with under the PAYE system, may at the beginning of the tax year request the inspector of taxes to reduce his-her tax-free allowances by the amount of the profit arising.  In this way the additional tax due can be collected through the PAYE system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> In line with the recommendations of the report Planning for the Future published in 1984 the North-Eastern Health Board is continuing to develop its community based psychiatric service.  This has led to a steady decline in the number of in-patients in St. Brigid's, as patients are transferred to more appropriate community settings.  It is anticipated that this policy will lead to a further reduction of in-patient numbers over the coming two to three years. The provision of a 26 bed acute psychiatric unit in Our Lady's Hospital, Navan will also contribute to the reduction of in-patient numbers in St. Brigid's, Ardee.</P>
      <P>It is also foreseen that heavy demands will be made on St. Joseph's Hospital in future to expand the service for the elderly with the provision of day hospital and other out-patient services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As part of its policy to improve and <Col N="1773" /> enhance its health services, the North-Eastern Health Board has commissioned a development study of its properties and lands, including St. Brigid's and St. Joseph's Hospital, to ensure its assets are used in the most appropriate manner to meet the needs and demands now being placed on the health services in this region.  The main conclusion from the development study is that St. Brigid's and St. Joseph's are buildings of a very high quality which have great potential for future use in the context of the developing health services of the Ardee area and its catchment.</P>
    <P>The management of the North-Eastern Health Board is presently engaged in reviewing the study in the context of its services plans.  In addition to its existing facilities for the psychiatric and geriatric services the board will also be seeking to provide facilities for general practitioners, dental surgeons, speech therapists, social workers, child care services, mental health services, different types of community nursing as well as paramedical services at Ardee.  The development study will assist the board in identifying suitable facilities for these services in the Ardee area.</P>
    <P>The motivation of the North-Eastern Health Board in commissioning the development study is to maximise the opportunities that arise from the physical infrastructure in Ardee and to link them directly with the service developments which will now be considered by the management team and the board.</P>

I propose shortly to make an order classifying the route as a proposed national road.  It will then legally be a matter for the NRA to make the detailed arrangements for the design of the project and any necessary public consultation.  It is likely that the route will be constructed as a motorway which would require the preparation of a motorway scheme, the holding of a public local inquiry and the carrying out of an environmental impact assessment. The Government is anxious that the project be completed as quickly as possible but, pending the conclusion of the detailed design and the statutory procedures, it would be premature to indicate a commencement date.</P>

      <P>I am providing the Garda with the necessary resources, in terms of personnel and equipment, to deal with the various issues confronting it, including drug-related crime, as effectively as possible. With particular reference to drugs, the following measures have been taken to deal with the problem: the co-ordination of all Garda drugs units on a national basis; the establishment of drugs units in <Col N="1783" /> each of Dublin's five Garda divisions and the co-ordination of their activities through the central drugs squad; the monitoring of the drugs situation on an ongoing basis and the regular review of Garda strategies to meet changing circumstances; measures towards the launching of a major Garda operation against drug dealing in the north innercity of Dublin; maintaining the closest international co-operation in the fight against drugs &mdash; in this regard, the European Drugs Unit is expected to play an increasingly important role in this objective, a liaison officer from the Garda is serving with this unit; and measures towards the full implementation of the Criminal Justice Act, 1994 which provides for the seizure and confiscation of the proceeds of drug trafficking.</P>
      <P>I also intend to bring to Government as soon as possible proposals designed to identify the best arrangements for achieving a cohesive and co-ordinated response to drug trafficking by the existing law enforcement agencies.  Taken together with measures to reduce the demand for drugs and to provide for increased access to treatment and rehabilitation programmes, I am of the view that the above measures represent the most comprehensive response ever taken in this State to deal with the drugs problem.</P>
      <P>Figures available from the Forensic-Science Laboratory &mdash; where all drugs seized by the Garda are analysed &mdash; show that 5,379 cases were sent for analysis in 1994.  Of the drugs analysed to date, records show that the Garda has seized 3,368 grammes of heroin.  Indeed, when all the 1994 cases have been analysed, it is likely that the figures will show that the Garda has seized over 4,500 grammes in the course of the year.</P>

      <P>I am very concerned about the drugs problem in some of the prisons.</P>
      <P>It is the case that in this country we operate a fairly liberal regime for offenders and their visitors and some of them take advantage of this to bring in illicit drugs.</P>
      <P>Deputies will be aware of my Department's view that it would be possible to modify the regime for prisoners in such a way as to virtually eliminate the problem. The revised regime, however, would have to include severe restrictions on free association between prisoners, more frequent searches of cells and prisoners, including stripsearches, the searching of all visitors to prisons, the erection of barriers between prisoners and all visitors to prevent personal contact, even with children, and the introduction of more intrusive technology. So restrictive and inhumane a regime would however, punish the innocent as well as the guilty and could cause irreparable harm to relationships with families, including children.</P>
      <P>Steps which are being taken to keep drugs out of the prisons include a high level of staff vigilance, closed circuit video surveillance, screening of prisoners after visits and regular searches of the prisons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The policy document The Management of Offenders &mdash; A Five Year Plan which was published in June last and which I broadly endorse contains in chapter 13 a discussion of the drugs problem.  It also indicated that it was planned, through the medium of the departmental steering committee which is in place to implement the recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Communicable Diseases in Prisons, to carry out a full review to establish how best to manage the problems of both the access of drugs and the treatment/rehabilitation of drug-addicted offenders.  I have asked that the work of this committee be speeded <Col N="1785" /> up so that we may know the options available to us to manage the drug problem in prisons.</P>

      <P>Lone parents are encouraged to seek employment while in receipt of a lone parent's allowance and they can continue to receive the allowance provided their income is below a certain level.</P>
      <P>When a lone parent takes up employment it is necessary to review his or her entitlement in order to take into account the expenses incurred as a direct result of the employment.  This involves a revised means test based on verified employment details.  Every effort is made to ensure that these revisions are completed promptly and that payment is restored, where appropriate, as quickly as possible.  The co-operation of the lone parent in responding to inquiries is vital in this regard.</P>
      <P>Lone parents are paid their allowances by means of personalised pension order books which are encashed at local post offices.  This ensures uninterrupted payments to the majority of beneficiaries whose claims are of a long term nature.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1788" /> My Department is committed to the development of a more localised service and to the provision of a range of payment options.  To date these developments have been aimed primarily at unemployed persons but it is intended that these payment options will be extended to other groups such as lone parents.  This will greatly enhance payment flexibility for people as their circumstances change.</P>

      <P>The national fuel scheme administered by my Department is available to people who are dependent on long term social welfare, health board or similar payments, who are either living alone or only with excepted persons and who are unable to provide for their heating needs.</P>
      <P>The former social employment scheme was subsumed into community employment with effect from April 1994.  Access to community employment is available to people, aged 21 years, or over, in receipt of unemployment assistance; all people in receipt of unemployment benefit for over one year; all people in receipt of lone parent's allowance for over one year; other special categories, such as referrals by the National Rehabilitation Board and persons combining a period on the live register with a period on a recognised programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1789" /> People who opt to participate in community employment leave the live register and cease to be social welfare recipients. However, under an arrangement approved by Government in 1994, social welfare recipients who participate in community employment and who qualify for a free fuel allowance retain that entitlement while on community employment.  People who do not qualify for an allowance under the conditions of the free fuel scheme do not become entitled to the allowance on transfer to community employment.</P>

      <P>My Department's view is that FÁS, through its national network of offices, is in the best position to provide preemigration advice and to outline the options which are available.  My Department has issued guidelines to FÁS concerning the operation of these services. The emphasis of these guidelines is to discourage unplanned and unprepared emigration.</P>

      <P>The statistical information on county enterprise boards sought by the Deputy is set out <Col N="1791" /> in the following schedule.  The data supplied are subject to change in the light of project decommittals or amendments to amounts already approved in individual cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the present procedures under the interim operating guidelines, as the CEB initiative is entering a more definitive phase following the publication of the European Union operational programme for local, urban and rural development, I am <Col N="1792" /> looking constructively at how the aims, objectives, functions, administrative systems and funding criteria of the boards should take shape.  I recognise the need to move rapidly to formally establish the boards as separate legal entities &mdash; com panies limited by guarantee &mdash; and to allow them operate flexibly.  Systems for managing the resources of the boards will be put in place which reflect the objective of decentralising public agency decision making and expenditure.</P>

      <P>In so far as disadvantaged areas headage grants are concerned the position is that payment has normally been made by way of an advance payment in the year of application with a balancing payment being made early in the following year.  The <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> commits the Government to moving progressively over the period of the programme to a position where headage payments are made in full in the year of application.  In 1994, the level of the advance payment was 85 per cent of entitlement compared to 60 per cent in 1993.  That trend will be continued this <Col N="1795" /> year with a view to ensuring full payment to applicants under the 1996 headage schemes during that year.</P>
      <P>The position in relation to special beef and suckler cow premium schemes is that EU regulations preclude any payment before 1 November each year and even then limit the payment to a 60 per cent advance.  Ewe premium payments are normally made by way of three instalments.  The rate of premium is fixed by the EU Commission and member states are precluded from making payment until up to seven days have elapsed from the date of publication of the decision fixing the payment date. Normally the first and second instalments are payable in July/August with the third and final instalment payable in the spring of the following year.</P>
      <P>Deseasonalisation premium payments are already made in the overwhelming majority of cases in the year of application. Payment of extensification premium is dependent on various applications submitted by a farmer in a calendar year and this results in payment having to be held over to the following year.</P>
      <P>I have made very clear my intention of ensuring the earliest payment of headage and premium grants to farmers. In this context I intend to take up at EU level the issue of changes to elements of the regulations which tend to delay payments.  I have already outlined my intention of introducing a charter of rights with the objective of putting in place a top quality effective and efficient service for farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the EU arable aid scheme, procedures are in place to pay applicants within the year in which applications are made.  EU regulations stipulate that area aid payments in the arable sector may commence in mid-October.  In 1994, over 97 per cent of payments were made before 31 December.  Outstanding cases involve problems and are the subject of ongoing correspondence with applicants.  Procedures for the payment of forestry grants are subject to ongoing review so as to ensure that there <Col N="1796" /> is no undue delay in discharging grant liabilities.  While the vast majority of grant applications are discharged within the relevant year some applications may be received too late in the year to enable processing to be completed within the calendar year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates)</NameTxt>
      <P>I see 1995 as being a very significant year for Irish forestry.  The key developments will include the following.</P>
      <P>A strategic plan for the development of the forestry sector to the year 2015 is being developed by my Department and will address the integrated development of the entire sector, from forest nurseries, through growing and processing, to timber end uses and wood-crafts.  This will be the first plan of its type in Ireland and will set the framework for the development of our forestry sector for decades to come.  I expect to publish the plan by the summer.</P>
      <P>This year increases in planting, timber production and timber processing are planned, with consequential additional employment being generated in rural areas.  A significant increase in the overall level of planting on the 1994 figure of 23,000 hectares is expected.</P>
      <P>On the timber production side about 2 million cubic metres was produced in 1994.  This year I expect to see a further increase in output from our forests and my Department will continue to assist in the development of an efficient and cost effective harvesting capability.  The market for such production will be improved by the planned expansion in the timber processing sector.  A total of 500 new jobs will be provided by the new oriented strand board project in Waterford.  This OSB facility will commence production in September next.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1797" /> The construction of the Masonite plant in Carrick-on-Shannon, which I announced last December, will commence later this year.  An average of 300 jobs will be provided over the anticipated 18 month construction period. About 330 people will be employed when the plant is in full production and an additional 100 jobs will be generated in associated activities.</P>
    <P>I will also be encouraging the increased involvement of farmers in forestry this year.  More and more farmers are becoming aware of the benefits of forestry as an income and asset option and as an alternative productive use of agricultural land.  This is evidenced by the fact that farmers now account for almost 80 per cent of all planting on privately owned land.  The very attractive planting grants and premiums will continue to be available to farmers in 1995.</P>
