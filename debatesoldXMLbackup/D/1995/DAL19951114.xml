    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1, 2, 3, and 8 together. As I said in the House on Wednesday last, on behalf of the Government, I put <Col N="142" /> certain proposals to the British Prime Minister some ten days ago.  They were designed to point a way of moving forward in the short-term on a path towards all-inclusive talks.</P>
      <P>On Saturday night last, I underlined my belief that agreement now needs to be achieved on a reasonable compromise on those issues still in the way of movement towards all-party talks through the twin track approach. Through the work of the international body, authoritative reassurance can be given on the issue of arms, thereby building trust that they will never again be used, or their use threatened for political purposes.  At the same time, the political track can be used to prepare for all-party roundtable talks within a speedy timetable.  It is only through dialogue between former antagonists that we will really begin to build a new era of trust and co-operation.</P>
      <P>I concluded my speech by saying that the proposals I have put to the British Prime Minister are reasonable and that unless we compromise and move from the preferred positions of the relevant parties, we will not get around the table at all.</P>
      <P>Regarding my meeting with President Clinton in Jerusalem, we had a very brief conversation on his forthcoming visit to this country and on related matters.  President Clinton plans to visit here on 1 and 2 December next. The programme has not yet been finalised by the White House.  As is customary, full details of the visit will be announced at the appropriate time.  I can say, however, that President Clinton's programme is likely to include a meeting with the President at Áras an Uachtaráin; an address to both Houses of the Oireachtas; the conferring, by Dublin City Council, of the Freedom of the City; and bilateral discussions with the Government.  There are plans for the President to visit the mid-west and the south-west on 2 December where he will undertake a number of engagements, before departing from Shannon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government warmly welcomes <Col N="143" /> President Clinton's visit, which symbolises the close and friendly relations between Ireland and the United States of America.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Why did the Taoiseach show such a dramatic change of heart <i>vis-à-vis</i> all-party talks?  Did he not tell the House two weeks ago that there was no point calling for talks unless everybody would participate in them and is he now satisfied that everybody would participate if talks are called?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am anxious to move forward on the twin track approach towards all-party talks.  I am anxious that there will be movement as soon as possible on the two parallel tracks.  That is what I emphasised in my speech at the weekend and it was consistent with previous statements I made, particularly in regard to the Government's responsibility to outline concerns felt by the Nationalist community in Northern Ireland.  The House will remember that I drew specific attention to that matter in response to questions from Deputy Ahern approximately ten days ago. That was the basis upon which I made my statements.  As I stressed in my speech in London and on other occasions, the Government has two roles.  One is the role of building a bridge between the two communities, Unionist and Nationalist, on the island of Ireland and that involves going out of our way to understand the concerns and views of Unionists and making sure that those views are heard and understood on this side of the Border.  It involves also, under the provisions of the Anglo-Irish Agreement and previous practice by Governments, making sure simultaneously that Nationalist concerns are heard and understood where they need to be heard and understood and obviously Britain is one such place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach explain why in a matter of two or three days he felt it necessary to make a major <Col N="144" /><i>volte-face</i> and why it was appropriate on the eve of Remembrance Day?</P>
      <P>Does he agree that the week prior to his London speech he seemed totally opposed to what Mr. Hume and Adams had agreed in their document of last week but the difference now seems to be that he is setting a target date whereas they believe we should have a firm date for all-party talks?  Many people think the Taoiseach's proposal will be a recipe for endless procrastination similar to what was seen in recent months?  Is this not a valid point?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The underlying thesis in the Deputy's question is not correct. As I said in the House last week, under the Anglo-Irish Agreement the Government has a responsibility in regard to the promotion of the best interests of the Nationalist community in Northern Ireland.  I take that responsibility extremely seriously and for that reason I have had a number of meetings with the political parties representing Nationalist opinion in Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>Under the Anglo-Irish Agreement that responsibility for the Nationalist community extends to ensuring that British public opinion understands the fears and concerns of the Nationalist community on matters such as policing, Orange parades and fair acceptance of responsibility for past injustices &mdash; acceptance by all those responsible rather than one side.  I believe it was appropriate to avail of a speaking engagement in Britain, one of the few I have had in recent times, to ensure that those Nationalist concerns are heard. Equally, I believe I have responsibility, especially when speaking in this jurisdiction, to ensure that public opinion here understands the concerns of the Unionist community.  There is a complementarity between the two roles and they are being performed in a reasonable manner.  We will bring people together only if we assure them their concerns are articulated and understood.</P>

      <P>I am sure the Taoiseach will recall giving out last week about the British press but it appears his officials did little else yesterday but brief them.  Can I take it the six point plan outlined in today's <i>Financial Times</i> is correct?  If that is so, does the Taoiseach object to publishing the document he said last Wednesday he would not even discuss with Deputy Harney or me.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Next week is now this week and that offer is available but has not been taken up.  As I have not read today's <i>Financial Times,</i> I am unable to comment on the accuracy of the reports to which the Deputy referred.  It is not appropriate for the Taoiseach or Ministers to comment on newspaper articles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Rather than putting on record the six point plan, I refer Members to that report.  Does the Taoiseach agree with reports that this is his most considered view to date on the position in Northern Ireland and that his speech on Saturday night represents his considered opinion on Northern Ireland matters and the peace process? Is that a fair reflection of his speech?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The speech was carefully considered and those who read it will know that.  However, it must be read in conjunction with other statements I have made which emphasise some of the matters contained in the speech, but which also contain matters of concern to the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Taoiseach's speech on Saturday night represents his most considered view since taking office, is it not remarkable that it does not contain a reference to the Framework Document?  If this is his considered view on the peace process and the state of play one year after taking <Col N="146" /> office, is it not final confirmation that, as I stated on a number of occasions recently, the Taoiseach is not interested in the Framework Document?  He signed his name to it in February but no longer has an interest in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry to have to correct the Deputy about what I said.  I stated that the speech I made in London represented a considered speech on my part.  I did not, nor would I, say it represents all my views on that subject.  As the Deputy correctly acknowledged, I was involved in the finalisation of the Framework Document which I regard as containing a carefully worked out agreed position between the two Governments as to a scenario in which the problems in Northern Ireland could be resolved.  It is also important to make the point &mdash; as was made at the launch of the Framework Document by the Prime Minister and me &mdash; that the document was not written on tablets of stone and was a matter on which we would welcome the considered views of the other parties not directly involved in its negotiation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I find it difficult to accept the Taoiseach's attitude since September.  The Tánaiste and the Taoiseach appear to have adopted a flip-flop approach to the matter in that every second week they place a different emphasis on it.  Will the Taoiseach explain why he told the House two weeks ago that there is no point in forcing people to come to talks and last Saturday he put pressure on for the holding of such talks?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry to have to repeat that the Deputy must not have read the speech I made in London.  I made it very clear that I would not regard it as particularly desirable to <Col N="147" /> start talks on a basis which attracted one set of parties but repelled another set.  I stated:</P>
      <P>If we fail to resolve these small contentions, (that is standing in the way of the twin-track approach commencing) the verdict of future generations will not be favourable for any of us who are involved.  In saying that, I realise that, for talks to be fruitful, we must have all the relevant parties at the table.  Indeed a formula for talks that attracts one set of parties, by repelling another set of parties, is not a formula for progress. Each side has responsibility for that.</P>
      <P>Deputy Harney might revise her question in light of that quotation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that the British Prime Minister is wrong in putting all the blame for the impasse on Sinn Féin, as he did on the airwaves last Sunday?  Is it not a fact that the republican leadership is committed to peace and political methods and has sustained the ceasefire almost to perfection &mdash; I have already condemned the punishment beatings &mdash; for the past 15 months?  Does the Taoiseach believe that the remit of the international commission should include or exclude the Washington 3 condition?  As it is totally unrealistic, should it not be dropped altogether?  This would appear to concur with the implications of the Taoiseach's speech on Saturday night. Does he also agree with John Hume's argument, endorsed yesterday in the <i>Belfast Telegraph,</i> that it makes little logical sense to outsiders to agree that republicans can be spoken to with 95 per cent of their arms but not with 100 per cent of them?  If the Taoiseach's proposals are correct, why did he refer to an assembly in advance of negotiations?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the first part of the Deputy's question.  I will quote again from my speech in London. I stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="148" /> The Irish Government has accepted the word of Sinn Féin and the IRA's commitment to the ceasefire.  We have taken that to mean that the ceasefire is not a tactic, but a permanent political commitment.</P>
    <P>In regard to the Washington 3 condition, it is well known that the Irish Government has not accepted the idea that a gesture is necessarily something that should be insisted on before the commencement of talks.  It is because we have not agreed with that view that we have advocated the idea of an international body or commission as a means of finding an agreed approach&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach drop the condition?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;to building the necessary confidence to get all the relevant parties to the table.  That covers the matter raised by the Deputy about arms.  It is also important that we understand the concerns of the Unionist community who have been at the receiving end of republican violence.  That is not to say the Nationalist community has not been at the receiving end of loyalist violence but there is concern in the loyalist community about any insistence on holding on to arms as of right.  They are concerned that there is inconsistency between that and the statements I quoted.  It is one thing for me to accept the word of Sinn Féin that it will not revert to violence but it is another thing for the Unionist community to accept it. We need the Unionist community at the table and that is why it is important, if an international body is set up, that Sinn Féin engage seriously in that process and seek through that body to give the kind of assurances that will genuinely attract Unionists to the table.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not enough to simply satisfy the needs and worries of the Republican or Nationalist community.  In Sinn Féin's engagement with the international body it must go out of its way &mdash; it will be difficult for it to do so &mdash; to put itself into the minds of Unionists who fear a <Col N="149" /> resumption of violence in light of their 25 years experience of it.  What is required if the peace process is to be a success is to seek to see the problem not as one's supporters see it but as the supporters of one's antagonists see it.  That is advice I would offer to Sinn Féin just as I would offer it to those who I hope will soon be involved in all-party talks.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>

      <P>In recent weeks the Taoiseach made great play of the fact that he does not see himself solely as the leader of Nationalist Ireland.  In view of his comments at the weekend, does he accept that any watering down of his role as leader of Nationalist opinion on this island would damage the dynamic which was the catalyst for the peace process in the first place?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Last week I said that I did not believe, and I hoped the Deputy agreed with me, that the interests of the Nationalist community were served by promoting initiatives that cannot command the support of the Unionist community.  It is important from the point of view of the Nationalist community that agreement be reached.  For that to happen we must have all the relevant parties in discussion with each other as soon as possible at the same table.  In promoting the interests of the Nationalist community in a legitimate and reasonable way I must ensure &mdash; in order for there to be discussion that can lead to agreement, which is the best protection for the Nationalist community &mdash; that the Unionists' view is also understood.  I have a dual role, to which I have already referred, on the one hand under the Anglo-Irish Agreement to make sure the Nationalist view is heard clearly where it needs to be heard, particularly in Britain and, on the other hand, to <Col N="151" /> build a bridge between the two communities.  That involves ensuring Unionist worries are understood and heard here.</P>

In regard to the northern part of this island my concern should not be confined to one section of the people and I hope the Deputy would not urge such a course on me.  In endeavouring to ensure Unionist concerns are heard and understood on this side of the Border I am fulfilling my responsibility to all the people who live on this island.  I hope the Deputy would not urge on me to be the advocate of one &ldquo;ism&rdquo; rather than that I should be the advocate of the interests of all those who live on this island.</P>

      <P>Would it be fair to suggest that the Taoiseach's change of heart was due to a sneak preview of the leader of the Opposition's Ard-Fheis speech?  Is he aware of the increasing concern both North and South at the political vacuum that has existed for too long and does he accept that the ultimate responsibility for starting the all-party talks rests with the British and Irish Governments?  Can he give any indication when he expects the talks to commence?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned about the political vacuum and have been for some time.  That is one of the reasons I regretted the unnecessary breakdown of the 1992 talks.  It could have been avoided by the Government at the time. I am glad to say efforts are being made to fill the vacuum.  We do not as yet have all party talks to fill the vacuum but we are working towards that objective.  I appreciate the Deputy's support in that direction.</P>

There is a flip flop arrangement for the future from one week to another and we heard it again today.

      <P>Does the Taoiseach accept there is a substantial body of opinion in the North particularly among moderate Unionists and Protestants that Unionists should talk directly to Sinn Féin?</P>
      <P>A number of business people in Northern Ireland have recently advocated that, and it has been highlighted recently in the <i>Belfast Telegraph.</i> An editorial last Tuesday asked whether it is time for Unionist parties to open up lines of communication with Sinn Féin and stated that meaningful discussions between Republicans and Unionists are needed.  A number of business groups have stated that there would be no sacrifice of principle if that happened. Does the Taoiseach agree with that view and has he put that point to the British Government, who does not seem to believe there is a moderate opinion among Unionists?</P>

I would advise them directly that it would be in their interests to open up discussions with the SDLP and Sinn Féin, and I urge the SDLP and Sinn Féin to be willing to open up discussions with the Unionist <Col N="154" /> parties.  In this context bilateral discussions are particularly useful because they would promote much understanding and perhaps certain issues that are being avoided would be confronted earlier than would otherwise be the case.

Progress is being made on that subject, which is very important to movement in the direction we need to follow.  We need assurances of that nature to make the twin track approach viable.  It would be better if Sinn Féin were to speak for itself on that matter rather than have me interpret its opinions for it.</P>
      <P>I have offered Deputy Harney and Deputy Bertie Ahern a briefing this week if they wish to take it up.  That might be a better way to brief the Deputies more fully on matters of this nature.  I agree with Deputy Ray Burke that these are matters of great sensitivity.  It is important that we move towards agreement and that we do not expose parts of the solution without exposing the whole solution to public gaze.  Any solution in this area must be balanced and therefore I should be allowed use a measure of discretion in the way I characterise the views of others.</P>

      <P>We have spoken to the Taoiseach about a briefing, but it is clearly unhelpful that the international press received a briefing, which is not far removed from the facts.  Does the Taoiseach agree that, since it is a little more than two weeks before the visit of President Clinton to Ireland, the US administration is increasingly dismayed and exasperated at the lack of progress in negotiations on the peace process and cannot comprehend the obstructive approach being adopted 15 months after cessation of violence?  It is beginning to talk in terms of international mediation in the event that the two Governments cannot solve the problems.  Will the Taoiseach outline his views in that regard?</P>

      <askee>Minister for Social Welfare</askee>
      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the increase in the number of long-term unemployed on the live register from 1 January 1995, to October 1995; and the plans, if any, he has to address this problem.</Quest>
      <QRef>[16739/95]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Proinsias De Rossa) Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Proinsias De Rossa)</NameTxt>
      <P>The increase in the number of long-term unemployed is of course a cause for concern and is an issue which the Government is urgently addressing. The Deputy will appreciate that my Department's primary responsibility is to provide a level of income support to such persons which will ensure that they do not become socially excluded.  A co-ordinated approach by several Government Departments is, however, essential to address the problem of long-term <Col N="157" /> unemployment.  My ministerial colleagues in the Departments of Enterprise and Employment and Education for example have significant roles to play in addressing it.</P>
      <P>The Government recognises and accepts the seriousness of the problem and is developing a comprehensive strategy which will embrace all policy areas and ensure that the necessary priority is reflected in activities of all relevant Departments.  A range of initiatives are being examined and developed and if the Deputy addresses this question to the relevant Ministers they will provide him with details of the measures which they are putting in place.</P>
      <P>In so far as my Department is concerned we are taking a pro-active and work supportive approach to assisting unemployed people.  A wide range of initiatives is already in place to assist the long-term unemployed to re-enter the active labour market.  A number of measures are also in place to encourage the creation of new job opportunities for the unemployed and to assist employers in hard-pressed labour intensive sectors.  Unemployed people can also avail of second-chance educational opportunities designed to enhance their prospects of obtaining employment.</P>
      <P>The back to work allowance scheme was introduced in 1993 as a pilot scheme designed to allow people who have been long-term welfare dependants to test employment and self-employment options and regain a foothold in the labour market while retaining some financial security for up to three years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even though the scheme has only been in operation for just over two years there are nearly 9,500 people currently in receipt of the allowance at an average weekly payment of £62.  This scheme has been a significant success and it will continue as my Department's principal incentive to the long-term unemployed to leave the live register.  I have just received an interim report of an independent evaluation of the scheme.  This is being examined in my Department at present with a view to <Col N="158" /> identifying any further appropriate enhancements and modifications to the scheme.</P>
    <P>I have a team of jobs facilitators in place in each of my Department's eight regions who are responsible for maximising awareness of this and other options at local level among employers, the long-term unemployed and lone parents.  Their role is to assess the needs of our unemployed customers, support them in seeking job opportunities and direct them towards the wide range of existing initiatives and options provided by various Government Departments, agencies, voluntary bodies and community groups.</P>
    <P>In addition my Department has in place a PRSI exemption scheme which grants exemption from employers' PRSI, which is 12.2 per cent, for two years to any employer who takes on an additional employee from the live register or a young person under the age of 23 years taking up their first job.  About 1,900 people have to date been approved for exemption under the current scheme which started in April this year.</P>
    <P>A package of measures was introduced in last year's Social Welfare Act to assist employers in the labour intensive sectors to retain employment and encourage all employers to create new employment.  The package included a reduction in the employers share of PRSI from 12.2 per cent to 9 per cent where employees earn £231 or less per week.</P>
    <P>A programme of second chance educational opportunities is also available to unemployed people.  These optional schemes encourage people who have been out of the education system for a long time to resume their education and increase their chances of obtaining employment.  At present my Department has approved just over 2,000 unemployed people to take part in third level education for the present academic year while almost 4,000 are available for the vocational training opportunities scheme which is operated through the vocational education committees.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="159" /> Additionally, I recently announced improved arrangements to facilitate long-term unemployed people who wish to avail of second level education opportunities.  Under the Social Welfare regulations such persons can participate in recognised second level courses if they are over 21 years of age and receiving a social welfare payment for at least six months.  Usually these are second level courses run by the vocational education committees which lead to junior or leaving certificate or city and guilds qualifications.</P>
    <P>I should also mention another employment-supportive scheme, the family income supplement, which is designed to support families with children in employment where the wages are low.  This scheme reinforces the opportunities for people to remain in employment where family income is not significantly above the level of the unemployment payments which, in the event of unemployment, the family would receive.  As a result of improvements made to the scheme over the past few years and other initiatives taken by my Department to promote the benefits of the scheme, the number of families receiving FIS payments has increased to almost 11,000 since mid-1993.</P>
    <P>Another area which I am tackling is the question of disincentives to work which may arise for some of those who are dependent on social welfare and other supports.  Measures in recent years include raising the tax exemption limits, exemption of the low paid from PRSI and the levies, and the improvements to family income supplement as already stated.</P>
    <P>The expert working group on the integration of the tax and social welfare systems is currently completing its examination of disincentives.  The working group was set up to identify the problems arising from the interaction of the tax and social welfare systems and to identify the steps necessary to achieve greater co-ordination and integration of the two systems.  The group is <Col N="160" /> expected to furnish its report within the next few months.</P>
    <P>I will continue to take a pro-active and work supportive approach to job creation and retention and to ensure that all relevant programmes administered by my Department are geared towards this objective.  I am confident that the measures which we have in place at present assist the unemployed in returning to the workforce and my Department will work closely with all relevant Departments to maximise their impact.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Minister is concerned about the long-term unemployed, but I am disappointed that he fobs off the problem to other members of the Cabinet.  I remind the Minister that collective Cabinet responsibility should bear on this matter.  Does the Minister not consider it would be a good thing to have the long-term unemployed figures available on a monthly basis, similar to all the other figures we have available?  They are only available on a six monthly basis, and if, for example, I were to ask for the most recent figures, in respect of October 1995, I would be told that they were unavailable.</P>

      <P>The detail of the reply I made to the Deputy would indicate that, far from fobbing off the issue to other Departments, my Department is involved in seeking to assist the long and short-term unemployed, to access whatever jobs are available.  With regard to the second part of the Deputy's question, I will investigate the feasibility and appropriateness of what he suggests.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 14, 49 and 59 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The back to work allowance was introduced in September 1993 as an integral part of my Department's programme of initiatives designed to encourage the long-term unemployed to return to the active labour force and has proved a significant success.  To date <Col N="163" /> 9,500 people who were previously long-term unemployed or lone parents have returned to real jobs in the private sector.  Approximately 5,900 of these are engaged in a variety of self-employment enterprises while the remainder are working as employees.  The average weekly payment being made under the scheme is £60, which does not attract income tax or PRSI.</P>
    <P>I am very pleased with the success to date of this scheme.  It has proved very attractive to the long-term unemployed and has encouraged the creation of new job opportunities in the services and indigenous industries sectors.  In particular it has demonstrated that there is a wide range of ideas and talents among the unemployed and this is especially evident in the number of new enterprises set up under the scheme.</P>
    <P>The scheme was set up as a specific incentive aimed at the long-term unemployed and there are no proposals at present to extend access to the scheme to categories of people who have not declared themselves available for work. The long-term unemployed will remain the primary focus for the scheme.  I should mention, however, that I recently concluded an agreement with the National Rehabilitation Board on behalf of recipients of disability benefit and invalidity pension.  Under this agreement my Department will consider granting exemption from the rules of behaviour to facilitate such persons to undertake appropriate FÁS Community Employment placements; part-time employment for rehabilitation or occupational therapy purposes with no income limit; certain training courses and education courses including those at second and third level.</P>
    <P>With regard to extending the duration of the scheme for a further 12 months, one of the improvements which I introduced as part of this year's budget was to extend payment of the allowance for a third year at a weekly rate of 25 per cent.  I am satisfied that this extension will act as a further important support to enable participants to consolidate <Col N="164" /> themselves in employment or self-employment.</P>
    <P>An independent evaluation of the scheme was commissioned earlier this year and an interim report has just been made available to me.  Preliminary conclusions show that the scheme is proving to be a significant incentive to the long-term unemployed particularly and is having a more effective impact than previous labour market programmes.  This interim report is currently being examined in my Department.</P>
    <P>All the participants on the scheme are still receiving financial support from my Department at either the 75 per cent, 50 per cent or 25 per cent rates of payment and they also retain entitlement to certain other secondary benefits throughout this period.</P>
    <P>In the light of experience to date, a number of ancilliary supports have been introduced, particularly for those who took up self-employment.  These include access to small loans, business advice and relevant training where these are not available from other sources.  The purpose of these supports is to maximise the likelihood of the long-term survival of these small enterprises.  It is my intention to consider further modifications to the back-to-work allowance in the light of the findings of the independent evaluation to which I already referred.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clohessy</NameTxt>

Under current procedure participants can retain their social welfare benefit at a rate of 75 per cent for the first year, 50 per cent for the second year and 25 per cent for the third year.  If participants are living in a partnership area, for the first year they can avail of an area allowance equivalent to 100 per cent retention of their social welfare benefit.  At the end of the first year such participants may transfer to the back-to-work allowance scheme <Col N="165" /> which enables them to retain 75 per cent, 50 per cent or 25 per cent of their social welfare benefit.  Effectively, a four year scheme is available to unemployed people in partnership areas, 100 per cent retention of benefit in the first year tapering to 25 per cent in the fourth year.  That scheme is working extremely well.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 15 and 145 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The free travel scheme operated by my Department is available to all people living in the State aged 66 years or over as well as certain incapacitated people in receipt of social welfare type payments.  The scheme provides free travel at off peak periods for eligible people on the main public and private transport services.  These include road, rail and ferry services provided by semi-State companies such as Bus Átha Cliath, Bus Eireann and Iarnród Éireann, as well as services provided by some 42 private transport operators.  Currently, <Col N="166" /> about 470,000 people qualify for free travel at an annual cost of about £31 million.</P>
    <P>The main purpose of the free travel scheme is to encourage independence, mobility and social integration among elderly and incapacitated people.  The scheme also provides a measure of financial support for both public and private transport services operating outside off peak periods and on marginally economic routes, particularly in the case of remote areas.  In this way, the free travel scheme has played a part in ensuring the availability or the continuance of public transport services in parts of the country where they might not otherwise be viable on economic grounds.  The provision of an adequate public transport service in remote areas not already covered does not come within the ambit of my Department's free travel scheme.</P>
    <P>Having regard to its objectives, the scheme is subject to regular review and over the years its scope has been expanded both in relation to the number of routes covered and the concessions made available to certain categories of recipients.</P>
    <P>There was a significant extension of the scheme earlier this year in relation to cross Border journeys, which has been a major success.  Since last July, the free travel scheme covers cross-Border journeys undertaken by passholders from both sides of the Border.</P>
    <P>The free travel companion pass introduced in 1990 has been another innovative improvement designed to enable free travel passholders to make use of public transport where otherwise they would be unable to do so by reason of being unable to travel alone.  The companion pass enables a person 16 years of age or over to accompany the pass holder free of charge.  The majority of companion passholders are either blind or mentally handicapped.  Also the companion pass has been introduced this year for existing passholders being cared for by a recipient of the carer's allowance.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="167" /> I have no plans at present to extend the scheme further.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for highlighting improvements to the scheme, especially its extension to cover cross-Border journeys, an initiative of the Fianna Fáil's national women's committee in which I was involved.  A proposal in that regard was put forward last September and I am pleased it, and others, were implemented.  My question relates to the inaccessibility of the vehicles used for many people.  The Minister stressed that the service costs £31 million, but it is sad that many of the 470,000 people who hold a free travel pass cannot gain access to the vehicles used in the service.  Given that a large amount is expended on this scheme annually, what pressure can the Minister exert to ensure its participants can use the service and to ensure that CIE will provide buses that are accessible to participants?  I am not referring only to people in wheelchairs, but to the elderly, those with temporary injuries and parents with buggies who find it difficult to board a bus.  As £31 million is being spent on the scheme, the Minister has an active interest in ensuring that such money is spent correctly to benefit those at whom it is targeted.  What can he do to ensure that?  Can he go so far as to threaten to withdraw the subvention to CIE if it cannot ensure that people can use its buses?</P>

      <P>The Deputy's last suggestion is not a wise one as it would have the effect of cancelling free travel for 470,000 people.  I am as concerned as the Deputy regarding accessibility to transport and I will undertake to take the matter up with our public and private service providers who are on contract.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's colleague, Minister Lowry, replied to me on ten occasions that he does not have <Col N="168" /> a role in ensuring that the public transport carrier provides accessible transport.  Therefore, responsibility for this matter falls on the Minister for Social Welfare who authorises expenditure for travel passes.  If CIE does not provide accessible buses, the Minister might consider threatening to withhold a portion of the payment or might suggest that he will divert some of it to the &ldquo;vantastic&rdquo; transport scheme with which I am aware he is familiar as he met people involved in it earlier in the year. Buses are provided by the centre for independent living.  The Minister might consider diverting the money to the &ldquo;vantastic&rdquo; bus service or withdrawing a proportion of the money if it is not being used to make the buses accessible. Many of the 470,000 people who have free travel passes are unable to use them because they cannot access the buses.  It behoves CIE to ensure that the buses are accessible and it behoves the Minister as the person who pays for the service to ensure that the buses are accessible or to withdraw or divert a proportion to the &ldquo;vantastic&rdquo; service.  Is the Minister prepared to consider that type of action and bring the matter to a head?</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I have already indicated to the Deputy that I will not consider that kind of action.  It would be counterproductive and might have the effect of destroying some small companies which operate, as I indicated in my earlier reply, in very remote areas and which depend on the money they receive from the Department of Social Welfare to provide free transport at offpeak periods.  I have undertaken to contact the various transport companies with which we have contracts to ask them about their plans for accessibility. If the Deputy wishes to table another question at a later stage I will inform her of the outcome of that inquiry.</P>

      <P>It has been an extraordinarily successful scheme.  I so not seem to have the figures on file but I will arrange to have them sent to the Deputy.  My recollection from discussing the matter with CIE officials is that about 700 people per week used the Dublin-Belfast train during the summer. The number of people from the North travelling to the Republic was roughly the same.  A considerable proportion were not simply travelling to Dublin but further afield.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 16 and 22 together.</P>
      <P>My Department is currently working towards taking over the administration of the disabled person's maintenance allowance scheme from the health boards and the legislative basis for this transfer will be contained in legislation to be introduced in this Dáil session.</P>
      <P>In the context of preparations for this transfer, a meeting was held on 12 October with national organisations representing people with disabilities to hear their views on the scheme and to discuss any concerns regarding the transfer arrangements.</P>
      <P>The organisation involved at that meeting were the Disability Federation of Ireland, the Federation of Voluntary Bodies Providing Services to People with Mental Handicap, the National Association for the Mentally Handicapped, the Mental Health Association and the Irish Wheelchair Association.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="170" /> Meetings were previously held with the National Rehabilitation Board and with the COPE Foundation in Cork who provide training and care for over 1,500 mentally and physically handicapped people.  These meetings have provided an important source of information and feedback to my Department to assist with the process of transfer and in considering the future development of the disabled person's maintenance allowance scheme.</P>
    <P>My immediate priority is to effect a smooth transfer of the scheme as it stands and to ensure continued efficient delivery of service to clients.  Once this transfer has been effected.  I will examine all aspects of the disabled person's maintenance allowance scheme to see what changes are necessary or warranted.  The position with mental handicap and how their particular needs in relation to income maintenance should be met will be addressed as part of this evaluation and review.  In this regard I will also take account of any recommendations emerging from the work of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been receiving promises from the Minister dating back to 23 March in regard to the review of the disabled person's maintenance allowance scheme.  As the Minister has met with the various organisations involved I hope the review is taking place.  Will the Minister confirm that he is prepared to address the issue of a non-means tested allowance for people with disabilities?  If a person with a disability takes up employment &mdash; 80 per cent of people with a disability are unemployed &mdash; they will lose their medical card and various other allowances because they have a certain income.  People who suffer from disabilities have extra costs.  We should move to a non-means tested allowance based on the extra costs of disability. Whether it is described as a disablement allowance or whatever it should be paid to those people.  If they can get a job and overcome their disability we should <Col N="171" /> not ignore the fact that they still have extra costs because of their disability.  I would like to see us moving in this direction, especially as the review is taking place.  Will the Minister confirm that he is prepared to take on board that issue?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will probably be aware that the number of recipients of disabled person's maintenance allowance is around 31,000 at a cost in excess of £100 million.  A non-means tested scheme would have enormous financial implications.  A case has been made by a number of organisations representative of people with disabilities that an element of the payment should be linked to the costs related to the disability since the costs of living independently with a disability are higher than if one does not have that disability.  That is one of the issues I will be addressing when we have the scheme in hand.</P>
      <P>My primary concern is to transfer the scheme effectively and efficiently to the Department of Social Welfare, to ensure it is delivered in its present form as effectively as it can be and to consider what improvements need to be put in place.  There are a number of differences in relation to means testing of disabled person's maintenance allowance which are different from the means test which normally applies in the case of unemployment assistance.  Most people in receipt of disabled person's maintenance allowance are single and live with their parents.  They would be at a financial disadvantage if we were to apply the normal Department of Social Welfare unemployment assistance means test to them because we take into account board and lodging whereas the disabled person's maintenance allowance scheme does not take that into account.  There are other differences also.  It is a complex area and one which I intend to seek to improve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My primary concern is to have the scheme transferred to my Department. <Col N="172" /> Bearing in mind that the scheme is currently administered by eight health boards all of which are different in various ways, including the way in which they maintain their records, there is a considerable task in bringing all those records together, having them on a single system and ensuring that the payments, once the scheme is taken over, issue on time to recipients.  This is the primary objective and when it is in place I will be more than happy to discuss with Deputies and others how the scheme might be improved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the broad idea will be taken on board in the review because research around the world has shown it would save the Exchequer money.  Perhaps the Department could take the point on board that the Exchequer would benefit if people with disabilities were encouraged to go out to work without losing their disability payments.  I appreciate the £100 million costs involved, but this move would not cost money in the broader context.  People should be encouraged to take up jobs which are available without losing their disability allowances.</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned comparisons with other schemes and I am concerned about an important anomaly in the disabled person's maintenance allowance, which perhaps could also be taken on board in the review.  When the spouse of a disabled person's maintenance allowance recipient takes up employment, all the earnings are deducted from the allowance.  It is different from schemes, such as unemployment assistance, where £65 a week is allowed before any deduction is made.  Perhaps the Department could take this anomaly on board when attempting to address the position because it affects many people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An important specific anomaly also arises in another area.  Persons aged over 16 years who are in a special residential school or some form of residential accommodation do not receive disabled person's maintenance allowance even though they may live at home with <Col N="173" /> their families for over 165 days a year on average.  They should receive a <i>pro rata</i> disabled person's maintenance allowance payment and perhaps this anomaly could also be considered in the review.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>There are many differences but I am not sure they are, strictly speaking, anomalies.  There are differences in how disabled person's maintenance allowance is assessed and paid under the system, which has evolved to suit the particular needs of the category of people involved.  The scheme was first introduced in 1954 by the then Minister for Health.  It has, therefore, been in existence for more than 40 years and, in common with most schemes of this type, it has evolved and developed as needs changed.</P>
      <P>The scheme was first introduced to pay maintenance allowances to disabled persons over 16 years of age who were unable to provide their own maintenance in the community and whose relatives were unable to maintain them. When it was introduced it was not intended to be payment on top of earnings, rather to assist people who were not in a position to earn an income. However, there is a provision in the scheme under which the disabled person's maintenance allowance can be converted into a DPRA, which is a rehabilitation allowance.  The health board transfers the disabled person's maintenance allowance payment to the training organisation and it then pays the person in training an allowance. This is usually an enhanced allowance where the person receives more than they would if they were not training and in receipt of disabled person's maintenance allowance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is scope in the scheme as it stands for people to take up training and work.  It is a matter of examining the position when the scheme is put in place and administered efficiently.  We could then examine how the differences between social welfare schemes and the disabled person's maintenance allowance can be ironed out or whether they <Col N="174" /> should be changed.  It may be the differences in some cases should be maintained.  However, I do not yet know the position, it must be examined.</P>

      <P>There are many issues involved in pensions.  My colleague, Minister of State, Deputy Durkan, has a keen interest in this area and is keeping a sharp eye on developments in the Department in relation to the report from the National Pensions Board.  The board made a wide range of recommendations to the Department and these are currently being assessed. I am not in a position to indicate what might be done about any element until the review is complete.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure the Deputy appreciates that no matter what is done in that area, it will have a knock-on effect and create demands and anomalies in other parts <Col N="175" /> of the system.  If any changes are made, they must be progressive and not create anomalies or injustices for other people in the system.  In particular, we must avoid a situation where people who, for whatever reason &mdash; perhaps they were not permitted to or did not think it worthwhile &mdash; may have avoided paying social insurance contributions for most of their lives could buy into the system at a very low cost but have the same rights as someone who paid contributions throughout their working life.</P>

If a person did not have a choice and had to compulsorily enter insurable employment and if, at the very least, they have half the number of years required, perhaps five years out of ten, they should be eligible for a <i>pro rata</i> pension, for example, 50 per cent.</P>

      <P>I am not aware of any insurance company which would give a person a 50 per cent pension on the basis of contributions made over five years.  It would be extraordinarily generous.  It would also be unfair to the millions of people who made contributions from their weekly wages all <Col N="176" /> their working lives to guarantee a contributory pension when they retired. The Deputy is demanding that a half pension should be given to somebody who has only paid contributions for five years.</P>
      <P>I am quite willing to consider the matter and I indicated that my Department is examining the recommendations of the National Pensions Board in relation to <i>pro rata</i> pensions, mixed contributions and a range of other areas.

      <P>It depends on the number of contributions.  If a person was in paid employment, for instance, in the earlier part of his working life but then became self-employed and began contributing to this new scheme for self-employed people, the earlier contributions would be counted, but it depends on the number of contributions he made and whether they were pre-1953 or post 1953.</P>

      <P>The manner in which they might be linked would depend on whether they are pre-1953 or post 1953.  One of the anomalies that emerged in this area concerns a person who came into the scheme when it was introduced and who now finds he does not have the ten years contributions. Such people are entitled to a refund of what they paid in but if it is found they had an earlier record of contributions, as the legislation is currently interpreted, no refund is provided.  That is one of the anomalies we are currently examining and hope to resolve.</P>

On a point of information, I am aware that the members of the self-employed pensions associations are anxious to meet the Minister and I would be grateful if he would indicate he is willing to meet them because they are a group of people with a particular problem.

For example, if a person was in the scheme for seven years, three years of earlier contributions could not be used to top up that seven years to make ten years.  It can be used, however, in the averaging in terms of the amount of pension.  If he has ten years contributions, earlier contributions can be used to enhance the pension but not to make up the ten years.</P>

      <P>The employers PRSI exemption scheme provides an incentive to employers to create full time job opportunities for the unemployed, lone parents and also for young people under 23 years of age taking up full time employment for the first time. Subject to certain criteria, employers are exempted from paying their share of the PRSI contribution in respect of additional employees for the first two years of the employment.  Recipients of disability benefit, invalidity pensions and disabled person's maintenance allowance can also qualify for the scheme provided they are registered with the National Rehabilitation Board.</P>
      <P>The current scheme commenced on 6 April 1995 and 1,900 employees have been approved for exemption.  A total of 3,465 employees were approved under the 1994-95 and 1995-96 scheme. Statistics of the number of disabled persons who have availed of this scheme to date are not readily available.  I hope however to have such figures available shortly and I will convey the information to the Deputy.</P>
      <P>Access to the educational schemes such as the vocational training opportunities scheme and the third level allowance scheme is restricted to lone parents and the unemployed who have been in receipt of an unemployment payment for at least six months.  Just under 4,000 have been approved for VTOS for the 1995-96 academic year with 2,019 approved for the third level allowance.  Under a recent arrangement with the National Rehabilitation Board my Department will consider granting exemption from the rules of behaviour to persons in receipt of disability benefit or invalidity pension to facilitate their attendance at education courses including second and third level.

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 20, 50 and 148 together.</P>
      <P>The improvements in the social welfare area, which I introduced in this year's budget, will cost £90 million in 1995 and £212 million in a full year. Considerable progress still remains to be made and my views on the inadequacy of the basic rates of social welfare entitlements are already on record. I consider that they need to be greatly improved.</P>
      <P>The EU Commission report, to which the Deputy refers, describes the social protection systems operating in the member states of the European Union. The report aggregates spending on health care, housing benefits and social welfare payments in calculating the <i>per capita</i> spend on social protection.  One reason the resulting <i>per capita</i> spend is lower in Ireland than elsewhere is the relatively small growth in retirementage population compared to other member states.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1986, the Commission on Social Welfare set out a range of minimum adequate income rates and recommended a priority rate as an interim target to be put in place pending the implementation of the minimum adequate rates.  The programme, <i>A Government of Renewal,</i> includes a commitment to <Col N="183" /> carry out a review of the rates recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare.  The Economic and Social Research Institute has started working on this and the review will be completed by mid 1996.</P>
    <P>The completion of the ESRI review will coincide with the tenth anniversary of the publication in 1986 of the report of the Commission on Social Welfare and will thus provide a timely opportunity to assess objectively the extent of the progress that remains to be made in this area.</P>
    <P>The review will consider the adequacy of the rates of social welfare benefits and allowances.  The study, with other reviews of the social welfare systems, such as that of the expert working group on the integration of tax and social welfare, will form the basis for the formulation of proposals for improvements in the social welfare system in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>The question of funding any improvements will be considered in the light of the resources available when the extent of the requirement is quantified and in the context of the commitment in <i>A Government of Renewal</i> to maintain and develop the social insurance system.</P>
    <P>As the ESRI, and others in earlier reports, have identified families with children as being at greater risk of poverty, I have taken a significant step towards addressing that issue in the 1995 budget.  The increase in child benefit accounts for 38 per cent of the cost of the 1995 budget improvements and almost 50 per cent of the full year cost.</P>
    <P>The extent to which I or any Social Welfare Minister can improve social welfare rates further will depend on the willingness of the public to support such increases.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister must find it exasperating to have to indicate that the basic rates of social welfare entitlements are inadequate, but what social welfare recipients want to know is what is he doing about this at the Cabinet <Col N="184" /> table.  Is he making any progress in securing the extra 5 per cent which we read about in the newspapers over the weekend so that social welfare recipients can look forward to a reasonable increase in the next budget?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am seeking to elicit some information.  Will the Minister be able to improve the position of the least well off in society, those in receipt of social welfare?  A commitment was given in <i>A Government of Renewal</i> that the ESRI would be commissioned to conduct a study.  The Minister has informed us that he expects to receive its findings in mid-1996.  As those living in poverty cannot wait that long, will he treat this problem with more seriousness and expedite the findings of the review?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that the Deputy was referring to the report in the <i>Sunday Business Post,</i> which as usual was a figment of the particular journalist's imagination and did not bear any relationship to discussions or facts of any kind.  I have improved the position of those in receipt of social welfare.  The reason for the massive increase in child benefit was that families with children have been identified as being at greatest risk of poverty.  The Government is updating the rates recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare so that they relate to the reality of life today and realistic targets are set, not ones which are ten years out of date.  A national anti-poverty strategy <Col N="185" /> has been devised based on the commitments given at the social development summit in Copenhagen to ensure that all governments and state agencies have regard to the effects of policy on poverty.  This has been the most active Government ever in tacking and alleviating poverty.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that his performance has been dismal? Social welfare rates were increased in the budget by only 2.5 per cent.  That was the worst performance by any Minister for Social Welfare in 30 years.  This time last year he gave a solemn commitment when negotiating <i>A Government of Renewal</i> that the ESRI would be commissioned to conduct a review.  He has informed us today that the poorest of the poor can look forward to receiving its findings in mid-1996.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know if there is any point in pursuing this matter further with the Deputy as he is not prepared to listen to what I have to say. The commitment to conduct a review of the rates is being honoured.  I have indicated when we expect to receive the ESRI's findings.  In the meantime we will continue to operate on the basis of the commitments given in the programme for Government and try to ensure that the poor are not placed back in the hands of the heartless, dirty dozen Fianna Fáil Minister for Social Welfare.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ColmMHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is trying to give the impression that the social welfare system has only been improved since he took office.  The child benefit scheme accounts for only a small fraction of the total cost of social welfare. Does the Minister agree that the increase in the last budget of 2.5 per cent was the lowest in 30 years?</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>It is pointless for the Deputies opposite to continue trying to reheat old arguments.  The statistics show that Fianna Fáil in office granted lower increases.  While considerable improvements were made in the social <Col N="186" /> welfare system by the former Fianna Fáil Minister, Deputy Woods, some of the greatest damage was done by another Fianna Fáil Minister, Deputy Charlie McCreevy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of the comments of Father Seán Healy of the Conference of Religious Superiors in regard to the fact that the gap between rich and poor has become wider this year in particular?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the remarks made by Father Seán Healy. He made them previously.  There are different ways of measuring poverty. Father Seán Healy chooses to base his measurement on the gap between the highest paid and the lowest paid.  There are other ways to measure poverty.  The Commission on Social Welfare put forward the view almost ten years ago that to enable people to avoid poverty, those dependent on social welfare payments should be in receipt of no less than £50 per week and possibly as high as £60 per week.  That is another measurement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have given credit to the former Minister, Deputy Woods, for bringing those rates close to the lower end of the Commission on Social Welfare recommendations but, as has been said, other aspects of the social welfare system need to be addressed.  There are poverty and unemployment traps.  The biggest problem of poverty, as study after study has found, is in families with children. The most effective way of dealing with that in the short-term is by increasing child benefit and I have increased it in a full year by £100 million.  That is not an insignificant advance in child benefit and in dealing with poverty.  I am not suggesting, nor have I ever claimed to suggest, that in the 11 months I have been in the Department I would expect to have achieved the elimination of poverty.  That may well take a generation, but during my tenure in office and the <Col N="187" /> tenure of this Government, the issue has begun to be seriously addressed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose taking Questions Nos. 21 and 34 together.</P>
      <P>The detection of fraud and abuse of social welfare payments is an integral part of the day to day work of my Department, which has a programme of ongoing specialist control activities under way as part of its drive against fraud, abuse and unwarranted recourse to social welfare.  There are over 500 staff working on these control activities, including specific investigation units which work at local, regional and national level within the Department.</P>
      <P>These units, one of which works in conjunction with Revenue staff, carry out inspections of employers in relation to their PRSI obligations, investigate cases of concurrent working and claiming social welfare payments, review customers' means for assistance payments and monitor their ongoing entitlements to social welfare payments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The savings attributed to control activities in 1994 were £118 million; the <Col N="188" /> figure for 1995 is estimated at £122 million, (£100 million to the end of October 1995).</P>
    <P>The value of overpayments attributed to fraud in 1994 was £11.4 million and the figure was £8.1 million to end October 1995.</P>
    <P>Since January 1995 some 4,845 cases of concurrent working and claiming have been detected.  The overpayments in these cases amounted to £2.08 million.  Details of the amounts recovered from these overpayments in 1995 are not yet available.</P>
    <P>Prosecutions are taken against persons who defraud social welfare schemes, and against employers who fail to honour their obligations under the PRSI system.  All cases involving fraud or abuse of the social welfare system are examined with a view to initiating legal proceedings.  This involves striking a balance between the need to vigorously pursue serious fraud and abuse, against a concern not to be unduly harsh in circumstances where a person's situation is such that recourse to the full rigour of the law might be inappropriate.</P>
    <P>The total number of prosecutions finalised in court in 1994 was 59, of which ten related to employer fraud. Convictions were secured in 52 of those cases, seven of which related to employers.  The total value of overpayments in the cases prosecuted amounted to £126,259.</P>

      <Quest>if he will increase the £10 private income limit threshold for payment of fuel allowance; and the cost to the Exchequer if the limit were increased to £15 per week and £20 per week.</Quest>

      <P>The aim of the national fuel scheme is to assist qualified householders unable to provide for their own heating needs.  To qualify for the allowance the applicant must be in receipt of a long-term social welfare or health board payment.  In addition, they must live alone, or only with qualified dependants, a carer, a person in receipt of a short-term unemployment assistance payment or a person who qualifies for a fuel allowance in their own right, and they must satisfy a means test.</P>
      <P>Applicants in receipt of means tested benefits are considered to have satisfied the means test.  Those in receipt of contributory benefits, including certain EU pensions, benefits or equivalent payments, may have a combined household income of up to £10 per week, or savings of £5,400, above the appropriate maximum Irish contributory pension rate.</P>
      <P>It is difficult to estimate precisely the costs of increasing the income limit for receipts of fuel allowance as requested by the Deputy, because of a lack of detailed information on the levels of income of those rejected on the basis of the current means test.  Based on information on the number of applicants whose claims had been unsuccessful because they exceeded the current limits, it is estimated that the cost of increasing the limit by the amounts mentioned by the Deputy would be some £150,000.  In addition raising the limit could also attract additional claims from people who had not applied before and it is not possible to quantify this factor.</P>

      <P>Will the Taoiseach allow Government time for a full debate on Northern Ireland next week?  We on this side of the House consider it would be appropriate to have a public discussion on how the present impasse can be resolved a week before President Clinton's arrival here when there will be much international focus on this country, bearing in mind that we have not had a full political debate here on Northern Ireland since the emergence of the Framework Document at the beginning of the year.  The Taoiseach will recall, from his period as leader of the main Opposition party, that the previous Government always allowed Government time for debates on Northern Ireland in recent years.  I reassure the Taoiseach that we are not interested in a vote on this matter and I will go along with whatever can be agreed by way of a motion to be worked out by <Col N="297" /> the respective Whips or by way of statements.  I will ask our Whip to talk to the Government Whip later today in this respect.</P>

I have not received any notice of this request from Deputy Ahern but, now that I have received notice of it here, I will of course ask the Government Whip to discuss the matter with the Fianna Fáil Whip.</P>
      <P>Effectively we have up to an hour's debate on Northern Ireland every week in this House at Question Time since questions on that subject are tabled virtually every week.</P>

I would be happy to accept such briefing but on condition only that it does not preclude me from asking questions in this House. If I can have his assurance on that point, I will be happy to avail of his offer.</P>
      <P>In relation to the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions &mdash; the need for that office to be accountable to this House having been raised by my party several times here &mdash; the irrelevance of this House has been confirmed now that we have become aware that on Friday next the Director of Public Prosecutions proposes to make himself accountable to the public by participating in &ldquo;Live-line&rdquo; presented by Marian Finucane to answer questions put to him.  Yet, Members of this House are not entitled to ask the Taoiseach any questions about that office or the new legislation granting the DPP immunity from the requirement to appear before the Dáil committees.  The Taoiseach should take on board what we have been saying about this office and ensure that the farcical circumstance does not arise in which any member of the public can telephone into a radio programme&mdash;&mdash;</P>

If the Deputy wishes to receive private information over and above that made available in this House, such information must remain private.  That is something the Deputy would want to consider <Col N="299" /> before coming to receive any private information.

This side of the House has agreed to take these Bills this week, although the traditional 14-day rule will not have expired in respect of one to be taken tomorrow or Thursday, it having been published only on Friday last.</P>
      <P>Since we on this side of the House have supported the efforts of the Minister for Enterprise and Employment in relation to Irish Steel &mdash; because of statements made by British Ministers, including their representatives on this issue &mdash; would the Taoiseach consider it worth while, as we do, raising this matter in his discussions with the British Prime Minister as I understand he will talk to him about a mini-summit over the next few days?  Perhaps he would raise this urgent issue since the passage of time is becoming dangerous for Irish Steel and its employees.</P>

      <P>On the matter of private information, as the Taoiseach knows, he offered private information on another matter today which I refused to accept because I consider it the duty of the Opposition in this House to render the Government accountable, through this House, to the public. Therefore, if the receipt of private information prevents us asking legitimate questions, we are not then in a position to receive such information.  In advance of Friday next will the Taoiseach explain to the public, through this House, why the Director of Public Prosecutions is willing to participate in a live radio programme and accept questions from members of the public&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The previous exemptions, that is, sovereign immunity, which existed for state vessels, including military vessels, will no longer apply.  The Government has decided that, even though dumping by state vessels is legally permitted under international conventions, it is no longer appropriate that Governments should be exempt from the restrictions imposed on others by these conventions.</P>
      <P>No state, and particularly no coastal state, can ignore its duties of stewardship of the world's oceans and seas.  It is incumbent on Ireland, and on all other states bordering the world's extensive and complex marine resource, to ensure that it is passed on to the next generations in a sound and healthy state.  We ignore this duty at our peril.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="304" /> Our knowledge of the physical, chemical and biological processes of our seas and oceans is far from complete. We do know, however, that they are fragile; that they are threatened every day by the effect of onshore and offshore activities; and that they are at risk of long-term damage from visible and invisible processes and actions, the impact of only some of which we fully understand.  Other more insidious damage is inevitably occurring; we cannot await the luxury of the establishment of clear casual relationship to farming and implementing protective measures.</P>
    <P>We must also strive to better understand the marine environment, the impact of man's activities on its health, both in the short-term and the very long-term.  Damage done now may be irreversible in the future.  Our policy, and that of the global community, is to take strong preventative and protective action now and, at the same time, further our understanding and knowledge of the marine resource.</P>
    <P>About 70 per cent of the earth's surface is covered by oceans.  As I mentioned, the waters and resources of the seas and oceans are fragile, complex and only partly understood.  While coastal states strive to protect their coastlines from misuse or abuse, it is only by way of the concerted and co-ordinated efforts of nations that damage, often insidious in nature, can be avoided.</P>
    <P>Owing to the nature of the marine system, local action alone will not protect national coastlines, still less the quality of the high seas.  We cannot, therefore, control deep-sea pollution without solid, unambiguous agreements between governments.  The OSPAR Convention provides a basic and effective framework for the protection of the marine environment.  It is aimed at an extensive ocean area of the north-east Atlantic which borders the majority of the countries of the continent of Europe.  It is an area of intensive economic and industrial activity where the adjacent seas are particularly threatened by pollution.  National measures must be combined with international <Col N="305" /> agreement to reduce the input of pollutants to the marine environment.</P>
    <P>As an island nation close to major shipping lanes we are particularly vulnerable to the effects of marine casualties, oil spills and wilful disposal of wastes in the North Atlantic.  Thus, we have a very special interest in promoting protection of the marine environment in the interests of human health, marine life and amenity values.  We also have a deeply principled interest in ensuring that our stewardship of our adjacent seas and oceans will be seen by future users of the resource to have been wise and farsighted.  In addition to the OSPAR Convention, we are party to a number of international conventions designed to protect the marine environment.  It is useful to review for the House the body of national and international law and in that regard for the House to put the present Bill into the overall context.</P>
    <P>Ireland became a party to the London (Dumping) Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter, 1972, at the same time as it became a party to the Oslo Convention.  The Dumping at Sea Act, 1981, gives effect to both conventions.  Unlike the OSPAR convention, the London Convention, applies globally and has been globally adopted by the International Maritime Organisation.  The terms of the convention are very similar to those of the Oslo Convention and the new OSPAR Convention.  In general, environmental protection trends set under the Oslo Convention and the OSPAR Convention progress to consideration and adoption by the London Convention.  The London Convention is currently under review, following the adoption by the North East European States of the OSPAR Convention in 1992.</P>
    <P>Ireland is also party to the Intervention on the High Seas Convention in the case of Oil Pollution Casualties, 1969, and its 1973 Protocal on intervention in cases of pollution by substances other than oil.  The Sea Pollution <Col N="306" /> Act, 1991, gives effect to this convention.  This Act enables the Minister, following upon a maritime casualty, to give directions for the purpose of preventing, mitigating or eliminating danger from pollution or threat of pollution by oil or any other harmful substance to the owner or master of a ship which is outside territorial waters.  Where the response of the owner or master of such vessels to such direction is inadequate, the Minister may take such actions and do such things as he thinks necessary and reasonable to prevent, mitigate or eliminate the effects of pollution.</P>
    <P>Ireland is party to MARPOL 73/78. The Sea Pollution Act, 1991, also gives effect to the MARPOL Convention and its 1978 Protocol.  The Act prohibits or controls the operational discharge of marine pollutants from ships through the establishment of operational discharge criteria and vessel construction and equipment standards.  Three sets of regulations made in 1994 under the Sea Pollution Act, 1991, on the Prevention of Pollution by Oil, the Control of Pollution by Noxious Liquid Substances in Bulk and the Prevention of Pollution by Garbage give effect to three of the Annexes which form an integral part of MARPOL 73/78.</P>
    <P>The Oil Pollution of the Sea (Civil Liability and Compensation) Act, 1988 gives effect to the Civil Liability and Compensation Conventions, 1969, and their 1971 Protocols.  The Act requires oil tankers carrying 2,000 tonnes or more of oil in bulk as cargo to hold specified insurance cover.  Oil importers receiving more than 150,000 tonnes of oil per annum into the country are required to contribute to the compensation fund established under the above mentioned conventions.</P>
    <P>The Merchant Shipping (Salvage and Wreck) Act, 1993, gave effect to the International Convention of Salvage, 1989.  It made an important further contribution to the procedures for dealing with maritime casualties.  An orderly system for handling the three main <Col N="307" /> phases of a casualty at sea was introduced, namely vessels in distress, salvage operations and, where necessary, the removal or rendering harmless of ensuing wrecks.  This Act strengthens the role of both the Department of the Marine's emergency service and its Marine Survey Office, where professionalism and operational capacity have been greatly upgraded in recent years.  In particular, rescue operations now have a firm legislative base.</P>
    <P>The Act places responsibility on owners for the removal or rendering harmless of their wrecks and has given a new role to public authorities in ensuring that owners of wrecks adhere to their responsibilities.  Wrecks of historical interest are also dealt with and the Director of the National Museum will have the right of first refusal on any unclaimed wreck around the coasts. Commercial salvage operations are often high risk affairs which need careful regulation if they are to strike the right balance between the interests of the State, shipowners, salvors and the environment.  The Merchant Shipping (Salvage and Wreck) Act, 1993 strikes such a balance.</P>
    <P>Plans are in train for accession to the 1990 Oil Pollution Preparedness, Response and Co-operation Convention.  This convention is concerned with preparedness and response issues related to oil pollution emergencies.  It will be expanded in the near future to include emergencies involving hazardous and noxious substances.  The convention is designed to facilitate international co-operation and mutual assistance in preparing for and responding to major pollution incidents and to encourage states to develop and maintain an adequate capability to deal with pollution emergencies.</P>
    <P>A Memorandum of Understanding between Ireland and the UK on co-operation-assistance in search and rescue and pollution control in the Irish Sea is being negotiated and in due course will contribute to our ability to tackle marine pollution in the area.  The <Col N="308" /> House will appreciate from this review that there is a strong body of law in place to deal with marine pollution.  This is kept under constant review, as is our operational capacity to implement it in an effective manner.</P>
    <P>The Bill will enable Ireland to ratify the Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North-East Atlantic, which is known as the OSPAR Convention.  In September 1992 the Government authorised the Minister for Foreign Affairs to arrange for signature, subject to ratification, of this convention.  Marine pollution in the area of the north-east Atlantic has been covered since the 1970s by two separate conventions in which Ireland has participated. The OSPAR Convention is effectively an amalgamation of these two conventions, namely, the Oslo Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping from Ships and Aircraft, 1972 and the Paris Convention for the Prevention of Marine Pollution from Land-Based Sources, 1974.</P>
    <P>The Oslo Convention is administered by the Department of the Marine.  The Paris Convention is primarily the concern of the Department of the Environment but the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications also plays a role in controlling the discharge of radioactive substances, including wastes, from land-based sources.  All EU member states, excluding Austria, Iceland and Norway are party to both conventions.  The EU is party to the Paris Convention and has observer status in the Oslo Convention.  Contracting parties to both conventions have signed the OSPAR Convention.  In addition to these contracting parties, Switzerland has also signed the Convention.</P>
    <P>The new convention takes account of developments since the original Oslo and Paris Conventions were signed in 1972 and 1974, respectively, and merges and consolidates their provisions.  The OSPAR Convention attaches particular importance to the need to increase our knowledge of the state and science of the north-east Atlantic.  Contracting <Col N="309" /> parties to the new OSPAR Convention have been preparing for the ratification of the new convention by agreeing on new scientific committees.  Preparations are under way for the completion of a quality status report for the entire convention area by the year 2000.</P>
    <P>Ireland and the UK will be responsible for the preparation of the report in respect of the Irish Sea, Celtic Sea, the area to the west of Ireland and the area to the west of Scotland.  These reports will comprehensively assess the health of our adjacent seas under a detailed set of criteria.  They will constitute an invaluable input to policy in relation to the sustainable development of the marine resource.  We are currently in consultation with the UK and Northern Ireland authorities about the management of this large but potentially extremely valuable undertaking.</P>
    <P>In this context I wish to refer to the question of munitions dumping in our adjacent seas, as the quality status report and the OSPAR Convention generally represent the most appropriate means to address this vexed issue. Up to now it has been through the Oslo Convention that the issue of dumping by the UK of chemical and other weapons from World War II has been pursued.  Such dumping is a matter of major concern to many of the contracting parties to the Oslo Convention.</P>
    <P>We will ensure that the impact of the dumping of chemical weapons off the coast of Ireland and the UK will be specifically addressed in the quality status report.  We have asked the UK Government to draw up a system of management of the relevant dump sites. The main aim is to ensure that we are made aware of the physical and chemical processes involved and their impact on the adjacent waters and the marine environment generally.  I can assure the House that we attach particular importance to this issue.</P>
    <P>It is also through the Oslo Convention that agreement has been reached globally on the termination of the disposal at sea of industrial wastes.  Such wastes have not been disposed of at sea <Col N="310" /> in Ireland since July 1993.  The Oslo Convention has also been instrumental in addressing the issue of the disposal at sea of sewage sludge.  Dumping by Dublin Corporation, Ireland's only authorised sewage sludge dumper, is being phased out and will be terminated by the end of 1998.  Alternative land-based methods of treatment and disposal are being developed by Dublin Corporation with that time-frame in mind.  This means the only substance of any significance being dumped at sea by Ireland is dredge spoil from harbour development and maintenance operations.  The Oslo Convention guidelines for the management of dredged material are taken into consideration in the disposal of dredge spoil.</P>
    <P>The Oslo and Paris Conventions have been merged with a view to a stricter and more updated environmental protection regime for the north-east Atlantic.  The new convention generally obliges contracting parties to adopt &mdash; individually and jointly &mdash; programmes and measures involving the use of best available techniques, best environmental practice and, where appropriate, clean technology, for the purpose of preventing and eliminating marine pollution and protecting the maritime area covered by the convention against adverse effects of human activities.</P>
    <P>The new convention provides a stricter marine environmental regime; establishes mechanisms for the protection of the marine environment; allows more in-depth considerations of ideas and proposals affecting the marine environment through an increased number of scientific working groups; operates on a &ldquo;precautionary principle&rdquo; where countries are asked not to license activities where there is any question of damage to the marine environment; and provides an arbitration mechanism for the settlement of disputes involving transboundary pollution.</P>
    <P>This Government is anxious to ratify the convention as soon as possible.  It is seen as essential that we equip ourselves with the powers to implement urgently and effectively the marine pollution <Col N="311" /> control regime in the convention.  It is also essential that we as a nation are not seen to be behind in ratifying this convention.</P>
    <P>An important objective in ratifying the convention is to open the way for the possibility of initiating arbitration between Ireland and the UK arising from the increased discharges from Sellafield since the start-up of THORP. As Deputies are no doubt aware, this Government is opposed to the reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel and is seeking the closure of the Sellafield-THORP plant and the halting of any future expansion.  An interdepartmental committee on the Irish Sea has been established in order to progress Government policy on Sellafield and the Irish Sea in line with the commitments given in A Government of Renewal policy document.</P>
    <P>The operation of the THORP plant results in the transportation near our shores of nuclear materials.  I have very serious concerns regarding this matter. We are not alone in this concern.  Small island states and other coastal states world wide have been vocal in international fora with regard to the transportation of such material.  This led to the adoption in 1993 of the International Maritime Organisation Code on the Safe Carriage of Irradiated Nuclear Fuel, Plutonium and High Level Radioactive Wastes in Flasks on Board Ships &mdash; the INF Code.  The code lays down standards for construction, equipment and operation of ships engaged in the carriage of irradiated nuclear fuel, plutonium and high level radioactive wastes.</P>
    <P>Ireland has consistently argued for the following requirements to be included in the INF code: reporting arrangements; consultation with coastal states; routing restrictions-passage planning; marine emergency response plans and salvage arrangements in the event of an accident.</P>
    <P>I have met the Secretary General of the IMO to whom I have expressed Ireland's concerns.  He and a number of <Col N="312" /> IMO member states have supported Ireland's view and as a result a special meeting of the IMO is being set up to progress the expansion of the INF code. This morning I made a special presentation to the assembly of the IMO pointing out the deficiencies of the code and requesting that they be addressed.  I will be doing everything in my power to ensure that the transportation of nuclear material by ships is strictly controlled.</P>
    <P>Three Departments of State have obligations under the OSPAR Convention: the Department of the Environment is responsible for the prevention of marine pollution from land-based sources; the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications is responsible for the prevention of pollution from offshore installations and for the discharge at sea of radioactive substances, and the Department of the Marine is responsible for the prevention of marine pollution by dumping at sea.</P>
    <P>Sufficient statutory support to implement the provisions of the convention on pollution from land-based sources already exists in the Local Government (Water Pollution) Acts, 1977 to 1990, the Air Pollution Act, 1987 and the Environmental Protection Act, 1992.  An updated legislative framework for provisions relating to discharges or emissions from offshore installations and pipelines, abandonment of offshore installations and placement of disused offshore installations and pipelines in the sea for a purpose other than originally intended is being brought forward by the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications by way of the Energy (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill and is awaiting Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the convention relating to dumping at sea require that new domestic legislation be enacted to give full effect to the convention.  Legal advice is that the most appropriate way to amend the Dumping at Sea Act, 1981, is to repeal the existing legislation and to enact a new Dumping at Sea Bill. We have taken this opportunity to carry <Col N="313" /> out a full review of dumping at sea legislation.  I will advise Deputies of the key provisions of the Bill before the House and comment on the extent to which they will enhance the provisions of the Dumping at Sea Act, 1981.  The term &ldquo;dumping&rdquo; is redefined to bring into the regulatory net all forms of dredging techniques developed since the 1981 Act and includes deliberate disposal at sea of vessels or aircraft as well as substances or material from or in conjunction with a vessel and aircraft.</P>
    <P>The &ldquo;maritime area&rdquo; to which the Bill applies has been extended beyond the 12 mile territorial seas limit, to 200 miles and, in some cases, up to 350 miles off the Irish coast depending on the extent of our Continental Shelf.  Ireland expects to ratify the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, 1982 in the near future and, under the terms of that convention, contracting parties may exercise control of the maritime environment out to those limits.  This is a major development.  Up to now Ireland was in a position to regulate out to 12 miles only.  Our control over the marine environment will be greatly enhanced by this provision.</P>
    <P>The Dumping at Sea Act, 1981 prohibits the dumping of substances or material except in accordance with a permit issued by the Minister or a contracting party in the OSPAR Convention if it is in its territorial waters.  In line with the new convention the Bill before the House clearly specifies what may not be dumped at sea, thus doing away with any misconceptions or ambiguities.</P>
    <P>The Bill strictly prohibits the incineration of substances or material at sea; the disposal at sea of offshore installations or of substances or material from any such installations; the disposal at sea of low, intermediate and high level radioactive substances or material and the disposal at sea of toxic, harmful or noxious substances.</P>
    <P>A permit may be granted for the disposal of radioactive substances or material below low level subject to consultation between the Minister for the Marine and the Radiological Protection <Col N="314" /> Institute of Ireland.  This is intended to allow the dumping of materials, such as dredge spoil, which are found to contain trace or negligible levels of radioactivity.  The House may be aware that all substances and material contain some level of naturally occurring radioactivity.  The Radiological Protection Institute is guided by the European Commission and the International Atomic Energy Agency in defining below low levels.</P>
    <P>The 1992 OSPAR Convention prohibits the dumping of wastes or other matter from offshore installations.  It allows dumping of an offshore installation under a permit issued by the competent authority of the relevant contracting party on a case-by-case basis. No permit for an offshore installation shall be issued, however, if the disused installation contains substances likely to be deleterious to human health, living marine resources or would damage amenities or interfere with other uses of the sea.</P>
    <P>Last May, following pressure from the majority of contracting parties to the Oslo Convention, Shell UK Ltd. decided not to proceed with the proposed disposal at sea of the offshore installation, the <i>Brent Spar.</i> At the OSPAR Commission meeting in June, agreement was reached by the majority of contracting parties to the Convention on a moratorium on the disposal at sea of decommissioned offshore installations until a formal decision was adopted, by 1997 at the latest.  The agreement was a positive step towards ensuring that proposals to dump decommissioned installations such as the <i>Brent Spar</i>, of which there are approximately 60 in the North Sea awaiting disposal, would be avoided in future.  I am pleased that the joint governmental action of the majority of contracting parties brought such effective pressure to bear on a proposal which was fundamentally unacceptable.  In order to ensure that no such dumping takes place in our maritime area, the Bill will specifically prohibit the disposal at sea of offshore installations.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="315" /> Thus, the Bill does not envisage the issue of permits in respect of offshore installations or radioactive substances, other than those having essentially background levels, and other toxic, harmful or noxious substances.</P>
    <P>The disposal at sea of all other substances or material is also prohibited, except in accordance with a permit issued by the Minister for the Marine and in full compliance with any restrictions, requirements or conditions laid down by the Minister and detailed in the said permit.  The Minister is empowered to revoke a permit issued.  At this stage I would like Deputies to gain an appreciation of how seriously the Minister and his officials will approach applications for permits.</P>
    <P>Currently all applications for permits under the 1981 Dumping at Sea Act are referred to the Ministers for the Environment, Enterprise and Employment and Transport, Energy and Communications for their observations. Applications are rigorously assessed by the Department's marine licence vetting committee.  The committee, a multi-disciplinary one, is composed of Department of the Marine and Central Fisheries Board officials with expertise in biology, chemistry, oceanography, navigation and engineering disciplines. Effectively assessment of each application has been based on the criteria governing the issue of a permit as outlined in the First Schedule to the Bill and on the exceptions to the prohibition on dumping as shown in Annex 2 to the OSPAR Convention.  For the convenience of prospective applicants, this is outlined and given legislative status in the Second Schedule to the Bill.  Briefly, the criteria used include the characteristics and composition of the substance or material to be dumped; the characteristic of the dumping site and the proposed method of disposal; the extent to which the dumping might interfere with fish and shellfish cultures, shipping, recreation or navigation; the availability <Col N="316" /> of suitable land-based alternatives; proper certification of the disposal vessel and crew and the possibility of an impact on the marine environment.  In practice, dumping does not take place from aircraft.</P>
    <P>Where deemed necessary, applicants are requested to undertake analyses or surveys of both the waste and the dump site, at their own expense.  If the proposed site is found unsuitable for any reason alternative sites are investigated; if the waste is found unsuitable for sea disposal a permit is refused.</P>
    <P>On the basis of the committee's assessment, its recommendations to the Minister and the views of other Ministers, the Minister decides to grant or refuse a permit.  I am happy that the assessment procedure guards against any substance or material likely to have a negative impact on the marine environment being dumped at sea.</P>
    <P>The 1981 Dumping at Sea Act exempts state ships and vessels from its provisions.  The Oslo and OSPAR Conventions provide that &ldquo;nothing in these Conventions shall abridge the sovereign immunity to which certain vessels are entitled under international law&rdquo;.  At the June meeting of the OSPAR Commission, the majority of contracting parties, including Ireland, agreed that notwithstanding this sovereign immunity clause, the provisions of the convention should apply to all vessels and aircraft including those entitled to sovereign immunity.  The UK has given a commitment to cease dumping of redundant munitions at sea.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned, I strongly believe that the same regulatory provisions should apply to all who want to dump at sea.  Therefore, I have removed the exemption provision from the terms of the Bill, thus ruling out any dumping of munitions off the Irish coast.</P>
    <P>The Bill empowers the Minister to appoint authorised officers to enforce the provisions of the Bill and makes it an offence to obstruct or interfere with an authorised officer in the course of the officer's performance of functions. Provision has been included to give the <Col N="317" /> Naval Service new enforcement powers. It makes provision for the prosecution of offences and specifies the penalties for such offences.  Up to now the Naval Service had no powers in relation to enforcement.  The Navy is in a strong position to detect any unlawful dumping at sea.</P>
    <P>Penalties for offences under the Bill have been increased.  The Bill provides that the maximum penalties for an offence under this Act shall be, on summary conviction, a fine not exceeding £1,500 or 12 months imprisonment, or both and on conviction on indictment, a fine of such amount as the court deems appropriate taking into account the cost of remedial action or five years' imprisonment or both.</P>
    <P>It is my hope that the possibility of substantial penalties on conviction will be an effective deterrent to would-be offenders.  It is our intention to invoke the full rigours of the law where offenders are not so deterred.</P>
    <P>The Bill represents decisive and strong action on the part of the Government in tackling the threat posed by the dumping of toxic and environmentally damaging substances.  I have stated from the outset that the protection of our valuable marine resource is one of my key objectives.  I am determined to afford it the strongest and fullest protection.  The Bill sets new standards for international marine environment management and gives a firm lead to our European partners.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>This evening the House has an opportunity to deal with the last rung in the ladder in catering for, and introducing legislation to deal with sea, land, air and water pollution. For the past nine or ten years a series of Bills was introduced to protect and enhance the environment.  Although I do not predict the Minister will achieve all he set out to achieve under the Bill, I am glad it has been introduced and we will do our best to improve it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="318" /> All life began in the oceans and the oxygen in the atmosphere on which all respiratory animals depend is produced in oceans by the plant plankton.  The ocean is an enormous source of food and recreation and for far too long has been treated as a sink, a place into which almost anything, such as nuclear and chemical waste, detergents, insecticides, pesticides and animal, human and industrial waste, can be flushed.  For far too long the public and Governments all over the world have ignored this reality. The seas and oceans are treated as if they are infinite and inexhaustible.</P>
    <P>However, as our knowledge develops we are beginning to understand that the earth is fragile and that each succeeding generation, in its ambition to represent itself, its talents and achievements, must not compromise future generations from doing likewise.  Unfortunately, in many cases reaction, legislation and Government activity has come too late.</P>
    <P>We are frequently told about the level of radioactivity in the Irish Sea.  One of the criteria by which this Bill can be judged is its effectiveness to enable the Government to close THORP at Sellafield.  The Minister stated he hopes to be able to use the arbitration rule on foot of this legislation.  We want this legislation to have the teeth to bring this matter to a head and bring to an end the life threatening insidious problems associated with the discharge of nuclear waste into the Irish Sea.  It is too close for comfort.  The matter must be addressed aggressively and successfully and legislation that deals with dumping at sea must make it a priority.</P>
    <P>We have been frequently rocked by new information about the dumping of conventional and chemical munitions in the north-east Atlantic and elsewhere following the Second World War.  One of the most blatant and unacceptable features of such action is that so little information is made available for a long period afterwards.  It is an indictment of Governments and societies that we can allow a country to dump in that fashion without the knowledge of the Irish Government.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="319" /> Recently in reply to a parliamentary question the Minister of State said there were 22 sites where conventional munitions were dumped and 24 sites where chemical munitions were dumped.  He stated there will be joint monitoring and management of these sites.  If the shadow of the past in terms of lack of information is anything to go by it is hard to know how we can trust joint management of that kind.  The OSPAR Convention provides for a quality status report to be undertaken and we look forward to what will emerge from that.</P>
    <P>Concern was expressed about the casings in which these substances are dumped.  The scientific evidence seems to indicate we should leave them as they are as it would be more hazardous to tamper with or move them.  I am not a scientist but if it is as safe as we are told why was it necessary to be so secretive? Why could it not be sealed and deposited on the spot instead of being brought to our coastline and dumped?  I urge the Minister not only to be vigilant but to ensure that the root of the problem is exposed and brought before the House as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>We had hardly come to grips with that news when there were reports of dumping of nuclear waste in the Beaufort Dyke.  I understand the British authorities have denied that but it is important to clarify the matter and make known the conditions under which the dumping was made.  It is crucial that no stone is left unturned in getting that information.  The Government must take a practical, tough stand and get all the information for us.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister that, on their own, Governments cannot monitor or ensure 70 per cent of the earth's surface is protected.  This will only happen if they work with the utmost co-operation.  As the global scale of these problems and the threat to life and ecosystems becomes known, the more it becomes necessary to have international conventions under which contracting parties agree to fundamental principles.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="320" /> When Minister for the Environment in 1992 I was glad to have the opportunity to lead the Irish delegation to Paris on the occasion of the signing of the convention.  When this Bill is passed the Government will be in a position to ratify that convention.  It will apply to the maritime area as defined under Article 1 for the protection of the marine environment in the north-east Atlantic.  The area includes the internal waters and territorial seas under Irish jurisdiction and I welcome the fact that this Bill extends the area to be protected.  I hope surveillance will be enhanced to ensure that is a reality.</P>
    <P>The general obligations under Article 2 require contracting parties to take all possible steps to prevent and eliminate pollution defined as the introduction by man of substances or energy into the maritime area which results or is likely to result in hazards to human health, harm to living resources and marine ecosystems, damage to amenities or interference with other legitimate uses of the sea and the measures necessary to protect the maritime area against the adverse effect of human activities.  Programmes and measures must be adopted individually and jointly by contracting parties in pursuance of these obligations.  Best available techniques and best environmental practice, including, where appropriate, clean technology, must be incorporated in these programmes and measures which must apply the precautionary principle and the polluter pays principle.  When practicable, parties must be required to restore marine areas affected by pollution.</P>
    <P>The general obligations are further developed in a number of articles and annexes dealing with specific sources of pollution &mdash; land based sources, dumping and incineration of waste or other matters at sea, offshore sources relating to the exploration and exportation of liquid gases and hydrocarbons.  Annex II prohibits incineration in a maritime area and also the dumping of waste, apart from a few exceptions.  The latter permits the dumping of sewage sludge <Col N="321" /> until 31 December 1998.  Dublin Corporation must deal with that problem soon.  The only sewage sludge dumped in the sea at present is from Dublin sources and it is vitally important to develop recycling and other alternative systems in order to live up to that aspect of the convention.</P>
    <P>Contracting parties will also be required to undertake and publish at regular intervals joint assessments of the quality and status of the marine environment and evaluate the effectiveness of measures taken and proposed to protect it.  Provision is made for the adoption of further annexes in respect of pollution sources not otherwise addressed under the convention to the extent that such pollution is not effectively dealt with by the other international organisations or conventions.</P>
    <P>Contracting parties will also be required to establish complementary or joint programmes of scientific or technical research.  They are obliged to make available to any person information on the state of the maritime area, activities affecting it and measures taken to implement the convention subject to the right to withhold information in specified circumstances and enter into consultation for the purposes of renegotiating a co-operation agreement where transboundary pollution is likely to prejudice the interests of contracting parties.  Implementation of the convention will be supervised by the commission made up of representatives of the contracting parties and a permanent secretariat established to deal with administrative matters.</P>
    <P>Since the 1970s marine pollution in the north-east Atlantic has been covered by two conventions in which Ireland participated together with 13 other parties.  These conventions are the 1972 Oslo Convention on the prevention of marine pollution by dumping from ships and aircraft and the 1974 Paris Convention for the prevention of marine pollution from land-based sources.  Before I took office negotiations were in progress to merge these conventions with a view to having a <Col N="322" /> stricter and updated environmental protection regime for the north east Atlantic.  I was happy to lead the Irish delegation in 1992 and to help in reaching a favourable outcome.  Ireland will be required to contribute to the annual operation budget of the commission established under the convention.</P>
    <P>Ireland, with some support, took a strong position in favour of prohibiting all marine dumping of radioactive waste.  The UK and France were opposed to a permanent ban on the dumping of low and intermediate level radioactive waste.  They were prepared to accept a temporary ban only on such wastes until the year 2000 when the prohibition would have to be reviewed.  The London Dumping Convention, 1972, which has worldwide application, is the principal international instrument for control of marine dumping of radioactive waste.  Under that convention the dumping of high level radioactive waste is prohibited.  Since 1983 a voluntary <i>ad hoc</i> moratorium has been placed on the dumping of low and intermediate level waste.  Prior to that moratorium several countries &mdash; France, the UK, the Netherlands, Switzerland and Belgium &mdash; carried out dumping for 130 miles south-west of the Irish coast.</P>
    <P>The UK and France have an upcoming problem with the disposal of decommissioned reactors and old nuclear powered submarines.  They have not said positively that they will dump such radioactive material, but they consider sea disposal as a preferred alternative to land disposal and are determined to keep that option open.  Their position is a reflection of the technical and political difficulties in finding suitable means and publicly acceptable locations for permanent disposal of radioactive waste on land.  An opt-out provision sought by the UK and France would have meant that, against the background of existing hazards from Sellafield and other nuclear installations to the east as well as hazards further east, particularly central and eastern Europe, there would be a possibility of resumption of dumping off south-west Ireland in a few years.  It <Col N="323" /> is likely that dumping will be resumed at a site previously used, creating an increased source of contamination to the west of the country.</P>
    <P>There is considerable dissatisfaction among environmental organisations at what is perceived as the Government's inability to secure the closure of Sellafield and THORP and the community inspection force for nuclear installations.  A threat of dumping of radioactive substances south-west of Ireland, in view of previous dumping by the UK and its strong intention to keep these options open, will only add to public concern and dissatisfaction.  It is crucially important in the context of these provisions that we ensure not only an end to discharges from these plants but that we never again have to face the prospect of being told years later what British Governments do with old nuclear chemical or other munitions.</P>
    <P>I do not think there will be much objection to the main provisions in the Bill.  The measure that will have to be teased out most is that dealing with the granting of future permits by the Minister for the Marine in consultation with his colleagues.  We will seriously consider putting down effective amendments to ensure an absolute guarantee of better protection.  The Bill provides for the imposition, on summary conviction, of a fine not exceeding £1,500 or 12 months imprisonment, or both.  In view of the seriousness of this matter, perhaps the fine may be increased, but we will deal with that matter on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I wish to deal with aspects that are not directly relevant to this legislation but are vitally important to the way we address the questions.  Sea disposal of hazardous waste is unnacceptable.  In the past the attitude was &ldquo;out of sight, out of mind,&rdquo; but most people are concerned that an event which may have taken place years ago may produce problems, unforseen at the time, causing enormous environmental damage.  I referred earlier to the question of casings and wondered how permanent and <Col N="324" /> safe they are.  It is not good enough simply to impose bans in this regard and to outline what we cannot do; we need to state what it is possible to do.  There is no doubt that in certain parts of the seas with rich iron environments successful biodegradation is possible.</P>
    <P>There is tremendous public concern that these problems may be addressed by way of landfill sites.  There is equal opposition to the alternatives sought.  It should be possible for us to set out a course to be followed in addressing these urgent environmental matters.  I am concerned about the leaching of chemical and other wastes from landfill sites into ground water and surface water.  We do not have sufficient scientific knowledge or experience to guide us as to the safety of these propositions. Regardless of how successful the waste legislation is in terms of waste reduction and elimination, society will continue to produce waste, and I am not sure Governments have found the answers.</P>
    <P>I raise that question because it is important to be as open and transparent as possible in addressing these questions and dealing with these risks.  We cannot move immediately from the position in which there are dangerous chemical and nuclear objects and armaments to the ideal world where arms can be decommissioned and the public can be assured there is no threat.  Safe disposal is therefore a crucial aspect of this matter.</P>
    <P>Recently I read that Sweden has decided, in the context of certain nuclear wastes, to construct a pipeline from the land under the sea bed to satisfy public considerations and concerns in this matter.  It is a demonstration of how difficult it is to find the right and safe answers for the future.</P>
    <P>On the issue of incentives, while I do not wish to argue about how grant oriented we are, we must consider tax incentives, or some other medium which will encourage industry and users to slow up the process, use different technologies and expend funds in scientific research to find ways of reducing the load into the pipeline.  While this is not <Col N="325" /> primarily the responsibility of the Minister for the Marine, the Government must act collectively on this matter.  If we are discharging waste into the marine environment from land-based sources on a continual basis which could be effectively reduced by a programme of education and support, tax incentives or whatever, then it is something we must consider.</P>
    <P>We must also encourage industry with regard to the management of waste and getting rid of the historical practices and long-term liabilities because of mistakes in the past.  We must learn from these mistakes and ensure that what we are doing now is the way forward, and can succeed with regard to the three main criteria I would lay down for the Bill, criteria which I am not certain its provisions can meet.</P>
    <P>The first is in respect of what we can do on the issue of THORP and Sellafield.  Second, how do we get more information, monitoring and management of the dump sites that have been secretly used on our coast, or close to our coast? Third, what are the alternatives, and how well are we developing them to ensure that the passage of this law not only protects the ocean and the seas around our coastline, but that we do not, as a result, force other types of solutions to be used where the same criteria applies, where the same risk is still inherent in them and where, therefore, the possibility of converting from the use of the sea in the way that has been done in the past, and was acceptable, is not matched in the future by using land or landfill to rescue us from this problem?</P>
    <P>There should be a wider educational and tax incentive orientation in regard to this problem, so that the pressures that lead to such dumping, and the pipeline which comes from the land sources into the sea is altered irrecovably for the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clohessy</NameTxt>
      <P>I broadly welcome the Bill and congratulate the Minister on outlining his plans for the future.  It is not before time that a Bill of this kind <Col N="326" /> was introduced.  Looking back over the years, it is astonishing to read that a nuclear powered submarine could be buried in the North Sea from which, at times, leaks occur.</P>
      <P>Vast quantities of atomic, industrial and nuclear waste have been deposited in the seas north of our Continent.  The first indications of the seriousness of these deposits were that the waters became totally denuded of wild life.  We have also discovered large quantities of gases and poisons, which were left after the First World War, and disposed of in the Irish Sea, not too far from our shores.  Some day the containers holding this waste will disintegrate, releasing their poisons into the seas.</P>
      <P>I recently spoke to a friend of mine in Limerick, a lone yachtsman, who has sailed around the world on two occasions.  He told me that it cost&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clohessy</NameTxt>
      <P>There are some nice people in Limerick, and loners also.  He told me he had crossed the North Atlantic Ocean on two occasions and came across large islands of waste spread out before him.  On one occasion he was fearful of being lost in view of the depth and size of the waste.  It is only right and proper, therefore, that we give serious consideration to the Bill and ensure that, for future generations, there will be a better means of controlling the damage that all this waste is causing.</P>
      <P>At one time we all took the view that if there was anything to dispose of and it was put into a river, lake, stream or sea that would be the end of it. However, waste does not disappear easily.  It will reappear for future generations and, perhaps, cause enormous damage to fish stocks, people's health and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Environmental issues have taken on a new importance in public affairs in recent years.  In this respect, the importance of dumping at sea, the subject of the Bill, was clearly highlighted by the <i>Brent Spar</i> saga earlier this year.  The <Col N="327" /> decision by the Shell Oil Company to tow a disused rig into the North Atlantic Ocean and dump it there caused a huge outcry.  It developed into an international incident and, ultimately, the company had to back down in the face of fierce public pressure, which included a boycott of its products, and was effectively forced to abandon its plan to dump the rig.</P>
    <P>I accept that public perception of the <i>Brent Spar</i> affair was heavily influenced by the orchestrated campaign mounted by the Greenpeace organisation and we know that some of its claims regarding materials contained in the rig were, perhaps, inaccurate.  Nevertheless, the incident illustrated how strongly public passions can be aroused on this topic.</P>
    <P>The need for us to protect the environmental integrity of our coastal waters and territorial seas is clear.  Any hint of contamination in Irish waters could have serious repercussions for our fishing and tourism industries, both of which are major employers and important contributors to national wealth generation.</P>
    <P>This country has more need than most for legislation on the issue of dumping at sea.  As an island nation at the edge of Europe, we are adjacent to major international shipping lanes.  We are also next door to the UK, one of the most heavily industrialised countries in the world, one of Europe's major military powers and one of the biggest players in the world in the business of nuclear weapons and nuclear energy.  It is hardly surprising, therefore, that material dumped by our nearest neighbour should find its way into the waters surrounding our shores.</P>
    <P>Regarding the nuclear industry, I realise that Sellafield is outside the ambit of this Bill.  Nevertheless I place on record my continuing concern that waste liquids containing radioactive contamination are still being discharged into the Irish Sea from that plant.  It is small wonder that the Irish Sea has been described as being twice as radioactive as the Pacific in the wake of a French <Col N="328" /> nuclear test.  With the commissioning of the new THORP facility the level of liquid discharges into the Irish Sea will naturally increase.  It is important that the Government maintains pressure on Britain on this issue.  We should be pressing also for some form of independent monitoring of the Irish Sea by a reputable international body to assess the scale of the nuclear pollution problem.</P>
    <P>The British have also shown themselves culpable regarding the disposal of military hardware.  It has recently come to light that during the past 50 years the British military authorities have dumped in excess of one million tonnes of munitions and military equipment into a marine trench known as the Beaufort Dyke between Ireland and Scotland located little more than six miles off the coast of Northern Ireland. That dyke holds a dangerous undersea cocktail of phosphorous forms, waste artillery shells and discarded ammunition.  It has been described by one expert as an environmental disaster waiting to happen.  That is bad enough but it may not be the whole story.  There is also a suggestion that up to 2,500 tonnes of nuclear waste may have been dumped in the dyke.  Undoubtedly that dumping has had environmental consequences.  A scientist from Liverpool University was reported in March this year as having found traces of arsenic in fish caught in the vicinity of that dyke. I need hardly point out the type of damage to our fishing industry that news poses.  It is vital that the Irish Government obtains clarification from the British authorities as to what has been dumped and its location.  The Beaufort Dyke may be an environmental time bomb.  It is vital that we understand the scale of the problem if we are to get to grips with it.</P>
    <P>I find fault with section 10 of the Bill which deals with penalties.  The maximum fine provided for under the Bill is £1,500.  Given that the likely culprits under this legislation could be transnational corporations or major international shipping companies, that <Col N="329" /> sum seems a small penalty in those circumstances.  The cost of the damage resulting from the dumping of a toxic substance at sea could be much more than that sum.  I accept that the Bill also provides for terms of imprisonment of up to five years.  However, the sanction of imprisonment is rarely employed in environmental cases and is not a practical option in cases where the offender is a corporate body.  I respectfully suggest that the Minister should consider giving the Bill more bite in terms of the maximum fine that may be levied.</P>
    <P>I wish to highlight a related matter, the reliability of sea charts of Irish coastal waters.  Last September an expert report was placed before a hydrographic seminar in Cork.  The report stated that many of the charts in use for Irish waters were up to 150 years old posing major dangers not only to the environment but to human life.  The sea approaches to Dublin were last surveyed in 1880.  An oil tanker which runs into difficulties while passing the Irish coast can exercise its right to head for the nearest safe port of refuge.  If the available charts are out of date by a century or more, such a vessel is at risk of running aground or worse.  Such an incident could result in a major spillage, an environmental catastrophe.  Hundreds of vessels engaged in international traffic pass the Irish coast annually.  For their safety and that of our environment it is important that up-to-date charts are available.  We need a national hydrographic office.  Will the Minister indicate what progress, if any, has been made towards that end?  I support the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley" hpid="Mr. McGinley Mr. McGinley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Minister of State, Deputy Gilmore, on introducing this long awaited Bill.  For a number of years many of us have been concerned about the extent of dumping along the coast between Ireland and the UK and off the north-west coast of Donegal.  During the past ten to 12 years, questions on this matter were asked in the House, motions were passed by local authorities and councils throughout the country condemning <Col N="330" /> indiscriminate dumping of war munitions or poison gas off our coasts and condemnations were made, but little or nothing has happened here where we are supposed to have the power to do something about that matter.  Therefore, I compliment the Minister of State who, after less than one year in office, has introduced a Bill designed to address these difficulties and our concerns, particularly those of us living in coastal areas of the north-west.</P>
      <P>I have received a number of letters from different Ministers during the past ten to 12 years.  I received one from the then Minister for Foreign Affairs in 1986 indicating that he had taken up the matter of dumping at sea with the British authorities and expressed his concern in that regard.  I received a letter in July 1987 from the then Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Lenihan, who raised this matter with the British authorities and gave useful information.  He said that the disposal included weapons captured from the Germans at the end of the Second World War as well as British stocks and consisted of nerve agent GA (&ldquo;Tabun&rdquo;) mustard gas, phosgene and bromobenzyl cyanide (BBC) and the dumping was carried out at depths ranging from 2,700 feet to 8,000 feet.  He gave other valuable information in that letter written eight years ago but very little has been done since to deal with that matter.  There have been occasional newspaper articles and issues raised on radio programmes.  The Minister must be complimented on addressing this problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Clohessy referred to the Beaufort Dyke mainly between Northern Ireland, along the Down-Antrim coast at Larne, and Stranraer, along the Scottish coast and the north-west of England.  That sea route is crossed almost every hour of the day by ferries travelling between Northern Ireland and Scotland carrying passengers and cargoes.  Approximately 1,500 feet under the surface of that water there is the largest undersea arms dump in Europe.  I question the safety of such <Col N="331" /> crossings and the condition of material dumped there at various times since 1945.  The British have admitted that there is more than one million tonnes of material dumped there.  It is not the type of dumping that was carried out in the Atlantic by the Americans and by others.  None of the munitions were dumped by scuttling ships there as was done in the Atlantic and other areas. Instead materials were crated, although many of them were sunk in barges.  The North Channel between Scotland and Ireland contains approximately 350 wrecks, ten of which are known to be military type ships.  Off north-west Donegal, about 70 to 80 miles off Tory Island, approximately 240,000 tonnes of chemical weapons are dumped.  They were supposed to have been encased in concrete and dumped there immediately after the Second World War and that dumping continued until about ten years ago.  Since then we have been told that dumping has not been carried out, but I am not sure if that is the truth.</P>
    <P>In recent weeks a colleague raised another matter of great concern in the European Parliament.  Mary Banotti interrupted a debate and asked about the dumping of nuclear waste.  It is bad enough that munitions and gases may be dumped in that area but, as Deputy Clohessy mentioned, if nuclear waste is dumped there it must be investigated.  I understand the Minister is following up that matter with the British authorities. I welcome the Bill.  It may not go as far as many of us expected but goes a long way towards dealing with this matter.</P>
    <P>A number of measures in the Bill commend themselves to me and to others who are concerned about what is taking place.  For example, one measure seeks to extend the maritime area of 12 miles, for which we are responsible, to 200 miles and, where the continential shelf is involved, to 350 miles, giving us power to regulate what dumping takes place within that region.  That represents a major step forward.  I hope we will be able to monitor what goes on in that area when the Bill is enacted.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="332" /> A wide range of activities is prohibited: incineration of substances or material at sea; the disposal at sea of offshore installations or of substances or material from any such installations; the disposal at sea of low, intermediate and high level radioactive substances or material, which must be outlawed as soon as possible, and other toxic, harmful or noxious substances.  There is also a prohibition on the dumping at sea of sewage sludge.  The dumping around our coast of raw sewage into the sea can no longer be tolerated.  Under the Bill I understand that after 1998 that will no longer be permitted.  It will be difficult to enforce these provisions.  Significant extra powers are being given to our patrol ships and to the Naval Service. I hope more monitoring vessels will be available to ensure that its provisions are complied with.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the issue of penalties.  I understand that for an infringement of any of the measures fines of about £1,500 are proposed.  Newspapers reports every weekend state that for relatively minor offences people can be fined up to £1,000 or £1,200.  If I had any recommendation or amendment to propose it would be to take a long hard look at the figure of £1,500.  A fine of £1,500 imposed on any person who is guilty of polluting one of our most valuable natural resources is much too low. We should be thinking in terms of a minimum of £15,000.  Indeed, a custodial sentence should also be imposed.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on introducing the Bill.  I hope it will have a speedy passage through both Houses and become law so that this difficulty of indiscriminate dumping by ourselves or others around our coast will cease.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Mr. Browne (Wexford) Mr. Browne (Wexford)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Wexford):</i> I welcome the Bill.  In a lengthy speech the Minister of State covered all aspects of our concerns in regard to dumping at sea and the problems faced by an island nation, such as ours.  Particularly along the east coast, we have been living under a cloud of secrecy for many years in regard to the actions of the UK <Col N="333" /> Government from which we have to drag information.  I refer particularly to the Sellafield and THORP nuclear installations which are practically on our doorstep.  We have voiced our concerns over the years but it appears successive Governments lacked the power to deal with the actions of the British Government.</P>
      <P>Medical experts have expressed concern from time to time about the high number of people who are born with deformities.  Despite medical evidence, public concern and the reaction of different Governments, the UK Government continues to act in a highhanded fashion in relation to the whole nuclear industry.</P>
      <P>I am concerned at newspaper announcments in September about the dumping of tonnes of nuclear oriented weapons in Ireland's backyard.  We have had toxic and nuclear dumping in the Irish Sea.  In October there was the following announcement: revelations indicate British authorities dumped 2,000 tonnes of nuclear waste in the sea between Ireland and Scotland.  There were other drip announcements as follows: &ldquo;British Ministry of Defence admits chemical weapons dumped off the Donegal coast&rdquo; and &ldquo;one million tonnes of weapons dumped off Irish and British coasts&rdquo;.  There were announcements in British and Irish newspapers of what has been happening recently.  We tabled many parliamentary questions seeking information.  I appreciate it is difficult for the Minister to obtain the correct details from the UK Government in view of the secrecy and underhandedness involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I appreciate that the Minister of State is doing his best to obtain information to allay people's fears, we may not be in a position to get the right answers through the conventions.  Reference has been made to the Oslo, London and Paris conventions.  As far as I know it is left to the Irish and British Governments to prepare reports and publicise them.  I have confidence in the Government to prepare the reports and be honest and up-front in its dealings <Col N="334" /> but I would find it very difficult to accept that the British Government will be honest and up-front in its dealings in view of their record to date of secrecy and underhandedness.  We have been unable to extract information from them in the way we would wish.  It is not good enough to read in the newspapers about the dumping of arms off the Donegal coast or the dumping of nuclear waste in the sea without knowing the long-term consequences for an island nation so close to the UK.</P>
    <P>There is a great emphasis on the need for the protection and cleanliness of the environment by the public, industry, farmers and consumers, and a demand that our environment be protected and enhanced.  The sea is very much part and parcel of our environment.  It is important for job creation, recreational facilities and tourism.  Much has been said about the need to develop the marine and tourism and in order to do so we must protect our seas from continuous dumping by the UK authorities.  The environment is most important to future job creation.  This Government, in common with its predecessors has identified the jobs potential of environmental protection.</P>
    <P>The <i>Brent Spar</i> oil rig issue highlighted public concern about this area. The decision to dump the rig was not taken with public consent but the public became aware of the decision once Greenpeace and other organisations became involved.  Some experts say the dumping of the <i>Brent Spar</i> rig might not have caused any great damage while others say it would have caused tremendous damage to marine life.  This sums up the problem.  There does not seem to be extensive research on or investigations into the dumping of nuclear arms or obsolete ships at sea and whether it causes damage to marine life and waters generally.</P>
    <P>The actions of the public at that time should be commended although they may cause problems for Shell in the future and for EU countries which have yet to deal with this type of problem. <Col N="335" /> That Shell planned to dump the rig without ensuring the public was fully aware of its intentions caused anger among Irish people, people in the EU and others further afield.  As a result, probably due to commercial reasons as much as anything else, Shell decided to take alternative action.</P>
    <P>The public is correct to remain unconvinced of the benefits of deep sea disposal.  Marine experts always assumed the deep ocean was effectively a desert. We now know differently because marine biologists and experts have discovered that, although life is much sparser than in estuaries or coral reefs, there is life at the bottom of the ocean. Estimates in the last decade suggested there could be between one and ten million different species on the ocean floor, yet, we are aware of two million species only on the entire planet.  This obviously means hundreds of different species of fish are living well below the level at which Shell wished to dump the <i>Brent Spar</i> rig.</P>
    <P>The UK Government took a critical view of the public's reaction and of Greenpeace.  It criticised the fact that Irish, French and German people were up in arms and suggested we were fools who did not know what we were talking about, since everything was safe. However, as the Minister said at the time, too many questions were left unanswered and there were too many ifs and buts regarding the dumping of the rig.  There is no doubt that if that dumping had been allowed, many more obsolete ships would have been dumped off our coast and those of other countries.</P>
    <P>When I was in the Department of the Environment I attended a number of meetings about marine matters.  I recall one joint meeting with marine Ministers about oil pollution incidents in the Shetlands and other areas when the then Minister, Deputy Andrews, accused the Greeks of having ships with rusty, leaking hulls.  They were offended by the tough stance adopted by Ireland and its Minister at the time.  They felt we were over-critical and over-reacting.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="336" /> However, as was pointed out at those meetings, the high quality natural environmental areas off the coast of Ireland and elsewhere are not just recreational amenities.  Local inhabitants depend to a large extent on environmentally-supported activities for their living, such as tourism, agriculture and fishing.  Ireland has a valuable coastline particularly vulnerable to oil spillages and other problems caused by the dumping of ships.  The shipping industry must play its part in preventing marine pollution.  &ldquo;The polluter pays&rdquo; principle, an important aspect of European Union policy, must be applied with full force to maritime operations.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his detailed and lengthy speech has set about tackling the problems related to dumping at sea. I commend him on introducing the Bill. He outlined the conventions under which Ireland and other countries can take action.  I welcome the Bill but question whether its provisions will apply henceforth.  Perhaps in his reply the Minister could comment on and clarify how the problems caused by the nine or ten incidents the UK Government has admitted in relation to dumped chemical weapons and other matters, will be resolved.  It is unclear how the problems will be solved and what effects they will have on the waters around our coastline or the fishing developments announced by the Minister recently.  Will the cans or barrels containing chemical weapons at the bottom of the sea corrode?  Have they already corroded and is there leakage from such areas at present?  What effect, if any, is this having?  The UK Government will deny that any such thing is happening or will happen. However, it is important that investigations be carried out on the long-term effects on the fishing, recreation and tourism industries.  If leakages do occur, what emergency plans exist to deal with them?  This matter is of concern to the communities earning their livings around our coastline.  It is also of concern to the wider public.  We do not want the UK to continue dumping <Col N="337" /> offensive chemicals and obsolete weapons off our coastline.  It is not good enough for any nation to carry out such activities and I ask the Minister to deal with this matter in his reply.</P>
    <P>Is the Minister satisfied with the conventions?  Under the Oslo, London and Paris Conventions, it seems it is very much up to Ireland and the UK to decide what is best and what type of report will be forthcoming.  Does the Minister agree it would be far better, safer and in the interests of the Irish people if an independent body was set up within the EU to investigate the long-term effects of dumping at sea on our coastline and our people?  Will the Minister consider, if he has not already done so, asking the EU to take this route?</P>
    <P>Deputy McGinley said some of our MEPs have raised this issue in the European Parliament.  Deputy Gallagher has been most vocal about these problems on our behalf in the Parliament and he has been told consistently that if Ireland requests such an independent investigatory body it may be considered favourably.</P>
    <P>In conjunction with all the Irish MEPs, who are extremely concerned about the environment and the damage being done to our seas, the Minister might seek to have such an investigative body set up as quickly as possible.  I trust the Minister and Government to seek action but I do not trust the British Government, whose actions to date in relation to THORP, Sellafield and dumping off the Irish coastline is proof that it has scant regard for the health and welfare of Irish people.  That is totally unacceptable.  I do not blame the Minister or this Government; successive Governments tried to tackle this problem but were unsuccessful.</P>
    <P>With the full support of this House and of the Irish MEPs, the Minister should move a stage further and insist, as Ireland's right within the EU, on the setting up of an independent investigative body to examine all cases of alleged dumping during the past 20 or 25 years.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="338" /> We do not have answers to the serious problems that may arise in the event of leaks at nuclear plants or accidents at sea.  If we are depending on the UK Government to be honest with us in this regard, we are going down the wrong road.  There has been too much secrecy and information has been forthcoming on a drip basis when sought by this Government.  That is not good enough when we are talking about an area of major concern to everyone in this House and the actions that may be necessary as a result of this Bill.</P>
    <P>I welcome the enactment of this Bill. It is long overdue.  I congratulate the Minister on its speedy introduction and I hope that over the coming weeks we will all have an input to deciding how best we can resolve the problems I have outlined in relation to the various newspaper reports over the past few months of major concern to all of us.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Over 70 per cent of the earth's surface is covered in water, yet only recently have we become aware of the threat to the marine ecological system, particularly relevant to this island nation for two reasons.  In recent decades, both the Irish Sea and the Atlantic have been turned into little more than marine tipheads, resulting in terrible insecurity for people living on the coastline and those who fish the seas.</P>
      <P>This Bill marks a watershed in environmental legislation.  It enables us, for the first time, to ratify the OSPAR Convention.  Its provisions will also extend our control over dumping from 12 to 200 miles and, in some cases, 350 miles.  Democratic Left has long argued for stringent measures to protect our marine environment from assault by governments and industry.  Those concerns are addressed in the programme, A Government of Renewal, which contains a number of innovative environmental protection measures and deals at some length with the dangers facing our marine environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this regard I congratulate my party colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, <Col N="339" /> Deputy Gilmore, who since taking office has made it clear that he views our marine environment as a resource to be guarded and protected rather than ruthlessly exploited by governments and industry.  The Bill is indicative of this Government's commitment to marine protection.  In that respect I am delighted to hear there will be all-party support for it, important because this is the most far-reaching marine protection legislation so far enacted in this or any other jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>However, there is a limit, to what Governments can do unilaterally.  The environmental threats to the Irish Sea and the Atlantic stem from two main sources, namely, heavy industry and the nuclear establishment.  Of course, Ireland does not have an entirely clean environmental record.  Much of our current domestic legislation is weak, sloppily implemented and penalties, such as exist, are often derisory &mdash; we should cast our minds back to the penalties imposed in the case of Ringaskiddy.</P>
    <P>The major threat to our marine environment stems from the UK.  No amount of domestic legislation, however well drafted, will of itself halt the nuclear madness on the other side of the Irish Sea.  Less than 100 miles from this House the THORP nuclear &ldquo;elephant&rdquo; is a constant threat to people here.</P>
    <P>Until now, international law has proven a flawed instrument with which to challenge the UK nuclear establishment.  As made abundantly clear in the case of the French nuclear tests, the EURATOM Treaties are outdated and inadequate to meet the demands of the modern world.  EURATOM is riddled with loopholes and is subject to a wide range of legal interpretations which, unfortunately, have tended to favour the nuclear industry rather than the environment.</P>
    <P>The programme, <i>A Government of Renewal,</i> contains a commitment to press for the updating of the EURATOM Treaties to take account of the concerns of countries like Ireland and other non-nuclear jurisdictions sharing <Col N="340" /> land or maritime borders with nuclear jurisdictions.  Unless the EURATOM Treaties and other international legislative instruments are given teeth, no amount of domestic legislation will be sufficient to protect our marine environment.</P>
    <P>Every day we face the threat of accidents at Sellafield and THORP.  Not only will the ever present risk of a nuclear accident increase as the UK nuclear industry submits further to commercial considerations, THORP also increases the volume of nuclear shipping passing through the Irish Sea.  It has been estimated that an accident on any of the vessels carrying nuclear waste to THORP could have the same effect as several Chernobyl accidents.  It is important to picture the effects on this country of such a horrendous accident. Such concerns led to the adoption, in 1993, of the INF code.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister will have the full support of every Deputy in ensuring that the transportation of nuclear materials by sea is strictly controlled.</P>
    <P>Ideally, Democratic Left would like to see a total ban on nuclear shipping in environmentally sensitive areas, such as the Irish Sea, but the nuclear industry does not pose the only threat to our marine environment.  Since the end of the Second World War, and probably the First World War, an unknown quantity of munitions and chemicals has been dumped in Beaufort Dyke which lies between Scotland and Ireland.  It has been reported that 2,517 tonnes of nuclear waste was dumped at the same location in 1981.  Satisfactory answers have not yet been received from the UK authorities regarding what was dumped, when it was dumped, the total amount and the proposals, if any, there are to ensure the future safety of the dump sites.</P>
    <P>The UK authorities' indifference to environmental concerns was obvious in recent months when they supported Shell UK in its plans to dump a disused oil rig, the Brent Spar, in the Atlantic. They were forced to back down by a combination of public pressure and <Col N="341" /> threats of action under the OSPAR Convention.  There is a moratorium on the marine disposal of decommissioned offshore installations until a formal decision is adopted in 1997.  I hope that during the intervening period governments will intensify their efforts to secure a total ban.  I have no doubt that the Irish Government and the Minister of State, Deputy Gilmore, in particular will continue to take the lead in this regard.</P>
    <P>The sad reality is that the Irish Sea is the final destination for everything from domestic sewage sludge to irradiated effluent from Sellafield.  The most stringent licensing regulations will be imposed under this Bill on all those seeking permits.  Applicants will be obliged to undertake surveys and analysis at their own expense.  This should act as a deterrent.</P>
    <P>I welcome the removal of the sovereign immunity exemption.  If this provision had been retained, the State would be enabled to dump munitions. In removing this exemption the Minister of State is making it clear that the same law will apply to all, thus setting a welcome precedent which I hope will be followed internationally.  The marine environment is our greatest natural resource which we are in danger of frittering away.  Therefore, I hope this legislation will be rigorously enforced.</P>
    <P>Domestic legislative measures are one side of the coin only.  Unless the Government is successful in seeking the introduction of tighter international controls and massive penalties for any breaches of them domestic legislation will have little effect in preventing marine pollution.  I congratulate the Minister of State on his excellent contribution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. H. Byrne Mr. H. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I commend the Minister of State on introducing this welcome legislation which as Deputy Eric Byrne reminded us deals with a serious issue.  I am surprised, therefore, that there is not more active participation in the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Approximately 70 per cent of the <Col N="342" /> earth's surface is under water.  As the Minister of State rightly said, &ldquo;no state in the world, and particularly no coastal state, can ignore its duties of stewardship of the world's oceans and seas&rdquo;.  This legislation, therefore, is timely and I hope it provokes the proper reaction.  There is a belief that environmental matters are now high on everyone's agenda.</P>
    <P>Approximately 20,000 ships are listed on Lloyd's shipping register, although a number remain unregistered.  If one takes account of the number of ships which visit Dublin port, Waterford harbour &mdash; 560 last year &mdash; New Ross harbour and so on annually, one can appreciate the risk of severe pollution and dumping at sea.  All too often one comes across plastic containers, plastic bags and aeroboard along the shoreline. This is a disgrace.  Ships registered both here and abroad are obliged to use the waste disposal facilities provided onshore.  It is all too easy to dump domestic waste overboard in the same way that people roll down the window of a car to dump a plastic bag.  This matter can be easily resolved.</P>
    <P>Ships must also be encouraged to use the facilities provided in all our major ports for the disposal of waste oil as it is equally tempting to dump it overboard so as not to carry an unwanted load further.  Oil spills damage the marine environment and can cause the death of marine life.  We should be very careful about this.  From time to time the Department of the Marine has carried out exercises in various places.  I participated in one held at Rosslare some years ago.  Such clean-up operations are organised after the damage has been done, and while I recommend that sort of damage limitation as a good course of action, our energy should be concentrated on preventing oil spills at every opportunity.</P>
    <P>Why are there oil spillages?  Carelessness has played the biggest part in the most recent oil spillages.  It will be very difficult for the Minister to say that we can control oil spillages, that we can talk to ship owners, masters, crews and so on <Col N="343" /> and ask them to be part of a major campaign to prevent oil spillages.  In a perfect society that might work but it will be very difficult to get it to work in the Minister's Department, because he is asking people to do something miles away from everyone when they cannot be seen.  He is dependent on the goodwill of ship owners and ships' masters and crews.  They must be asked to participate in a campaign to improve the marine environment if we are serious about passing on the marine resources to the next generation in a healthy condition.</P>
    <P>While we must do all we can to prevent oil spillages, there will be accidents and we must also ensure that damage limitation exercises are carried out in or near all ports.  It is most likely that accidents will occur close to ports.  To date we have not had any such spillage in New Ross but there is a real possibility it could happen.  New Ross is a very busy port.  Some 300,000 tonnes were imported there last year.  Exercises must be organised for ports such as New Ross in order to prevent severe damage. As I said, a damage limitation exercise is the best that we can hope for at this stage.  I wonder how many ports would be able to cope with the problem if it occurred?  The Minister should take a personal interest in this area.</P>
    <P>We have seen the damage that has been caused by spillages in the past, off our shores and those of the United Kingdom. There is nothing more terrible than to see dead fish washed up on the shoreline and birds, covered with oil, unable to move. We have all seen such pictures on television.  I ask the Minister to ensure that exercises are carried out at or near all ports to ensure that such damage is limited when it occurs.</P>

      <P>What about submarines?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. H. Byrne Mr. H. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am coming to that.  I was very disappointed that I got very little support from the Deputy when I raised this issue.  I was delighted to hear <Col N="344" /> my colleague, Deputy Eric Byrne, raise the issue of the use of the Irish Sea by the British, Russians, Americans, French and anyone else who happens to have submarines in their naval fleets. The Cold War is over and war games no longer occur in the Irish Sea.</P>
      <P>The use to which the Irish Sea has been put would encourage people to believe that it is the British dump.  That is a tough statement to have to make, but it is true from several points of view, not least submarine activity.  Because of the activity of submarines in the Irish Sea, 50 lives and several fine trawlers were lost.  They pulled the trawlers under and then disappeared.  Only a coward will run from the scene of a crime.  Only after severe pressure did the British Ministry for Defence admit to some of its mistakes.  Whether it was I or the conclusion of the Cold War that brought it about, I am happy to note that there is now less submarine activity in the the Irish Sea.</P>
      <P>It concerns me that ships, sometimes nuclear powered, travel on the Irish Sea to take nuclear waste to Sellafield.  All we can do is hope and pray that an accident will not happen.  There should be very severe and restrictive controls on such traffic.  It will be said that it is not really our concern, but of course it is. This traffic is just off or coastline and if anything happens there is no doubt that we will be the worst hit.  I do not know how many tonnes of waste are imported into Sellafield.  Now that THORP is up and running the amount will definitely increase.  No thought whatsoever has been given to Irish concerns in this matter.  We all know that there is tremendous concern throughout the country but particularly along the east coast at the prospect of an accident.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I indicated earlier, the Irish Sea seems to be the British dump.  If we consider the amount of nuclear waste that is pumped into the Irish Sea every day we would have to agree.  Successive Governments have attempted, so they <Col N="345" /> tell us, to discourage that activity.  The response has been what I am reading here.  Their response to us was reported in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of 20 September 1995 as follows: &ldquo;We have never tried to hide the fact.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the arrogant British attitude to this country which reaps no benefit from their electricity supply industry. While it has been maintained from time to time that the price of progress is inconvenience, that is progress for Britain but inconvenience or worse for Ireland.  How serious are we about endeavouring to control the levels of nuclear waste being dumped into the Irish Sea?  Would it be honest to say we raise the odd objection but are not really serious about it?  Do we really care, or could it be maintained that, if the opportunity arose, we would connect to the British electricity grid, take advantage of their supply and continue to complain about its source?  It would be hypocritical to adopt such an attitude; we are either against it or for it.  I should like to know from the Minister of State precisely what is our attitude.</P>
    <P>I will refer now to the matter of drugs in general.  On the south Wexford coast there have been very big drugs seizure incidents in the recent past when tonnes of drugs were picked up from the sea floor.  Now that our port authorities have become so diligent, it appears we are making headway on drugs detection. The attitude of the drug barons appears to be: dump the drugs offshore and somebody will take them inland to various markets.  What is our attitude to that?  As I understand it, we have seven corvettes, four of which are in dry dock at any one time.  If we are serious surely those seven corvettes should be manned and at sea at any given time.  There is much talk about eliminating the drugs problem but very little about prevention.</P>
    <P>Our fishermen who are at sea day and night know every nook and cranny of our coastline and must have known when that load of drugs was dumped. The Departments of the Marine and Justice should avail of their knowledge <Col N="346" /> and expertise.  If we are really serious about preventing the importation of drugs here we should consider rewarding fishermen who provide intelligence which results in their seizure. The shoreline appears to be the new entry point for drugs coming in here. We must reward those who provide intelligence leading to their discovery.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanMcGahon" hpid="Mr. McGahon Mr. McGahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGahon</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy Gilmore, on his foresight in introducing this Bill and on his particularly good ministerial performance to date.  He is very attentive to his brief, in control of it, receptive to ideas and always willing to travel to any location to hear or investigate a complaint.  Certainly, I have experienced no difficulty in approaching him on such matters and thank him for his attention.</P>
      <P>I had the opportunity of attending a Globe International conference in Brussels last week.  It was something of an eye opener for me, giving me an insight into an aspect of the environment I had not appreciated before.  I returned convinced I had learned much from its deliberations.  In fact, I subscribed my name for membership to Globe International whose discussions covered many of the issues debated in this House from time to time.</P>
      <P>The introduction of this Bill is indeed opportune, coming as it does when environmental questions have become a priority for all politicians irrespective of party allegiance.  There is no doubt that the environment and a growing appreciation of it, will play an even greater part in politics than it has to date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As an island nation, the sea and its better management is of particular interest to us.  While this century has witnessed tremendous developmental and industrial advances, in the latter part only, has marine life and culture been evaluated and, at the same time, threatened.  Last week in Brussels two Icelandic MEPs requested me to sign a motion protesting at the development of Sellafield and another reprocessing plant apparently being established in Scotland.  They were worried about the <Col N="347" /> continuation of fish life on which Iceland depends so much.  I told them I shared their concern but, as an eastern coast resident of Ireland, I was even more concerned about the lives of our citizens on that coast.  We discovered we had much in common.  Their concern was deep and genuine and they continued to raise it at many intervals in the course of that three day conference.</P>
    <P>Like Deputy Hugh Byrne and others, I too am deeply concerned about Sellafield, living as I do in the town of Dundalk, in the smallest county in Ireland with the highest number of deaths from leukaemia with our neighbours in County Down, a remarkable phenomenon.  While there are differing medical opinions on the subject, the man in the street believes, as I do, the reason is that we are located in the direct path of winds blowing across from Sellafield. Indeed, in the years 1957-59 there arose a phenomenon, never explained &mdash; and I suppose never will be &mdash; when 11 young girls who had attended the St. Louis Convent School in Dundalk gave birth to Down's Syndrome babies.</P>
    <P>That is a horrible indictment of the Sellafield plant.  Britain has no right to threaten the lives of the people in a small neighbouring country.  The only solution is intervention by the European Court and/or the formulation of a definite policy on nuclear waste by the European Parliament.</P>
    <P>The European Parliament has produced much fine legislation, but can waffle and sit on the fence on a par with any Irish politician when it suits it.  The recent problem of France's nuclear experiments shows just how lacking in teeth is the European Parliament.  As a matter of priority, the European Parliament should develop a cohesive and definite waste programme, given that France turned a blind eye to the objections of the world and that Britain is doing the same at Sellafield.  Last week an English member of parliament, a member of the Labour Party who is against Sellafield, told me privately that Sellafield would continue because of <Col N="348" /> economic considerations.  During the seven years that Fianna Fáil was in power I never raised the issue of Sellafield.  I felt it would have been sheer gamesmanship to have done so because, unless the Government could focus the attention of the European Parliament on that question, there was nothing we could do.  I still believe that.  This is a matter for the concerted efforts of the European Parliament.  No small nation at this stage of world development should be endangered by a greater power for economic reasons.  Those economic considerations are massive; the employment generated by Sellafield is hugely significant in an unemployment black spot.  However, international pressure should be focused on that problem and the health of our people should not be endangered simply to provide employment on the other side of the Irish Sea.</P>
    <P>There are certain aspects of this Bill about which we have to be concerned and on which, being a political cynic, I must voice a certain cynicism.  I refer to the extension of the limit of Irish control in relation to dumping from 12 miles to 200 miles off the Irish coast. That looks very well in writing, but have we the naval resources to patrol this area effectively?  I am sure the Minister will correct me if I am wrong, but I understand that there are two major Irish patrol vessels constantly at anchor in a harbour in Cork because of our inability to provide seamen.  It makes nonsense of this legislation.</P>
    <P>There are many other considerations, such as the necessity to have an effective patrol against the vultures who trade in that most despicable of trades, drug running.  No politician needs to be told of the necessity to elevate that issue to priority and to clamp down on those ruthless people who run drugs in by the sea to destroy and dehumanise our youth.  If some of those drug runners were to meet with an accident at sea, say to slip on a wet surface, I would not shed any tears and would not be raising the matter in this House.  Most parents are concerned about the sudden density <Col N="349" /> and extent of drugs in the country, and that is something we must address.  If we have ships for which the taxpayer paid millions, surely we can provide seamen to crew them so that they can put to sea where they are needed and are not being left riding at anchor.</P>
    <P>The channel between the Antrim coast and Scotland is the graveyard of many ships that have been deliberately scuttled by the British who have turned it into a tiphead for ocean wrecks.  It is supposed to be the most densely polluted area in the world, and there the Scottish coast is as close as 12 miles to the Antrim coast.  That is something we should be negotiating with the British on a permanent basis.  It is a fact that the British have used the Irish Sea as a dumping ground and perhaps in the past Irish Governments have been remiss in allowing that.</P>
    <P>Deputy Byrne referred to the mysterious activities of submarines in the Irish Sea in recent years.  There is no doubt that shameful activities occurred in that area involving not only British submarines but Russian and American, and many fatalities occured for which nobody accepted responsibility.  There is no doubt that those three world powers were involved in the disappearance of several ships and the loss of the lives of people who were simply seeking to earn a living from the sea.</P>
    <P>The question of raw sewage has to be mentioned.  Some of the objectives contained in this document are laudable, but we continue to pollute the seas by discharging raw sewage into it.  The Government should facilitate local councils to eliminate that sort of pollution.  Until we do, much of what is in this document will remain a pious aspiration.</P>
    <P>Finally, I congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy Gilmore, on introducing this necessary legislation which will ratify the OSPAR Convention.  Perhaps he would give his attention to the points I raised, particularly regarding the non-use of substantial vessels which are so necessary if we are to implement many <Col N="350" /> of the Minister's own suggestions contained in this document.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This Bill proposes to extend the criminal law of the State to try sexual offences against children committed elsewhere but which, if committed in this State, would constitute a criminal offence by citizens of the State or by persons ordinarily resident within the State.  It gives me particular pleasure to move this Bill on behalf of my colleague, Deputy Ryan, and the Fianna Fáil Party not least because for once the Minister for Justice and the Government have been gracious enough to accept a Fianna Fáil Private Members' Bill.</P>
      <P>Child sexual abuse is an evil of the 20th century.  Tragically an increasing number of these vile types of crimes have come to light in recent years. There is sufficient legislation to deal with child sexual offences committed in this country and it is fair to say that Irish children are given the protection of Irish criminal law.  However, it is desirable and necessary for us to recognise that children living in foreign jurisdictions are entitled to the same protection.  It is in this context that we put forward the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Child sex abuse is a very serious international problem and paedophiles travel to other countries where they abuse children.  In its report to the United Nations Group on Slavery the Norwegian Government stated that an estimated one million children are forced <Col N="351" /> into this kind of trade every year.  It goes without saying that these children are manipulated by evil people who ply human misery and poverty.  While 120 states ratified the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child unfortunately the problem of child prostitution is getting worse internationally.  The Bill seeks to deal with the global problem of child prostitution and attempts to educate the global community on the depravity of such an offence.</P>
    <P>The frightening trade in child prostitution is allegedly more profitable than illegal arms dealing or drug trafficking. It is difficult for people living in a country on the periphery of western Europe to believe that this pernicious trade could be more profitable than illegal arms dealing or drug trafficking, yet that is the international experience.  It is also the international experience that there are evil people who are willing to utilise children in this manner for monetary gain.  Tragically the age of the children who are being tricked into prostitution is getting younger.  Reports by international agencies dealing with the problem state that children as young as four years of age are being forced into prostitution by evil people.  It is estimated that up to ten million children could be enslaved in child prostitution, the sex industry generally, sex tourism and pornography.</P>
    <P>The trade, if one can call it that, appears to be worse in Asia and Latin America and it is clear to the international community that Thailand is particularly notorious for this type of trade.  In recent years there has been a growth in the trade in Africa, North America and Europe, with Eastern Europe emerging as a new market. Report suggests that Romanian children in Germany and Amsterdam who have been driven from their homeland, who are living in deep poverty, who have nowhere to go and have no way of making money, are being driven into this evil and degrading business.</P>
    <P>The Bill has been put forward on the basis of common humanity and human <Col N="352" /> rights and the belief that each human being, whether they are Irish, Vietnamese or Filipino, is entitled to the same protection by the international community.  Unless serious action is taken by the international community it appears that this despicable trade will continue to increase in the foreseeable future.  In Latin America large numbers of street children survive by prostituion and crime.  In many cases children are sold into slavery by their debt ridden families.  It is difficult to believe that a human being could sell his or her child into slavery, yet this is not only happening but it is happening at an alarming rate.  The enactment of this Bill will send a clear message to the international community that this democracy decries this foul trade in human misery where the most innocent and vulnerable are used for monetary gain.</P>
    <P>It appears that the sale and trafficking in this trade includes the following: procurers and criminal organisations which sell children to brothels in their own country or abroad; procurers and criminal organisations which supply children to clients; individual paedophiles who acquire children for themselves and paedophile organisations which acquire children for their members.  In this context it must be recognised, shocking as it may be, that there is a paedophile information exchange which has been driven underground but which is still very much in existence.  It is said that this exchange is one of the most influential in Europe.</P>
    <P>Experts in the field agree that effective action is required across the international spectrum.  The action which must be taken falls into a number of categories &mdash; law enforcement, anti-povery measures, education and AIDS awareness and tourism aid and assistance.  In his 1993 United Nations report on the sale of children Professor Muntarbhorn states in paragraphs 151-53:</P>
    <P>There is systematic and individual criminality, coupled with corruption, which profiteers from prostitutes in <Col N="353" /> general and child prostitutes in particular.  The criminality is part and parcel of a business, at times with a facade for whitewashing the illegal returns.  This is a major root cause of child exploitation which has not been sufficiently addressed.  At the very worst, children are abducted, drugged and coerced by gangs and syndicates into prostitution both locally and across frontiers.  They may also be killed or maimed in the process.  The tragedy is aggravated by the advent of AIDS and the various forms of discrimination which arise against child prostitutes faced with this dilemma.</P>
    <P>Interestingly, in all the countries studied under this mandate, there are many existing laws which can be used to protect children from prostitution. These vary between special laws on women and children and general criminal laws and codes which also apply to child trafficking and exploitation.  Yet in many instances they are not implemented.  In practice, the customers tend to be exempted from their application.  Those caught by the law tend to be the children and the procurers rather than the consumers, even though the law should be applied to incriminate the latter.</P>
    <P>Another serious loophole is that the issue of proper law enforcement has not been tackled directly.  More specifically, if the police are badly paid, as is the case in many countries, and if they are untrained to protect children as a &ldquo;first call&rdquo;, the situation lends itself to their being passive towards the issue of child prostitution in those countries, and some may have a hand in the whole industry as part of an ingrained process.</P>
    <P>Sex tours, from so-called tourism trade operates, are available not very far from these shores.  In established bookshops in some countries paedophiles may obtain information on where to go to commit what is one of the most criminal offences of all.  It is of fundamental importance that legislation be enacted in all western democracies that makes it <Col N="354" /> quite clear that anybody found exploiting a child in this degrading, disgusting and terrible way will face the full rigours of the law in this State or in other western states on his return.  Child prostitution and sex tourism must count as the ultimate form of exploitation, a terrible crime against the most vulnerable in society, a crime against humanity.</P>
    <P>This Bill will send out a clear message to one and all that our democracy will not accept criminality of this type. Section 2 (1) provides:</P>
    <P>Any sexual offence, specified in the Schedule hereto, if committed against a child under the age of 18 years in any other jurisdiction, shall be triable and punishable within this State in accordance with the provisions of section 3 of this Act if&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  it is an offence under the law or territory where it occurred, and</P>
    <P>(b)  it is an offence under the Schedule to this Act, and</P>
    <P>(c)  it is committed by a citizen of this State or by a person who is ordinarily resident within this State.</P>
    <P>The Schedule to the Bill sets out the offences which include:</P>
    <P>1.  The offence of unlawful carnal knowledge of a girl under the age of fifteen years contrary to section 1 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1935.</P>
    <P>2.  The offence of the unlawful carnal knowledge of a girl between the ages of fifteen and seventeen years contrary to section 2 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1935.</P>
    <P>3.  The offence created by section 4 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1935.</P>
    <P>4.  The offence of rape contrary to section 4 of the Criminal Law (Rape) (Amendment) Act, 1990.</P>
    <P>5.  The offence of rape contrary to common law and section 2 of the Criminal Law Rape Act, 1981.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="355" /> 6.  The offence of aggravated sexual assault contrary to section 3 of the Criminal Law (Rape) (Amendment) Act, 1990.</P>
    <P>7.  The offence of sexual assault contrary to section 2 of the Criminal Law (Rape) (Amendment) Act, 1990.</P>
    <P>8.  The offence of buggery contrary to section 61 of the Offences Against the Person Act, 1861.</P>
    <P>9.  The offence of gross indecency contrary to section 11 of the Offences Against the Person Act, 1861.</P>
    <P>There are similar Bills in other jurisdictions but I submit this Bill goes further.  It not only provides that it will be an offence in this State, triable in this State in respect of a sexual offence committed in another state on a person under 18 years of age, but provides in section 3 that any person who aids, abets, counsels or procures the commission of an act that, if done in the State, would constitute an offence specified in the Schedule.  Effectively this means that if somebody aids and abets an individual in committing an offence of this kind he will be triable here for that criminal offence.  This will send out a signal to tour operators, who to my knowledge are not operating in this State, who may consider opening such a business in this country.  Someone who offends in this way will be treated as if he were a pimp for the purposes of the offence and will be punished accordingly.  It is important that this signal is sent out very clearly.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides also that if anybody attempts to commit the offence he too will be held to be guilty of an offence and will be triable in this State.  Where somebody conspires with one or more persons to do an act which if done in this State would constitute an offence specified in the Schedule, that too would be an offence that would be triable in this State.  It is fundamentally important that the principle of double jeopardy would not be jeopardised in any way.  That is why we specify in <Col N="356" /> section 4 (1) that: &ldquo;Nothing in this Act shall affect the legal principle of double jeopardy.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We have also incorporated in the Bill Part III of the Criminal Evidence Act, 1992.  The House will recall that this provision deals with video link evidence.  It is of crucial importance that video link evidence could be made available to a court in this State.  This would ensure that people who live in other counties and are not in a position to travel to give evidence would be able to do so by video link.  It is of fundamental importance that only <i>prima facie</i> cases are brought before the court.</P>
    <P>It is important to realise that organisations such as Jubilee working in the international field have publicly said they are investigating cases of this nature and are prepared to gather the evidence and put it together in order to stamp out this trade in human misery. This means that the Bill, for all practical purposes, can be enforced by a court in this country.</P>
    <P>In short, this is a fundamental Bill.  It will ensure that the State recognises the human rights of children not only in Ireland but internationally.  It will send out a clear signal to those considering committing offences of this nature on foreign soil that if there is sufficient evidence they will be tried at home.</P>
    <P>If I have a slight reservation about the Bill it is the obligation that the offence be an offence under the law of the territory where it occurred.  This provision was inserted in the Bill in the interests of certainty so that an offence in another State would also be a criminal offence here.  That rule most frequently exists in extradition law and it was felt necessary to insert it in this legislation. Unfortunately, while it may be difficult to understand or believe, many of the offences listed in the Schedule are not considered offences in some countries. There is a great deal of political and police corruption, as well as corruption in law enforcement agencies, in many countries.  This means the children of such countries are corrupted by the adults.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="357" /> In general, the public will welcome the Bill as an extremely positive measure.  It is one of the few Private Members' Bills that will pass through Dáil Éireann.  Therefore, it would be unkind of me not to acknowledge the graciousness of the Minister in accepting it.  However, other desirable measures introduced by Fianna Fáil in the past year or so were not accepted by the Government.  It would have been preferable, for example, if it had agreed to the passage of the criminal law bail Bill or the amendment to the Constitution Bill.  I have reached the conclusion of late that the refusal to accept certain measures put forward by Fianna Fáil may not be the fault of the Minister for Justice only.  The Labour Party and Democratic Left appear to be at odds with the Fine Gael section of the Government in respect of vital legislation required in the interests of the people.</P>
    <P>We in Fianna Fáil are pleased the Government proposes to accept this Bill which deals with a pernicious trade.  We are proud to have introduced it as an indication of the people's concern about the violation of human rights.  The Bill expresses the people's abhorrence of criminality involving vulnerable children.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland has been rocked in recent months by revelations of paedophile abuse of young children.  A much more sinister opportunity exists for the Irish child sex abuser to practice his horror through organised package holidays to Thailand, Cambodia and other South-East Asian countries that promote sex tourism.  For as little as £500, including flight, Irish, British and other north European paedophiles flood into those areas to have sexual relations with children aged between three and 15 years. The betrayal of innocence, the spread of disease and risk of violence to such children by their abusers is a crime against humanity.  The Irish people, who were <Col N="358" /> recently awakened to the horrors of paedophilia, must now act to stop and expose such Irish criminals.  However difficult and unsettling this action and debate must be for an Ireland that cherishes the child and family, we must not flinch in our obligation to protect such children, be they from Ireland, Asia, Africa, South America or elsewhere.</P>
    <P>The Sexual Offences (Jurisdiction) Bill aims to provide the enforcement mechanism to deter child abuse by Irish citizens and residents acting outside Ireland.  The legislation is in keeping with our obligation under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child which explicitly calls on Governments to take action to prevent child prostitution.  Such legislation has already been adopted by the Governments of the United States, Australia, Germany, France, Sweden and Norway and the Governments of Belgium, Japan and New Zealand are considering similar legislation.  Ireland must not drag its heels on this issue or it will stand indicted in the eyes of the children it has pledged to protect.  There must be no refuge for monsters who prey on defenceless children.  As a parent and legislator I know of no more important task than the introduction of this legislation.</P>
    <P>The Bill makes sexual offences against children by Irish citizens or residents in other countries punishable in Ireland as if they were committed here. This is a major development in imposing the jurisdiction of the Irish courts on offences committed abroad, and obviously, is not a step taken lightly. Ireland and the international community have already embraced legislation on extradition and other issues, such as war crimes and genocide, that also transcend national borders.  We will not interfere with the laws of other countries by introducing this legislation. Rather it will enforce an Irish constitutional and international law that is imperative for the protection of children.</P>
    <P>While of itself the law may not deter the most determined child abuser, it <Col N="359" /> should deter many Irish tourists from hiring child prostitutes in places such as Thailand, Cambodia and the Philippines.  In the murky underworld of child prostitution this law will be a major obstacle.  The Irish tourist travelling abroad to solicit under age sex will know the Garda may apprehend him at Dublin Airport, at home or in the work-place.  The writ of the State and the long arm of the law will meet the sex tourist on his return home.</P>
    <P>Under section 3(2) the Bill also targets the tour organiser and trader in child pornography in this or other jurisdictions who aids, abets, counsels or procures the sexual abuse of children in other countries.  Such parasites who prey on the predilection of the paedophile and enslave and destroy children, who are often sold into child prostitution, will be dealt with harshly.</P>
    <P>The advertisement in many popular newspapers of exotic and romantic holidays, particularly in South-East Asia, where locals are billed as companionable and easy going is often, but not always, a euphemism for sex tourism.  Brochures emphasise a lively night life and may hint at a commerical sex industry.</P>
    <P>Some holiday advertisements silently scream: &ldquo;come where the weather is fine, sex is cheap and available and no questions are asked&rdquo;.  We must let it be known that sex with under age and prepubescent children, no matter where it takes place, no matter how far from home or how blurred the circumstances, is child prostitution and paedophilia, it is illegal and will be exposed and the perpetrators will be imprisoned in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Child prostitution is one of the most serious social problems in less developed countries.  Nobody knows how many child prostitutes there are in these countries.  Thailand has an estimated 100,000 to 200,000 and there are an estimated 200,000 Nepalese girls sold into sexual slavery in Indian brothels.  It is a serious problem in Brazil and Cuba <Col N="360" /> and there are approximately 60,000 children working as prostitutes in the sex industry in the Philippines.  Countries such as Colombia and Sri Lanka have shown a dramatic increase in child prostitution among young boys and girls.</P>
    <P>This afternoon the spokesperson for Jubilee, the English group against child prostitution, said millions of children could be involved in this trade and it is a new form of slavery.  Children enter prostitution principally because they are poor and deprived.  Many have a history of broken homes, alcoholism and physical and sexual abuse by parents.  Many did not succeed at school or their families were to poor to care for them or send them to school.  In certain communities there is a history of providing prostitutes to the sex industry and money received by the children is used as an alternative source of income in otherwise destitute areas.  Other children are naive and hungry for secure relationships and find themselves drawn by pimps and abusers into child prostitution.  A significant number are coerced through the trafficking of women and girls into brothels where they are exposed to an unimaginable level of brutality and exploitation. There is a substantial body of information showing children who are sold into bondage by their parents.  Under this system the children are held as collatoral for high interest loans given to their parents.  The children are used to generate income from sex with visiting tourists.</P>
    <P>These are the victims.  These are the companionable and easy going locals; this is where sex is available and no questions asked.  This is what the paedophile tourist travels for.</P>
    <P>Many children manage to preserve a relationship with their families and send money home from their pathetic livelihood to help educate their brothers and sisters and to support their families. Prostitution is easier and apparently safer and far more lucrative than heavy labouring which would be the lot of <Col N="361" /> many young boys.  Inevitably prostitution leads the child to lose all self-esteem and to stop thinking about the future.  It often leads to bouts of depression and many try to commit suicide.  Many live on the streets or in brothels, take drugs and are exposed to sexually transmitted diseases, including AIDS.</P>
    <P>In some cases brothel owners give girls drugs to pacify them and make them easier to control.  These children face an early death.  UNICEF stated they are particularly vulnerable to infection as their bodies are immature and they are more likely to suffer abrasions during sexual activity.  This facilitates transmission of the virus.  Among many of these young uneducated children AIDS awareness is often low and condoms may not be easily available.  Older and physically stronger clients may insist on unportected sex and a child may not be willing to risk losing a valuable client by insisting that a condom be used.  Research suggests that sex tourists rarely use condoms and frequently have numerous partners.  It will often happen that a sex tourist will be attracted to young prostitutes on the premise that they are less likely to have contracted HIV or other sexually transmitted diseases.  Unfortunately children from rural areas who work as child prostitutes in the cities in South East Asia may bring the disease back to their village.</P>
    <P>We met Fr. Shay Cullen the Irish priest working in Manila who recently appeared on RTE and BBC television programmes.  He recently set up an orphanage in Manila for the street children many of whom work as child prostitutes.  He travels the streets by night to identify, speak with and, in many cases, bring to the protection of the orphanage those children who are preyed upon by sex tourists.  He has seen the pitiable sight of children who have been permanently physically and emotionally damaged by their abusers for as little as £1. At great personal risk he has confronted pimps and recidivist abusers.  He has prevailed upon the Filipino Government to take steps and while there is a <Col N="362" /> will to act and certain measures have been put in place, the scale of the problem is so enormous that he has convinced us the problem must be tackled at source.  I am happy to say that he told us this afternoon that the Filipino Government is going to take further steps and bring in tougher penalties for child prostitution.  It is for reasons promoted by ECPAT and out of conviction, that we presented the Bill to the House.  The cycle must be broken.</P>
    <P>Due to the economic deprivation of these holiday destinations there will be an endless supply of children to feed the lust and demands of the child abuser. On the other hand, child abusers or sex tourists, who incidentally engage in child abuse by having sex with an under age boy or girl, will know that under this legislation they are punishable on return to their home countries.</P>
    <P>Many of the Asian countries to which I referred are taking steps to protect their children and prosecute child abusers but they are confronted by social and economic factors which make their task difficult.  While it is not officially acknowledged some of the police and other enforcement agencies have a direct or indirect interest in the sex tourism trade and are slow to act.  Similarly tourism in many developing countries generates substantial amounts of foreign currency and these countries may become increasingly reliant on revenue from visitors.  Many of them are reluctant to look too closely at the source of this revenue.  Many people who use child prostitutes would not do so in Ireland or in their home countries.  They feel safe from prosecution and often persuade themselves that sex with children or young adolescents is tolerated in such countries.</P>
    <P>The Bill proscribes sexual offences against children committed overseas. These offences carry substantial penalties, including long-terms of imprisonment on conviction.  I am conscious that while offences must carry the strictest penalty, the gravity of the crime and the accusation must be weighed against the rights of the individual under Irish law <Col N="363" /> to receive a fair trial and have the benefit of fair procedures and access to evidence to be used against him.  Two areas we propose to deal with by way of amendment on Committee Stage relate to the evidence necessary to prosecute the offence and the likely defence that may be offered.  These are a mistaken belief of the age of the child and the procedures for giving evidence by or on behalf of the child.</P>
    <P>On the issue of enforcement measures against child abusers, the primary responsibility for protecting children rests with the country in which the children live.  It is not practical for other countries such as Ireland to propose a policing and investigative role unless it is initiated in the country where the offence is committed.  Ireland or the other countries that have implemented this legislation have no wish to usurp the role of the governments in the countries directly concerned.  We rely on their co-operation to tackle this heinous crime.</P>
    <P>There are, however, practical enforcement steps which Ireland can take.  These include ongoing co-operation with Interpol and other intelligence operations directed at paedophilia and child sexual abuse.  Such co-operation has achieved notable successes recently in the area of drug trafficking and can also be applied to the transational offence of child sexual abuse.  Similarly there should be liaison between Customs and Excise personnel and the Garda when child pornography is intercepted.  Often the photographs or videos seized clearly identify their owners engaging in sexual acts with children.  These parties can be prosecuted under this Bill.</P>
    <P>Pornography can be transmitted down telephone lines to computers and access to child pornography on the Internet is not difficult for those who wish to seek it out.  I understand many international agencies and governments are grappling with this issue with a view to presenting workable sanctions <Col N="364" /> against the transmission of such pornography.  The reality of child sexual abuse and paedophilia in sex tourist resorts is graphically set out in the following extract from the ECPAT report from Manila in the Philippines published last May.</P>
    <P>A police raid on four beer houses in one area found 17 of the 55 women working there were minors with ages ranging from 12 to 17.  They all said they were recruited by one known procurer who had been operating brothels in many parts of the metropolis and the provinces for more than 20 years.  They were promised jobs as housemaids in Manila but instead were locked up and forced to have sex with customers.  Virgins were sold for $40 of which $8 was given to the girl and thereafter she was given $1.40.  They work from 12 a.m. to 4 a.m. in rooms above the beer house and average six customers per night. They also earn commissions on drinks.  They have no rest day and the youngest girl who is 12 years old averaged 12 customers per night.</P>
    <P>One 13 year old was stabbed by a customer after she refused to have sex with him for the second time because he did not want to pay again.  The girl had to pay for her own medical treatment from her own earnings.</P>
    <P>Child abuse is ugly and disturbing.  It is a crime against humanity.  It is a new form of slavery.  We have seen the horror of paedophilia uncovered in recent months.  There must be no haven for these people and all children must be protected.</P>

      <P>I commend Deputies Eoin Ryan and O'Donoghue for the work they have put into the preparation of this short but very important Bill.  I have no doubt that all Members support the objectives of the Bill and I am happy to be in a position to confirm that the Government is prepared, in principle, to give its backing to the Bill.  While that is the case, and I am in no way taking from <Col N="365" /> the Bill, there are a number of aspects of the Bill which require amendment before it is permitted to reach the Statute Book; Deputy Ryan has already indicated that there is need for amendments to the Bill.  I will refer to some of these matters later.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Donoghue reminded me that he brought in other Bills that were not taken on board, but the record of the many years of Fianna Fáil in office is not brilliant in terms of accepting Opposition Bills.  The only two I could find in the Department of Justice are the Landlord and Tenant Act, 1994, and the Judicial Separation Act, 1989.  A Bill on foreign adoptions was accepted by a Minister for Health.  I am not, however, quibbling about that.  I intend to accept this legislation and on Committee Stage we will work together to ensure it is a very effective Bill.</P>

      <P>I am very lucky to be the first Minister to accept an Opposition Bill.  The Bill has very appropriately received considerable attention within and outside this House.  It has been strongly supported by organisations with a special interest in protecting the welfare of children.  I know that I speak for all Members of this House when I say that the greatest credit must go to such organisations for highlighting the abominable exploitation of children for the purpose of child prostitution and for their efforts, which very often are undertaken under the most difficult conditions, to abolish that hideous trade.  I pay tribute to organisations such as Trócaire and Jubilee who have raised this issue and to Fr. Shay Cullen of the Columban Fathers.  A number of years ago I visited the Philippines and saw the work being done by people such as Fr. Cullen and other Columbans and missionaries in parts of the world where this trade is continuing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main purpose of the Bill is to ensure that Irish citizens or persons ordinarily resident here who travel <Col N="366" /> abroad for what has become known as child sex tourism and return will find that there is no safe haven for them in this country.  I know that there is a tendency to think that the commercial abuse and exploitation of children is a problem that affects other countries but not our own.  However, Deputies will be aware that information has come to light that implicates Irish people in child sex tourism.  Deputies will also recall that this is an issue that was addressed by the Taoiseach in the House earlier this year when he indicated that he was seeking advice from the Attorney General on the question of extending our criminal jurisdiction to enable prosecutions to be taken against persons who commit sexual offences against children abroad.  Shortly afterwards, Deputies Ryan and O'Donoghue published their Private Member's Bill which covers the topic referred to by the Taoiseach.  In effect, they have removed the need for the Government to introduce its Bill in this area and I thank them for that.</P>
    <P>I am sure that many Deputies will also be aware that the problem of child sex tourism was raised in the Seanad by Senator Henry in the context of the package Holidays and Travel Trade Bill.  What the Senator had in mind was that steps should be taken to render criminal within the State the promotion of sex holidays in other countries involving acts in respect of minors which are criminal offences where they are committed and would be contrary to our law if committed here.</P>
    <P>Child sexual abuse is one of the most horrible of crimes.  We all know of the particular vulnerability of children and their need for our special protection. The process of safeguarding children from sexual exploitation has been significantly strengthened in this country and many others in recent years.  This is a development that will be welcomed by every right minded person.  Unfortunately, however, it has become the case that paedophiles are now travelling to certain parts of the world, and Asia in particular, where child protection laws <Col N="367" /> are not as stringent or as strictly enforced as in their own countries.  The greater ease of travel between distant parts of the world and organised tourism have contributed to this phenomenon and have actually led to the situation in which an industry has developed to cater specifically for the provision of child sex for foreign tourists.</P>
    <P>Child sex tourism is very closely linked to the problem of child prostitution throughout the world.  While the causes of this form of prostitution are varied, it is clear that it arises mainly from the acute poverty that exists in certain countries.  Such poverty can give rise to the most primitive living conditions, illiteracy, under-education and a lack of employment opportunities.  Seeking to take advantage of persons who are struggling to survive under these circumstances, agents acting for brothels and other establishments often coerce or entice parents to surrender a child on the basis of a small sum of money. Sometimes a promise is made to parents that a child will be given a legitimate job.  Instead the reality is that the child is sold into prostitution.  Financial pressures can also mean that it is very difficult to maintain family units.  One of the consequences is that children are made homeless, which greatly increases their vulnerability to pimps and exploitation.</P>
    <P>As I have already mentioned, today it is a relatively simple matter to travel to even the most distant countries with the result that journeys that at one time would take weeks or even months to complete can now be undertaken in a single day.  This has undoubtedly led directly to the establishment and development of sex tourism which involves the systematic and deliberate exploitation of children who are forced into prostitution.  In particular, the United Nations Working Group on Contemporary Forms of Slavery has recognised that child prostitution is connected with mass tourism.  Furthermore the Ecumenical Coalition on Third World Tourism investigated tourism and child prostitution in a number of <Col N="368" /> Asian countries and concluded that tourism is now very closely linked with the acceleration, and in some cases is the cause, of child prostitution.  In certain countries it has been established that child prostitution was introduced by tourism while in others it would appear that tourism is aggravating an existing problem and is providing an attraction for paedophiles.</P>
    <P>I know that many Members will be aware that the enforcement of the law relating to child sexual abuse in countries that attract sex tourists has not been very successful in the past.  One of the reasons for this appears to be that the local enforcement authorities are often reluctant to enforce the laws against foreign tourists.  Furthermore the relevant authorities may not have the resources that are required to enable them to operate effectively. Another difficulty that has arisen is that even when an offence has been detected and pursued the only sanctions that have been imposed in some cases are deportation and a fine which can allow the offender to travel to another country to continue the abuse of children.</P>
    <P>I understand that the issue of child sexual abuse is one that has been highlighted and is being pursued in many of the countries in question and I would sincerely hope that the steps that are being taken in that regard will lead to the situation where all forms of exploitation of children for sexual purposes will be eliminated in those countries.  I am sure Deputies will appreciate that the solutions to the problems that arise in those countries lie essentially with those countries themselves and that there is a limit to what can be achieved by other states who wish to put an end to the evil trade of sex tourism.</P>
    <P>That being said, however, there is no doubt but that the international community has a role to play in eliminating child sex tourism and the problem has been recognised internationally as one that creates obligations for all states, especially where their nationals are involved.  In response to the problem a worldwide campaigning organisation <Col N="369" /> has been set up to tackle the issue of child prostitution on a number of fronts. The organisation, which is called End Child Prostitution in Asia &mdash; ECPAT &mdash; has offices in many countries and works closely with organisations such as UNICEF and Interpol and also with tourism agencies.  In addition to directing efforts towards the receiving countries where the offences take place, ECPAT has been lobbying the governments of the major sending countries from which many of the offenders travel in order to avail of child prostitution.</P>
    <P>Deputies may be aware that the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child places general obligations on states to take action both at national and international level to protect children from sexual exploitation and abuse.  This is not an obligation that is confined to child nationals or a particular state.  Article 34 of the convention refers to the protection of children from all forms of sexual abuse and requires states to take all appropriate national, bilateral, and multilateral measures to prevent the inducement or coercion of a child to engage in any unlawful sexual activity and the exploitation of children in prostitution or other unlawful sexual practices.  Furthermore, in 1993, the United Nations World Conference on Human Rights stressed the need for states to address the problem of exploitation and abuse of children and to provide effective measures against harmful child labour, sale of children, child prostitution and other forms of sexual abuse.</P>
    <P>The United Nations Commission on Human Rights and the Working Group on Contemporary Forms of Slavery has adopted a programme for the prevention of the sale of children and child prostitution which called <i>inter alia</i>, for sending and receiving countries to adopt measures to prevent sex tourism.  In response to these initiatives a number of states have recently enacted new laws to combat child sex tourism.  Up to recently we had no reason to believe that Irish people were involved in this repulsive trade either as promoters or as <Col N="370" /> sex tourists.  Even if only a handful of Irish people are so involved, it is incumbent on us as legislators to take action. The Bill introduced by Deputies Eoin Ryan and O'Donoghue provides a welcome opportunity for us to legislate in this area and to play our part in the fight against child sex tourism.</P>
    <P>Before I proceed to discuss the provisions of the Bill there are two specific points I should make.  First, I would remind the House that special provisions which are designed to assist and to safeguard the interests of rape victims are provided for under the rape Acts. For example, I am sure Deputies will be familiar with the requirement that, save in exceptional circumstances, the identity of a complainant in a rape case cannot be disclosed.  While the current Bill allows prosecutions to be taken in respect of rape offences committed against children abroad, the particular portions of the rape Acts I have referred to would not apply.  This is a matter that needs to be addressed and I would hope that the appropriate result could be achieved by way of a relatively straightforward change to the Bill.</P>
    <P>Second, I would like to draw attention to the fact that the Bill makes no provision in relation to powers of arrest, despite the fact that, if one of the offences with which it is primarily concerned were committed within the State, a person suspected of having committed it could be arrested without a warrant by a member of the Garda Síochána. This could, of course, be very significant.  For example, if a garda was to meet a person against whom there was clear evidence that he or she had been involved in a child sexual abuse case in another country the garda could not, under the terms of the Bill as it stands at present, arrest the person.  Instead the garda would have to apply to a judge of the Distict Court for a warrant to carry out the arrest.  It is not difficult to envisage the problems that could arise under those conditions and the result could well be that a person who may have carried out sexual abuse against children could escape justice.  I am convinced it is <Col N="371" /> essential that a specific power to arrest persons reasonably suspected of having committed offences to which the Bill applies should be conferred on the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>I would now like to turn to the provisions of the Bill before the House. Deputies will be aware that what it sets out to do is to extend our criminal jurisdiction to certain sexual offences that are committed against children in other jurisdictions.  The general principle on which our criminal law operates is that our courts can exercise jurisdiction in respect of every criminal offence that is committed within the State, regardless of the nationality or the domicile of the offender but, subject to a number of exceptions, they cannot deal with offences committed elsewhere.  This would mean, for example, that a person who travels to another country for child sex tourist purposes could not be tried for any sexual abuse they may have engaged in while they were outside the jurisdiction.  The effect of the Bill would be to make it possible to convict an Irish citizen or a person who has resided here for more than 12 months of a number of offences linked to child sexual abuse where such offences took place abroad.</P>
    <P>As I indicated, the Government is prepared to accept the thinking behind the Bill, but we are satisfied that it gives rise to a number of specific issues that need to be teased out further and are likely to require changes to be made to the Bill.  In raising these issues, I would like to make it clear that I am not seeking, in any sense, to question the good work that the Deputies have done in framing the Bill but, and I believe this is a view that would be accepted on all sides of the House, that it is essential that all possible steps should be taken to ensure that the legislation, when it is enacted, will be as effective as possible and that it will be consistent with out existing law on sexual offences committed against children.  In this respect I have welcomed the recognition by Deputy Eoin Ryan that some amendments to the Bill are required.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="372" /> The first point I would like to make with regard to the specific provisions of the Bill relates to section 2 (1).  This subsection refers to the commission of offences against a child under the age of 18 years in another jurisdiction.  Access by authorities to proof of the age of the child is an area which appears to require particular attention and it has not been dealt with in the Bill.  In that context it must be borne in mind that the vast majority of the children in question will not be living with their families and they may in fact be street children.  In the circumstances it can be expected that the normal means of proving age, which is a birth certificate, will not be available and that alternative methods of proof will have to be resorted to.  This is a matter that has been tackled in Australian legislation and it is undoubtedly one that should also be considered for the purposes of the Bill.  I might mention, for the information of Deputies, that the relevant Australian provisions allow certain material to be treated as admissible evidence for the purpose of determining the age of a victim, or his or her age at a particular time, including the following: the person's appearance; medical or scientific opinion and a document that is or appears to be an official or medical record from a country outside Australia.</P>
    <P>The problem of proving the age of a child who has been sexually abused in another country is much more than an academic point and it is one that has already led to the acquittal of persons who have been tried for sex tourist offences.  For example, the absence of a birth certificate to prove whether a young girl was below the age for sexual consent in the Philippines resulted in the quashing of the conviction of a foreign national for her rape in 1990.  Furthermore, one of the major hurdles experienced by Swedish authorities gathering evidence in Thailand to bring to trial a Swedish citizen was the obtaining of the key witness's birth certificate to prove that he was under age at the time the offence was committed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="373" /> I would also like to refer Deputies specifically to section 3 which creates a range of offences under the Bill. Obviously the main offences are those which are covered by subsection (1) and which relate to acts of sexual abuse committed against children abroad.  In addition, the section goes on to provide in subsections (2) and (4) for separate offences arising out of aiding and abetting etc., or conspiracy in relation to subsection (1) offence.</P>
    <P>I am sure that from the point of view of taking effective action against child sex tourism, Members would be anxious that the promoters of that evil trade should be liable to prosecution and to very severe punishment.  As Deputies will recall, this is the specific point that Senator Henry sought to deal with when she tabled amendments to the Package Holidays and Travel Trade Bill mentioned.  I would be concerned, however, that the Deputies' Bill does not go far enough in that regard.</P>
    <P>While it is clear that the provisions of subsections (2) and (4) of section 3 would catch a person who organises a child sex tourist visit abroad for the purpose of sexual abuse against a particular child, I understand that it may be open to question whether these provisions could be successfully applied in a situation where arrangements are made for a person to travel to another country but the identity of the child or children who may be abused is not known to the person who actually makes the arrangements for the abuser.  As Deputies will appreciate, this is likely to be the position in the vast majority of cases. Accordingly, I believe there is urgent need to consider subsections (2) and (4) of section 3 further and, if necessary, to extend their scope to ensure that anyone involved in providing child sex tourism services for others will be subject to the full rigours of our criminal law in all cases.</P>
    <P>The next issue I would like to address is the question of double jeopardy <Col N="374" /> covered in section 4 (1). That subsection merely provides that nothing in the Bill shall affect the legal principle of double jeopardy.  I have some concerns about that provision I would like to share with this House.</P>
    <P>Firstly, and I accept that it might be considered a relatively minor point, it would not be appropriate to refer to the legal principle of double jeopardy in a Bill or a statute.  On the basis of decisions from the High Court and the Supreme Court, it appears to be established that the rule against double jeopardy has a constitutional basis and, accordingly, it should not be classified as a mere legal principle by the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>More importantly, however, I can foresee serious practical difficulties arising with section 4 (1) as currently worded.  As Deputies will be aware, the principle against double jeopardy is designed to ensure that a person who has been tried for a particular offence cannot be tried again for the offence in question.  The main purpose of the principle is to protect individuals from spurious prosecutions.  As I said, section 4 (1) refers simply to the principle of double jeopardy and it does not specify whether the principle is to apply in respect of criminal proceedings taken in this country or in another jurisdiction.  One interpretation of the provision would be that it would be open to our courts to try a person in respect of offences already prosecuted abroad but not where the person had previously been convicted or acquitted in this country.  Such an interpretation would undoubtedly give rise to constitutional difficulties and to eliminate any such difficulties it will be necessary to amend the relevant portion of the Bill.  I might, in passing, mention that the equivalent Australian legislation has set out the double jeopardy principle in full.  From the point of view of clarity and legal certainty of which I am aware the proposers of this legislation want to be assured that a similar approach should be adopted in this Bill.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="375" /> I note that section 4 (2) provides that Part III of the Criminal Evidence Act, 1992, shall apply to offences created by the Bill.  While I may have some doubts about the precise wording the Deputies have used in the subsection I welcome this provision.</P>
    <P>Deputies may recall that part III of the 1992 Act has made it easier for witnesses to give evidence in cases involving physical or sexual abuse.  In particular, it allows evidence to be given by live television link.  Questions put to witnesses under 17 may be conveyed through a competent person appointed by the court.  Furthermore, where the evidence of such witnesses for a preliminary examination of the offence has been video-recorded they may not have to give evidence at the trial and we realise how important that would be in some cases.  In addition a video-recording of statements made to the Garda Síochána or other competent persons by victims under 14 of physical abuse may be admitted in evidence.  The operation of the relevant provisions is subject to the control of the court and any evidence must be excluded if in the interests of justice it ought not to be admitted.</P>
    <P>Before I proceed further, it would be appropriate to deal with certain points that arise in the context of the Schedule to the Bill.  Briefly, the Schedule contains a list of offences in respect of which jurisdiction would be conferred on our courts where the offence in question is committed abroad by an Irish citizen or a person ordinarily resident here against a person under the age of 18.  The list is a comprehensive one which embraces a very wide range of offences and, understandably, I have no difficulty with it from that point of view. I should mention, however, that the Schedule appears to have been prepared without reference to recent legislation enacted in the field of sexual offences and contains two specific offences which have, in fact, been repealed.</P>
    <P>As Deputies may recall, the Criminal <Col N="376" /> Law (Sexual Offences) Act, 1993, introduced by a Government of which Deputy O'Donoghue's party was a member, repealed section 4 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1935 and the offence of buggery, save in so far as it does not involve animals, under section 61 of the Offences against the Person Act, 1861.  Offences under section 4 of the 1935 Act and section 61 of the 1861 Act are included in the list of offences set out in the Schedule to the Bill and there is no doubt that, in the light of the 1993 Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act, they should be deleted.  I am sure Deputies will agree.</P>
    <P>In addition, I suggest that the Schedule should be amended to include the offence provided for in sections 3, 4 and 5 of the 1993 Act.  I do not think there is any need for me to spell out the relevant sections in any detail but I should mention that section 3 is concerned with buggery of persons under 17 years of age; section 4 deals with acts of gross indecency with males under 17 and section 5 has created a number of specific offences in connection with the protection of mentally impaired persons from sexual abuse.</P>
    <P>Deputies will appreciate from what I have said that additional work will be required on this Bill before it is enacted. Deputy Ryan made it clear that he believes more work is required.  In that connection I propose to bring forward a number of amendments to deal with the points I raised with a view to strengthening the text and to make sure that it will prove to be as effective as possible.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to my staff in the Department of Justice who have worked continuously since this Bill was put forward as a Private Members motion at the end of last week.  It required a great deal of speedy work to examine the legislation to enable me bring to the attention of the House today some of the issues in the Bill we need to strengthen to ensure that the work done by Deputies Ryan and O'Donoghue is as effective as possible when this Bill is passed into law.</P>
    <P>As I indicated, the Government is <Col N="377" /> happy to support the Bill subject to the amendments outlined above and others that Deputies may wish to table when they have had an opportunity to consider the available literature.  I believe that when it is in operation it will place Ireland in the forefront of the fight against the scourge of child sex tourism and I look forward to its enactment as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>I thank the two Deputies who have put the work into this Bill.  I am aware that they, like me, have had an opportunity to speak to people such as Fr. Shay Cullen about the issue.  When one reads, and it is not reading one enjoys, in the report on child prostitution in the Philippines prepared by Fr. Shay Cullen of a security guard at the Subic free port brought to court for the sexual abuse of a three year old he picked up on the streets, one must commend the Deputies for their diligence and work in this regard.  I hope when we complete Committee Stage that we will have put effective legislation on our Statute Book.</P>

      <P>I commend my colleagues on these benches for their initiative in introducing this Bill.  I know the commendable hard work Deputies O'Donoghue and Ryan put into it. Inside and outside the House it has unanimous support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a difficult topic.  As the Minister and my colleagues indicated, many people here do not believe such things happen.  An estimated one million children are forced into child prostitution world-wide and globally as many as ten million could be ensalved into child prostitution, the sex industry, pornography and sex tourism.  That is an awful indictment of the First World against the Second and Third Worlds.  Poverty is often the reason young girls and boys <Col N="378" /> are sold by their families who are desperate for money.  If there were no need for such services, that element in out society would not exist.  In a world where some countries do not comply fully with the UN Convention on the rights of children and where there is corruption, particularly within their law enforcement and police force, we need to impose legislation here to ensure that perpetrators are brought to justice.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to accept there is a sex tourism industry but we know it exists. Increased tourism should have benefited countries such as Brazil and Thailand but it has contributed to the growth in numbers of child prostitutes and children who are sexually abused.  People in this country are sick when they read of the ages at which children are abused and in prostitution.  In Thailand a ten-year-old girl was sold by her mother for $200.  That shows the extent of poverty and depravity.</P>
    <P>Fr. Shay Cullen has put his life at risk in going against authorities.  Everyone in the House commends what he tries to do.  He has documented the fact that a four-year-old girl was sold for sex to US sailors.  There was uproar in the Philippines some months ago regarding the rape of a young Filipino.  I am pleased the US authorities saw fit to allow a prosecution to take place.  It is a sad indictment of a strong nation that such things happen.  Were it not for the people themselves being empowered, this issue could have gone unnoticed. With a view to ensuring that does not happen I am pleased this legislation is before the House for discussion.</P>
    <P>The amendments to which Deputy Eoin Ryan has spoken can be discussed at a late date and I will leave the legal people on both sides to address them. Only minor amendments need to be introduced.  The tougher the measures the better.  It will be difficult to ascertain what type of operator is involved specifically in this trade.  Some tour operators will say they cannot be held responsible for what happens outside their jurisdiction.  A strong warning should go out that these things are not <Col N="379" /> acceptable in this country and that the perpetrators will be brought to justice. We will all reiterate that there is no safe haven for these people here and we stand firm on that commitment.</P>
    <P>We have had to deal with many issues we did not really want to discuss over the years.  I am pleased that issues such as child abuse have come into the open. One of the recommendations arising from the investigation into the Kilkenny incest case was that there should be inter-country co-operation.  My colleagues have taken that recommendation on board.  Co-operation between nations should be firmed up to bring the perpetrators to justice by allowing the courts to deal with them.  Many countries will not deal with these offences. They turn a blind eye to them and will not prosecute people who bring hard currency into their countries for the wrong reasons.</P>
    <P>We have all heard in recent years about the increase in infectious diseases, HIV and hepatitis.  Even from a selfish point of view it is difficult to understand why people leave themselves open to catching and spreading such diseases not only among young people in nations such as the Philippines, Brazil and the street children in Latin America but in the First World.</P>
    <P>There are grave concerns in the former Eastern European countries that such trade is now commencing.  I sincerely hope the introduction of legislation in all countries will bring child prostitution and the sex tourism to an end.</P>
    <P>We are all good at attending conferences and signing UN conventions. In view of the fact that over 120 states ratified the UN convention on the rights of the child it is hard to believe that child prostitution is on the increase. Article 34 of that UN convention states specifically that parties undertake to protect the child from all forms of sexual exploitation and sexual abuse.  For these purposes, state parties shall, in particular, take appropriate national, bilateral and multilateral measures to <Col N="380" /> prevent the coercion of children in unlawful sexual activity, the use of children in prostitution or other unlawful sexual practices and the use of children in pornographic performances and material.  It is hard to believe that many nations have not even introduced legislation which would allow for multilateral and bilateral measures to address this problem.  Certainly, national measures to combat child prostitution are lacking and further international co-operation is needed in dealing with this issue.  In the Third World there are many problems in regard to child poverty, children living on the streets, lack of education, lack of information and exploitation.  Many countries like to support Third World charities and try to take children off the street, to address poverty and to introduce education. Many of us felt that travel would bring hard currency into countries and that those countries would benefit but it is sad that many people travel to such countries for other reasons and exploit one of the world's greatest assets, our children.</P>
    <P>I wholeheartedly congratulate my two colleagues for taking this initiative.  I am pleased the Government has seen fit to accept it.  I hope there will be a further teasing out of one or two amendments. It is a matter of tidying up some matters with some minor amendments.  I am delighted we can hold our heads up high and ensure there are no safe havens for such people in this country.  This message has been spelt out loud and clear in the debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Coughlan for sharing her time.  I wholeheartedly join in welcoming the Bill and in complimenting the Minister for her wise and generous decision to back this legislation which was drafted by Deputies John O'Donoghue and Eoin Ryan on the Fianna Fáil Opposition benches.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In common with other speakers.  I must admit when I first came into the House in 1989 and my party was in Government, there were occasions <Col N="381" /> when I was anything but happy to vote against Opposition proposals with which I agreed in principle.  I was happy when my party surprised most people by accepting legislative proposals from the Opposition which are now enshrined on the Statute Book as vital components of our laws.  I look forward to further developments of this nature and I urge my party to continue the process when it returns to Government.  It cannot be said at any time that all wisdom is confined to one side of the House.</P>
    <P>It is a sad reflection on mankind that this Bill is necessary, but, unfortunately, this is very much the case.  Earlier speakers eloquently described the horrific trade which has developed in the evil practice of exploiting innocent children.  At a time when the clergy of Ireland has been the target of widespread criticism because of the sins of a few in the area of child sexual abuse, it is heartening to note, as the Minister and Deputy Ryan pointed out, the heroic role of our missionaries abroad in fearlessly highlighting any type of abuse of the rights and dignities of human beings.</P>
    <P>Regarding the area covered by the Bill, it was an Irish Columban Father who exposed, in a global fashion, the extent of the menace.  Through his research, Deputy Ryan has given the House some horrendous figures, which will be read in newspapers all over the country tomorrow, which demonstrate how extreme this abuse is and how it has been tolerated in other countries throughout the world.  One product of widespread child prostitution is the obvious danger of the spread of AIDS, not only among the children themselves but through them to all who exploit them and so on in a deadly chain reaction.</P>
    <P>It is ironic that child sexual abuse has been the focus of much debate in Ireland in recent months.  The Bill deals with our problem which is magnified by millions in countries in Asia, South America and eastern Europe where there is child prostitution.  I am convinced there is child prostitution in</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="382" /> Ireland, although not on the same scale. If people from this country are ever to become part of a rescue operation abroad, it would be a great help if we started by greatly extending the facilities and therapy available to the victims of child abuse here.</P>
    <P>I was appalled to hear a woman on the radio today who was a victim of sexual abuse as a child.  She underwent group therapy which cost £30 a session and she made the point that not enough facilities are available in this country to back up the victims of child sexual abuse.  She could not afford the treatment.  She mentioned another startling fact.  Paedophiles, she said, may be sentenced to a certain number of years but her sentence is lifelong.  We do not fully take the victims of child abuse into consideration when we talk so eloquently about it.</P>
    <P>As people, we have been asked to forgive the perpetrators of many heinous crimes in this country.  As a rule, we are very forgiving people.  I regard myself as a forgiving person but what if it happened to my seven year old boy?  What if it happened to one's little boy or girl? I cannot say how responsible I would be for my actions if it happened to my family.  We do not fully understand the horrendous effect of child sexual abuse on victims.</P>
    <P>Deputy Coughlan mentioned that we have been inundated with writings on child sexual abuse in recent months.  We have been shocked by the type and amount of cases but we must hope some good will follow the exposure of this evil.  This is the first positive legislation in this regard in this island and hopefully it will be a message to the world that we will not tolerate these fiends any longer.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ryan said that the Bill targets tour organisers and traders in child pornography in section 3 (2).  I hope our tour organisers are not directly involved in this type of operation.  Previously, there were sun holiday, golf and other types of tourists in addition to sex tourists.  It is now clear that tourists go to certain parts of the world to sexually <Col N="383" /> abuse children.  These people do not deserve any hiding place and it must be made known that sex with underage boys and girls, regardless of where it takes place, how far it is from home and how blurred the circumstances &mdash; and paedophilia &mdash; is illegal.  It will be exposed and the perpetrators imprisoned in Ireland.</P>
    <P>It has been stated recently that the Minister is dealing with this area comprehensively in the Child Sexual Offences Bill.  Certain parts of the legislation have not matched expectations and we hope the advent of this Bill, which the Minister has generously accepted, will ensure that Ireland leads the way in this area.  We will be able to say to the rest of the world that we showed the way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for allowing me to raise this particularly important matter.  I have an intimate knowledge of this subject because I live in the town and I am pleased that the Minister of State, Deputy Coveney, is in the House to reply because he is a Cork Minister and familiar with the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Clonakilty has been subject to repeated tidal and fresh water flooding for many years.  In 1991, the Department of the Environment sanctioned the appointment of consulting engineers, M.C. O'Sullivan, to look at ways and means of resolving this problem and <Col N="384" /> their report made two essential recommendations. It recommended the construction of a tidal barrage of Clonakilty Bay to prevent tidal flooding and reduce the risk of freshwater flooding.  The consultants also emphasised that any flood relief works which did not include the construction of a tidal barrage would prove unsatisfactory.  The report also emphasised that, in the construction of the barrage, care would have to be taken to allow for the wildlife habitat in the mud flats in Clonakilty Bay.  This would have to be observed in any measures being taken in the bid to prevent tidal flooding.</P>
    <P>The second recommendation was to reduce the volume of surface water flooding in the eastern end of the town and the report proposed the construction of a new drainage system by way of sealed pipes into the tide at the eastern end of the town.  The cost involved for the sealed pipe system is approximately £87,000 and the tidal barrage would cost approximately £1.5 million.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to give consideration to providing the £87,000 which, on the face of it, is not a great deal of money.  There is a serious flooding problem in Clonakilty.  Sandbags are at the ready all the time and earlier this year, when there was a serious flood, it caused a great amount of damage, including damage to some local authority houses.</P>
    <P>I have been given the excuse on a number of occasions that this is the responsibility of the Department of the Environment, the Department of the Marine or the Office of Public Works. If we could get £87,000 from any source with a view to considering the construction of a barrage at a later stage, I would be happy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Coveney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am interested to hear the Deputy's comments on the flooding problems in Clonakilty.  He obviously knows more about that than anybody else, and certainly more than I do.  I am aware of the <Col N="385" /> problems nonetheless.  Unfortunately, it mirrors in genereal terms the problems in many areas throughout the country which suffer flooding on a regular basis. Indeed, it was for this purpose that the Government introduced the Arterial Drainage (Amendment) Act, 1995, earlier this year.  This Act amended the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945, under which the powers of the Commissioners of Public works to undertake drainage works were derived, and gave the commissioners new powers to undertake drainage schemes for the relief of localised flooding.</P>
      <P>Some nine areas around the country, for which enough data was available to commence immediate designs for flood relief schemes, were identified for priority consideration under the 1995 Act.  They are as follows: Carlow Town &mdash;the Barrow River catchment; Cappa-more, County Limerick, and Newport, County Tipperary&mdash;the Mulcair River catchment; Duleek, County Meath&mdash;the Nanny River catchment; Dunmanway, County Cork&mdash;The Bandon River catchment; Gort Town, County Galway &mdash;the Gort River catchment; Kilkenny City&mdash;the Nore River catchment; Six-milebridge, County Clare&mdash;the Owenogarney River catchment; Williamstown, County Galway&mdash;the Corrib-Clare-Suck River catchments and Belclare, near Tuam, County Galway, where a smaller scheme than the others has already been undertaken.</P>
      <P>Apart from the Belclare scheme, the eight remaining areas previously mentioned for immediate attention form the current drainage flood relief programme and designs of schemes for all eight are in course of preparation and, in a number of instances, are practically complete.  It is likely that existing commitments to these schemes will absorb all the available resources in 1996.</P>
      <P>Approximately 90 other areas around the country, which also suffer flooding on a regular basis, among which is</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="386" /> Clonakilty, have been identified for consideration for localised flood relief schemes.  It is intended that these will be prioritised shortly and form the basis for a national drainage-flood relief programme to be undertaken on an ongoing basis.</P>
    <P>In that context, I give an undertaking to Deputy Walsh that I will bear the problems in Clonakilty, with which I am familiar, in mind.  I am familiar also with the fact that some years ago Cork County Council commissioned consultants, with the agreement of the Department of the Environment, to study the problems in Clonakilty.  The conclusions to which the Deputy referred are the same as I understand them to be.</P>
    <P>The Deputy appreciates reality because in mentioning the cost of the tidal barrage in Clonakilty Bay of £1.5 million, he is concentrating initially in reducing the surface water problem in the town to a figure which is easier to contemplate, £87,000.  If the £87,000 scheme to reduce the surface water were to make a substantial contribution to improving the local flooding problem, it would be easier to prioritise that and contemplate carrying it out on the compeltion of the other eight or nine schemes.</P>
    <P>I cannot give the Deputy any undertaking in regard to an expenditure of £1.5 million for a tidal barrage, which is a major work of engineering.  Given the historical budgets of the Office of Public Works, that would be a difficult scheme to finance within our budget.  However, I will examine in the near future the question of the surface water aspect of this scheme and perhaps we can slot it in after the completion of the other schemes, perhaps in 1997.</P>

      <P>Thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for allowing me to raise this matter on the Adjournment and I thank the Minister of State for coming into the House this evening to reply.</P>
      <P>Since the present principal took over at Waterpark College in August 1990, the school has gone from strength to strength.  This is due to two factors, first, they way the present incumbent has gone about this task and, second, the explosion in the population of this parish in the city.</P>
      <P>Waterpark College is situated in Lower Newtown, on the main Waterford to Dunmore East road.  This road has become the busiest road in the southeast over the past number of years, if not in the country.  I remember some years ago hearing daily reports on RTE about traffic problems on the Ennis road in Limerick.  The problem was so bad it became something of a national joke.  Eventually, action was taken to improve matters.  For some reason, best known to it, RTE tends to ignore Waterford city when giving traffic reports but if it did not, I am sure the Dunmore road would be mentioned every day and would now attract the same notoriety nationally as the Ennis road did previously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I mention this roads problem to highlight the additional demands that have arisen in this part of the city on all services, not just educational establishments.  The Minister of State may recall <Col N="388" /> that I previously raised the pressing need for additional accommodation at Ballygunner national school which was subsequently sanctioned.  That school is in the same parish as Waterpark College.  If it is necessary to provide additional accommodation at primary level, it follows there is a need for additional accommodation at secondary level.</P>
    <P>Waterpark College is experiencing an accommodation shortfall of critical proportions.  At the beginning of the next academic year pupils will have to be refused entry as short-term measures will not be adequate to tackle the scale of the problem being experienced.  Arising from sustained enrolment increases, the college must, as a matter of urgency, seek the immediate inclusion in the 1996 Estimates of capital funding in respect of the schedule of accommodation already agreed with the planning and building unit of the Department of Education.</P>
    <P>The enrolment for the 1995-96 academic year is 400 approximately. When this is compared to projections submitted in July 1994 it can be seen that the college has exceeded its target enrolment figures a full year ahead of schedule.  While, in one way, this is welcome and clear proof that its case merits immediate attention it nevertheless consigns the college which has a proud tradition and an ever increasing enrolment to the severest accommodation shortfall.</P>
    <P>The original accommodation capacity was 200, but the college projects an enrolment of 450 approximately.  Apart from the accommodation shortfall, this has created administrative problems: teaching difficulties because of the lack of space; problems with storage and catering; a shortage of toilet facilities for teachers; a lack of language facilities; no specialist rooms, such as a computer room, audio-visul room, technology room, lunch room, wet day shelter or social area.  There is a derelict prefabricated science laboratory and one outdoor toilet block comprised of six cubicles for 400 pupils.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="389" /> I am informed that the case made by the college authorities for additional accommodation has already been accepted by officials in the Department. However, the sacrifices made by all connected with the college will amount to nothing unless it is examined at ministerial level as a matter of urgency.</P>

      <P>I am grateful to the Deputy for giving me this opportunity to clarify the position concerning the provision of additional accommodation at Waterpark College, Waterford city.  In 1994, the school principal brought to the attention of the Department the serious lack of suitable accommodation at this school.  This accommodation problem has occurred as a result of a number of factors as follows: the school is located in an area of Waterford where considerable housing development has and still is taking place; the school was built for a capacity of 200 pupil places, but current enrolments are in excess of this and expected to rise to more than double this year; the school is expected to retain its pupils for the foreseeable future and, therefore, occupies a &ldquo;niche in the market&rdquo; which will hold pupil numbers.</P>
      <P>As a result of these findings, the Department's planning section projects a long-term enrolment of 425 pupil places and additional permanent accommodation will be provided on that basis.</P>
      <P>In July this year a schedule of residual accommodation and a schedule of suggested future use of existing accommodation was agreed by the school authorities.  The extension will be 1,573 metres square and is estimated to cost in excess of £1 million.</P>
      <P>The school authorities have nominated their design team which is currently being examined by the post primary's professional staff.  It is hoped to begin the architectural planning of this extension early next month.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am fully aware of the urgent need for this extension at Waterpark College and I will ensure that every effort is made to commence the architectural <Col N="390" /> planning of this extension so that the new building may proceed at the earliest opportunity.</P>

      <P>This matter relates to the heroic efforts of teachers and parents alike since 1978 to have a new vocational school provided in Milford, County Donegal.  The original school was built almost 40 years ago to cater for 95 students.  The present enrolment is 441 and growing steadily.</P>
      <P>As far back as October 1984 the Department authorised County Donegal vocational education committee to purchase a seven acre site approved by Mr. Noel Montayne, co-ordinator of the Department's building unit.  The parents made a substantial contribution towards the cost of the site which was purchased in the summer of 1985.</P>
      <P>During the following seven years the number of pupils continued to grow. During this period there was a prolonged debate on a proposal to incorporate the school as part of a community school with the Loreto College. Finally, in December 1992 the Minister for Education, Deputy Séamus Brennan, gave a written commitment to build a new vocational school for 500 pupils.  A little over a year later the current Minister authorised the planning of a new school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the summer of 1994 there has been a lack of progress by the Department in moving to stages three and four of the architectural planning of the project.  County Donegal vocational education committee has been waiting with <Col N="391" /> growing impatience and concern for sanction.  It has written to the Department on five occasions between 27 July and 7 November.  A mood of desperation has now set in.  In its most recent letter its chief executive officer, Mr. Seán Ó Longáin, has pleaded that the Department should convey written approval to proceed to stages three and four as a matter of the greatest urgency, in time for its forthcoming meeting on Monday, 20 November.</P>
    <P>I sincerely hope the reason for the delay in recent months is not related to the efforts of the Minister's colleague, the Minister for Finance, to get her to drastically reduce her Department's Estimate because the children of Milford deserve better.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter.  It gives me the opportunity to outline the current position regarding the present and future position of post-primary education in Milford.  There are two post primary schools in Milford, namely, Loreto College and the vocational school.  The current enrolment in these schools is 1,086.</P>
      <P>The organisation of post primary facilities in this centre has been the subject of much discussion over a number of years, mainly directed at achieving a single school development.  However, early in 1994 my Department decided that the Loreto College be redesignated as a community school and that a new replacement vocational school to cater for 500 pupils should be provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is expected that the new community school will be effective from early 1996. The developments in relation to the new vocational school are as follows: in early 1994 a schedule of accommodation to provide for 500 pupils was agreed with County Donegal Vocational Education Committee.  A design team was appointed by the vocational education committee and architectural planning was initiated in summer 1994.  Following a series of informal discussions and consultations with my Department's technical staff, stages I and II documentation <Col N="392" /> required under my Department's design team procedures was submitted earlier this year for formal approval by the Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Mr. McDaid Mr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>That occurred on 27 July.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct.  As a result of detailed examination of this submission by my Department's technical staff, the Department wrote to the vocational education committee seeking further information and made a number of suggestions in relation to the project. The current situation is that my Department's technical advisers are examining a revised joint Stage I and II planning submission in respect of this project.</P>
      <P>In relation to the last point that Deputy McDaid raised, the question of proceeding to construction will depend on the availability of capital funding when the planning process is complete.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>There seems to be a lack of proper financial controls at the highest levels in some of the State companies.  Take the latest disclosures in relation to what has been happening in CIE, our national transport company, for example.  The ex-chairman of the company was able to undertake foreign trips at the company's expense, even after he left office. He was in a position while chairman to send family members on trips to America at the company's expense and apparently he allowed another relative to use his free travel pass on British Rail, <Col N="393" /> something that would be a sacking offence for an ordinary employee of the company.</P>

      <P>It is also not possible for the group now to identify the purpose or the business reasons, if any, for the trip.

      <P>The Minister will be replying after me and it us up to him to indicate whether he can confirm what I am saying.  I want to hear his view on this matter.</P>
      <P>It says little for the management ethos prevailing in CIE that abuses of this kind should be allowed.  It says little for this Government's management of the semi-State sector that the same individual is allowed to continue as a board member of another State company, Aer Rianta.  Clearly there is something wrong in CIE.  Amid a great fanfare of publicity the Minister, Deputy Lowry, appointed a new chairman and chief executive to the company earlier this year.  Now, a very short time later, the newspapers are full of speculation as to whether the new chairman is about to pack it in and resign.  Apparently he believes that boardroom divisions are such that he cannot implement the changes to put CIE on a sound financial footing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the meantime the company goes along its merry way, blissfully unaware of any kind of commercial reality.  It sits on huge under-utilised property assets, it engages in cut throat competition with another State monopoly, An Post, for road haulage contracts, it engages in competition with itself, running nonstop express bus services on the same routes as its own trains.  The company has yet to publish a timetable for the completion of the Dublin rapid transit system and there is now great danger that this project will not be completed in time to qualify for full European funding.  CIE soaks up £100 million of taxpayers' money every year.  There is a management malaise in the company and the Minister needs to sort it out <Col N="395" /> before any more public money is pumped into that organisation.</P>
    <P>CIE is not the only State body where the board members believe that travel broadens the mind, provided, of course, that it is undertaken at public expense. It has recently been revealed in newspaper reports that a group of ESB directors and executives and their spouses undertook a trip to Japan, which reportedly cost the company £75,000.  This is a company which is supposed to be pushing through a package of job cuts and austerity measures designed to ensure its own future commercial survival. What kind of signal does this wanton extravagance send to the workforce?  Is it any wonder that, despite 15 months of negotiating and numerous different headlines, the ESB is still struggling to finalise its cost and competitiveness review?  The CCR set out to achieve savings of £100 million per year.  There must now be serious doubts that this target will be reached and if it is that too high a price is being paid.</P>
    <P>There are reports that individual employees will receive redundancy payments of up to £100,000.  This is surely financial madness for a heavily indebted company that is supposed to be fighting for survival.  Sweetheart deals are being negotiated between management and staff with the head of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions sitting in judgment in the middle.  Who represents the interests of taxpayers in this cosy cartel? Who authorised these massive payments?  What is the Ministers role in all these negotiations?  Has he indicated the Government's willingness to pay out these extraordinary amounts, bearing in mind that the ESB has debts of almost £1,000 million?  Are we to assume that when eventually Telecom Éireann gets around to negotiating its equivalent of the CCR, the terms will be equally generous as those of the ESB?  Could Telecom Éireann possibly afford payments of this magnitude?</P>
    <P>Does ESB management know where <Col N="396" /> it is going?  Here at home ESB management and their cheerleaders in the Labour movement loudly sing the praises of State ownership of the electricity industry.  In Hungary, meantime, the ESB no less, is advising the Government on the privatisation of its electricity generation and distribution industries.  How can ESB management reconcile these differing positions?  We have seen clear evidence of management extravagance at CIE and ESB.  Has the Minister made inquiries regarding similar extravagances in other semi-State companies and will he publish the results?</P>
    <P>Aer Rianta earns £27 million in monopoly profits at Dublin Airport.  How on earth does the Minister justify the squandering of this money on exotic projects around the world, such as the opening of a duty free shop in down town Bangkok?  Are they that short of shopkeepers in Bangkok?  Do they really need a few bob from the Irish taxpayer to keep the show on the road out there?  We need a coherent strategy for the management of the semi State sector and our basic objective should be to make these companies efficient and competitive.  We could make a start by introducing an air of commercial reality to the semi-State boardrooms and by ensuring that proper management and financial controls are in place.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Lowry) Michael Lowry">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Lowry)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Molloy for raising two important matters here this evening &mdash; first the question of financial controls for State companies and second, the question of what action would be taken in the case of abuse of public funds.  The details and information as outlined by Deputy Molloy in regard to travel at CIE are consistent with information provided to my Department by CIE. The Deputy has raised a number of other issues which will be the subject of further questions which I will be happy to answer in due course.  In the case of financial controls for State companies, Deputy Molloy will be aware from his <Col N="397" /> time in Government that a set of guidelines on State bodies, prepared by the Department of Finance was issued to all commercial State companies in early 1992.  Those guidelines set out the underlying principles which govern the relationship between Departments and commercial State companies.  Under the guidelines, the State companies are required to furnish to their parent Departments their audited annual accounts; interim unaudited half-yearly accounts and corporate plans covering a five-year period.  These accounts and plans enable the financial state of the companies to be monitored on an ongoing basis.</P>
      <P>In addition, as the House will be aware, I established a task force last August to review the controls in the commercial State companies under the aegis of my Department.  The task force, which reported recently, made 31 recommendations covering the areas of procurement of goods and services; asset disposal; internal audit and corporate governance.  I am consulting with my colleague the Minister for Finance with a view to having the recommendations considered and implemented as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>It is very important to recognise that it is the responsibility of the management and boards of State companies to ensure that proper financial controls are in place and the current guidelines are being fully adhered to.  In discharging their responsibilities, the State companies must also have regard to the relevant legislation under which they operate and to the Companies Acts, where they apply.</P>
      <P>I now turn to the second matter, namely the question of what action would be taken in the case of an abuse of public funds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where any abuse, or alleged abuse of public funds comes to my notice, as Minister, my normal course of action would be to draw it to the attention of the chairman of the semi-State body concerned, with a request that the matter be investigated and a report made to <Col N="398" /> me.  Such a report should indicate the board's intentions concerning the elimination of any abuse and the steps to be taken to recover any funds which have been misused.</P>
    <P>I assume the Deputy's reference to recent disclosures concerns the question of overseas travel undertaken by the former chairman of CIE at CIE's expense, including travel at a time when he had ceased to hold the position of chairman.  This latter aspect is a matter which was only recently drawn to my attention and I have raised it with CIE. All of the overseas travel by the former CIE chairman was authorised by either the then acting chief executive of CIE or by the chairman through his secretary.  It is the responsibility of the board to decide whether and to what extent it would be appropriate to seek the recovery of any costs incurred by the former chairman on overseas travel.</P>
    <P>Membership of the board of any State body is a position of trust and authority. It requires a degree of discretion and judgment on the part of the person appointed.  The assumption must be made that such discretion will be exercised in an objective manner and in the best commercial interests of the company concerned.  In particular, expenditure on travel, entertainment etc., must only be incurred where it is genuinely necessary and beneficial to the company concerned.  The onus must be on the boards and senior management of these companies to ensure that such expenditure is properly and responsibly authorised, monitored and accounted for.</P>
    <P>The need to ensure proper controls on the expenditure of public funds, and to ensure that value is obtained for such expenditure was one of the key areas addressed by the task force on commercial State companies.  The task force made a number of important recommendations concerning the internal audit function of the semi-State bodies. It recommended that there should be no operational areas or levels within the organisation precluded from internal audit review; the head of the internal audit function should have considerable <Col N="399" /> seniority within the organisation and the content of all internal audit reports should be entirely at his or her discretion; the internal audit unit should have unrestricted access to all senior management, including board members; the internal audit unit should ensure that adequate attention is given to value for money auditing; and board audit committees should only include non-executive board members and should specifically exclude board chairpersons.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the implementation of these recommendations will <Col N="400" /> very significantly reduce the potential for abuse and inefficiency in the expenditure of public funds.  I am sure the Deputy will agree that the findings and recommendations of the task force represent a very substantial return on the modest investment of public funds in it.</P>
    <P>I assure the Deputy and the House that I expect timely and appropriate action by the board of any semi-State body which becomes aware of any abuse of public funds.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.5 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 15 November 1995.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 25, 30 and 37 together.</P>
      <P>Section 171 of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1993 provides that every person in the State whose means are insufficient to meet his needs, or the needs of his dependants, is entitled to payment under the supplementary welfare allowance (SWA) scheme.  Substitute or interim payments are not paid automatically.  Such payments are only awarded where a person has no means to meet their immediate needs pending payment from another source, for example, where they are awaiting determination of an application for a social welfare or health board payment.</P>
      <P>Detailed information on the numbers of cases in which interim payments were made pending unemployment assistance or unemployment benefit prior to 1994 is not available.  This type of information was provided for in 1994 following the introduction of a new computer system for the collection of data relating to the SWA scheme.  Information for 1994 and 1995 is set out in the following tabular statement.  The Deputies will note, however, that as a result of a number of procedures adopted such as desk interviews of certain of the Department's customers, computerisation etc., there has been a reduction in the number of interim payments made.  The Deputies will note in particular that in the Eastern Health Board area, as a result of a specific agreement between the health board and the Department of Social Welfare, the number of interim payments in that area has been halved since October 1992.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There will always be a need for interim payments particularly in cases such as deserted wives who have no income but who must have been deserted for at least three months before a social welfare payment is awarded.  Other circumstances in which interim payments may be made include where a social welfare book has been returned due to a change in circumstances, for example the death of a <Col N="193" /> dependant, and it is not possible to reissue in time for the next payment date.</P>
    <P>Any interim payment which is awarded pending the determination or payment of a social welfare or health board payment is fully recoverable from the arrears once the other payment is awarded.</P>

    <P>The number of cases where an interim payment was made does not necessarily correspond to the number of people who received SWA interim payments.  There may be an element of double counting e.g. where a person made more than one claim for UA or UB in a year and claimed an interim payment pending determination of each claim.  Payment of an interim payment will be counted as a separate case on each occasion.</P>

      <P>I intend to pursue an active programme during the Irish Presidency. I will be hosting an informal Council meeting of European Ministers for Social Security to focus attention on those issues which will be of relevance and importance both at national and European level.  This meeting will be held right at the start of our Presidency on 10-11 July 1996.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am also holding, as part of my programme of work, two major conferences in conjunction with the institutions of <Col N="194" /> the European Union.  Initial planning is under way for the first which is entitled &ldquo;Social Security: Beyond Equal Treatment&rdquo; and which will take place on 10-12 October 1996.  This conference is being co-hosted by my Department and the EU Commission with input from the social security sub-group of the EU Network of Experts on the Implementation of the Equality Directives.</P>
    <P>The second conference &ldquo;New Directions in Social Welfare&rdquo; will be held on 14-16 November 1996 and is being co-hosted with the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions.  The aim of this conference is to support a constructive debate at European level on the challenges facing the welfare state.</P>
    <P>Two formal Social Affairs Council meetings at ministerial level will take place on 24 September 1996 and 2 December 1996.  The issues covered by social affairs are not solely my responsibility.  Many of them are the responsibility of my ministerial colleagues in the Departments of Enterprise and Employment, Equality and Law Reform, Health and Education.  The Deputy will, no doubt, be aware that the eventual agenda of the social affairs portfolio during Ireland's Presidency of the European Union in 1996 will be shaped by the Commission's work programme and the dossiers handed down by the outgoing Italian Presidency.  However, the following concerns may well be foremost during our Presidency in relation to my area of responsibility: advancement of anti-poverty issues; stimulating the debate with fellow member states on a number of fronts dealing with the future of social protection.  The European Commission has adopted a communication on this issue which seeks to explore, in a positive framework, the major strategic issues facing member states within the EU, such as financing of social protections; the effects of demographic changes and new emerging social trends; the need to impact positively on unemployment; employment; freedom of movement and social protection in the single market.</P>
    <P>The Secretary of my Department will <Col N="195" /> also be hosting one of the regular meetings of the Directors-General of Social Security in the EU during Ireland's Presidency.  This group considers social security issues of a topical nature on an ongoing basis.</P>
    <P>My officials are in constant contact with their Commission counterparts and I will meet Commissioner Flynn on 23 November to discuss our Presidency programme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Proinsias De Rossa)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 27 and 28 together.</P>
      <P>The average time taken to process appeals during 1994 was just under four months.  Appeals involving oral hearings would tend to be above this figure whereas those where the appeal can be determined on the basis of the documentary evidence would be below the average figure.  This average period includes all phases of appeals and is inflated by the additional time involved in the determination of a number of appeals where, for example, adjournments have been sought or where questions affecting the estates of deceased claimants are at issue.  When the slowest 10 per cent of cases is discounted the average falls to approximately three months.  A survey of appeals during the second half of 1994 found that approximately one third were disposed of within two months of being registered in the appeals office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Appeals to the independent Social <Col N="196" /> Welfare Appeals Office involve cases where there is a difference between the position taken by the Department of Social Welfare and the claimant and consequently involve a degree of conflicting contentions which must be resolved.  For an appeal to get the attention it merits, the grounds advanced in support of it must be investigated.  This will often require a further report by an investigating officer where, for example, a person's means are at issue or, for disability benefit claimants, a further examination by a medical referee.  The periods indicated above cover the time taken to deal with all phases of the appeal including additional investigations into the grounds advanced, the arrangement of oral hearings, adjournments which may be requested by the appellants or their representatives, determination by an appeals officer and notification of the outcome to appellants.</P>
    <P>The Social Welfare Appeals Office has made significant progress in the four years since its establishment in 1991. During that period over 68,000 appeals have been processed and the number of appeals on hands has decreased from 8,287 at 31 December 1991 to 3,850 at the end of 1994 and this has brought about a significant improvement in the service provided to appellants.</P>
    <P>The provision of a prompt service is a major objective of the Social Welfare Appeals Office.  This was so recognised by the chief appeals officer in his report for 1994 and this aspect of the service will continue to receive attention during 1995.  The achievement of further improvements in response times by reducing the time taken to process appeals has been given a high priority. It is important to ensure that progress in this area is achieved in a manner which is consistent with the demands of justice and the requirement that every appeal be fully investigated and examined on all its merits.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Proinsias De Rossa)</NameTxt>
      <P>The carer's allowance is a social assistance scheme which provides an income maintenance payment to people providing elderly or incapacitated pensioners with full-time care and attention and whose incomes fall below certain limits.</P>
      <P>The allowance was introduced in 1990 and has been improved and expanded progressively over the years.  For example, in 1994 the means test was eased with the introduction of a weekly disregard of £100 in respect of the earnings of the carer's spouse.  This amount was increased to £150 a week this year and the scheme was further expanded with the inclusion of carers who look after recipients of occupational pensions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department has regular contact with voluntary and other groups representative of social welfare recipients with a view to discussing improvements in and enhancements to particular <Col N="198" /> schemes.  The main representative organisation in respect of carers in Ireland is the Carers' Association with which ongoing dialogue is maintained, particularly in the context of my Department's annual pre-budget form. The objective of the pre-budget forum is to give representative voluntary organisations an opportunity to set out their views on the priorities which should be addressed in the annual budget.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy is aware, the question of further improving the carer's allowance is a matter for consideration in a budgetary context and in the light of available resources.</P>

      <P>The means tests applied in determining entitlement to social assistance payments include an assessment of the value of any capital or investments held by the applicant.  The purpose of this assessment is to ascribe a notional value to the capital owned and, at present, different methods of assessment apply in the various social assistance schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="199" /> These provisions are currently being reviewed in my Department with a view to devising proposals for a standard method of assessment of capital for all social assistance payments.  In view of the substantial costs involved, however, any changes in this area would have to be considered in the context of available resources.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the hardship caused to a family (details supplied) in County Tipperary arising from the refusal to pay the additional £1 per hour on the students' summer jobs scheme in view of the fact that the family income is means tested and equal to a sole Department of Social Welfare payment; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The response to the student's summer jobs scheme has again been very positive this year and it is estimated at this stage that about 15,700 students worked under the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the improvements I introduced to this year's scheme is that students whose parents are totally dependent on social welfare payments are entitled to receive an additional bonus payment of £1 per hour worked. The purpose of this was to give additional income support under the scheme to the most disadvantaged families and the criterion selected was families who are totally dependent on social welfare payments.  Persons in this category would in general have no other or minimal means.  About 3,300 students are entitled to and have received this payment.  Self-employed persons in receipt of a reduced rate of unemployment assistance cannot be considered to be totally dependent on social welfare payments as they have an income from their self employment.  Students of such <Col N="200" /> persons are not therefore entitled to the special bonus payment.</P>
    <P>As the father of the person concerned is self employed and has additional income as a shoe repairer, he cannot be regarded as totally dependent on social welfare payments.  His weekly means have been assessed at £60 net taking account of disregards for expenditure incurred in the operation of the business.  His daughter therefore does not qualify for this special allowance.</P>

      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to the free schemes administered by my Department, namely, free travel, free electricity allowance, free natural gas allowance, free telephone rental allowance and free television licence.  Free travel is available to all persons in the State aged 66 years or over and also to certain disabled people under the age of 66.  The other free schemes are available to people, usually aged 66 or over, who are in receipt of a welfare type payment and who are either living alone or who otherwise satisfy the living alone condition.  In <Col N="203" /> addition, widows between the age of 60 and 65 whose late husbands had entitlement to the free schemes retain that entitlement notwithstanding their age.</P>
      <P>A person who retires on superannuation may, depending on the level of their pension, be entitled to receive an old age (non-contributory) pension from my Department even at a reduced rate.  If they are so entitled and can satisfy the living alone condition, they will qualify for the free schemes referred to above.  Extending the free schemes to categories who do not qualify under the current conditions would have financial implications and could only be considered in the light of available resources.</P>

      <P>I am concerned to ensure that the social welfare system provides an adequate minimum income for people without other adequate means of support, while at the same time enabling them to take up any employment opportunities which may arise.  I am looking at ways in which social welfare payments can be structured to facilitate the transition from unemployment to employment, particularly where people have families to support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In considering the relationship between employment and social welfare, I see a need to address the question of a minimum wage.  I have called on employers to address the question of low pay with a view to seeking to establish how best agreed minimum standards might be implemented.  This proposal seeks from employers a response <Col N="204" /> to the social welfare and other initiatives currently taking place in our economy.  Employers have a social responsibility to ensure that their employees are paid a fair wage.  If they do not accept that responsibility voluntarily then it will be necessary to legislate for it.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 44 and 147 together.  The Government approved last month the payment of a Christmas bonus to certain social welfare and health board recipients at a cost this year of almost £40 million.  The bonus will amount to 70 per cent of normal weekly payments and there will be a minimum payment of £20.  It will be paid during the first week in December 1995.  Over 1.25 million people will benefit i.e. about 755,000 recipients and their 500,000 dependants.</P>
      <P>The bonus will be paid to people on long-term payments including those receiving old age, retirement, widows, widowers and invadility pensions, lone parent's allowance, unemployment assistance at the long-term rate, carer's allowance, disabled person's maintenance allowance as well as FÁS and CERT trainees.  All participants on community employment will also receive the bonus this year.</P>

      <P>Entitlement to an old age non-contributory pension is determined by reference to the age of the applicant, whether he-she is resident in the State and satisfies a means test.  This means test is similar to that used to determine entitlement to all social assistance payments and takes account of any income the applicant or his or her spouse or partner may have as well as property, other than the family home, and assets which are capable of providing an <Col N="206" /> income.  It also includes an assessment of the value of any capital or investments held.</P>
      <P>The old age non-contributory pension forms part of the assistance payments directed at people with needs i.e. those with no other or only some limited form of income support.  A means test is required to establish those needs.</P>
      <P>The cost of abolishing the means test for entitlement to old age non-contributory pension is estimated at £255 million in a full year.  It would also undermine the commitment to making contributions to the social insurance fund for pension purposes.</P>
      <P>It is relevant to note in this context, that, as a consequence of the widening of the scope of social insurance coverage in recent years, the proportion of the elderly entitled to contributory pensions is rising.  These pensions are, of course, not subject to the means test.</P>

      <P>Expenditure on rent supplements under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme has increased from an estimated £8.6 million in 1990 to £44.8 million in 1994.  The number of community welfare officers and superintendent community welfare officers &mdash; the staff who administer the scheme on behalf of my Department &mdash; employed by the health boards increased from 457 to 479 over the same period.  A breakdown of those figures on an annual basis is set out in a tabular statement which I will make available to Deputies.  This increase in staff has mainly occurred in the Eastern Health Board area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The administration of the broader supplementary welfare allowance scheme involves basic payments, supplements, exceptional needs and urgent needs payments.  Staff are also involved in assessing eligibility for health and welfare services administered by the <Col N="207" /> health boards.  Accordingly, in the absence of a detailed study, it cannot be assumed any increase in staff is solely a direct result of increased levels of expenditure on rent supplements.</P>

      <P>The persons concerned were disqualified under the trade dispute provisions from receipt of unemployment benefit and assistance for the duration of the dispute by a deciding officer.  The disqualifications were upheld by an appeals officer and the chief appeals officer.  An appeals officer's decision is final and conclusive and may only be revised in the light of new evidence or facts.  However, any person who is dissatisfied with the decision of an appeals officer may appeal the decision to the High Court on a point of law.  No such appeal was made in this case.</P>

    <P>The legislation establishing the Social Welfare Tribunal, the Social Welfare (No. 2) Act, 1982 provides that persons disqualified by a deciding officer and an appeals officer from receipt of unemployment benefit, arising from their participation in a trade dispute, can apply for an adjudication to the tribunal <Col N="208" /> where the stoppage of work or trade dispute was &ldquo;in existence on or after the 1st day of June 1982&rdquo;.

      <P>The adult dependant allowance payable with invalidity pension is £42.30, while in the case of retirement pension it stands at £48.10 if under age 66, and £52.30 if age 66 or over.  The allowance payable with invalidity pension has historically been pegged at a higher rate compared to the adult dependant rates payable with short-term payments, but at a lower rate compared to the adult dependant rates payable with long-term payments.</P>
      <P>It is of course open to a person to claim a retirement pension once he-she satisfies the qualification criteria.</P>

      <P>On a number of occasions recently I have drawn attention to the demographic patterns which indicate a considerable increase in the proportion of elderly people in the population over the first half of the next century.  This will have a significant impact on the future costs of social welfare pensions, which are set to increase by some 100 per cent by the year 2035.  At the same time, the ratio of persons in the economically active age group to those over age 65 is projected to fall.  This would result, in the absence of any policy change, in an increasing burden of the cost of pensions falling on future generations of PRSI contributors and taxpayers.</P>
      <P>These are important factors in any consideration of the development of future pension arrangements and raise serious questions about the capacity of the present financing arrangements to meet these emerging costs.  The pensions industry is also placing considerable emphasis on this issue at present. One aspect which needs to be examined further in this regard is the effect of real long-term growth in the economy.  If this is maintained, it should increase the resources available to pay for pensions in the future; although as the Deputy will appreciate, there will be many competing claims for any resources freed up as a result of this growth.  I am examining the reports on this area at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The final report of the National Pensions Board Developing the National <Col N="210" /> Pension System raised and considered these issues.  This report is being considered within my Department at present and I intend to bring forward proposals based on the recommendations of the report.</P>
    <P>In this context, a major survey of occupational pension schemes, which was recommended by the National Pensions Board, has been commissioned jointly by my Department and the National Pensions Board and a report will be available in the first half of next year.  The last major survey was carried out in 1985 and the results of this new survey will give essential up to date information on occupational cover, which will be of considerable assistance when proposals in relation to pensions are being formulated.</P>
    <P>I have also stated frequently in recent times that demands to abolish or significantly reduce contributions to the social insurance fund are short sighted given the demands which are currently being placed on it and which will grow in the years ahead.  We must preserve the principle of solidarity embodied in the PRSI system if we are to guarantee pensions needed in the future due to the ageing of the population.</P>
    <P>I would like to stress that there is no danger to anyone's current pension entitlement.  However, as I pointed out earlier this is an issue which we cannot afford to ignore.  Provided we face up, over the next few years, to the needs which we know will arise because of the demographic changes, we can plan to deal with them in an orderly and effective way.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, I obtained Government approval earlier this year for the development of a national anti-poverty strategy.  This will involve all Government Departments and agencies targeting poverty and social exclusion across the full range of policies and programmes and is in line with the commitments entered into at the UN World Summit on Social Development in Copenhagen.</P>
      <P>The strategy is being developed by a high level interdepartmental policy committee.  In keeping with the commitment in A Government of Renewal to extend the opportunities for democratic participation by citizens in all aspects of public life, the committee is required to provide for consultation with and the participation of those affected by social exclusion through their representative organisations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The process of consulting with and ensuring the active participation of people directly affected by poverty through the organisations that represent them has been ongoing over the last few months and the Combat Poverty Agency has made resources and support <Col N="212" /> available to enable groups hold local consultations-workshops about the strategy.</P>
    <P>The national anti-poverty strategy will involve the preparation of a statement setting out the nature and extent of poverty and social exclusion in Ireland.  Work is well advanced on the preparation of this overview statement; the selection of key themes-policy areas which must be addressed if poverty and social exclusion are to be tackled; the setting of specific targets within each theme against which progress can be assessed; recommending the type of institutional mechanisms to be put in place to ensure that the issue of reducing poverty and social exclusion is firmly on the agenda of all Government Departments and agencies and that there is appropriate co-ordination across and between Departments in this area and use of the Strategic Management Initiative currently under way in the public service to reflect the Government commitment to the anti-poverty strategy.</P>
    <P>An independent monitoring mechanism will be important in the successful implementation of an anti-poverty strategy and the achievement of targets to be set out in such a strategy.  The Combat Poverty Agency will play the key role in this process and because of its expertise in the area will represent an important resource to Government Departments.</P>
    <P>The interdepartmental committee has been charged with preparing a report which will form part of the national report for the United Nations, to be completed before the end of 1996, to demonstrate national progress in implementing the UN commitment.  The secretariat to the committee has been augmented for the purpose of the strategy with assistance from the Department of Social Welfare and the Combat Poverty Agency.</P>
    <P>The committee started its work by issuing an information leaflet, signed by the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and myself, inviting submissions on how the strategy should be developed, what it should <Col N="213" /> contain and what institutional mechanisms should be in place to ensure its implementation.  The deadline for receipt of submissions was 22 September and I understand that some 235 submissions have been received in the Taoiseach's Department.  These are now being examined and analysed and a synopsis will be published shortly.</P>
    <P>The Government has already begun the process of addressing social exclusion and poverty in this year's budget with a significant improvement in child benefit; as it has been established that in Ireland, households with children have a higher risk of poverty than those without, we increased the monthly payment for each child by £7.</P>
    <P>I intend to continue this process. Tackling poverty will continue to be my primary concern in farming proposals for the social welfare aspects of the 1996 budget.</P>

There are some 11,000 people currently in receipt of this supplement, supporting 31,000 children.</P>

      <Col N="216" /> Entitlement to social welfare payments is based on the applicant fulfilling prescribed statutory conditions.  In the case of the means based schemes like unemployment assistance, the applicant's income is taken into account.  At the initial claim stage the applicant is interviewed in his home or a social welfare local office by an inspector who will investigate and report on the case. When a case is put into payment it is thereafter subject to review.</P>
    <P>People in receipt of payments are also obliged to confirm on a regular basis that they continue to satisfy the statutory conditions for entitlement and to notify the Department of any changes in their circumstances.  Following investigation on review payment can be suspended and disallowed where there is clear evidence that the applicant has failed to fully disclose his-her means.</P>
    <P>The Department can and will use any evidence which comes to its knowledge relevant to the circumstances of people claiming social welfare payments subject to the normal requirements of the rules of natural justice and proper administration.</P>

      <P>It is Government policy to have at least 40 per cent of both men and women in appointments to State boards and the Government requested the social partners to observe this gender balance in making nominations to the National Economic and <Col N="217" /> Social Council, NESC.  There are currently 33 members of the council, with a full membership of 34 if a nominee of the National Youth Council of Ireland, NYCI, is agreed.  Of the 33 appointed members, 12 are women, which represents 36 per cent of the membership. If the NYCI nominate a female, as requested, then the female representation will rise to 38 per cent.</P>
      <P>The other social partners have made efforts to enhance the proportion of women in their representation on the council.  I accept the difficulty that an organisation which only has one representative may have with this Government policy, however, as the representative from the NYCI has always been male, I decided to request it to nominate a female representative for this term of the NESC.  I have indicated to the NYCI that it may wish to nominate a male alternative for a female member of the council as a means of overcoming any difficulty.  Following this suggestion I have received no further correspondence from the NYCI and I await hearing from it.</P>
      <P>The Government's gender balance policy helps the achievement of equality between men and women because it will result in greater access by women to important decision making roles in Irish society.</P>

      <P>Over the past year, the Government has consistently emphasised to the British authorities the importance of moving forward on the issue of prisoners in a flexible and constructive way, taking into account the part played by prisoners from both communities in making the ceasefire possible and lasting.  We have taken our own steps in this regard in a number of ways, including the early release of 36 prisoners.  The legislation recently introduced to restore 50 per cent remission for paramilitary prisoners in Northern Ireland is a further helpful development, which I hope can be built on in the period ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government remains very concerned, however, about the situation of <Col N="219" /> the prisoners in Britain.  I have underlined our concerns on this issue repeatedly, both in the House and more generally.  Several Members of the Oireachtas have visited prisoners in Britain and know of the many serious complaints which I and my Department have been dealing with in recent months.  The health of a number of the prisoners in Britain has been our primary concern in that time, particularly so in the case of two prisoners engaged in a protest at Whitemoor Prison.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the two prisoners have in recent days been recategorised and moved out of the special secure unit at Whitemoor.  I understand that this move will bring the protest to an end.  The Irish Embassy in London will pursue its contacts with the British authorities regarding the health of both prisoners and other issues of concern to them.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will be aware, the Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons came into force on 1 November.  The Government believes the possibilities offered by this convention should be used flexibly and constructively in regard to the remaining republican prisoners in Britain.  Discussions have been taking place between British and Irish officials to draw up procedures for the effective implementation of the convention provisions on transfers to this jurisdiction.  The Government has made clear that we stand ready to agree to the transfer of those republican prisoners who wish to be transferred to this jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>The convention does not apply to transfers from Britain to Northern Ireland.  However, I am aware that 18 prisoners have to date been transferred from British prisons to Northern Ireland.  The Government believes that republican prisoners who wish to transfer from prisons in Britain to Ireland, North or South, should be facilitated <Col N="220" /> and we will continue to pursue this matter with the British authorities.</P>

      <P>The links between demographic factors and trends and sustainable development are now accepted by all developed and developing countries, particularly in the aftermath of the International Conference on Population and Development which took place in Cairo in 1994.  Prior to 1993, Ireland was the only EU member state not to have contributed to the United Nations Fund for Population Activities, UNFPA. Given the growing importance of the population issue at international level, it was felt by the Government at that time that a contribution to UNFPA represented an appropriate response to the challenges posed by population growth, particularly in developing countries. Ireland has since then provided annual contributions of £50,000 in 1993, £100,000 in 1994 and £250,000 in 1995 in support of the valuable work of UNFPA in developing countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The UNFPA provides assistance in the field of population, including family planning and awareness and education programmes, in response to requests from developing countries.  It is financed <Col N="222" /> from contributions by governments and private donors.  Its policy, as laid down by its governing council in 1995, specifically states that UNFPA is &ldquo;not to provide assistance for abortions, abortion services or abortion-related equipment and supplies as a method of family planning&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I recently requested my Department to obtain verbal and written assurances from UNFPA that this policy is fully complied with in respect of all its activities.  Officials of my Department accordingly met the deputy executive director of UNFPA on 13 October 1995.  They received categorical assurances from him that UNFPA &ldquo;has not and does not support any act pertaining to abortion&rdquo;. Subsequent written assurances have also been received to that effect.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the concerns which have been expressed in some quarters, including recently by a number of British Members of Parliament, regarding UNFPA assistance for family planning activities in China.  We have also received assurances from UNFPA that while it has provided support for family planning activities in China, it has carefully monitored its projects to ensure full adherence to universally accepted standards of human rights.  UNFPA has emphasised that its family planning projects, both in China and elsewhere, are grounded on the principles of freedom of choice and informed consent.</P>
    <P>UNFPA is a highly respected agency of the United Nations.  Its word must be accepted in the absence of any information to the contrary.  While I can appreciate the concerns that have been expressed in relation to UNFPA support for family planning activities in China, I must accept, on the basis of the oral and written assurances which we have been given, that UNFPA has acted in accordance with its policy and principles.</P>

      <P>The consultants appointed to undertake the study of the flooding problem in south Galway have recommended that no action be taken to open swallow-holes.</P>
      <P>The consultants examined this issue as a matter of priority at my request as there was a widely held view in south Galway that the opening up of certain swallow-holes would help to prevent a recurrence of the severe flooding which occurred last year.</P>
      <P>When I met with the consultants after they had completed their initial investigations, they informed me that they had found very little evidence to suggest that the swallow-holes were blocked and that in so far as could be seen by visual inspection that was not the case.  They further advised that given the uncertainty regarding water circulation and storage patterns in the area the effect elsewhere in the region of interference with swallow-holes in one location could not be reliably predicted.  It was possible that if flooding was alleviated in one area, similar or worse flooding could be caused elsewhere.</P>
      <P>The consultants strongly advised that no action be taken in relation to swallow-holes until they had studied the matter in detail in the course of their investigations.  I have decided to accept that advice.  The expenditure of public funds contrary to such a clear recommendation could not be justified.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 70 and 71 together.</P>
      <P>I am in the process of finalising a scheme to assist persons who have been made homeless as a result of the flooding in late 1994 and early 1995.</P>
      <P>Owner-occupiers whose homes have either been damaged beyond repair at reasonable cost, or have been subject to long duration flooding i.e. for a minimum of three weeks, will qualify for assistance under the scheme.</P>
      <P>I have had a number of lengthy meetings with the south Galway IFA and the South Galway Flooded Victims' Action Group, regarding the scheme and have listened carefully to their suggestions as well as explaining to them the principles underlying the relocation scheme.</P>
      <P>While the scheme is now at a very advanced stage of drafting, there are still some aspects of it to be finalised and I am not therefore in a position to give full details of it just yet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The principle underlying the scheme is that people who qualify for assistance are effectively homeless and will be treated equally by the State as any other homeless person.  The scheme will therefore seek to ensure that applicants who qualify will have funds available to them from a combination of their insurance compensation, if any, for structural damage and State assistance, equivalent to what it would cost the local authority to provide a house for them.  Allowance will be made for the reasonable cost of <Col N="226" /> a site and legal and design fees.  People will of course have the option of having a house provided for them by the local authority acting as an agent for the Government if they prefer.</P>
    <P>The scheme will be open for a period of two years.</P>

      <P>A total of £1,148,000 was made available in humanitarian aid; £750,000 was provided by the Government and £398,000 by the European Union.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand however that the total of £1,148.000 was distributed to approximately 340 recipients throughout the country.  Approximately 160 recipients in County Galway received approximately £520,000 which represents just over 45 per cent of all the aid distributed.  Loss of income was one of the criteria used by the Irish Red Cross Society to assess the amount of aid to <Col N="227" /> recipients.

      <P>The major multi-disciplinary investigation commissioned earlier this year into the flooding problems in the south Galway area has already been extended to include part of the adjoining area of north Clare.  The decision to extend the <Col N="228" /> study area was due solely to the fact that that part of north Clare contributes to, or has an effect on the groundwater regime within the study area.  The enlarged study area does not extend to include the Gortaclare-Bellharbour valley or the Burren-New Quay areas.  It should not be taken that because a particular area has not been included in the study area that it is being forgotten.  It is envisaged that procedures and principles determined during the course of this study can be used later to the benefit of other similar areas, such as those referred to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that since the introduction of the single market, EU law provides for intra-Union acquisitions whereby a VAT registered trader in one member state may obtain VAT zero-rated goods from another member state, and account for VAT on those goods in his own member state.  One of the conditions of such a transaction is that the goods in question must be removed from the member state in which they were obtained, otherwise the vendor in that member state becomes liable to account for the VAT due.</P>
      <P>Because of the ease with which abuses of such provisions could arise, I am advised by the commissioners that a series of legislative and procedural arrangements have been put in place to safeguard the VAT system.  For example, traders in each member state are obliged to furnish a quarterly return-known as a VIES return here and an ESL return in the UK &mdash; to their tax authorities, of all their zero-rated supplies to traders in other member states.</P>
      <P>Special mutual assistance arrangements facilitate transmission of the material between national authorities so that a trader's quarterly return can be cross checked with the normal VAT returns of the traders in receipt of his supplies.</P>
      <P>As a result of complaints received in 1993 and 1994 about VAT evasion arising from cross-Border trading between here and the North, a systematic programme of visits by inspectors of taxes to various targeted sectors around the country was carried out.  That programme resulted in the regularisation of the VAT status of traders concerned, where this action was appropriate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="231" /> Information is exchanged on an ongoing basis between HM C &amp; E, Belfast and our VAT authorities, via the VIMA office in Dundalk about traders on both sides of the Border involved in VAT evasion.</P>
    <P>A previous complaint was made about one particular fuel merchant from Northern Ireland who was alleged to have purchased briquettes at the zerorate from Bord na Móna and sold them in this State.  Inquiries to Bord na Móna have revealed that they examined the records of the company in question and found that all consignments of briquettes purchased in the State had been dispatched to the company's depot in Northern Ireland, and that all subsequent sales to fuel suppliers in this State had been correctly invoiced.</P>
    <P>However, if the Deputy could supply the names of the fuel merchants referred to in this parliamentary question to the VAT administration branch, indirect taxes division, Revenue Commissioners Office, Dublin Castle, Dublin 2, the matter will be investigated and appropriate action taken.  The information provided will, of course, be treated in the strictest confidence.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> I presume the Deputy is referring to the inclusion of post-polio syndrome as an illness covered by the long-term illness scheme.  The long-term illness scheme entitles persons who suffer from certain specified illness to free drugs and medicines which are prescribed in respect of the particular illnesses.  The scheme has not been extended since 1975 and there are no plans to expand the number of illnesses covered by the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The long-term illness scheme is only one of a number of schemes in operation which provide assistance towards <Col N="234" /> the cost of prescribed drugs and medicines for persons with ongoing medical conditions.</P>
    <P>Health services, including prescribed drugs and medicines, are available free of charge to persons covered by medical cards.  The determination of eligibility for medical cards is a matter for the chief executive officer of the relevant health board.  Income guidelines are available to assist chief executive officers in determining a person's eligibility.  While a person's income may exceed the guidelines, that person may still be awarded a medical card if the chief executive officer considers that the person's medical needs or other circumstances would justify this.  For example, where an individual or a family is subjected to a significant level of ongoing expenditure on medical expenses, such as general practitioner fees or prescribed drugs, due to a long-term medical condition, these expenses may be taken into account in determining eligibility for a medical card.</P>
    <P>The drug cost subsidisation scheme caters for people who do not have a medical card or long-term illness book and are certified as having a medical condition with a regular and ongoing requirement for prescribed drugs and medicines.  Persons who qualify for inclusion in this scheme will not have to spend more than £32 in any month on prescribed medication.</P>
    <P>Under the drugs refund scheme which covers expenditure by the whole family, any expenditure on prescribed medication above £90 in a calendar quarter is refunded by the health board.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that appropriate and comprehensive support is being provided by the State through the existing range of schemes for people with long-term medical conditions.</P>

      <Quest>the amount of reduction in public spending in his Department as a result of the Government decision announced by the Minister for Finance on 8 June 1995; the number of new posts established since that date in his Department and agencies under the aegis of his Department; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> The Government decision announced on 8 June outlined the Government's targets in relation to growth in public expenditure in 1996 and decided that there would be no further recruitment to posts, paid for out of public funds, which would have the effect of increasing the number of posts above the number in place on 9 June, except where the Government agreed to such recruitment, in particular areas.  In view of the Government's commitments with regard to poverty and groups with special needs, as set out in the policy document A Government of Renewal, it agreed to approve the establishment of an additional 1,200 posts in 1995 for the health services.  The decision was taken in the context of the need to maintain existing services and further develop services in certain critical areas.  To the extent that the numbers approved are less than the original numbers sought at the beginning of the year, the decision will have the effect of reducing the additional costs in 1996, of developments initiated this year.  With regard to 1995, I have already stated that there will be no reduction in the approved level of expenditure for any agency, under my Department's aegis. In relation to expenditure in 1996, discussions are continuing with regard to the Health Estimate, which I expect will be concluded shortly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> As the Deputy will be aware, the current policy on care of the elderly is to maintain elderly people in their own homes for as long as possible.</P>
      <P>It is recognised, however, that there is a small proportion of dependent elderly people who require long-stay care and accommodation must be provided for these individuals, whether it be in health board accommodation or nursing homes.</P>
      <P>The length of waiting time for health board long-stay accommodation varies from board to board.  Some health boards have no waiting lists but, in general, the average waiting period is two to four weeks.  The boards assure me, however, that all urgent cases are assessed immediately and, if necessary, admitted without delay to long-stay accommodation.</P>
      <P>The waiting period is somewhat longer in the Eastern Health Board area due to the large proportion of elderly people in the region and the ensuing pressure this places on the health board's long-stay institutions.  As is the case in the other boards, however, waiting periods for admission vary and are generally dependent on the urgency and appropriateness of the patient's need in relation to the particular vacancy which has become available.</P>
      <P>The figures requested by the Deputy are not routinely collected by my Department.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> I am aware of the very important contribution of the hospice movement in the provision of in-patient and home care for the terminally ill.  The health strategy document, Shaping a Healthier Future, acknowledges the important role palliative care services play in improving the quality of life of terminally ill patients and it is my intention to promote the continued development of such services, making use, where possible, of existing health facilities.</P>
      <P>A policy statement on cancer services is currently in preparation in my Department and it will include a review of the role played by the hospice-palliative care services throughout the country in respect of cancer patients and set out recommendations for its future development.  When I have the proposals of the review group to hand, I will be in a position to decide on priority areas for development within the palliative care sector as a whole.</P>

      <P>The Western Health Board inform me that the temporary vacation of an existing ward at the Sacred Heart Home, Castlebar, to facilitate upgrading and modifications for this purpose will not have any major impact on the availability of long-stay beds or the period of waiting time for such beds.  This is due to the fact that an integrated ward,-which was recently upgraded in line with the planning of the dementia unit, has now become available and will make up for the temporary loss of beds. The board assure me that all possible steps have been taken to avoid any increase in the waiting time for a bed in the Sacred Heart Home, Castlebar.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The board state that there will be no need to replace the accommodation designated for dementia sufferers as the overall bed complement in the home will only marginally decline and the accommodation will serve patients who otherwise would be accommodated <Col N="242" /> in different wards thorughout the home.</P>

      <i>The Years Ahead &mdash; A Policy for the Elderly,</i> which was published in 1988, emphasised that the objective of health services for older people should be to support them in dignity and independence at home and when this is no longer possible to ensure that they have access to high quality hospital care when they require it.</P>
    <P>
      <i>The Years Ahead</i> was adopted as official policy towards the elderly and its recommendations have been progressively implemented.  In recent years additional funding has been made available for the elderly and their carers. This extra funding has enabled the health boards to expand home nursing services, to provide day care centres and to increase the number of paramedical staff working with the elderly in the community.</P>
    <P>It should also be noted that since the introduction of the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990, on 1 September 1993, a total of 6,876 people have been <Col N="243" /> approved for health board subventions in private and voluntary nursing homes.</P>

      <P>There is no reduction in the 1995 Education budget as provided in the Estimates for 1995.  The Government reviewed its financial targets in June 1995 and decided that in order to meet its overall budgetary targets it was necessary to control public sector employment.  In this context it was agreed that the expansion in posts for the 1995-96 school year should be carefully monitored and controlled.  This means that the rate of expansion of certain services has to be adjusted.  No new posts have been established in the Department of Education since 8 June 1995.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>New posts in the education sector, including the agencies under the aegis <Col N="260" /> of my Department, have been provisionally allocated in 1995 on a sectoral basis as follows: first level education &mdash; 315; second level education &mdash; 576; third level education &mdash; 255.</P>

The school's current enrolment of 61 pupils can be accomodated within the recommended guideline of 11 square feet of floor space per pupil.

Furthermore, the enrolment of the school is not in breach of a maximum class size guidelines as laid down in Circular 3/95.</P>
      <P>The staffing of the school for the current school year consists of a principal and one assistant teacher.

      <P>Under the Rules for National Schools, no pupil shall be struck off the rolls for breaches of discipline without the prior consent of the patron and unless alternative arrangements are made for the enrolment of the pupil at another suitable school.  At second level the managerial authorities of each school are responsible for ensuring that a fair and efficient code of behaviour, encompassing rules, sanctions and procedures, is drawn up and applied in the school.</P>
      <P>Circumstances will vary from school to school and it is only those intimately involved with a particular school who can drawn up the detail of a code of discipline appropriate for that school. Accordingly, the most effective method of countering indiscipline is for each individual school to draw up its own code of behaviour.  In drawing up the code, school authorities should have regard to guidelines issued by my Department.</P>
      <P>In 1990 and 1991, my Department issued <i>Guidelines Towards a Positive Policy for School Behaviour and Discipline</i> together with <i>A Suggested Code of Behaviour and Discipline</i> to all schools.  Within these guidelines individual boards are given the discretion to work out specific details.  The guidelines lay considerable stress on the use of suspension only as a last resort and I am satisfied that schools also see it in that way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department gives assistance in securing placement in individual cases. Typically this can arise where a pupil has been suspended as a result of disruptive behaviour and where alternative arrangements need to be made.  In these <Col N="262" /> circumstances, my Department endeavours through a process of consultation with the schools and through its inspectorate to assist in the reinstatement of the pupil in the school or alternatively, his-her placement in another school.</P>
    <P>The truancy report, published in April 1994, highlighted the question of suspensions and expulsions from schools.  Subsequent to the publication of this report a task force was established within the Department to examine submissions on the report and to make recommendations for further action.</P>
    <P>My Department is continuing to develop its policy in this area and future initiatives will be taken only after full consultation with the education partners.</P>

      <Quest>her views on whether the Registry of Deeds, King's Inns, Dublin, constitutes a valuable genealogical source; her further views on the condition, indexing and storage of these documents; the plans, if any, she has to review the current circumstances; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The primary and statutory function of the Registry of Deeds is to provide a system of registration of property deeds.  The Registry of Deeds was set up in 1707 &ldquo;to secure purchasers and prevent forgeries and fraudulent gifts and conveyances of land&rdquo;.  I agree with the Deputy that it is now recognised by many people that the registry is a rich source for genealogical research with records going back to 1708.</P>
      <P>The material stored in the Registry of Deeds provides an invaluable, unique and irreplaceable reference for genealogical work as it maps all the important dealings with property from 1708 and has much incidental information contained in the four million memorials stored in the registry.  In addition, records of wills from 1708-1835 are also part of the resources of the registry.</P>
      <P>I recently opened the newly refurbished Registry of Deeds and I know that the refurbishment programme has substantially improved the genealogical service being provided.  The cost so far of this ongoing work is £1.51 million.</P>
      <P>The primary objectives of the refurbishment work were to improve accommodation and facilities in the context of welfare and safety of the public and staff and to improve security having regard to the importance of the building's contents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The genealogical area was one of the main areas that benefited from this refurbishment.  The names index, lands index and transcript books have been <Col N="264" /> reshelved on modern shelving.  The various rooms have been renovated and reading desks have also been provided in all areas where the various books are kept.  The refurbishment of these areas was in line with the approach to conservation applied in the redevelopment of the building as a whole.</P>
    <P>The job of refurbishment is not complete.  I understand that the following works remain to be undertaken: all the books are being cleaned and this work should be completed in the next few weeks.  The books are to be more conveniently ordered on completion of the cleaning programme.  Seating has been provided in one of the reading rooms. Final adjustments to the reading desks and the seating in the other rooms are being considered and designed at present.  Provision has been made to have staff available, on request, to assist members of the public wishing to inspect any books.  A new computer, server, is being installed at present and should be operational within the next two to three weeks.  This will improve the speed of searches for the public and will also result in additional workstations being available.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that every effort has been, and is being, made to provide a modern, safe, convenient and comfortable environment for members of the public to avail of the genealogical-historical riches contained in the Registry of Deeds.</P>

      <P>Both mobile and foot patrols are carried out on a regular basis in the Infirmary Road area.  The local community garda maintains regular contact with the local residents and Neighbourhood Watch co-ordinators for the area.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the Infirmary Road and the North Circular Road Neighbourhood Watch groups held a meeting on 4 November 1995 which was attended by a detective inspector from the Bridewell station, the local juvenile liaison officer and the community garda responsible for the Infirmary Road area.  I understand that concern was expressed at the meeting regarding vandalism and attacks on the elderly in the area.</P>
      <P>Following this meeting arrangements have been made for increased patrolling in the area with particular attention being directed to the protection of the elderly from attacks or acts of vandalism.</P>

      <P>Circuit Court statistics are compiled on the basis of the legal year which runs from 1 August to 31 July.  In the legal years 1993-94 and 1994-95 I am informed that there were 12 one day sittings and 16 one day sittings respectively of the Circuit Family Court in County Tipperary.  There are four Circuit Court venues in County Tipperary i.e. Clonmel, Nenagh, Thurles and Tipperary and the Circuit Family Court sits at each of these venues.</P>
      <P>With regard to the hearing of family law business in the 1995-96 legal year, I am informed that to date two family law sittings have been fixed i.e. 15 January at Nenagh and 11 March at Clonmel.  As the Deputy will appreciate under the Rules of the Circuit Court the fixing of sittings of the Circuit Court is a matter for the Judge of each circuit and is one in which I have no function.  I understand, however, from the Circuit Court Office that family law business will be included in the draft list for each of the Circuit Court venues in County Tipperary and the time to be allocated to family law will be decided at the presittings meetings, which are held approximately three weeks before each court sitting to arrange the lists of cases for hearing at each venue.</P>

      <Quest>his views on whether the public and information givers, whether statutory or voluntary, are well served by the sheer multiplicity of claim forms issued by his Department in view of the fact that the basis for all claims is either PRSI contributions, a means test or universal; whether two multiple option claim forms would be sufficient to meet the needs of information givers and the public; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 134 and 135 together.</P>
      <P>The social welfare system comprises a variety of schemes designed to support people at various stages of their lives or when certain contingencies arise.  It has been the practice to have a separate application form for each benefit type which is designed to elicit concise information needed to determine entitlement to the needs and circumstances of the applicant.  Some of the administrative functions of my Department have been decentralised in recent years and schemes are now administered from a number of centres, including those based in Sligo, Letterkenny and Longford.  The application forms also contain relevant addresses to ensure that they are forwarded directly to the relevant decision area.  The colouring of forms also helps avoid delays at the sorting and distribution stages within the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some progress has already been made towards streamlining administrative <Col N="272" /> procedures.  For example, schemes to support deserted wives, prisoners' wives, widows and single parents which were broadly similar in nature were amalgamated into a single unified lone parent's allowance scheme which now caters for people caring for children without the support of a partner.</P>
    <P>While the process of integrating and simplifying the system will continue, it is not considered that a single uniform application form covering all social insurance schemes, with a further form for assistance schemes, is feasible at this time.</P>
    <P>While the basic information required to identify the applicant and locate the appropriate PRSI record is common to all social insurance schemes, the specific information needed to determine entitlement to the most appropriate benefit type can differ significantly. Applications for disability benefit, for example, are made on a combined application form also completed by a medical practitioner who certifies the nature of the illness involved.  Unemployment benefit claims, on the other hand, are usually completed during a visit to one of the Department's local offices and the information required relates strictly to the employment position of the applicant.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the important role that the NSSB and other independent information givers have in the area of information, advice and welfare rights services.  I have already indicated my commitment to the further development of that role and my Department will be consulting with the relevant organisations on a number of matters, including the effectiveness of the current applications procedures and forms.</P>

      <P>A death grant under the Social Welfare Acts is payable, subject to the satisfaction of certain PRSI contribution conditions, on the death of an insured person or of their spouse or child under 18.  The amount of the death grant varies with the contribution record and, in the case of children, with the age of the child.  In addition, where a person dies while in receipt of a social welfare payment, the weekly payment usually continues to be paid to his or her adult dependant for a period of six weeks.  Payment may also continue for six weeks after the death of an adult or child dependent.  I have no proposals at present to make changes in this grant.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that the issue of long-term unemployment is a highly complex one not amenable to one single solution but requires a wide range of interventions at different levels.  These interventions necessarily involve a number of Government Departments and agencies, apart from mine, including the Departments of Enterprise and Employment, Education, Environment and Health. Because of this the Government has <Col N="274" /> decided that all relevant Departments should be involved in the preparation and implementation of a comprehensive strategy with clearly defined objectives to deal with all aspects of the problem of long-term unemployment.</P>
      <P>My Department, because of its interaction with the unemployed through its unemployment payments system and with all employers in the context of the PRSI system, obviously has a key role to play in this strategy.  It is uniquely placed to deliver supports to the unemployed because of its well developed local and regional structure, successful track record in delivering services on a large scale to all parts of the country and well-developed contact at local level with bodies, both statutory and voluntary, addressing aspects of the unemployment problem.  It is essential that the Department of Social Welfare builds on its particular strengths to make a worthwhile contribution to the Government strategy on unemployment.</P>
      <P>I do not, therefore, regard the functions my Department exercises in relation to a variety of programmes aimed at assisting and encouraging the unemployed and lone parents to return to work as being more appropriate to the other Government Departments. My Department has a range of employment supports in place to assist the unemployed and lone parents to make the transition to work.  The back to work allowance scheme in the past two years has been successful in assisting almost 9,500 formerly long-term unemployed persons to return to work as employees or self-employed persons.  The PRSI exemption scheme, acts as an incentive to employers to take on unemployed persons from the live register.  In addition, my Department provides a range of supports to enable unemployed people to avail of second-chance education opportunities at secondary, vocational and third level.  Participation by unemployed people in all these programmes is actively encouraged by the Department's locally based jobs facilitators.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="275" /> From an operational perspective it is in any event more cost-effective for my Department to administer the PRSI exemption and the back to work allowance schemes as both are closely allied to programmes already administered by my Department.  Transferring their administration to another Department would necessitate devising and resourcing costly communications arrangements.  For these reasons I do not envisage any change in the current arrangements.</P>
    <P>Family income supplement is designed to help families with children, on low earnings.  The aim of the scheme is to preserve the incentive to work for such families in circumstances in which they would otherwise be only marginally better off working than if in receipt of unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance.  £23 million is being paid this year to 11,000 employees supporting 30,000 children, their wages being inadequate.  It is my view that there is a need for statutory minimum wages.</P>
    <P>The Programme, <i>A Government of Renewal,</i> contains a commitment to create a child benefit supplement which will replace child dependant allowances currently payable to social welfare recipients and family income supplement.</P>
    <P>The Expert Working Group on the Integration of the Tax and Social Welfare Systems is examining the implications of introducing child benefit supplement.  The group is preparing its final report.  I expect this to be completed in the next few months.  As part of this overall examination of income support for children, the group is also looking at ways of improving FIS with particular reference to unemployment and poverty traps.</P>

      <P>The aim of the national fuel scheme is to assist people in receipt of long-term social welfare or health board payments who are unable to provide for their own heating needs.  In the case of a contributory pensioner, one of the conditions is that the pensioner and members of the household, must not have a combined income greater than £10.00 per week in addition to the contributory pension.</P>
      <P>The person concerned does not qualify for a fuel allowance as he is receipt of an occupational pension in excess of £10.00 a week in addition to his social welfare retirement pension.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that, as part of this year's budget improvements in social welfare, the previous income limit for the fuel allowance was increased from £5 to its current level of £10 per week with effect from the start of this year's winter heating season in October.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should remind the Deputy that there <Col N="278" /> is a facility available to assist people in certain circumstances who have special heating needs.  Under the supplementary welfare allowance &mdash; SWA &mdash; scheme a person who may have exceptional heating costs due to ill health or infirmity may qualify for a heating allowance.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Proinsias De Rossa)</NameTxt>
      <P>The legislative conditions governing entitlement to unemployment benefit were changed with effect from 4 January 1993 in the light of the extension of full social insurance cover at that time to all employed persons earning £25 a week or over.  The purpose of the changes was to enable part-time workers to have access to unemployment benefit when the need arose.</P>
      <P>The revised arrangements required that a part-time worker must have experienced a substantial loss of employment in order to be eligible for unemployment benefit.  A claimant whose normal working week was four days, or more, had to have lost two days of insurable employment.  In the case of claimants whose normal working week consisted of fewer than four days, a loss of one day of insurable employment was required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, those requirements have been considerably eased since their introduction in 1993.  For example, with effect from March 1993, the rule relating to substantial loss of employment was amended to provide for a loss of <Col N="279" /> only one day of insurable employment in order to meet the condition.</P>
    <P>In August 1993, special arrangements for casual dockers affected by the substantial loss of employment condition were introduced.  Dockers who were not entitled to unemployment benefit in any week, because they had not sustained a substantial loss of employment received special payments equal to what they would have received by way of unemployment benefit had the substantial loss of employment condition not been introduced.</P>
    <P>The rules were further relaxed in September 1994 with the exemption of casual workers from the requirement to satisfy the substantial loss of employment condition.  As well as dockers, the categories of worker covered by these regulations include employees in meat processing plants, the hotel business and the retail trade.</P>
    <P>The impact of the substantial loss of employment condition is being kept under review.</P>

      <P>In order to establish entitlement to deserted wife's benefit, the deciding officer must be satisfied that the husband left his wife of his own volition and that she has made reasonable efforts to secure adequate maintenance from him.</P>
      <P>It takes just over twelve weeks on average to decide claims to deserted wife's benefit at present.  The time taken, of course, will vary having regard to the circumstances of particular cases and the extent to which the facts are disputed by the parties involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The person concerned applied for deserted wife's benefit in May 1995 and <Col N="280" /> was interviewed by a local officer of the Department in June 1995.  Information was sought from the husband in July on the circumstances relating to their separation and on his financial and current household circumstances, as he would be legally liable to contribute to the Department if his wife's claim is granted.  The husband indicated that he was seeking legal advice before responding.  He is being pursued for the information needed to decide the claim.</P>
    <P>In the event of the husband refusing to co-operate, the case will still be decided if his wife makes efforts to obtain adequate maintenance from him by application to the District Court.  She has been requested by the Department to do so and her entitlement will be decided as soon as she responds.</P>

      <P>The most recent independent study carried out on behalf of the Department estimated that some 2 per cent of unemployment payments and 1 per cent of disability payments was being lost through fraudulent claims.</P>
      <P>However, since then my Department has recognised its structures so as to allow a more focused and co-ordinated approach to the work of combating fraud and abuse.  This reorganisation included the setting up of a regional structure in 1991, a Central Prosecution Section in 1991 and a Control Division in 1992.  Special Control Units were also established in all schemes sections to initiate, monitor, co-ordinate and report on all control initiatives and activities.</P>

    <P>There are, also, specific investigation units which work at local, regional and national level within the Department who carry out inspections of employers in relation to their PRSI obligations, <Col N="281" /> investigate cases of concurrent working and claiming of social welfare payments, review customer means for assistance payments and monitor their continuing entitlements to social welfare payments.

In the case to which the Deputy is referring, a combined area aid application was lodged in my Department's office in Cork on 28 April 1995.  Unfortunately, given that the application was received after the final closing date of 20 April 1995 I regret that no area aid payment can be made under the strict EU regulations governing these schemes.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the enormous differences in cost in mobile phone communications in the increasing single island economy north and south; the average cost of mobile phones provided by Telecom Éireann and the average tariff together with the corresponding figures from British Telecom, Northern Ireland; and the action, if any, he can take to overcome the effect of this on national competitiveness.</Quest>

      <P>It must be emphasised that the market for mobile telephony in the UK, including Northern Ireland, is starkly different to that in the Republic.  The UK market <Col N="289" /> has been fully liberalised for several years and a number of competitive offerings are available.  One feature of the competitive UK market is the sale of handsets at subsidised prices to customers who enter a contractual commitment to a single service provider for a number of years.  The cost of the subsidy is then recovered through relatively high rentals and call charges.  It is noteworthy that this type of terminal price subsidy in the UK applies to new connections only.  If a customer loses his-her mobile phone or if it is stolen, he-she must pay the full price of a replacement phone and that price will be largely similar to the price paid in Ireland.  Hence, when like is compared with like, prices of comparable mobile phones in over-the-counter transactions are roughly equivalent here and in the North.</P>
      <P>Since the Irish market is primarily business based at present, the tables below compare the mobile charges for the business customers of Telecom Éireann's Eircell here in the south with those offered by British Telecom's mobile subsidiary, Cellnet, which operates in the North.  All figures listed are VAT exclusive.</P>

    <P>It is clear that the Eircell charges for monthly rental are particularly competitive; indeed when the £5 rebate on GSM rental is taken into account, Eircell's actual monthly charge of £15 is fully 37.5 per cent cheaper than the £24 demanded from Cellnet's GSM customers in the North.  It should also be noted that the rental fee charged by Eircell provides the mobile customer with a range of value added services free of charge.  These include 24-hour automated answering service, directory assistance, call divert and call waiting facilities together with an alarm clock service.  UK operators offer similar services but usually at an additional cost. The Eircell airtime rates are also quite competitive; the peak charge for Analogue service is the tariff of most relevance to the average business user here and is, at 22p per minute, over 8 per cent cheaper than its British Telecom equivalent.  The corresponding peak charge for the GSM service is only slightly higher than the UK equivalent.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy is aware, I have already taken action which will ensure the development of competitive mobile telephony services in the Republic of Ireland.  Indeed the whole thrust of my policy on mobile telephony is, through competition, to achieve much wider penetration and ownership at affordable prices.  I recently announced Esat Digifone as the winner in the competition to become Ireland's second mobile operator.  One of the selection criteria in that competition was the applicant's approach to tariffing and I am satisfied that the introduction of competition in the Irish mobile market with the presence of Esat Digifone from late 1996 onwards will lead to a considerable drop in the cost of mobile telephony, as well <Col N="291" /> as a wider choice and availability of service, for business and consumer users alike.  Indeed there is evidence to show that Telecom Éireann's Eircell is already responding to the emerging prospect of competition and I am sure that the Deputy will have noted the steady fall in the price of mobile phones here in recent times.  Such improvements in the cost of telecommunications services, together with their wider availability, will inevitably have a positive impact on Ireland's competitiveness.</P>

      <Quest>the basis on which the decision was taken to proceed with the light rail transit lines to Dundrum and Tallaght and to defer the Ballymun line; and if he will make available the supporting reports for this decision which were prepared for his Department, for Government or for the Dublin Transport Initiative.</Quest>

      <P>The core light rail network recommended by the Dublin Transportation Initiative provices for lines to Tallaght, Cabinteely, via the Harcourt Street line and Ballymun at an estimated cost of approximately £300 million, in 1993 prices.  The Operational Programme for Transport 1994 to 1999 provides for a total expenditure of £200 million on light rail during the period.  The recently published DTI final report endorsed this expenditure of £200 million as about the limit of what could be physically implemented in the period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In late 1993 a high level project team, comprising CIE personnel and consultants, analysed a range of possible options derived from the core light rail network which could be implemented within the £200 million allocation for light rail.  These options were examined against a number of criteria including financial performance, congestion <Col N="292" /> alleviation, environmental impact and ease of construction.  In October 1994 the Government noted and approved the provisional finding of the project team that the links to Tallaght and Dundrum should be constructed during the current Structural Funds round, with the remaining DTI-recommended links to be constructed thereafter.</P>
    <P>Since the Government decision, the project team has been engaged in detailed planning work for the two priority phases, including the determination of the preferred technical route alignments.  This work is almost complete.  I expect to formally launch a comprehensive public consultation programme on the preferred technical route alignments for the two priority phases shortly.  That will provide an appropriate opportunity to outline the basis for the decision on implementation priorities.</P>

      <P>The Defence Forces pensions schemes provide for the payment of a special increment &mdash; currently £3.69 a week &mdash; in addition to his basic pension to a soldier for each year of his pensionable service in excess of 21 years but not exceeding 31 years.  As a general rule, this special increment continues to be payable until the pensioner becomes entitled to a social welfare retirement pension, at age 65, or to a contributory old age pension, at age 66, at which stage the increment ceases to be payable.  The personal rate of either social welfare pension is considerably greater than the maximum special increment. Exceptionally, the increment continues to be payable up to 70 years of age in the case of a pensioner who retired prior to 1 August 1978 provided he is not in receipt of a social welfare retirement pension.</P>
      <P>The arrangements in place are in accordance with the principle of co-ordinating occupational pensions in the public sector with social welfare pensions in the case of employees who are fully insured under the Social Welfare Acts.  Soldiers are so insured.</P>
      <P>The person in question is in receipt of a contributory old age pension and retired prior to 1 August 1978.  He reached 70 years of age on 30 August 1995 and the special increment ceased to be payable from that date.  He had been advised of the position by my Department in 1992.</P>
