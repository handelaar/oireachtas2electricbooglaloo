On proposed legislation for a third banking force, in January the Taoiseach promised the conclusions of the Government's deliberations would be available before Easter, at Easter he promised they would be available in May and in May he said they would be available in June, will the Minister for Finance indicate the position in this regard?

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen) Nora Owen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendments No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 3, line 26, after &ldquo;applies&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or a state or territory outside the State designated by the Minister for Foreign Affairs under section 2 of this Act&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We had a detailed and helpful discussion at the Select Committee on Legislation and Security on the Committee Stage of this Bill.  It highlighted the benefit of the committee system in that it allows a real debate to take place on legislation.  I undertook to consider suggestions and amendments put forward by Members and I am pleased that I was able to accept a number of them. The fact that I tabled nine amendments on Report Stage is a measure of the constructiveness of the debate on Committee Stage and I thank Members who participated.</P>
      <P>The effect of amendments Nos. 1 and 5 is to make it possible for a transfer to take place between this State and a State that is not a party to the convention. As matters stand the convention may be acceded to by any interested States, not necessarily members of the Council of Europe.  Five States that are not members of the Council of Europe, including the United States and Canada, are now contracting parties to the convention. Some States, however, may be unable to make a commitment to signing the convention on a multilateral basis but may be interested in signing on a bilateral basis.  These amendments would give such a bilateral arrangement binding legal effect so that an Irish national serving a sentence in a country which is not party to the convention but is party to a bilateral arrangement could apply for repatriation to an Irish prison. Foreign nationals serving sentences here will also be able to apply for transfer to their countries if they are party to a bilateral arrangement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="345" /> The amendments differ somewhat from those Deputy O'Donoghue tabled in that they make it clear it will be for the Minister for Foreign Affairs rather than the Minister for Justice to negotiate such bilateral agreements.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs will be able to designate the third country concerned after which all of the provisions of the Bill will apply.  The application for transfer and the transfer will be treated exactly as if the country was a party to the convention in a multilateral way.  In other words, the three-way consent will have to exist.  The criteria for transfer and all the other conditions that will apply will be the same.</P>
    <P>Apart from some slight differences my amendments meet the requests made by Deputy O'Donoghue and others on Committee Stage and supported by Deputies Woods and Browne in that they will fill a lacuna in the Bill. I commend them to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I warmly welcome the Minister's amendments and thank her for having taken our comments on board.  I can well understand why the Minister would wish it to be the Minister for Foreign Affairs who would designate a non-convention State since his Department would be <i>au fait</i> with such matters.  Some States which may never be convention States might have a good relationship with this State and be willing to enter into an arrangement whereby prisoners could be transferred. The number of Irish nationals in such States is relatively small.  They are very far from home and may be incarcerated in appalling prison conditions suffering tremendous hardship.</P>
      <P>It is extremely important that the provisions of this Bill be extended to that small minority whom I am sure will welcome the opportunities provided by these amendments.  I have no difficulty in withdrawing my amendments and accepting the Minister's admirable ones along the same lines.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 3, line 30, after &ldquo;deprivation&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or restriction&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In some foreign countries, penalties or sanctions are imposed which do not amount to imprisonment but to a restriction on liberty.  I have in mind house arrest sentences imposed in a small number of Asian countries where a sentenced person is sent to a remote place and required to reside there. Within that context, while the deprivation of liberty does not amount to imprisonment, the restriction imposed on the individual is very severe.  I suggest that the Minister take this amendment on board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>For the reasons explained on Committee Stage I cannot go along with the amendment.  As Deputy O'Donoghue said, its purpose is to extend the provisions of the Act to alternative penalties imposed in some countries, such as weekend or evening imprisonment.  The definition of &ldquo;sentence&rdquo; used in the Bill is identical to that in the Council of Europe Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons. Article 1 under Definitions which reads as follows:</P>
      <P>For the purpose of this Convention:</P>
      <P>(a) &ldquo;sentence&rdquo; means any punishment or measure involving deprivation of liberty ordered by a court for a limited or unlimited period of time on account of a criminal offence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is clear that the definition of &ldquo;sentence&rdquo; in the convention &mdash; to which we are giving legislative effect &mdash; clearly is meant to apply only to punishments or measures which involve &ldquo;deprivation of liberty&rdquo; not curtailment or any other restriction on liberty.  To introduce the concept of &ldquo;restrictions&rdquo; would go beyond the terms of the relevant convention clearly aimed at those who are <Col N="347" /> in custody.  The same humanitarian considerations could not be applied to those whose liberty is restricted.  Obviously, the most severe restriction on liberty is the deprivation of liberty and incarceration.</P>
    <P>It can be argued that any non-monetary sanction imposed by a court, such as probation or community service, amounts to a restriction of liberty.  It would be going beyond the scope of the convention for us to have an obligation to people in those categories.  If we provided for that we would expect that if we imposed a similar type of restrictive sentence on a non-national who wanted to return to his or her country, such person would seek the same privilege if and when returned to his or her country.</P>
    <P>The provisions of this Bill are based on the convention and we should not go beyond its terms in the manner requested by Deputy O'Donoghue. Therefore, I am afraid I cannot accept his amendment.</P>

      <P>3.&mdash;A person on whom a sentence has been imposed in the State and to whom the provisions of this Act concerning a transfer out of the State may apply shall be informed, in a language which he or she understands, as soon as may be after the commencement of the sentence, of the substance of this Act.</P>
      <P>In the course of our debate on Committee Stage Deputies O'Donoghue and O'Donnell tabled amendments to provide that foreign nationals serving sentences here should be informed of their right to apply for a transfer to their native country under the provisions of this Bill.  With or without such a provision, once the convention is ratified, there will be an obligation to inform any person to whom the provisions of the Bill may apply of its substance.  That obligation is laid down in Article 4.1 of the convention.  I also indicated I had no problem in strengthening the Bill by enshrining therein some sections of the convention.  Therefore, I have no difficulty in including the obligation of furnishing information to a non-national who would require to know the substantive provisions of the Bill once passed.</P>
      <P>The wording of my amendment adheres closely to that of Article 4.1 of the convention and, in effect, provides that the person should be informed as quickly as possible of the substance of the convention, on which basis I commend it to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Donoghue's amendment requires that the prisoner should be informed at the commencement of his <Col N="349" /> or her sentence while Deputy O'Donnell's requires that it be done within two weeks of the imposition of such sentence whereas mine proposes it be done &ldquo;as soon as may be&rdquo; meaning it must be done as quickly as possible, representing a compromise between both Deputies' amendments.  My slightly more flexible wording will ensure that the information is properly furnished, with advice.  It may not perhaps be necessary to immediately furnish somebody information, particularly a non-national who may have difficulty in understanding its full import, even though it may be furnished in their native language so that the stipulation &ldquo;as soon as may be after the commencement of the sentence&rdquo; affords prison staff who will have to furnish such information greater flexibility to have on hand somebody who can advise the prisoner concerned.</P>
    <P>I commend my amendment as a compromise between the two Opposition ones.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the fact that the Minister recognised the need to stitch into the legislation the obligation to provide information.  As said on earlier Stages, the Bill does not give a right to a person to be transferred; it gives them the right to apply for a transfer.  It is important that people are made aware of their right to apply and the procedures that will follow such an application. People have the right to apply to the Minister and, following that, an Executive decision will be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many Deputies, including myself, were concerned on Committee Stage that any discretionary powers given to the Minister should have corresponding safeguards as to its exercise.  Following a wide-ranging survey of how the State interfaces with the individual, a report by the Ombudsman concluded that information should be much more freely provided to citizens in relation to their rights.  We do not have a good record in this regard although the Minister stated that the convention places an obligation on member states to make <Col N="350" /> people aware of their rights.  I welcome the fact that the Minister recognised this and I am withdrawing my amendment.</P>

      <P>It is desirable that prisoners are informed of the existence of the Act and the convention.  It is conceivable that some prisoners may not know of the provisions of the Act and the minutiae of the legislation.  I also welcome the fact that the Minister will now provide for the Department to advise prisoners of their right to a transfer out of the State and I hope that similar legislation will be introduced in other convention countries.  This is a humane and important provision.  In that context, it would be remiss of me not to extend my warmest congratulations and the congratulations of this House to the Irish Commission for Prisoners Overseas, which has campaigned for the introduction of this legislation and undertaken much work to inform prisoners about it.</P>

While these provisions are laid down in the convention, which will become applicable when the Bill is enacted, we must ensure there is not any doubt in the minds of prisoners as to their entitlements under the Bill.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Donoghue referred to the Irish Commission for Prisoners Overseas. That organisation has been extremely helpful, not just to me but to Opposition Deputies.  I am sure they received the volume of amendments prepared by the commission which were based on its many years of experience in this area.  I formally accepted the commission's own draft Bill which was very useful to us in the preparation of this Bill.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
      <P>In page 4, to delete lines 20 to 22 and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3) Subject to subsection (4) of this section, the Minister shall grant an application under subsection (1) of this section if the Minister is satisfied that the following requirements have been fulfilled, save only where there are substantial grounds for believing that the sentenced person concerned may be in danger of being subjected to torture, inhumane or degrading treatment if transferred, or where the Minister is otherwise satisfied that there are good and substantial reasons for believing that it would not be in the interests of justice or the welfare of the sentenced person to grant such an application.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment would give a foreign national imprisoned here, who satisfies the criteria in the legislation, a right to transfer to his or her home country provided that the native state agrees to accept the prisoner.  I know the Minister will say that the legislation is based on the concept of consent; the consent of the sentencing state, the receiving state and the prisoner.  The concept of consent would not be undermined by allowing a person imprisoned here the right to transfer out of the State.  This House can legislate to provide for such circumstances and the concept of consent would continue to be central to any such legislation because the receiving state would have to consent to the transfer. The Minister should take all reasonable steps with due expedition to request the administering state to agree to the transfer in the event of this amendment being made to the Bill. <Col N="352" /> That is the reason I tabled amendment No. 10.</P>
    <P>The Minister may well argue that this would eliminate her discretion in relation to an application by a prisoner, and I accept that, but it would give a right of transfer to an individual to return to the receiving state.  I understand the Minister's difficulty with the concept of discretion being eliminated in so far as she is concerned but what is her reason for denying a prisoner, who is a foreign national, the right to transfer out of this jurisdiction assuming, of course, that the receiving state agrees to accept the prisoner?</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>It will come as no surprise to Deputy O'Donoghue, having listened to my views on Second and Committee Stages, that I am not in a position to accept these amendments because they would substantially remove the discretion available to me, as Minister, to refuse to consent to the transfer of a prisoner from this jurisdiction. A central feature of this convention is that all three parties, the sentencing state, the receiving state and the prisoner, must agree to the transfer. That three way consent must be reflected in our legislation and this legislation is implementing the convention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I and any Minister for Justice, would be generally anxious to facilitate the transfer of foreign nationals back to their own country in the same way as we are anxious to see a facility for Irish people serving sentences far away from their families to come back and serve the remainder of their sentences here. There are humanitarian considerations but also the consideration &mdash; let us be frank about it &mdash; that if foreign nationals apply for a transfer out of this jurisdiction it frees up a place in our prisons to allow for better consideration of applications coming the other way. Obviously I would be disposed in a positive way to having that kind of free space for an Irish applicant coming from somewhere else.  However, we cannot rule out the possibility, rare though it might be, that other considerations that <Col N="353" /> would, perhaps, outweigh humanitarian considerations would have to be taken into account.</P>
    <P>For the first time in the history of this State this measure will allow for the exchange of prisoners between one jurisdiction and another, and we have no practical experience of how this will work.  For that reason and others we must maintain the freedom and latitude in the Bill, in keeping with the Convention. I do not want to create a situation where, in some unforeseen circumstance that I cannot anticipate, a Minister's hands might be tied and he or she be obliged to grant a transfer when there are very good reasons to refuse one.  We do not have any examples to give but, for the sake of argument, let us say that a non-national serving a sentence here for smuggling drugs into this country is transferred to his or her own country; the penal system in that country might deal more leniently with drug smuggling and the Convention may have been implemented in a different way from the way we are implementing it.  There are two methods of implementing the Convention: continued enforcement of a sentence or what amounts to a retrial in the country to which the prisoner is transferred.  We are implementing it by way of continued enforcement of sentence. If the receiving country operates a different regime, it is possible that somebody who had smuggled large qualities of drugs into this country and caused great damage might, on being transferred back to their own country, be treated more leniently.  It would not be suitable for us to give positive consideration to an application for a transfer in such a case.  People who have been damaged by the smuggling of drugs into this country would like to be assured that the sentence as imposed by the sentencing country will be applied.  That is an example that might arise but, having no experience of the working of this Convention, we cannot fully envisage conditions that might arise.</P>
    <P>Section 2 allows us to comply with our obligations under the Convention, <Col N="354" /> and it would not be prudent to go beyond that.  I do not believe there will be any great difficulty in consenting to transfer of non-nationals back to their own country.  We would have to be cognisant of the fact, as mentioned in Deputy O'Donoghue's motion, that one would not return somebody to a country where it is known they would be subjected to torture, inhuman or degrading treatment or where their lives would be in danger.  The acceptance of Deputy O'Donoghue's amendment would give rise to unforeseen and undesirable difficulties.</P>
    <P>The effects of amendments Nos. 13 and 14 would be to oblige the Minister, where a transfer has been consented to, to issue a warrant within 14 days.  I appreciate the thinking behind these amendments, but there would be no practical advantage in incorporating them, and doing so might give rise to practical difficulties and might even work against the transfer of prisoners if the examination of their application for transfer required more than 14 days.  If I were caught by the 14-day rule, I might be obliged to refuse a transfer.  In particular, the state to which the prisoner is being transferred may not be in a position to receive that person straight away. In those circumstances it would be premature for me to issue a warrant because there would be a gap between the time of their leaving our jurisdiction and getting a prison place in their own country.  I assure the House that there will be no undue delay on our part in arranging for transfers.  For the reasons I have given, I cannot accept this amendment.</P>

      <P>In respect of signatories to the Convention to date, their laws in relation to drug smuggling are, if anything hasher than ours.  The philosophy behind the amendment is to exercise some moral authority over other states in relation to the transfer of Irish prisoners because I fear some states, for certain reasons which may not be valid, may not wish to allow certain prisoners into this State.  While expressing my disappointment that the Minister was not <Col N="355" /> in a position to take it on board, I will not press the amendment.</P>

      <P>In page 4, line 38, after &ldquo;consents&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;in writing&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>As amendments No. 9 is in the name of both myself and Deputy O'Donoghue, I have no doubt that it will recieve immediate and widespread support.  On Committee Stage Deputy O'Donoghue tabled an amendment to section 2 (3) (d) to provide that where a person consents to the transfer outside the State on a sentenced person's behalf such consent must be in writing.  This is in the convention but it is a good idea to include it in the Bill.  I undertook to table an additional amendment to a subsequent section, section 4 (3) (d), which would provide a corresponding requirement in respect of incoming transfers.  I tabled both amendments because I was not sure whether or not Deputy O'Donoghue would be tabling an amendment on Report Stage.  It is to ensure that in regard to transfer into or out of this country consent must be given in writing. It is a technical amendment which I commend to the House.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 12:</P>
      <P>In page 5, between lines 13 and 14, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(6)  In deciding whether or not to grant the application under subsection (1) of this section, the Minister shall not discriminate between applicants on grounds of race, colour, ethnic identity, gender, marital status, age, religion, sexual orientation, medical condition, or political opinion.</P>
      <P>(7)  The Minister shall develop and publish criteria in accordance with which decisions whether or not to grant an application under section (1) of this section shall be made.  In devising such criteria, the Minister shall have regard to such factors as the length of sentence that the sentenced person has remaining to serve, the circumstances of the sentenced person's family, and the sentenced person's health.</P>
      <P>(8)  Where the Minister refuses an application under subsection (1) of this section, the Minister shall furnish to the applicant within one month a written statement of the grounds for such refusal.</P>
      <P>(9)  An appeal against a refusal by the Minister of an application under subsection (1) of this section shall lie to the High Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(10)  Where within the period of two months begining on the day of of receipt by the Minister of an application in writing from a sentenced person under subsection (1) of this section for transfer out of the State the Minister has omitted to grant or refuse to grant the application, a decision by the Minister to grant the <Col N="357" /> application shall be regarded as having been made on the last day of the said period, and the Minister shall be under a duty to seek the agreement to transfer of the proposed administering state.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>There is a number of amendments contained under the umbrella of this amendment.  The amendment provides that the Minister should publish criteria in regard to decisions on whether or not to grant an application for transfer of a prisioner and that in devising such criteria the Minister should have regard to such factors as &ldquo;the length of sentence that the sentenced person has remaining to serve, the circumstance of the sentenced person's family and the sentenced persons's health&rdquo;.  It is imperative that prisoners know the criteria involved in making a decision on their application for a transfer and they should be published.</P>
    <P>The amendment serves the interests of openness and transparency.  The prisoner would know where he or she stood and the public would be aware of the criteria to be followed in making a decision on an application for transfer out of this jurisdiction or, in the case of an application from an Irish prisoner in a foreign State which is a signatory to the Convention or a State designated for the purposes of the Convention by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, for transfer to this State.  The amendments would ensure the Minister complies with minimum criteria in deciding on applications.  The Minister indicated she would not agree to a right of transfer for a foreign national in an Irish prison and that is another reason for publishing the criteria.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that we do not know how the legislation will work in practice.  She is not obliged to say what the criteria are or publish them immediately. She can develop and publish them at a later date in the light of the operation of the legislation.  I also provide in the amendment that in deciding whether to grant an application the Minister must not discriminate between <Col N="358" /> applicants on grounds of race, colour, ethnic identity, gender, marital status, age, religion, sexual orientation, medical condition or political opinion.  That is desirable.  I fully accept the integrity of the Minister as far as non-discrimination is concerned but it is desirable that such an amendment be accepted.</P>
    <P>In this block of amendments I propose that where the Minister refuses an application, she will furnish a written statement of the grounds for such refusal to the applicant within one month.  Any prisoner in this State whose application is refused has a right to know why it was refused.  Equally an Irish prisoner in a foreign state which is a signatory to the Convention or one designated by the Minister for Foreign Affairs pursuant to this legislation is entitled to be told by the Minister for Justice the reason for refusing his or her application for transfer.  That is in accordance with natural justice.  A person has a right to know.</P>
    <P>There has been much complaint recently that people cannot get information from Government Departments or State agencies.  They cannot see their own files.  It would contravene the spirit of the Freedom of Information Bill if the Minister were to refuse to give the grounds for refusing an application for a transfer.  When the prisoner receives the grounds for refusal they could appeal to the High Court.  If a prisoner is not told why the application was refused it would be difficult to mount any serious challenge in the High Court. How could a prisoner appeal if they did not know the grounds for refusing the application?</P>
    <P>That is a fundamental and extremely important amendment.  The Minister is exercising a quasi-judicial function when deciding on applications for transfers. If the Minister refuses to accept this block of amendments would it be within the power of the prisoner, whether in this or another State, to seek a judicial review of the decision in the High Court?  If so, it would be extremely serious.  The decision would be made in secret and the prisoner would not be <Col N="359" /> told the reason for the refusal.  The Minister would have no option but to outline the reasons for refusing the application for transfer.  I understand her desire to keep the legislation as simple and direct as possible but we must keep in mind natural justice, the possibility of litigation, the need for openness and transparency, and we must respect the right of the individual to know.</P>
    <P>Far too often decisions are made and no reasons are given for them.  A secrecy culture has built up around certain elements of the bureaucracy in the State.  For example, health boards have only recently been obliged to set out the precise reasons for the refusal of a medical card.  An individual has the right to know and this amendment seeks to ensure this.</P>
    <P>Subsection (10) of amendment No. 12 states:</P>
    <P>Where within the period of two months beginning on the day of receipt by the Minister of an application in writing from a sentenced person under subsection (1) of this section for transfer out of the State the Minister has omitted to grant or refuse to grant the application, a decision by the Minister to grant the application shall be regarded as having been made on the last day of the said period, and the Minister shall be under a duty to seek the agreement to transfer of the proposed administering state.</P>
    <P>In regard to an individual incarcerated in a designated state or a state which is a signatory to the Convention, subsection (11) of amendment No. 19 states:</P>
    <P>Where within the period of two months beginning on the day of receipt by the Minister of a request under subsection (1) of this section for transfer into the State the Minister has omitted to grant or refuse to grant the request, a decision by the Minister to grant the request shall be regarded as having been made on the last day of the said period, and the Minister <Col N="360" /> shall be under a duty, where necessary, to seek the agreement to transfer of the sentencing state.</P>
    <P>These amendments seek to ensure that decisions are made without delay in the case of applications by a prisoner in this State for transfer out of the State and by a prisoner in a designated state or a state which is a signatory to the Convention for transfer into this State.  These amendments are of fundamental importance in the context of an individual's right to know and from the point of view of natural justice, and I strongly believe they should form a composite statutory imperative.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>We discussed these amendments in detail in the select committee. The difficulty is that amendments Nos. 12 and 20 are omnibus amendments which cover a number of issues.  I said I could not accept certain elements of the amendments but readily undertook to look at other elements of them.  One of the difficulties with an omnibus amendment is that one can accept some elements but not others.</P>
      <P>I have looked again at these amendments with a view to seeing which elements can be taken on board.  I have looked at the anti-discrimination clause and the proposal that the grounds for the refusal of transfers in and out of the State should be made known to the applicant.  These issues are covered by my amendment No. 25, subsection (2) of which states that the Minister will, where practicable and where the interests of justice do not preclude so doing, set out the reasons for a refusal. Obviously this will be subject to security and other considerations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the select committee my difficulty with the anti-discrimination clause was that in considering applications for transfers I would have to make distinctions between applicants on the basis of gender, age, medical condition or other grounds which would require to be considered in the context of the practical day-to-day operation of the prison <Col N="361" /> system.  I was anxious to avoid a situation where the making of such distinctions could be perceived as discrimination against an applicant.  Having discussed the matter with the parliamentary draftsman I have come up with the satisfactory formula in subsection (1) of amendment No. 25 which dispels the problems I outlined at the Select Committee and does not distract from the substantive point that there can be no discrimination between applicants without good reason.  I am afraid that someone would regard the distinctions which have to be made on practical grounds as discrimination, and under subsection (2) of amendment No. 25 the Minister is obliged to furnish a statement specifying the reasons for the refusal of any transfer into or out of the State.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donoghue's amendments seek to remove the discretionary element in the implementation of the convention.  The tripartite agreement between the sentencing state, the administering state and the prisoner is the kernel of the convention.  Deputy O'Donoghue is seeking to remove the discretionary element while I want to ensure that the administering Minister will have discretion.</P>
    <P>He also proposes that if a decision is not made within two months then the application should be approved automatically. This is similar to the system whereby, a planning application is automatically approved if the county council makes a mistake and does not make a decision within two months.  I do not want to impose a time limit as it may not be in the best interests of the applicants. For example, at times there may be delays in communications between the sentencing country and the state to which the prisoner wishes to be transferred and if there was a two month time limit I would have no choice but to refuse an application which might have been approved if more time was available.</P>
    <P>On the question of an appeals system, if the Minister of the day has the right to refuse an application the system <Col N="362" /> could be turned on its head by giving the prisoner the right to appeal.  The Minister may decide to refuse an application if the report from the sentencing country indicates that the prisoner has, to use prison parlance, been of bad behaviour for a period.  However, if he applies for a transfer some months later and the report states that his behaviour had greatly improved he has the right to have his application considered again. The refusal of an application does not deny a prisoner the right to continue to apply for a transfer, and this point must be made clear to prisoners.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donoghue asked me to publish criteria under subsection (7).  In section 2 a large number of criteria is listed and the prisoner will be made aware of this.  It spells out, as the convention does, the conditions under which a prisoner must be considered for a transfer.  The difficulty about preparing a further list of criteria would be that one could militate against a prisoner by not including some specific criteria that would apply to one or two prisoners.  I have already agreed on Committee Stage to issue an annual report.  That annual report will spell out clearly the criteria used.  If after the first annual report, it appears possible to set out the criteria more specifically in legislative terms it will be open to the House to look again at that section.  We are dealing with prisoners who have committed horrific crimes and there must be latitude to openly examine the circumstances of each.  I do not want to be tied to either having to refuse an application or grant an application because some specific criteria has been laid down.  I have gone as far as I can go to accept some of the amendments tabled.  I am unable to accept the remainder of the amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>In response to the Minister's amendment I recognised on Committee Stage the thrust of the reservations put forward by Deputy O'Donoghue. What we are talking about here is administrative law, a principle of which is that any exercise of executive <Col N="363" /> power of a Government Department or of a Minister should be amenable and open to scrutiny by judicial review in the High Court.  Had the Minister not gone as far as she did in accepting the principal reservations Deputy O'Donoghue and I expressed on Committee Stage, people would have had to bring applications for judicial review to the High Court.  It is vital in the exercise of executive power such as this that people know why decisions have been reached so far as that does not impede justice.  I am pleased the Minister has accepted that, in principle, apart from circumstances where the interests of justice do not preclude doing so, a statement will be given to the person who has applied under the provisions of this legislation to be considered for a transfer.  The Minister's amendment has gone a long way to address the concerns we expressed on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another exercise of a discretionary power would be the petition system which has recently come under scrutiny in the courts.  It has been found that the way that discretionary power was exercised did not live up to the standards of proper administrative law.  If decisions were being made by officials of the Department, indirectly by the Minister, a person could legitmately feel that natural justice had not been seen to be done in terms of exercising that power. It would be open to that person to go to the High Court and seek a judicial review of the exercise of that discretionary power by the Minister.  The Bill is better because of this amendment. Without this amendment, which takes on board the concerns expressed on Committee Stage, it would have been an unfettered exercise of a discretionary power with long term implications for the person involved.  It is not a right to transfer, it is only a right to apply.  The Minister has accepted that the application must be treated openly in a proper way &mdash; while still retaining the discretion and all the politics that goes with the exercise of such power &mdash; and her amendment is an appropriate <Col N="364" /> response to the concerns expressed on Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>I am disappointed the Minister stated she will not agree to the publication of criteria because people should be entitled to know the background to the decision about to be made.  I acknowledge that the Minister has gone some way down the road by agreeing to specify the reasons an individual is refused the transfer into or out of the State but she has not gone far enough.  There should be a right of appeal to the High Court and this right of appeal should be specified in the legislation.  That it is not specified in the legislation leads me to the conclusion that it may well be that an individual will have the right of judicial review in respect of the decision in any case and this is a more cumbersome procedure.</P>
      <P>I accept the Minister has gone some of the way specifically in relation to setting out the non discriminatory provisions in a manner I advocated.  The notification of the reasons for refusal is welcome also.  Unfortunately the Minister has decided not to accept the other amendments which I tabled.  In those circumstances the best I can do is to withdraw them but I do so with great reluctance.</P>

If an appeal system is introduced it may be on the basis of somebody being refused and wishing to appeal it on one of the grounds of refusal but, essentially, that is at the kernel of this convention.  If a person has the right to go to court to appeal a refusal that automatically takes away the right and the discretion of the Minister to make a decision on the application. A court might decide on appeal to allow the transfer where there has been a refusal and the conditions for that transfer might not exist.  One of the reasons for refusal might have been that the receiving state had made a strong case that it did not want this person returned or did not have a facility for <Col N="365" /> this person.  If a person was returned in those circumstances effectively he would be released from serving the remainder of his sentence.  I am sure that is not what Deputy O'Donoghue has in mind but it is a possibility.  Our annual report will allow us to look at the criteria issue.  Giving the reasons for refusal to each applicant will clarify the criteria involved.  It stands to reason, when the Minister is considering an application, that issues such as length of sentence, the health or sex of a person will be considered.  What else would I take into account when considering an application?  I will consider what a person is in jail for, what sentence is being served, its length and the implications of being transferred out of this country, etc.</P>
      <P>The prisoners know what I will consider when dealing with their applications. I have seen letters they write to get temporary release.  They know why they are in prison and what grounds they must present so that the Minister may consider favourably any conditions under which they are serving their sentence. I thank Deputies for their positive reactions to my amendments.</P>

      <P>In page 6, line 16, after &ldquo;State.&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;A sentenced person in a Convention state may request the Minister in writing to consent to such a transfer into the State, subject to the subsequent agreement of the sentencing state.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment would allow direct approaches to the Minister for Justice from prisoners abroad.  At that point I <Col N="366" /> hope the Minister would, in appropriate circumstances, find herself able to assist in obtaining the agreement of the sentencing state.  This is a desirable change and the Minister may have an amendment to this effect, which I would welcome.</P>
    <P>A person in a foreign jurisdiction may find himself alone.  He may apply to the sentencing state for a transfer to this State but receive an unsympathetic hearing, for reasons best known to the sentencing state.  In that context he should be in a position to enlist the help and support of his native state.  That is the intention behind this amendment, which I regard as desirable.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 27 provides that where an Irish national or person who would be regarded as such is sentenced in another state and wishes to apply for transfer to this State, that person may apply to the Minister; and if the sentencing state does not forward an application from the person concerned to the Minister, she shall be empowered to request the transfer of that person.  This is to give the Minister the power to request the transfer of a prisoner held in a designated state or in a signatory state to the convention.  It makes the Minister pro-active, in that she can request the transfer.  This amendment is also desirable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised this amendment was put down because we amended the Bill on Committee Stage to take on board the provisions in Deputy O'Donoghue's amendments.  I moved the amendment to deal with those points and the Bill as amended in committee makes it clear that an applicant serving a sentence abroad may make an application for transfer directly to me.  In the convention, it is implied that such a person applies to the sentencing state and in turn the application comes here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment to section 4 (2) provides that without prejudice to subsection (1) of that section, a request to transfer into the State to serve the sentence, or the balance of the sentence <Col N="367" /> imposed in a sentencing state, may be made directly to the Minister by or on behalf of a sentenced person.  The Bill as amended on Committee Stage allows a person serving a prison sentence in England or France to write directly to me instead of making an application to those authorities.  With no disrespect to Deputy O'Donoghue, these two amendments are superfluous to the Bill.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 16:</P>
      <P>In page 6, to delete lines 17 to 22 and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3) Subject to subsection (4) of this section, the Minister shall consent to a request made under subsection (1) of this section if the Minister is satisfied that the following requirements have been fulfilled:</P>
      <P>(a) that the sentenced person concerned is, for the purpose of the Convention, regarded by the State as a national of the State.  This shall include such persons, being nationals of another state who have or have developed close ties with the State such as to make it desirable for humanitarian reasons that they should serve their sentences within the State;&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The philosophy of this amendment is to allow for a flexible definition of Irish nationals for the purposes of the legislation. Some people have close ties with this country &mdash; they may not necessarily be Irish citizens but they may have family ties to this State which should, for humanitarian reasons, allow them to make a successful application for transfer into a prison in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment expands on the <Col N="368" /> definition of a national for these purposes and provides that a national of another State will be regarded as a national of this State where the transfer of the national is considered appropriate having regard to any close ties the national has with the State.  This provides that an individual in prison in this State has the same right as an Irish person in a foreign state.  An individual in this State who has family ties with Great Britain but is not a citizen of that country would have the right to transfer there.  This provides that the reverse will apply and extends the definition of &ldquo;national&rdquo; for this legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 17 is in my name.  Deputy O'Donoghue, with clever use of words, implied that the only import of his amendment is to define &ldquo;national&rdquo; but he also changed the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; to &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.  He has shown ingenuity in trying to make the discretionary powers of the Minister mandatory but it is difficult for me to accept that part of the amendment.  For the reasons I gave before I cannot accept what appears to be the simple change from &ldquo;may&rdquo; to &ldquo;shall&rdquo;. However, I do accept that the term &ldquo;national&rdquo; for the purposes of incoming transfers should be interpreted in a wide sense to include persons who have close ties with this country.  My amendment takes on board the concern which was expressed on Committee Stage.  As I said at that time, if the Deputies look at the definition of convention in section 1 they will see it includes the 1987 EU agreement and explains the description of nationals.  It was rightly pointed out to me at that stage that very few countries are party to the 1987 convention, so it is appropriate for me to spell out clearly and explicitly what we mean by &ldquo;national&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Article 3.4 of the convention gives the contracting parties the possibility at the time of ratification to define &ldquo;national&rdquo;.  The Department of Foreign Affairs, which will be responsible for the process of ratification, can make a <Col N="369" /> declaration at that time to encompass the scenario of a person having close ties with this State, and if we put it into the Bill it will be even more explicit.  I have no difficulty with clarifying in the Bill that a national would be defined in the wider sense as somebody regarded as having close ties with the State.  For example, a member of a family who were not Irish citizens but had lived here for many years could request to be transferred to serve a sentence here because of their close family ties with the State, although they would not be nationals in the true sense.</P>
    <P>This is a good amendment which arose out of concerns expressed on Committee Stage that there would be no equivocation on the definition of a national.  I hope this amendment will receive the support of the House.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="370" /> In page 6, between lines 44 and 45, to insert the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(4) The Minister shall not consent to a request under subsection (1) of this section unless he or she has first obtained a certificate from the governor of the prison in which the sentenced person concerned will be detained certifying that the reception of that person into the prison will not necessitate the release of any prisoner detained within the prison prior to the expiry of his or her sentence.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment, which I unsuccessfully moved on Committee Stage, is an attempt to bring some reality, in terms of numbers into the debate on this humanitarian legislation.  The Progressive Democrats support this legislation but it would be an exercise in self delusion on the part of this Government and the House if we were not to address, at this crucial point before this Bill is sent to the Seanad, the fact that we have a chronic shortage of prison spaces.  My amendment proposes to oblige the Minister before she consents to the transfer of a person sentenced in another State to complete his sentence here, as is provided for under the convention and the Bill, to ascertain from the governor of the relevant prison that there is space for that person.</P>
    <P>Refusing to include a recognition in this Bill that our prison system is in chaos is an exercise in ministerial self delusion.  My amendment seeks to put into the Bill a requirement for some contact or administrative questioning at that critical time to inform the Minister's decision before she consents to the transfer of an offender sentenced for crimes committed in the UK, Germany or wherever.  Before consenting to the return of a prisoner on humanitarian grounds, as is provided for under the legislation and the convention, she should first see if there is a place in this State where such a person can be put without requiring the release of a person convicted for crimes committed in this State who deserves to be kept in <Col N="371" /> prison until he has completed his sentence.</P>
    <P>The Minister indicated that the implications of my amendment are impracticable which I reject.  How can it be impracticable, in administrative terms, to ask the governor of Mountjoy or another institution if they have space in their prisons for a returned offender without requiring the release of a person who has done evil in this State?  The Irish people expect such a person to be kept in jail rather than being released to make space for a prisoner returned from overseas.  It cannot be fair, prudent or just for the Minister to decide to accept the return of a prisoner from abroad without addressing that critical factor.</P>
    <P>My amendment was drafted and tabled before this Government decided to reverse the policy of providing an extra 210 prison spaces.  My amendment was relevant then and it is even more relevant now because, with the recent Government decision to scrap the extra 210 prison spaces, we are in an even worse position when it comes to applying this Bill.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, my party supports this legislation as an integral part of the peace process.  The reservations I am expressing here today have no impact whatsoever on the possible return of paramilitary prisoners from Britain because we have space for them.  There has not been enough discussion of the figures.  We are making provisions which allow the Minister wide powers and we have not realistically addressed our prison accommodation problems.</P>
    <P>I understand there are 58 subversives out of a total of 162 prisoners in Portlaoise, which has capacity for over 200 prisoners.  There are 58 prisoners in Portlaoise in the category scheduled for phased release under the peace process, which I hope will continue.  I wish the Minister well on that as the issue of prisoners is an essential part of progressing towards reconciliation.  There are 35 prisoners in Britain who I hope will apply to return to Ireland to complete <Col N="372" /> their sentences and I believe the Minister is well disposed, in terms of the peace process, to that.  It is an essential part of the peace process and there is space in Portlaoise for that category of offender.</P>
    <P>However, I am not referring to that category of offender but prisoners in Mountjoy which is unbelievably crammed.  The visiting committee in Mountjoy referred to it as a volcano waiting to erupt.  In terms of rehabilitation and any humanitarian, decent treatment of our prison population, we are in a chronic situation.  It is irresponsible of the Minister to allow this legislation to go through this House without including it in some recognition of our chronic overcrowding and shortage of prison spaces.  The prison system manages to lurch from crisis to crisis on a daily basis by the temporary release of convicted offenders who reoffend in the community.</P>
    <P>When I put this issue to a vote on Committee Stage, I was the only person who supported including a provision to oblige the Minister to address the problems in regard to prison spaces.  She has failed to do that.  She said it would be impracticable for her to ask the Governor of Mountjoy if he has space for a returned prisoner without releasing an Irish offender onto the streets of Dublin. I do not see anything impracticable about that.  I would regard it as a normal administrative function in the proper management of the prison system.  The Minister is in flight from reality in enacting this legislation without first addressing that critical issue.</P>
    <P>On Second Stage the Minister of State mentioned that it may be necessary for the Government to insert a reservation during th eratification process stating the availability of space will be one of the criteria to be applied.  As in the case of other provisions, even if the convention allows for discretion, such a reservation should be inserted in a statute.</P>
    <P>It is essential in terms of the proper management of the criminal justice system that we include the safeguard that <Col N="373" /> a prisoner will not be released into the community to re-offend in order to house a prisoner who wishes to return here from Germany or Britain for humanitarian reasons.  The people should be asked if they think it is right, fair and just that a person convicted here of burglary or rape should be released early so that a prisoner convicted of similar misdeeds in Britain can return.  The Minister obviously thinks so and that it would be impractical to ask the governor of Mountjoy Prison to certify that space is available.  It would be folly if she were to allow this legislation to go through without first coming clean to the House and the people and addressing the issue of lack of space.  It is a matter of regret that the Minister has refused to accept a reasonable amendment.</P>
    <P>Prisoners are being released early from Mountjoy Prison to make way for those convicted by the courts and those held on remand.  This is the main reason people constantly re-offend.  The people are sick to death of persistent offenders being released early because of overcrowding. Under this Bill the Minister will be allowed to agree to the return of up to 400 prisoners from foreign jails. Because of emigration patterns during the past 50 years many people who would be considered to be Irish nationals will be entitled to return here at the Minister's discretion.</P>
    <P>The Bill has been improved both on Committee and Report Stages by restricting the discretion allowed for.  It is wrong in principle for the Minister not to accept that we are in a position to agree to the return of paramilitary prisoners also.  It is necessary to do this in the context of the peace process.  The British Government will not accede to each request but that is a matter for negotiation between the two Executives. If ordinary offenders &mdash; thieves, burglars, rapists and child abusers &mdash; in prison in Britain and Germany are allowed to return at a time when insufficient space is available for persistent offenders this Bill will be a recipe for disaster.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>This legislation is a crucial leg of the peace process and it is vitally important that no barriers be placed in its way.  With all due respect to Deputy O'Donnell, the amendment would be precisely that as the governor of a prison would have to certify that space was available.  Aside from the fact that the prison population is always in a state of flux, inevitably those who seek to return will be Irish citizens or, in accordance with the amendment agreed to earlier, considered to be Irish nationals because of close family ties.</P>
      <P>I mentioned last night that if 210 places were required two weeks ago they are still required today.  There is a chronic shortage of prison spaces and, without wishing to rake over old ground, it was the Minister for Finance who pulled the plug.  There is deep concern in the community about this.  This legislation does not, however, envisage the release of criminals on to the street in order to make places available for transferees into the State.</P>
      <P>For the most part prisoners in Irish jails are Irish citizens.  Deputy O'Donnell appears to be making a distinction between an Irish citizen incarcerated in a foreign jurisdiction and an Irish citizen incarcerated here solely on the basis that the individual incarcerated here committed the offence here.  What she is really saying is that we have first and second class Irish citizens, that the second class Irish citizen should remain incarcerated in a foreign jurisdiction until such time that the governor of a prison certifies that space is available while the first class Irish citizen will be incarcerated here because that is where he or she committed the offence.  With all due respect, one cannot distinguish between Irish citizens, who have the same constitutional rights, and it would not be right to do so.  The purpose of the legislation is to introduce some semblance of humanitarianism to meet the needs of Irish citizens in prison abroad. This amendment does not serve that purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish Commission for Prisoners Overseas estimated that there would be <Col N="375" /> about 40 applicants in the first year of operation of the legislation, and that figure is realistic.  However, that is not to say that all 40 prisoners will be accepted because the Minister has retained discretion in that respect, and in any event it will require the consent not only of this State but of the sentencing state and of the prisoner involved.  The Irish Commission for Prisoners Overseas estimates that after the first year the number of applicants for transfer to this State will not exceed ten.  That appears to be a realistic figure because the commission has carried out considerable research in this regard.</P>
    <P>If the number of applicants for transfer to this State is balanced against the number of prisoners who will apply for transfer from the State, it is conceivable that the number of places that will be required in Irish prisons may be less than the figure I mentioned.  Nonetheless it is undeniably true, and I strongly agree with Deputy O'Donnell, that there is need to provide additional prison places.  Failure to do so would be extremely serious, and I outlined the reasons to the House last night.</P>
    <P>It is a matter for the Government to provide prison places.  A lack of sufficient prison places will not be an excuse for not passsing this legislation or for passing the amendment proposed by Deputy O'Donnell.  The legislation must be passed on humanitarian grounds and in the interests of the peace process.  It must go through the House without barriers, or at least with a minimum number of barriers, and failure to ensure that could have serious consequences. We must face reality.  A promise was made that the legislation would go through the House, and that promise must be fulfilled.  Deputy O'Donnell's amendment is a barrier to the legislation.  It would be unworkable and undersirable and would effectively create a two-tier system of citizenry, which is wholly undesirable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>The debate on this legislation, on Second, Committee and <Col N="376" /> Report Stages, has been marked by unanimity that it is good legislation and it is well past the time when it should have been implemented &mdash; Ireland signed the convention in 1986.  I am amazed and disappointed with the divisive way Deputy O'Donnell spoke on this amendment.  She used very intemperate language.  I thought the Progressive Democrats Party was in favour of this Bill and was concerned about prisoners overseas.  However, having listened to Deputy O'Donnell, I do not think that support is forthcoming.</P>
      <P>The Deputy is trying to put in the way of the implementation of this Bill every hurdle that will ensure not one single person will be able to transfer here. That is implied not only in the amendment but in her comments, which are scaremongering and divisive.  Perhaps she is looking for a headline in making statements such as &ldquo;the Minister will release rapists and murderers in order to bring people back from other countries&rdquo;. Why does she think I have retained the power that is implicit in the convention relating to the consent clause?  I have done so because I am concerned about our prison population and the impact of legislation such as this on that population.  It is necessary for a Minister &mdash; I am sure the same argument will be made by Ministers in other countries &mdash; to have discretion to examine the implications of agreeing to the transfer of a prisoner.</P>
      <P>This convention was founded not because of the peace process but because a number of countries in the Council of Europe wanted a mechanism whereby humanitarian legislation could be implemented.  Countries believed that people serving sentences in their prisons would more appropriately serve them, for the sake of their families, in their own countries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Donnell will have an opportunity to reply in a moment.  She should guard against intemperate remarks in making the valid point that I must have discretion in considering whether there is space for a prisoner without releasing some of the offenders she mentioned.  I have no intention of releasing rapists or murders in order to allow a prisoner to come back from another country.  As the Deputy rightly pointed out there will be a possibility of allowing a certain number of transfers because, for example, to date 20 paramilitary prisoners have been released from Portlaoise.  There are still 58 prisoners in that category in Portlaoise.  The Deputy's suggestion that all those prisoners will expect to be released in the event of the peace process continuing is not correct.  The Government's decision on the release of prisoners will be taken carefully and considered on the merits of each case. There will not be a global package and the Deputy was wrong in generalising the matter.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Donnell is probably aware that there are other prisoners in Portlaoise. There are 28 prisoners who are considered serious, heavy criminals, nine special category prisoners, including people who are serving 40 year sentences, and in D Block there are 67 prisoners on half remission &mdash; they are referred to as ordinary prisoners as opposed to paramilitaries.  The Deputy said that Portlaoise prison can cater for more than 200 prisoners.  It was certainly built with that intention, but as a result of the 25 years of violence in the North it never reached that capacity because special arrangements had to be made in the prison.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will happily arrange for Deputy O'Donnell to visit any prison and see how the prisons system works and how impractical it would be for me to obtain a certificate a month in advance of agreeing to a transfer.  One of the criterion to be considered in making a <Col N="378" /> decison on a transfer and the timing of such a transfer is that I will have to be satisfied there is a place for the prisoner. I am sure Deputy O'Donnell is aware of that but she is using the amendment to have a general go at the legislation in a way that exposes the reality that she and her party would prefer if it was passed. It is impractical for me, when I am getting information from a country from which a person might be wanting to come back to say, ahead of time, or for the governor to say: &ldquo;On such and such a date we will not have a place&rdquo; or &ldquo;we will have a place.&rdquo;  It would tie the hands of a Minister and force that Minister to refuse every single applicant.  I do not believe that is what people in this House want to happen if this Bill is implemented, as I hope it will be.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donnell, in the intemperate way that she was using language here today, referred to the Government's decision to &ldquo;scrap&rdquo; prison places. I have made it quite clear, and the Government have made it quite clear, they are deferred.  The need for prison places has existed for some considerable time, long before we came to deal with this legislation.  If the decision by the last Government to build Castlerea had been taken when the Fianna Fáil Party came into Government and when the Progressive Democrats were in Government too, those places would now be available but the decision was taken only last year, after six years of continuous Fianna Fáil Government.  Those places would not be available, even if the decision was not taken by the Government two weeks ago, for two years.</P>
    <P>I want to implement this legislation now as soon as it passes all stages in this House and I want to be able to consider applications now before those places are available.  The peace process is an important element in the implementation of this legislation but it is not the only element.  Deputy O'Donnell implies that there will be no spaces available chiefly because our prisons are overcrowded.  Yes, they are overcrowded. I do not deny that but they <Col N="379" /> were overcrowded when I came into this Department and they will, I hope, be less overcrowded when I leave this Department at the end of two and a half years when this Government, of necessity, has to go to the people again.  As of 15 March 1995 there are 184 people who are not Irish in our prisons.  There is one from Australia.  I am quite sure an Australian serving a sentence here would very much like the opportunity to return to Australia to finish his sentence.</P>

It stands to reason that some, it not all, of those, at some stage over the next few years, will seek to have their sentences finished out in their own countries and if they fulfil the conditions will thereby give us some latitude.</P>
      <P>May I finish by saying to Deputy O'Donnell that I am concerned about the impact of transfers back here on our prison places.  She, in some kind of knowing way &mdash; she has no evidence at all &mdash; says I will immediately release rapists and murderers.  That is just scaremongering language.  I know it will catch a headline for Deputy O'Donnell but it is not a responsible way to deal with this legislation.  I will not be dealing with this legislation in the way that Deputy O'Donnell is trying to imply.  It is precisely because I am concerned about our prison population and the need for careful consideration of every application that I am maintaining what this convention wants me to maintain.

The fact that the Minister has got herself into a tailspin and accuses me of scaremongering and intemperate language shows that I have hit a sore point.  This piece of legislation is going through the House and had I not put down this amendment to address our chronic shortage of prison spaces and to address the dilemma and the choices that would have to be made by the Minister in the proper management of our prison system we would not have got the figures that the Minister has just given us.  We would not have heard that there are 184 foreign nationals in jails here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has said that it would be impracticable for the governor of Mountjoy to assess his prison population and to say: &ldquo;For me to take this prisoner in from Britain I would have to release another person&rdquo;. The fact that the Minister says that that is impossible as an administrative process indicates to me that the Minister is accepting the chaotic crisis management that is going on in the prison system at the moment.  She is saying that everything is in a state of flux, we do not know who is released from one day to the next, the whole thing is a revolving situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What sort of people are released early?  What sort of people are given temporary release?  We do not know that because all of this information is not given to the Dáil.  There is no register that I can go to and see how many people were released this week to allow for other people to come into the prison system.  The Minister is saying we cannot do that because the prison situation is in a constant state of flux and it would be impractical for the governor of Mountjoy to be asked whether the acceptance of an Irish national to this <Col N="382" /> State necessitates the release of a person serving a sentence here.  She is saying that is not possible, which is an indication that the Minister is not in control of the jails.  She does not have sufficient information at her disposal in her Department to enable her to make a management decision, an accommodation decision, in consultation with the governor of Mountjoy, in relation to the temporary release of prisoners.</P>
    <P>I believe I have raised an issue which hurts the Minister.  She accuses me of scaremongering because I have raised this issue but the Minister cannot put her hand on her heart today and say there is space for people who are to be returned from Britain to finish their jail sentences here under the terms of this Bill.  The reality is we do not have space. The prison officers have said Mountjoy is overcrowded.  The prison officers working in all the other jails have indicated, similarly, that they are sick to death of trying to cope with the chronic shortage of prison spaces.  The Minister has no response to this point today because she cannot say there is space.  If this Bill goes through the House and in six months time ten, 14 or 41 people apply under the provisions of this Bill to come back to this State to finish their sentences, she cannot say there will be space for them.  She will not accept that she should put in a reservation&mdash;</P>

Surely that is one of the most important criteria.  I accept and have said that we support this Bill from the point of view of the peace process as it is an essential part of it.  Space is available to accommodate transferred paramilitary prisoners, not all of them will be transferred as that would not be acceptable to the British Government, but space is available to accommodate those who return to complete the remainder of their sentences here.

It is essential that it be introduced now as <Col N="385" /> part of the peace process but the Minister has failed to address the chronic shortage of prison spaces here.

It might be insulting for a Minister of State to agree with an Opposition Deputy, but from his stance on law and order and on the criminal justice system when in Opposition representing the Fine Gael Party I am sure he would agree with me on this point.  I consider that the Minister has taken a flight from reality if she refuses to acknowledge the difficulties regarding prison places if this Bill is <Col N="386" /> passed without inserting safeguards to guard against the possibility that prisoners will be released from Mountjoy to enable Irish nationals sentenced in foreign countries to transfer to Irish prisons to serve the remainder of their sentences.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 21:</P>
      <P>In page 8, line 4, after &ldquo;duration&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;, with due regard to any remission of sentence accrued in the sentencing state,&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I tabled the amendment to address the point covered by Deputy O'Donoghue's amendment on Committee Stage to section 5.  I note it is covered in amendment No. 23.  Section 5 (4) provides that a High Court warrant authorising the continued enforcement here of a sentence imposed by a foreign court will have the same force and effect as an ordinary committal warrant.  It follows that when a sentenced person is transferred into the State, the person will be subject to the same rules governing remission, temporary release, administration of sentence in terms of the balance of the sentence to be served here <Col N="387" /> as generally apply to other persons sentenced here.</P>
    <P>As part of the continued enforcement, paragraph 49 of the explanatory memorandum states that the convention envisages that the duration of the sentence to be served in the receiving or administering State must correspond to the amount of the original sentence taking into account the time served and any remission earned in the sentencing State up to the date of transfer.  The convention, and likewise the Bill in section 5 (6) (a), goes on to state that a person can never be any less well off from the point of view of time left to serve.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Currie, undertook on Committee Stage to examine whether it would be preferable to make Deputy O'Donoghue's point more explicit in the Bill.  The amendment to section 5 (4), which I tabled, seems to make it explicit in the Bill that the High Court in issuing a warrant for continued enforcement must have due regard to any remission accrued in the sentencing State.  In other words, if a person has earned one-third remission in respect of the portion of his or her sentence served abroad, he or she will be credited with it and that will be reflected in the amount of sentence he or she will be required to serve when transferred here.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donoghue's amendment No. 23 could have the effect that where a prisoner had earned remission at a higher rate than he or she would be able to earn here, say at a rate of one-third as opposed to one-quarter, that would be reduced retrospectively to one-quarter on transfer here in respect of the part of his or her sentence served abroad.  I am sure that is not what he wants.  He wants to ensure that a prisoner would not suffer as a result of a transfer here, but it could be argued that if he or she had a higher rate of remission in another country on, say, a ten year sentence, that when transferred here that higher rate would be reduced to the one applicable for the whole sentence. That could have been inferred by <Col N="388" /> the wording of Deputy O'Donoghue's amendment.  The amendment I tabled will address Deputy O'Donoghue's point, that due regard to any remission of sentence accrued in the sentencing State will be taken into account here.  I commend amendment No. 21.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister's amendment, it tackles the point I was trying to make.

      <P>I move amendment No. 22:</P>
      <P>In page 8, to delete lines 7 to 12 and substitute the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(5) On an application under subsection (1) of this section, or on the application of the sentenced person concerned within one month of being brought into the State from a place outside the State, if the sentence concerned imposed by the sentencing state concerned is by its legal nature or duration incompatible with the law of the State, the court may adapt the sentence to a sentence prescribed by the law of the State for an offence similar to the offence for which the sentence was imposed.  A sentence shall be regarded as incompatible in its legal nature with the law of the State if it imposes a form of deprivation of liberty which in its legal or physical attributes is not known in the State.  A sentence shall be regarded as incompatible in its duration with the law of the State if it exceeds the maximum penalty prescribed by the law of the State for a similar offence, or if the criteria for calculation of the duration of the sentence are incompatible with the law of the State. <Col N="389" /> Before adapting the sentence, the court shall give the sentenced person concerned an opportunity to make representation with respect to sentence.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>A number of questions arise regarding the transfer of persons into the State. The convention appears to envisage that the rules governing remission and so on should be those that operate in the State to which the prisoner is transferred, in other words, the administering State. This matter should be clearly outlined in so far as prisoners transferred into this State are concerned.  A sentence of incompatible duration can be made to correspond with practice in the other State if forms of detention of a similar nature are applicable in both States.  I commend the amendment to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a complex amendment and relates to one of the most complex parts of the convention.  Essentially, Deputy O'Donoghue is trying to combine the two ways in which the convention can be implemented regarding continued enforcement of a sentence. Under Article 9 the convention gives the administering State the option of continued enforcement of the sentence immediately or conversion to the sentence applicable in the receiving country, as if the crime were committed there.  In this legislation we opted for the continued enforcement method. Deputy O'Donoghue's amendment would include a little of both methods and, therefore, is not practical.  It would cause too many difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Continued enforcement essentially means that where a prisoner is transferred the original sentence continues to be enforced.  For example, where a prisoner had served five years of a ten year sentence before transfer he or she would serve the balance of the five years after being transferred.  There are limited exceptions under the continued enforcement procedure and they would arise where the nature or duration of a sentence is incompatible with the law of the state to which the prisoner is being <Col N="390" /> transferred.  For example, a prisoner may be serving a sentence of penal servitude but that may not be a penalty under the law of the administering state. The convention provides that in such cases, under the continued enforcement procedure, the administering state would adapt the sentence to a sanction provided by its law for a similar offence. In the example I mentioned the likelihood is that a penalty of imprisonment or detention for the same duration would be substituted for the penal servitude penalty.  The convention provides that where continued enforcement is used the substituted penalty should not aggravate the sanction imposed in the sentencing state nor exceed the maximum prescribed by the law of the administering state.</P>
    <P>Under the conversion procedure &mdash; the other option under Article 9 &mdash; a state substitutes a penalty of its own rather than continuing to enforce the existing penalty.  Various rules govern this, including a provision that under this procedure the penalty cannot be aggravated.  In practice, this procedure will mean that the competent authority in the administering state will regard the facts behind the conviction as having been proved and then impose a penalty as if the person were convicted in the courts of that state.  Continued enforcement rather than the conversion procedure is the approach adopted in the Bill.  Under section 5 the court will issue a warrant for continued enforcement but may adapt the sentence where, by its legal nature and duration, it would be incompatible with our law.</P>
    <P>The advantage of this procedure over a conversion procedure is that it carries greater certainty and in the majority of cases will be simple to apply.  This will be the case particularly in regard to the transfer of prisoners from the United Kingdom because of our similar legal systems.  The conversion procedure is much more complex and could involve a new sentencing hearing.  It might be necessary to set up a new court procedure to convert a sentence imposed in another country.  In the explanatory <Col N="391" /> report accompanying the Council of Europe Convention it is recognised that the conversion procedure may take some time and, accordingly, the convention provides for a procedure for keeping the person in custody in the administering state pending the outcome of that procedure.  It is difficult to envisage any advantage with the conversion procedure that would outweigh the difficulties to which it could give rise.</P>
    <P>The changes proposed in this amendment have two purposes, the first being to qualify the concept referred to in section 5 (5) of a sentence which is &ldquo;by its legal nature and duration incompatible with the law of the State&rdquo;.  That phrase is taken exactly from the wording of Article 10 of the convention.  The amendment suggests that this should be qualified by stating that &ldquo;a sentence shall be regarded as incompatible in its legal nature with the law of the State if it imposes a form of deprivation of liberty which in its legal or physical attributes is not known in the State&rdquo;.  While I appreciate the desirability to avoid doubt I am not sure this form of wording would achieve that.  Moreover, given the complexities involved arising from the differences between various legal systems, the best approach would be to leave the wording of the convention enshrined in the Bill without further qualification and leave it up to the courts to apply this as appropriate in the individual cases that come before them. In other words, the words of the convention should be transferred directly to the Bill to allow the courts deal with each case as appropriate.</P>
    <P>The basic purpose of the remainder of the amendment appears to propose to allow the courts in certain circumstances to operate a conversion procedure rather than an enforcement one. That is similar to having one's cake and eating it, in other words, using both systems. The success of the actual wording in achieving this &mdash; particularly with its reference to &ldquo;criteria for calculation of the duration of the sentence&rdquo;&mdash; is <Col N="392" /> unclear.  For the reasons I outlined earlier I regard the continued enforcement procedure as more appropriate in this case.</P>
    <P>The amendment also states that before adapting a sentence the court shall give the sentenced persons concerned an opportunity to make representation with respect to sentence.  If we were adopting the conversion procedure, I would see merit in that and I believe it is in that context it was suggested. It should not, however, arise in using the continued enforcement procedure.</P>
    <P>This is a complex part of the legislation. The continued enforcement procedure will have the advantage of providing greater certainty and will lead to a simplified procedure for the transfer of prisoners to this State.  I do not regard it as an injustice to individual prisoners whose sentences were imposed in accordance with the laws of the state in which the offences were committed and it should have the advantage of expediting transfers under the convention without a risk of injustice to the applicants or the need for costly and protracted court proceedings.</P>
    <P>Will Deputy O'Donoghue take into account that the procedures I use are the simplified ones which are more appropriate in our legislation?  For that reason, I ask him to withdraw his amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not suggest that a conversion procedure be used rather than continued enforcement.  The purpose of the amendment is to set out in clear detail the definition of &ldquo;incompatibility with Irish law&rdquo;.  In that context, the amendment, in defining &ldquo;incompatibility&rdquo;, allows Irish principles of appropriate sentencing to be applied, in addition to Irish maximum sentences, and also gives the prisoner the right to raise the question of the compatibility of the original sentence with Irish law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In section 5 (5) there is already an element of conversion.  It provides that <Col N="393" /> the courts may adapt the sentence to a sentence prescribed by the law of the state for an offence similar to the offence for which the sentence was imposed.  That also refers to incompatibility. One could say, therefore, that where there is adaptation, there must be an element of conversion.  One of the objectives of the amendment is to clearly define &ldquo;incompatibility&rdquo;, the other being that the prisoner should have the right to raise the question of the compatibility of the sentence with Irish law.  If that were to be accepted, the applicant would have to be allowed legal representation.  However, I do not intend to press the amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 24:</P>
      <P>In page 8, between lines 29 and 30, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(10)  A person transferred into the State shall be free at all times to utilise any procedure available to reopen his/her case and/or challenge his/her conviction in the courts of the sentencing state.</P>
      <P>(11)  Any document submitted to the court on an application pursuant to this section shall be admissible&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  in so far as it consists of a statement of fact, as evidence of the fact, and</P>
      <P>(b)  in so far as it consists of a statement of opinion, as evidence of that opinion.</P>
      <P>(12)  Any document submitted for the purposes of an application under this section which&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  purports to be a translation of a document, and</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b)  is certified as a correct and true translation by a person competent to do so shall be admissible as evidence of that translation and <Col N="394" /> shall be accompanied by an original or an authenticated copy of the document of which it is a translation.</P>
    <P>(13)  The sentenced person concerned may appeal a sentence imposed under subsection (5) of this section, or a refusal by the High Court to adapt the sentence imposed by the sentencing state to the Court of Criminal Appeal under the following conditions&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  if the appellant obtains a certificate from the judge who imposed sentence that the case is a fit case for appeal; or</P>
    <P>(b)  in case of refusal of such certificate if the Court of Criminal Appeal on appeal from such refusal grants leave to appeal.</P>
    <P>(14)  Leave to appeal shall be granted by the Court of Criminal Appeal in cases where the court is of the opinion that a question of law is involved, or where the sentencing hearing appears to that court to have been unsatisfactory, or there appears to that court to be any other sufficient ground of appeal.</P>
    <P>(15)  Section 33 of the Courts of Justice Act, 1924 shall apply to the hearing of an appeal under this section.</P>
    <P>(16)  Subject to the same requirements as are imposed upon the High Court by subsection (6) of this section, the Court of Criminal Appeal shall have power on such an appeal to remit, or to reduce, or to increase or otherwise vary the sentence, or to dismiss the appeal, and generally to make such order as may be necessary, within the terms of this Act, for the purpose of doing justice in the case.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The first paragraph of the amendment is for the purposes of clarity.  The paragraph relating to documentation will facilitate processing evidence from other convention states.  The amendment also allows for an appeal to the <Col N="395" /> Court of Criminal Appeal against a High Court sentence or a refusal by the High Court to adapt the sentence imposed by the sentencing state.  These are procedural matters and I do not intend going into them in detail.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Under Article 13 of the convention, the sentencing state alone has the right to make decisions on an application for review of a sentence or an appeal of a conviction.  The exclusive competence of the sentencing state is justified by the fact that the crime was committed in that state and it would have full knowledge of and access to all the relevant evidence and information and would be in a position to examine it.  There is not anything in our law which would prevent a person transferred here pursuing whatever legal avenues of redress may be available in the state where he or she was sentenced. The inclusion of this amendment however, would enshrine in our laws measures relating to the laws of other states.  We do not have any jurisdiction to do that and the inclusion of the new subsection (10) as proposed in the amendment would not be of any benefit to the prisoner.  The convention clearly states that if a person is transferred here who has been sentenced in another state, any appeal he might wish to make must be made in the country in which he was sentenced.  It cannot be made here.  It would not be in keeping with the convention if we were to allow prisoners transferred here to have their cases retried in this State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The remainder of the subsections would only arise if the conversion procedure were to be used.  As we have not proceeded with that, the remainder of the amendment is not relevant.  The new subsections (11) and (12), which deal with technical matters relating to the admissibility of documents, would only be relevant if the conversion procedure was being used rather than continued enforcement.  These portions of the amendment flow from the proposed section 5 (10) and, as I am not accepting <Col N="396" /> that subsection, the remaining portions are not relevant.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept there is a procedure for any appeal that may arise in the context of the sentencing state but if a person imprisoned in one of the signatory countries when this legislation is enacted transfers here and wishes to appeal his sentence in the sentencing state, there is not any stipulation in the Bill as to how matters such as length of sentence, travel costs, etc. will be dealt with.  The presumption is that because the appeal would be heard in the sentencing state, any costs would be incurred by that state but complexities can arise and a country might possibly renege on its obligations if they are not clearly specified.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 28:</P>
      <P>In page 9, to delete lines 19 to 22, and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;8.&mdash; The Minister shall, as soon as may be after the 1st day of January in each year beginning with the year 1996, make a report to each House of the Oireachtas on the operation in the preceding year of this Act.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment merely provides that the Minister would report to each House of the Oireachtas on the operation of this Act in the preceding year. It is advisable that the House be advised on how it is progressing, to be informed of how many prisoners' applications have been accepted and how many applications for transference out of the State have been accepted.  The Extradition (Amendment) Act, 1987 also provides that a report be made to each House of the Oireachtas concerning its <Col N="398" /> operation.  Such desirable reportage would also give the Houses an opportunity of discussing the operation of this innovative Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>When first presented to the House there was an obvious omission from the Bill, there having been no obligation on the Minister to report to the Houses of the Oireachtas on the exercise of this discretionary power.  In the course of the debate the Minister more or less accepted, by agreeing to amendments tabled by Deputy O'Donoghue and me, that the criteria invoked by her in the exercise of her discretion should be clearly made known.  As has been pointed out, in terms of administrative law, whenever a discretionary power is exercised, there is always a danger it can be abused. Therefore, such discretionary power should be seen to be as transparent as possible within the practicalities of our justice system.</P>
      <P>I was concerned about the absence of any mechanism which we could use to scrutinise how the provisions of the Bill were progressing and how its implications were being felt.  While I had concerns about the problem of prison places I was concerned also about the general implementation of the provisions of the Bill, believing it to be important that the Oireachtas keeps a careful eye on the exercise of this power.</P>
      <P>There is a great deal of politics incorporated in this Bill.  It does not incorporate a right to transfer but rather a right to apply to the Minister for such transference. In the application of that discretionary power we must be very careful that people's rights are properly protected and that the proper use of administrative powers is seen to be preserved. This specification of providing an annual report to both Houses of the Oireachtas would be one method by which transparency and accountability could be seen to be practised in regard to this power of the Minister for Justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have already observed that the petition system has been faulted by our <Col N="399" /> courts on account of this lack of transparency. It is because there is no provision for reporting to the Houses on the petition system, a similar Executive power given by statute, it is crucial, within the overall range of ministerial powers, that Ministers be accountable to this House in the exercise of such power.</P>
    <P>I thought the Minister had indicated on Committee Stage that she would table an amendment providing for the presentation of an annual report to the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I had expected that the Minister would have tabled her amendment with these amendments, thereby indicating that she had accepted the principle of transparency.  My amendment seeks somewhat more information than did the Minister's on Committee Stage.  Her amendment had the capacity of being an air brush report whereas I had sought details of the convention state from which a prisoner was transferred, along with the nature of the offence giving rise to the sentence imposed, its duration and a report on whether that prisoner had been released since his or her return.</P>
      <P>I am glad the Minister has accepted Opposition amendments providing for accountability to the Houses.  That was not contained in the original Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 5, between lines 5 and 6, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;6.&mdash;The Act of 1908 is hereby amended by the substitution of the following section for section 3:</P>
      <P>`3.&mdash;In this Act&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) the expressions &ldquo;brother&rdquo; and &ldquo;sister&rdquo;, respectively, include half-brother and half-sister, and</P>
      <P>(b) the expressions &ldquo;father&rdquo;, &ldquo;mother&rdquo;, &ldquo;daughter&rdquo; and &ldquo;son&rdquo;, respectively, include step-father, step-mother, step-daughter and step-son.'.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I tabled these related amendments on Committee Stage to close a loophole revealed in the Punishment of Incest Act, 1908 which did not provide protection for adopted or step-children.  As the law stands adopted children and step-children violated by their adoptive father or stepfather are not treated as being the victims of incest; they are treated as having been violated or sexually assaulted, as the case may be, by a stranger.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The enormity of this omission from our laws means that a father who abuses or has sexual intercourse with, say, his 17-year old adopted daughter is not <Col N="401" /> deemed to have committed a criminal offence unless he rapes her.  In other words, if consent has been procured by a cycle of abuse over many years by persuasion, or by the usual awful indicators of sexual abuse &mdash; the abuse of a powerful, dominant parental relationship over that of the loving relationship of a child to its parent &mdash; there is need for the law to deal with it.</P>
    <P>The Status of Children Act, 1987 clarified the legal position of adopted children, rendering them similar in all respects to natural children.  Section 3 (1) states:</P>
    <P>In deducting any relationship for the purposes of this Act or of any Act of the Oireachtas passed after the commencement of this section, the relationship between every person and his father and mother (or either of them) shall, unless the contrary intention appears, be determined irrespective of whether his father and mother are or have been married to each other, and all other relationships shall be determined accordingly.</P>
    <P>Section 3 (2) (a) and (b) states:</P>
    <P>(2) (a) An adopted person shall, for the purposes of subsection (1) of this section, be deemed from the date of the adoption to be the child of the adopter or adopters and not the child of any other person or persons.</P>
    <P>(b) In this subsection &ldquo;adopted person&rdquo; means a person who has been adopted under the Adoption Acts, 1952 to 1976, or, where the person has been adopted outside the State, whose adoption is recognised by virtue of the law for the time being in force in the State.</P>
    <P>In other words, the provisions of section 3 of the Status of Children Act, 1987 does not apply retrospectively to the Punishment of Incest Act, 1908.  That matter which arose from a direction by a judge in incest cases should be dealt with by way of amendment to the Bill. It points to the need as originally provided in the Bill, for such proceedings <Col N="402" /> to be held in camera, the transcripts of which should not be released.  Therefore, an essential part of amendment to the Bill is that we deal with that procedural aspect of the reportage of incest trials.  As this has been drawn to the attention of the Government, it would be appropriate to amend the 1908 Act to include the relationship of stepfather, stepmother, stepdaughter and stepson. This is crucially important given that we are moving towards a successful divorce referendum because, following the introduction of divorce legislation, there will be thousands of children living in new family relationships based on second marriages, and the notion of stepchildren not being protected from an abusive or incestuous relationship really is too horrible to contemplate.</P>
    <P>Much of the law relating to incest is based on eugenics, the need to avoid pregnancies arising from relationships between people with close blood ties. This is the basis of the law and society's disapproval of incestuous relationships. Now, however, the whole matter of incest, particularly in the past 20 years, is firmly based on the need to avoid inappropriate and illegal relationships as between a parent and a child &mdash; we know from the available figures that a child is more likely to be violated sexually in his or her own home than anywhere else.  The incidence of incest is hidden.  Often it only becomes known when a child is born as a result.</P>
    <P>It is important and appropriate that we address this loophole in our incest legislation while the legislaton is being amended.  It would be folly to send it, as suggested on Committee Stage, to an indeterminate review committee whose remit is to ponder the area of sexual abuse generally.  There is a need to examine the crime of sexual abuse, but I think the Law Reform Commission got it wrong in one sense when their report indicated that there should be a crime of sexual abuse which would incorporate incest.  There will always be a special disapproval in society of an incestuous relationship.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="403" /> In regard to the problem my amendment was intended to deal with, the Minister stated on Committee Stage he had been advised that sexual relations between stepbrothers and stepsisters, and between an adopted child and his or her adoptive brother or sister, are technically not illegal.  Such activity is certainly undesirable, but if it is not illegal it would be difficult to apply the Punishment of Incest Act to it. However, most members of the public would agree, as did most Members of the Oireachtas who took part in the Committee Stage debate, that it would be important to protect and to include in the incest law that very important parental relationship between father and child, abuse of which is incest.  That is why I have changed my amendment to avoid any difficulty in regard to stepsisters etc.</P>
    <P>It is important that this Bill go on the Statue Book and I have no wish to delay it.  It is needed immediately to enable the proper reporting of incest cases to proceed unhindered.  However, I felt it was appropriate for me to raise this on Committee Stage.  The Minister has had only a few days to draft an amendment, to address the issues I raised and close this loophole to protect adopted children and stepchildren and I hope he has seen fit to make efforts in that regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully support the concept that adopted children and step-children should be protected.  The purpose of this Bill is to deal with the restrictions on the reporting of incest cases; it does not go to the substance of the crime of incest.  The Minister should take on board what Deputy O'Donnell said and try to amend the law in order to provide protection for adoptive children and stepchildren.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The criminal law of incest was based upon the existence of a blood relationship between the individuals concerned. That was the position in 1908 and it is still the position in 1995.  However, it must be recognised that an adoptive parent or a stepparent is in a fiduciary <Col N="404" /> relationship with the child, and that relationship can build a bond between them.  An adoptive parent or a step-parent who is a sexual deviant could easily build upon that bond, that trust and that fiduciary relationship to defile a step-child or an adoptive child.  There is clearly a very real need to extend the bounds of the criminal law on incest to cover step-children and adoptive children. It is desirable that it be done, if not in this legislation then in future legislation.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the difficulties which the Minister of State so clearly outlined on Committee Stage regarding the marriage of adoptive children or step-children to each other where there is no blood relationship, but there is a considerable difference between the fiduciary relationship which exists between an adoptive parent or a step-parent and that between adoptive children and step-children.  The parent is in a position of complete, absolute and utter trust. That trust must not be breached, and can never be allowed to be built upon by a sexual deviant to defile a step-child or an adopted child.  It is in that context that I support Deputy O'Donnell's amendment and ask the Minister of State to give sympathetic consideration to it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. Currie)</NameTxt>
      <P>The issue of protection of children from sexual abuse, particularly in their own home, is one with which I, as Minister with special responsibility for child care am very much concerned.  Accordingly, after these amendments were put forward on Committee Stage, I brought them to the attention of the Minister who agreed to re-examine them on the basis that if what was suggested was the best way forward in terms of child protection, the amendments should, as far as possible, be accepted.  However, on re-examination the Minister is satisfied that she cannot accept the amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the amendments is laudable, seeking adequate protection for young persons under 15 or 17 years <Col N="405" /> who may be pressurised or forced into sexual activity with persons in parental positions, including persons who are step-parents or adoptive parents.</P>

We had a very constructive exchange of views on issues of central importance to the peace process.  There has not yet been a formal response from the Alliance Party but I have had a lengthy meeting recently with the party leader, Dr. John Alderdice.</P>
      <P>The Ulster Unionist Party leader, Mr. James Molyneaux, recently informed me that, following consultation with his party colleagues, the Ulster Unionist Party feels unable to partake in bilateral talks with the Government for the time being.  Naturally I would have wished that talks with the Ulster Unionist Party could have got under way immediately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have not yet had a definitive reply from the Ulster Democratic Party and the Progressive Unionist Party.  The Democratic Unionist Party leader has <Col N="407" /> indicated publicly that he will not be responding to my invitation.</P>
    <P>The House can be assured, however, that I will continue to do everything possible to encourage the political representatives of the Unionist and loyalist tradition to meet with the Government. Within that context, I would be prepared to meet the new MP for North Down, Mr. Robert McCartney.</P>
    <P>The Government, together with the British Government, has been seeking, in a very proactive way, to move the peace process forward.  At a very useful meeting in Cannes, the British Prime Minister and I undertook a bilateral stock-taking on the peace process and all issues affecting it.  We focused mainly on two issues: how to advance our agreed objective of comprehensive political talks and how to make progress on the decommissioning of illegal weapons. We agreed that we want to see movement towards fully inclusive all-party talks and we believe the close co-operation between our two Governments is the key to achieving this.  We canvassed various ideas on decommissioning and have tasked our officials to consider these in more detail and report back to us in a matter of weeks.</P>
    <P>The two Governments are firmly committed to the peace process, to an agreed political settlement and to the comprehensive negotiations required to achieve this goal.  We knew from the beginning there would be difficulties. We have successfully overcome earlier difficulties and are confident we will continue to do so.</P>

      <P>I am disappointed with the response from the Unionist parties and I urge them to change their minds. They have a duty to respond to the wishes of the vast majority of the people in Northern Ireland who want to be involved in all-inclusive talks and see their leaders compromising and giving leadership.  Is the Taoiseach aware of the comments made this morning by the Secretary of State to the effect that talks <Col N="408" /> could go ahead without Sinn Féin?  Does he envisage that happening?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not a point of view with which I concur.  The objective should be all-inclusive talks in which each party would be able to participate on the basis of its electoral mandate. The SDLP has an electoral mandate, as have the Ulster Unionists and Sinn Féin.  There are difficulties with Sinn Féin participation, particularly from the point of view of the Unionist community, as long as the decommissioning of arms has not been dealt with in a substantial way.  As I have said repeatedly in the Chamber, the Unionist community is coping with the legacy of 25 years of violence.  That has engendered distrust and the fear that as long as there are large caches of offensive weapons these could be used again, as well as the view that discussions with people who speak with some authority for or have a link with, others who have control over these arms would not be taking place on the basis of an appropriate degree of parity of political position.  I have frequently expressed my comprehension of that point of view but I am anxious to find a basis upon which we can make substantial progress on the decommissioning of arms.  We must have all-inclusive talks involving all the parties on the basis of their electoral mandates if we are to have a settlement. Any formula which does not allow that to happen will not be sufficient to solve the problem.</P>

      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that the acknowledgment by the British Prime Minister, John Major, in Cannes of the reality that the political process must involve all the political parties potentially represents an important breakthrough and a sign that <Col N="409" /> perhaps for the first time the horse has been put before the cart and not the other way round?  Having read details of the interview between the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister and the documents, they appear to say they are resolved to secure a firm commitment from all the organisations concerned to engage in arms decommissioning when the peace process is further advanced &mdash;&mdash; it is not clear when the commitment will be given but until then the arms will remain in cold storage and will be inaccessible. On the other hand, they appear to say that the British Government must give a commitment to legislate for restoration of the 50 per cent remission as a first step to dealing with the issue of prisoners.  Is that a fair assessment? Does he agree that the British Government needs to commit itself to a review of emergency legislation and the judicial system and major reform of the system of policing?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The meeting the Tánaiste and I had with the Prime Minister and the Foreign Secretary, Mr. Douglas Hurd, was extremely good. There was a very strong level of engagement by the Prime Minister in all the issues.  He showed a tremendous grasp of the difficulties which must be overcome and a full understanding of the extent of them and the problems of others in overcoming them.  One did not get the feeling that he was simply putting forward his point of view without giving serious thought to the problems others face in this context.  In that sense it was a very good meeting.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, it would be unwise to read more into what was said. The ideas canvassed in the Deputy's supplementary questions, various publications and speculation in the media and elsewhere will no doubt be looked at in the intensive discussions which will take place between officials.  It is premature to say that this, that or the other will happen before the discussions are completed.</P>

      <P>Does the strategy the <Col N="410" /> Taoiseach is pursuing with the British Government involve the decommissioning of arms and the prisoners issue?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not particularly constructive to link the two issues as there are many issues involved.  During our discussions the Prime Minister and I touched on all these issues.  I would not pick out any two issues and say there are more links between them than any other issues.  We are seeking to move the process forward by looking at the range of issues.  The more issues on the table in negotiations the easier it is to find a solution.  If the discussion focuses solely on one issue it frequently becomes more difficult to find a solution &mdash; there is less room for movement. This is why I am particularly pleased that our discussion in Cannes focused on the broader issues.</P>
      <P>It is very important that the Irish and British Governments are seen to work together so that they not only have a certain degree of statutory authority but also have a great moral authority and can give leadership to the communities in Northern Ireland.  Political parties should not use this as a cover for not being forthcoming with ideas and concessions. There is a tendency for people to delegate to Governments, their problems, their thinking and the thinking of their communities.  Regardless of who they are, political representatives have a responsibility to think for themselves and they should not delegate this responsibility to Governments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that the Taoiseach does not wish to speculate but it appears from the documents he is trying to achieve a balance between a commitment by the IRA and loyalist paramilitaries to the decommissioning of arms and movement on the prisoners issue.  It is clear that Sir Patrick Mayhew does not share the view of the Taoiseach and the Prime Minister.  The Taoiseach probably cannot say this, but he either subscribes to the progress made yesterday or he disagrees with it, and <Col N="411" /> the comments he made this morning are unhelpful.  Am I correct in saying the discussion represented a further development of the talks by the Dalton-Chilcott group which have been ongoing for seven or eight months, that this is the level at which conclusions will be reached on the various elements and these will be discussed at a further meeting between the Taoiseach and the Prime Minister in September?  Is that the time scale to which they are working?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two elements to what Sir Partrick Mayhew said this morning.  The first element related to the talks and representations, and I have given my view on this.  On the points about decommissioning, this is simply a reiteration of positions which have been adopted by him and other spokespersons for the British Government on so many occasions that one could not count them.  It would be wrong to draw any conclusions from that statement.  The Prime Minister and I did not reach any agreement at our meeting yesterday on substantive questions of that nature.  Rather we agreed to a process for examining the issue more intensively with a view to finding a solution.  This is the best way to approach the issue rather than looking at bits of the issue and asking how one could move on these.  That sort of approach is not necessarily conducive to a solution.  We do not have a timetable but there will be a summit meeting in December and other meetings or contacts in the meantime are not precluded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree both Governments should adopt a similar approach as far as possible.  Much as I would like to know, I understand why the Taoiseach cannot spell out in detail the matters discussed at the meeting yesterday. Is he optimistic that the circumstances will be created this summer to allow the all-inclusive talks to begin?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not be drawn <Col N="412" /> into any expression of optimism on dates.  Any reference to dates, timetables or deadlines is not helpful and does not allow the participants the space they need to think through the consequences of a possible change of position on their part.  I will not refer to summer, autumn or any other season of the year in so far as this matter is concerned. I was very struck by the intensity of the engagement of the Prime Minister's attention on this issue and the extent to which he is interested not just in the general question and the need to solve it but his mastery of the detail and his day to day attention to this issue. There was a very serious level of intellectual engagement on this issue on both sides of the table and this was very welcome.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree it is important at this stage to have clarification on where we are going? Am I correct in saying the objective of the Government &mdash; I think it is the policy of all parties in the Dáil &mdash; is to move as quickly as possible towards all-party talks which include Sinn Féin, the Unionist parties and all parties with an electoral mandate?  Other issues such as the RUC, the decommissioning of arms and the early release of prisoners also need to be addressed but the fundamental issue is inclusive all-party talks, without which the peace process will be jeopardised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The overall and fundamental objective is inclusive all-party talks leading to an agreement.  That is the case and remains the constant concern of the Government.  It is a concern we reiterated in conjunction with the British Government yesterday in Cannes.  The other issues, which the Deputy mentioned, cannot simply be left over until afterwards from the point of view of some of the parties whose cooperation is necessary for an overall agreement.  I refer specifically to the views and concerns of the Unionist community on the issue of decommissioning of arms and on the issue of negotiating <Col N="413" /> with people who still have connections with those who hold arms.  That concern is there and there is no way in which it can simply be wished away by saying our objective is all-party talks and that everything else does not matter.  Reiterating that point, mantra-like, does not dispose of the problem from the point of view of the Unionist community in particular.  That is why the Prime Minister and I, at our first meeting in Downing Street in December, said we wanted substantial progress on the decommissioning issue.  I have stuck firmly to that position ever since.  What we are trying to do now is to accelerate our joint work between the two Governments so that we can find a formula whereby that substantial progress can be made.  It is one of the essential steps necessary to reach the objective which the Deputy and I share &mdash; which is essential to any overall agreement &mdash; of all-inclusive talks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree that there is one avenue open which is fully supported by the loyalist representatives, who appeared at the forum, it is common ground between loyalists and republicans &mdash; that something real be done in the case of prisoners? If we have a 50 per cent remission policy in regard to loyalist and republican political prisoners, it represents an area in which there is agreement across the board between the two communities, as referred to by the Taoiseach, in getting Unionist involvement and that represents a practical step that can be taken by the two Governments together now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already expressed my view on remissions and I will not repeat it.  The House is well aware of my view on that issue.  What I said the last time Deputy Lenihan raised this question &mdash; the last time we had questions on the subject &mdash; was that one has to be sensitive in looking at this issue also to the feelings of victims and their political representatives.  There is a wide spectrum of opinion in Northern <Col N="414" /> Ireland across the board who might have views about releases from their own community but who might have different views about releases from another community where those representatives in that other community might have committed crimes that were particularly offensive in their own community. It is not as simple as Deputy Lenihan is portraying it but I have expressed my view on the remission of sentences frequently in the House and elsewhere and in bilateral contacts with the British Government and I adhere to it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to ask three brief supplementaries.  Is the Dalton-Chilcott process being followed?  Will the Dalton-Chilcott group take up discussions at the point where the Taoiseach and the Prime Minister left off yesterday?  Will the Taoiseach confirm that the group will take up the work in which they were engaged earlier in the year, as announced last week? Obviously the Taoiseach cannot tell me the time-scale to which they are working. Will the Taoiseach accept that Strand II of the talks requires a resumption of the direct dialogue between the Irish Government and the Unionists which last took place in autumn 1992?  I support the Taoiseach's efforts in contacting the Unionist party and join others in expressing regret at the reply.  I urge the Taoiseach to continue to exert whatever pressure he can.  Strand II is part of the process in which they have already engaged and they should continue. In regard to Question No. 5, Mr. Robert McCartney came down to talks here with the then Taoiseach in 1981 and during his election campaign he claimed to represent the modern pluralist face of unionism.  Has the Taoiseach contacted him?  If, 14 years ago, he saw fit to engage in talks directly with the Irish Government he will not have a difficulty now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The discussions that are to take place between our officials are not confined solely to security and <Col N="415" /> decommissioning related issues; they are wider than that.  Therefore, not one particular instrument will be used for the channel.  The Chilcott-Dalton group was mainly for decommissioning and security related issues.  There are other issues that will be discussed as well.  I do not think I should dwell on what committee is dealing with the issue.  The important point is that we will have very serious and intensive discussions with a view to moving across the range of issues where movement can be made to advance the peace process.  On the question of Mr. Robert McCartney I have said in the House that I would be delighted to meet him and I repeat that. If it requires a letter to confirm it I will happily send it.  I have said it in the House and I think it is clear in its import.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that I invited all the parties to discussions on an open agenda.  I did not specify Strand II or any other strand.  I said I was inviting them to come to talk to the Irish Government and that at the first meeting items of concern to them would be exclusively discussed.  In other words they could determine the agenda for the first meeting and we could continue with our discussions, on their items, until we had gone a considerable distance on their concerns.  I am not confining my invitation to an agenda related to the three strands or to anything else. It is an open invitation which allows them to come to put their views to the Irish Government.  Even the most fundamental Unionist position accepts the existence of this State as a neighbouring State.  It would appear to me that even the most fundamental Unionist position will accept that we would have many bilateral concerns as we share the same island and that, therefore, the invitation by the Irish Government to allow them to come and speak to the Irish Government about those bilateral concerns from the perspective of their own <Col N="416" /> Government is one that has attractions to any party, representing any segment of the population in Northern Ireland.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">

      <P>My views on that matter are already on public record.  I will not go into any more detail on the matters discussed by the Prime Minister and me in Cannes.

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It may be perfectly legitimate for the Deputy to ask the question but it is equally perfectly legitimate for me to give the answer I am giving, which is that all the issues relevant were covered in a general way.  I decided I would raise the Clegg issue publicly before seeing the Prime Minister because it has been occupying a substantial amount of media space and attention in the days leading up to that meeting.  It was made a public issue by Members of the House of Commons who campaigned in the Irish and British <Col N="417" /> media on this question and it was therefore already in the public arena.  As I had not been asked about it in this House during the previous week I had not had an opportunity to voice my view on the subject so I gave it at the earliest opportunity because I believe it was and is a matter of public concern.  I did so on that occasion and see no need to give an ongoing repetition on this matter. My views have been made known.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>In the text of the doorstep interview the Prime Minister, Mr. Major, raised the decommissioning issue a number of times.  He seemed to suggest broadly similar proposals had been put forward by his Government and our Government and a mechanism to move forward had been agreed; the Taoiseach will not say whether it is the Chilcott-Dalton plan but someone else is obviously involved.  Is the Taoiseach disappointed that, having reached a position which seems like progress, Sir Patrick Mayhew rolled back from it?  On at least two occasions in the last three months we have reached a progressive position on decommissioning and each time Sir Patrick Mayhew has rolled back.  Is the Taoiseach concerned that, on the morning after a successful meeting at Cannes, where the Taoiseach announced and apparently achieved progress &mdash; which I acknowledged and congratulate him for &mdash; Sir Patrick Mayhew seemed to return to his pre-Easter position?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I quote what the Prime Minister said at questions:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One proposal I can tell you about this afternoon.  As a result of our discussions we both arrived this afternoon with broadly similar proposals as to how we might move forward in terms of decommissioning.  We spent some time examining those in detail and we have decided to put our officials together fairly speedily to examine those proposals and work out a mutually agreeable <i>modus <Col N="418" /> operandi</i> which will enable us to clear the way ahead in terms of decommissioning of weapons.</P>
    <P>That is what the Prime Minister said and it is accurate.  We agreed on a way of moving forward to deal with and reach a common view on issues such as those reiterated this morning by Sir Patrick Mayhew.  The Prime Minister and I were talking about a process for resolving differences; Sir Patrick was reiterating a previous position on the material question, as distinct from the process.  It is not for me to reconcile the comments of Ministers in another Government.  I do not think the representation the Deputy put on it &mdash; that the two positions are divergent &mdash; is in accordance with the facts.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9, 17, 38, 43 and 91 together.</P>
      <P>In recent weeks I have circulated to Government Departments and the Central Bank draft proposals dealing with the options open to the Government as regards the future of the State banks, including TSB.  I have met with a wide range of interested parties in connection with the preparation of these proposals. I have held meetings with representatives of the boards and staff of each of the three State banks, viz., ACC Bank, ICC Bank and TSB Bank.  In addition to the representatives of the staff of each of the State banks, I received a delegation from the Irish Bank Officials' Association.  I have also met with senior management of National Australia Bank, the chairman of National Irish Bank, and the chief executive of Ulster Bank.</P>
      <P>I have not so far sought the advice of consultants in relation to any aspect of the future of the State banks.  Deputies will be aware that my predecessor last year commissioned advice on several aspects of this question from independent consultants.</P>
      <P>As regards the economic role of a State bank, one of the primary functions which I would wish to see any such institution play is, through competitive lending and support of enterprise, the encouragement of business and trade, which can only have a beneficial effect on economic activity and prosperity. ICC Bank in particular has made a significant contribution in this respect over the decades, both in relation to domestic trade and to exports.  In recent years ACC Bank has quickly been moving into the funding of a diversified range of business customers on a substantial scale.  In doing so both banks have operated to a fully commercial mandate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My intention in seeking to develop the State banking sector to meet the needs of the economy is to foster greater competition in banking, both as regards costs and the availability of funds, notably in relation to small and <Col N="422" /> medium-sized enterprises, and to contribute to greater business activity, with consequent benefits to the economy in terms of increasing prosperity and accelerating the decline in unemployment.</P>
    <P>As part of my consideration of how best to restructure the State banking operations, I am considering how best An Post might be linked with whatever entity or entities may emerge from the evolution of this process.  Until the Government has had the opportunity to consider my proposals, which I intend to put before it at the earliest feasible date, it would be premature to speculate on how matters may develop in this regard.</P>
    <P>I have no plans to make an approach to the credit union movement in connection with the restructuring of the State banking sector.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>One could accept a reasonable delay on the part of the new Government in reaching a decision on a third banking force.  However, even the terminology of the Minister's reply has changed in the last few months.  He said it would be premature to speculate on what date a proposal might be brought before the Government.  Not long before this Government came to power, in reply to a question from me the Minister said this would be done shortly; he was asked again two months later and said it would be immediate; last month it was supposed to happen in this month, June; and now it is premature to speculate about it at all.</P>
      <P>Does the Minister not agree it is time to make a decision on this matter, one way or the other?  We have had enough speculation and all the information is there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thank the Minister for his reply which was only a recitation of the consultations he has had with the various bodies and what the <i>modus operandi</i> of those financial institutions should be. However, when will a decision be made to take us out of this limbo which does not help anybody?  It damages the good name of the State in the international financial sector where Governments are expected to make decisions within a <Col N="423" /> reasonable period.  That reasonable period is long since over.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I must reject what the Deputy has said.  To listen to him, one would think that the banks in question were not performing satisfactorily or that they were losing money, which is not the case.  The two State-owned banks have been making profits for some time and the TSB, which is in a separate category of ownership, is performing profitably.</P>
      <P>It is far more important that we get the best possible arrangement put in place than to move rather precipitously towards a particular kind of arrangement which may be speedily delivered but which may, in the long term, not suit the needs of all of the factors to which I have referred.  Therefore, I do not consider that the time which we have already taken has been misspent or has in any way endangered the actual operation of the banks in question.  That said, however, I share the Deputy's concern that it is essential that we move to finalise this as quickly as possible, and I have conveyed that view to my colleagues in Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that one of the reasons for the present delay is the document put forward by one of his partners in Government, the Democratic Left, which, when it was thought that they were about to make a decision, gave the argument a whole new complexion?  That was not helpful.  Since the Minister has said that these financial institutions are performing well, one option open to him is to drop the whole idea and to leave matters as they are.  I do not deny the Minister the right to make that decision. All of those institutions are working well and it is an option.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, there is litle point in commissioning expensive Government reports, having various discussions with the boards of all these institutions and going merrily around without making a decision.  It is time to make a decision <Col N="424" /> and to finalise this matter because this delay is not helping the morale of those institutions.  More importantly, the international financial institutions which are closely examining the situation are not impressed with the tardiness of the Government's response.  I agree with the Minister that it is important to make the right decision&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that the Deputy is saying that he would like me to make the decision but, more importantly, that he would like me to make the correct decision.  I share that concern.  The proposals which were on my desk when I came into the Department of Finance in January of this year did not find favour with me and it took some time to go carefully through the consideration that had been given by my predecessor in that respect.  I do, however, recognise that it is in the best interests of all concerned to move as quickly as prudence would suggest or come forward with a proposal which will have widespread support and will have the desired effect. No doubt, the Deputy shares this concern.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Finance</askee>
      <Quest>his views on the recent OECD survey report which put forward the view that the best way to secure long-term prosperity for the Irish economy is to use fiscal leeway to cut debt and taxes rather than to finance increasing public spending, as has been the case since the current Government took office; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[11938/95]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The OECD acknowledges <Col N="425" /> that Ireland's &ldquo;Budget position has remained under control&rdquo;.  It could, indeed, say no less since Government borrowing has remained well below 3 per cent of GDP for several years and the ratio of debt to GDP has been falling rapidly.  The OECD assessment of the spending limits which this Government has set itself is that these limits are consistent with substantial further reduction of our debt burden in the period ahead.</P>
      <P>While the choice of reducing the level of debt at a faster pace is, of course, a desirable one, the use of resources in this way must be weighed against the potential benefits of alternative uses. The choice of how to use the fruits of growth must be considered in the context of the overall priority of Government policy which is to sustainably reduce the level of unemployment as quickly as possible.  In deciding on the allocation of resources, it is necessary to strike a balance between reducing the level of debt on the one hand while committing appropriate resources to other desirable objectives on the other.</P>
      <P>The OECD is critical of the pace of expenditure growth in recent years.  This criticism of past spending trends has some validity.  The fact is that since 1990 spending on current supply services has increased on average by about 5 per cent per annum over the rate of inflation.  This rate of increase in spending clearly has to be reduced.</P>
      <P>The Deputy's question implies that public spending began to increase only since this Government took office.  This is simply, as he well knows, not the case. In fact, the upward trend in public spending has been evident for at least four or five years.</P>
      <P>The importance which this Government attaches to strict control of public spending is clear in the commitment in <i>A Government of Renewal</i> to limit the growth in current supply spending to 6 per cent in nominal terms this year and to an average of 2 per cent in real terms in 1996 and 1997; and in the action we have recently taken to ensure that these limits are observed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="426" /> The aim of the measures we are taking is to ensure that the benefits of future growth are used in substantial measure for tax reform which will favour the incentive to work, tackle the poverty trap, encourage enterprise development and, above all, ensure the maximum growth in sustainable employment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree with the OECD's contention that the best way to secure long term prosperity for the Irish economy is to use fiscal leeway to cut debt and taxes rather than to finance increases in public spending?  Secondly, we recently had a lengthy Private Members' debate on this whole area.  Does the Minister accept that there is an implied criticism in the OECD report that the setting of a target of inflation plus 2 per cent for the next number of years was not the correct strategy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy read the report carefully &mdash; which I am sure he has &mdash; he would recognise that the OECD is critical of the drift upwards in public spending over the four to five year period.  However, it takes note of the commitment which we made in the programme <i>A Government of Renewal</i> and this is a correct course of action from the OECD point of view. Increases in public spending of the level which we have had over the last five years are not sustainable for the interim period.  That is why in the formulation of the programme of the present three-party Government this problem was both recognised and addressed.</P>
      <P>I recognise, in turn, that achieving the target of 6 per cent was clearly difficult this year and, in respect to equal treatment, we breached it &mdash; consciously and for reasons which I have addressed elsewhere. I said in my budget speech that we would have difficulties in meeting our target of 2 per cent for 1996 and 1997 but they are desirable targets and ones to which I remain fully committed.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11 and 52 together.</P>
      <P>The Government's Programme of Renewal has promised that, in advance of the divorce referendum, a comprehensive paper will be published indicating the text of the amendment proposed by Government and addressing a number of related issues, including taxation. The full details of the proposed tax treatment of divorced and remarried people will be given in this comprehensive paper.  In the circumstances it would not be appropriate for me to outline my views on the taxation of divorced couples before the Government has had an opportunity to consider the matter fully.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister is unwilling to indicate his own policy position on the issue, perhaps he could be of assistance to the House.  Is it possible to give a double allowance to the current spouse and the previous spouse in the aftermath of a divorce?  If so, what would be the implications for the Exchequer and the taxation system if such a double allowance was given?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a complex area <Col N="428" /> and I hesitate to speculate on Deputy McDowell's very profound question. The double allowance implies a certain relationship between the people involved, that is, a relationship of marriage. What the Deputy is suggesting is that if the divorce referendum is carried and legislation is subsequently introduced to give effect to the decision of the people, the marriage relationship which justified granting a double tax allowance, would no longer exist where a divorce is granted by the courts and, if I understand the question correctly, citizens who had previously been married to one another would have a second set of double tax allowances in a second union.  That would present many difficulties.  Full details of the proposed tax treatment of divorced and remarried people will be given in the comprehensive paper to which I have referred.  I hesitate to give a definitive answer to the Deputy's question which is complex as the matter is still under review.  We are preparing proposals for Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer whenever it is given will be central to the thinking of many people on this matter. For many dependent spouses who anticipate being divorced the idea that they would no longer be recognised under the taxation system, apart from the question of remarriage, would scare them.  Does the Minister agree that there must be significant concern on the question of sharing the present tax deal for married couples in the event of a reconstituted second marriage and a divorced dependent spouse?  Does he also agree that since the Minister for Social Welfare is publicly putting the building blocks in place on the social welfare side in the run-up to the divorce referendum the public are entitled sooner rather than later to a clear view of the taxation implications for families who may find themselves in this unfortunate situation?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's question is well placed.  The guiding principle for the Government in addressing the question of the divorce referendum and subsequent legislation to be enacted if the referendum is endorsed by the people is that no one should be financially worse off.  It has been the practice in this House that taxation legislation reflects rather than leads social legislation.  It would be premature for me to anticipate the decision of the people in the divorce referendum and to enact provisions in finance legislation.  For this reason amendments tabled by Opposition Deputies were not accepted.  I fully accept &mdash; I am aware of the position of the Deputy and that of his party on this matter &mdash; that there is a need for clarity in terms of what regime governing social welfare and taxation matters is likely to be put in place if the referendum is carried. I intend to ensure once the Government has considered how the issue should be addressed that this will be published to inform the debate in the run-up to the referendum.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12 and 20 together.</P>
      <P>I take it the Deputies are referring to remarks made by the German Finance Minister at a press briefing following the 19 June ECOFIN meeting.  That meeting considered European Commission opinions to the effect that all member states of the European Union except Germany, Luxembourg and Ireland have excessive deficits as defined in the Treaty on European Union.</P>
      <P>The excessive deficit procedure is set out in Article 104c of the Treaty. Briefly, it provides that the European Commission will prepare an opinion where a member state does not fulfil one or both of the following requirements, namely that the ratio of the general Government deficit to gross domestic product, GDP, should not exceed 3 per cent or, if it does, that the ratio has declined substantially and continuously and reached a level close to 3 per cent, or the excess over 3 per cent is small, exceptional and temporary; The ratio of general Government debt to GDP should not exceed 60 per cent unless the ratio is sufficiently diminishing and approaching 60 per cent at a satisfactory pace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland's general Government deficit <Col N="431" /> has been below 3 per cent of GDP every year since and including 1989.  In addition, our debt-to-GDP ratio has been reduced from over 116 per cent in 1987 to 90 per cent in 1994 and will decline significantly again in 1995 to 85 per cent approximately.  In view of these factors, the European Commission did not prepare an opinion on Ireland under the 1995 excessive deficit procedure because, as in 1994, the Commission rightly considered that Ireland does not have an excessive deficit.</P>
    <P>I have not approached Dr. Waigel on foot of his remarks about Ireland's debt ratio: I pointed out after the 19 June ECOFIN meeting that the Treaty provisions are quite clear that a member state meets the debt criterion, even if its debt-to-GDP ratio is above 60 per cent, provided the ratio is sufficiently diminishing and approaching 60 per cent at a satisfactory pace, and it is equally clear that Ireland's debt ratio meets that test. It is the European Commission, and not the Government of any member state, which decides whether to prepare an opinion to the effect that a member state has an excessive deficit under the Treaty and the European Commission has clearly &mdash; and rightly &mdash; decided that Ireland has not.  The German Government is fully aware both of the Commission's decisions on Ireland's case in 1994 and 1995 and of Ireland's view of the matter.</P>
    <P>As regards the interim measures on public expenditure recently announced by the Government, these are aimed at ensuring that the Government commitment to limit the growth in current supply services expenditure to 2 per cent in real terms in 1996 is honoured.  By committing itself to containing current supply expenditure, the Government is demonstrating its determination to ensure that Ireland will continue to meet the convergence criteria for movement to EU set out in the Treaty on European Union.</P>

      <P>I do not know the reason Dr. Waigel expressed these views.  I understand that he is concerned about the position in Belgium, for example, where the general Government debt to GDP ratio is currently 123 per cent and rising.  The ratio is rising in a number of the countries which hope to introduce a single currency in 1999 which would form the basis for EMU.  I have taken note of what the Deputy said.  Public controversy is not necessarily helpful. This is a matter for the Commission, and it has made its decision.  It is not for individual member states to determine whether other member states meet the excessive deficit procedures.</P>

      <P>Opposing views among the public are often helpful or at least bring people to the realisation that we are not all perfect.  Given that as a result of the actions of successive Governments we are moving in the right direction regarding the Maastricht criteria and we are in a position to have a single European currency, will the Minister agree it is important to find out why the most important member financially of the EU thinks in this fashion?  Perhaps Dr. Waigel is making these comments because he is sceptical about some of the Government's statistics or he is concerned about the Irish position when EU funds dry up at the end of this decade.  The Minister should discuss these matters with his German counterpart.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the Deputy's view that outside comment, particularly of an objective and critical kind, is helpful and should not be rejected.  I think Dr. <Col N="433" /> Waigel is of the view that the debt-GDP ratio of 90 per cent last year and 85 per cent this year is too high having regard to the figure of 60 per cent &mdash; the critical phrase is &ldquo;moving at a satisfactory pace towards 60 per cent&rdquo;.  It appears that he is not necessarily satisfied at the pace, although he indicated in a press briefing that the performance in terms of reduction of the debt-GDP ratio between 1987 and this year has been very satisfactory.  In terms of treaty compliance the Commission is charged under the treaty to determine whether member states meet the criteria, and it made that judgment not only this year but last year also.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Finance</askee>
      <Quest>if he will abolish the dual structure in line with the declared objectives of the Strategic Management Initiative in view of the fact that it affects professional accountants and other professional bodies and in the interests of improving efficiency and professionalism in the Civil Service; if so, when he intends to do so; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[11884/95]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The term &ldquo;dual structure&rdquo; refers to the situation which applies in a number of Departments with significant functions whereby there is a separate technical structure, often headed up by an officer at assistant secretary level; parallel to these technical structures, there exist general service administrative structures.</P>
      <P>I am aware that over the years, certain difficulties have been associated with the dual structure, most of which are being addressed in the context of the strategic management initiative. However, I am not certain that Deputy Cullen's concerns regarding accountants arise from the existence of the dual structure; rather they seem to relate to the fact that certain professional grades, including accountants, do not have access to the inter-departmental scheme for promotion to principal officer posts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="434" /> As I explained to Deputy Eoin Ryan in a written reply on 25 April, the principles governing promotion in the Civil Service are open for discussion under the conciliation and arbitration scheme. The existing arrangements, including the details of the grades in which posts are fillable under the scheme and the grades which are eligible to compete for such promotion posts have been agreed with the staff side under the scheme.  As the scheme is currently constituted, it is confined to grades represented by the Association of Higher Civil Servants in both instances.</P>
    <P>I am positively disposed to the removal of traditional promotion barriers in the Civil Service.  Indeed, I understand that my own Department made proposals some years ago which would have effected significant changes in regard to eligibility for the principal officer scheme, but it was not, unfortunately, possible to secure the agreement of the relevant staff interests to those proposals.  Rather than take unilateral action in regard to this issue, I propose to await the outcome from the strategic management initiative.</P>
    <P>It is only fair to acknowledge, however, that eligibility for the most senior Civil Service posts, those which are filled through the Top Level Appointments Committee, is open to all civil servants, within a certain salary band, regardless of the &ldquo;stream&rdquo; to which they belong; while, in relation to the scheme for promotion to principal, eligibility has been extended to include a number of grades outside of the general service stream.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  I was a little despondent with the first part of it but much happier with the second part.  Will the Minister agree it is not in the best interests of the public service that people who are highly qualified, many of whom have a background in the private as well as the public sector, are debarred from principal officer grade and higher grades?  The position has changed dramatically in that the administrative role of these people has <Col N="435" /> become much more involved in recent times and their expertise is in more demand.  It is important under the strategic management initiative that all grades be open to merit and ability.  The present system has been abolished in the UK, from where it derived, and in most other commonwealth countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy. This matter must be negotiated with the relevant interests.  Proposals in this regard, were put forward by the Department of Finance some years ago.  There is an element of a closed shop here and all professional associations &mdash; perhaps the law profession being the worst, with my own profession not far behind &mdash; are fairly good at operating closed shops.  At the end of the day good people regardless of their training and background have nothing to fear from the opening up of competition in those areas.  More importantly the public service in general and the Civil Service in particular would benefit from such an opening up.  There are genuine fears that must be recognised and addressed.  Progress has been made and I would like to build on that progress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I commend the Minister for putting on record that there is a closed shop.  People have vested interests and nobody can be blamed for wanting to protect their own interests. Since the Minister has used the phrase it brings to the fore what we are dealing with.  I accept this is a sensitive area and we must ensure that everybody has a reasonable opportunity.  The opportunity that exists under the strategic management initiative is probably the best one available to allow the changes to be made.  Will the Minister agree that this matter must be included in consideration of the strategic management initiative?  Otherwise it may be ten years before the position is changed.  A target must be set in this regard within the current proposals.</P>

      <P>I hope in the implementation of the strategic management initiative, which is supported by all parties in the House and by the wider Civil Service, this matter will be addressed satisfactorily.  I hesitate to lay down conditions or set timetables in that respect. I agree with the Deputy and I hope the progress already made and the positive gains derived from that progress will encourage people to move forward to the next stage.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to reply to Questions Nos. 14, 24, 27, 29, 35, 55, 63, 64, 70 and 92 together.</P>
      <P>I wish to make clear at the outset that the interim decisions on public expenditure which the Government has recently taken are aimed at containing the growth in gross current supply services expenditure in 1996 within the 2 per cent real increase figure to which it committed itself in the programme, <i>A Government of Renewal.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A review of spending trends carried out recently by my Department pointed to a risk that, based on a continuation of existing programmes and policies, gross departmental current spenting would grow next year at a rate slightly in excess of the 2 per cent real limit. Accordingly, in the interest of prudent <Col N="438" /> budgetary management the Government decided on a measured and appropriate response at this point to an emerging unfavourable trend in order to avoid excessive dislocation of public services which would have been inevitable had the response been delayed.  The interim measures which were announced on 8 June were as follows:&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash;  all Ministers are to identify measures to control public spending within their Departments.  This will involve all Ministers reviewing their existing policies and expenditures with a view to maximising the benefits to be obtained within the Government's spending target.</P>
    <P>&mdash; there will be no recruitment to posts paid for out of public funds which would have the effect of increasing the numbers of posts above that on 9 June, unless there is specific prior Government approval.  All Ministers are to halt the process of recruitment for additional posts with effect from 9 June 1995, unless and until the Government decides that such recruitment may take place in particular areas.</P>
    <P>Their primary purpose is to ensure that the Government's 2 per cent limit on real current spending next year will not be breached and that there is thus sufficient scope in next year's budget to make further progress in reducing taxes in favour of employment.</P>
    <P>The impact of these decisions will be reflected in the detailed Departmental spending bids for 1996 which are now being drawn up.  These estimates will be examined in detail by Ministers over the coming months and final figures for each Department and agency will be published in the 1996 Estimates volume.</P>
    <P>Let me make one point absolutely clear.  Public spending in 1995 is on target. There are no indications of the emergence of any significant underlying <Col N="439" /> pressures driving spending off course. The Government is determined to achieve its target for 1995 of a 6.9 per cent nominal increase in gross non-capital supply services spending.  The midyear Exchequer returns which will be available early next week should provide confirmation that we remain on course.</P>
    <P>The inflation data for mid-May are not a cause of concern in so far as this year's Estimates are concerned.  Underlying inflation, exclusive of the recent change in mortgage interest rates, actually declined in the quarter.  I am confident that the average rate of price increase over 1995 as a whole will be close to my budget-day estimate of 2.5 per cent.</P>
    <P>I assure the House that, in the light of the foregoing, there are no plans to introduce a mini-budget in 1995.</P>
    <P>The prudent action which the Government has taken has resulted from a careful and timely examination of the outlook for expenditure in 1996. The Government commenced its examination well in advance of the publication of the recent OECD survey on the Irish economy.  It is totally misleading to suggest that the Government decision to initiate action to control the emerging expenditure trends in 1996 was taken in direct response to the OECD survey.  This is simply not true. Also, I reject allegations that the OECD survey is &ldquo;highly critical&rdquo;.  The survey, in fact, is very positive.  I acknowledge that there are some criticisms but these are in general constructive, in that the concern of the OECD is to ensure that the Government's present successful policies are maintained.  In this regard, I remind Deputies that the OECD's comments in relation to the growth in public expenditure relates to the growth in the recent past &mdash; not to the Government's plans to contain the real increase in current supply expenditure to 2 per cent <Col N="440" /> per annum on average over the next two years.</P>
    <P>This Government is taking positive and determined steps to ensure that the growth in public expenditure is kept firmly under control.  We are committed to curbing the excessive growth in current Government spending which has emerged over the last five years.  We are convinced that this positive action will yield significant benefits in terms of increasing the room for manoeuvre to improve the incentives for work through the tax and social welfare system, and in terms of keeping downward pressure on borrowing and thus on interest rates and inflation.</P>
    <P>This disciplined approach will provide the resources to promote additional employment, reward work and reduce taxation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>We read recently that there was a certain Friday by which all Ministers were to have sent their proposed cutbacks to the Minister for Finance. Is the Minister in a position to announce, particularly in the light of the impending by-election, to which areas these apply?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has been too long in this House and too long in Government not to realise that the replies which I have received have been substantial but, as is the tradition of the Department of Finance, not as satisfactory as we might wish.  Onward discussions and negotiations are taking place.  The replies have come in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>In the light of the need to control public expenditure will the Minister accept that the message from a conference which he was unable to attend recently but which was attended by people from the EMI, particularly in the light of Dr. Waigel's comments relating to the need to curb public expenditure, would lead one to believe that approaching the 60 per cent figure <Col N="441" /> will not be enough and what they are now saying is that we should achieve the 60 per cent figure?  Is the Minister's thinking in the context of public expenditure alerted to that and is that what he is now striving to achieve by 1999 when the kick-start of monetary union is proposed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly hold the view that we should be moving, particularly in a period of high growth and we are looking at positive growth in real terms of the order of 3 per cent after inflation, 2.5 per cent after inflation if you take the ESRI study, for example, for the next four or five years, towards getting our current budget into balance.  It is an opportunity which previous political generations have not had and I think we should use that opportunity to get our current budget into balance, possibly into surplus.  Because of the needs of the Irish economy, there will be a requirement to have a capital spend for some time in productive public infrastructure investment but in terms of current supply services for current account activity there is an opportunity and, therefore, an obligation for us to work towards a current budget balance.</P>
      <P>What we do with the fruits of growth depends on what priorities Governments of the day, informed by the votes of this House and the electorate, want to do.  Reducing the debt is clearly one of them because it releases resources for expenditure or for lowering taxation. There is another view that Government activity should have as a priority a policy that will stimulate economic growth. We certainly should be moving to reduce the debt as quickly as possible. One way of doing that and the way that has been chosen by this administration and by the previous administration is to ensure the highest rate of economic growth so that the debt to GDP ratio falls rapidly which is what has been happening.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that if one were to use the traditional net supply service spending figure, the growth in supply service spending this year would be close to 8 per cent rather than 6.9 per cent?  Will he also agree it is strange that we should hear in this House of the particular measures that affect the Department of Justice but are not told of the general implications of the call by his Department on other Departments to identify opportunities to control public spending, what those other measures will be?  Has the Minister asked each Department to specify a figure in respect of each Department, is there a target figure by which they are to control public spending next year?  Are Departments free to choose the extent to which they are to identify these opportunities or have they been fixed with some percentage of departmental spending which must be cut back, in effect, in the process that is now unfolding?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>They are publicly known. The figures are clearly contained in the Programme for Government.  They must prepare Estimates on the basis of a real increase of no more than 2 per cent for 1996 on the basis of where we are now having regard to certain emerging trends in so far as we can discern them at this stage.  We appear to be running at 2.7 per cent rather than 2 per cent, hence the reason for taking the 0.7 per cent corrective action.  That is an adjustment in the process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the Department of Justice the reason the decision to defer the Castlerea project was that they were about to go to a definitive stage in the contractual process and it was necessary <Col N="443" /> to defer it at that time.  Otherwise we would have engaged people in a contractual process that would have been difficult to unravel.  That is the reason that decision was taken in isolation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern" hpid="Mr. M. Ahern Mr. M. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>A substantial amount of overtime was paid in various Departments during the past year.  Overtime payments in the Department of Equality and Law Reform and in the State-sponsored bodies under its aegis amounted to £23.5 million, it amounted to £23 million in the Department of Health and the State-sponsored bodies under its aegis and to more than £6.75 million in the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry and the State-sponsored bodies under its aegis. Regarding the control the Minister is insisting on in terms of cutbacks, will his emphasis be to maintain employment at its present level and to ensure that overtime will not be abused?  Is the level of overtime kept under constant review?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not had notice of the precise nature of the question and I am not familiar with those overtime figures, but they appear substantial.  It is an area that must be examined.  We are concerned that a chief executive, be it the secretary of a Government Department or an agency under a Government Department like a health board, would manage the delivery of the services with which he is charged statutorily to supply in as effective and efficient a way as possible to maintain the quality of the service.  The Deputy used the phrase &ldquo;excessive overtime&rdquo;.  If overtime as a percentage of wage costs is excessive, it is time to examine the way that labour force is being utilised, the staffing level of that organisation or if there is an agreement, albeit informal, between management and staff to divvy up the work among a smaller group of people to ensure a higher level of remuneration when more employment could be <Col N="444" /> created to supply the same service. Without having specific details I hesitate to comment on the overtime figures to which the Deputy referred.  I would not like to think that collusion resulted in even temporary jobs, which could have been filled not being filled and the overtime being shared among a smaller group of people.  That would be against my view on how employment opportunities should be opened up and shared within our community.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The across the board use of a scalpel in various Departments when cutbacks must be achieved is not the correct approach, but it seems to have been adopted by successive Governments and Ministers for Finance in seeking to achieve spending levels. Such an approach in a Department which starts from a high base and has more fat may affect worthwhile initiatives in other Departments.  Perhaps the Minister should use a more selective approach in terms of achieving spending levels.  In this era of openness, transparency and accountability, will the Minister announce details of any midyear adjustments &mdash; similar to those made by Governments in the past regarding spending plans &mdash; before the Dáil goes into recess next week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for his observation on across the board approaches and I agree with him.  Those are corrective measures we are requiring Departments to take.  The 1996 Estimates do not take account of the mid-year Exchequer returns which will be available in a few days and will enable us to fine tune our figures.  We are not talking about a mini budget which would result in downward adjustments in terms of proposals for 1995. There may be adjustments regarding the commencement of various types of activities and programmes and I will make all that information available as soon as final decisions are made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Currie)</NameTxt>
      <P>The issue of protection of children from sexual abuse particularly in their own homes is one about which I, as Minister with special responsibility for child care am very much concerned.  Accordingly, when these amendments were put forward on Committee Stage I brought them to the attention of the Minister who agreed to re-examine them on the basis that if what was suggested was the best way forward in terms of child protection then the amendments should as far as possible be accepted.  However, on reexamination, the Minister is satisfied that she cannot accept the amendments.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the amendments is very laudable seeking adequate protection for young persons under 15 or 17 years who may be pressurised or forced into sexual activity with persons in parental positions including persons who are adoptive or step parents.</P>
      <P>I agree with the result the Deputy wishes to achieve, but not with the proposed means of achieving it.  The Minister said, however, on a number of occasions in this House that she accepted there were broader issues than the issues this Bill specifically seeks to address and that she intended to address them in a discussion paper to be published within weeks of the enactment of this Bill.  How best the sexual abuse of children by persons in authority should be dealt with is a question which the Minister strongly believes should be dealt with in the context of a comprehensive examination rather than by way of the well intentioned but inappropriate, piecemeal approach these amendments would achieve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The extent of the problem of sexual <Col N="570" /> abuse of children by persons in authority goes beyond the categories of persons the amendments seek to cover. Positions of authority can equally be abused by for example persons in <i>loco parentis</i>, or by a trusted relative of the family who may not come within the ambit of the Punishment of Incest Act, 1908.  An example would be an uncle, who may or may not live in the family home but who would obviously be trusted by parents and children alike. There are many categories of persons who may be in such positions of trust and unfortunately there are people who abuse their positions.  If we wish to ensure a wide-ranging protection for children from such abuse, we must take a comprehensive approach.</P>
    <P>I would ask Deputies to accept that we cannot do this in a short Bill, which must be quickly enacted to meet an urgent need.  That is generally accepted in the House.  A much more comprehensive approach is required.  Such an approach was taken by the Law Reform Commission in its report on child sexual abuse.</P>
    <P>In that report the commission examined the issue of sexual abuse of young people under 15 and 17 years.  The focus was on sexual abuse of young people by persons in authority.  The Law Reform Commission's suggested definition of &rdquo;a person in authority&rdquo; is</P>
    <P>A parent, step-parent, grand-parent, uncle or aunt, any guardian or person in <i>loco parentis</i> or any person responsible, even temporarily, for the education, supervision or welfare of a person below the age of 17 years.</P>
    <P>The Law Reform Commission's approach is very interesting and must be considered carefully in the context of its overall recommendations in respect of sexual offences with the young.  The Minister believes, as I do that this approach can be useful in helping to find a way to deal effectively with that most repulsive abuse of children by persons entrusted with their care.  The Minister considers this too serious an issue for a less than considerate <Col N="571" /> response and, therefore, wishes to consult as widely as possible on a matter which is of great consequence for this and future generations.  She is particularly anxious to hear the informed views of social workers and other interested parties concerned with the protection of children.  She proposes to include this issue in her consultation paper and to publish it within weeks of the enactment of this Bill.  She has also indicated that she is determined to introduce legislation to provide for whatever measures may be identified as necessary to ensure that children are adequately protected by the law against sexual exploitation by adults.</P>
    <P>The Minister is satisfied that her approach is the correct one and that this small Bill is not the right way to deal with what is a major issue.  Therefore, I cannot accept these amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed the Government has decided to procrastinate on yet another issue.  Deputy O'Donoghue and I have had cause to criticise the Minister for her tendency to procrastinate, to long-finger, to request consultation documents and to set up special committees to examine matters in need of immediate reform.  The suggestion by the Law Reform Commission of the need for a comprehensive review of the area of child sexual abuse is all very fine, but there always will be a specific need to view with disapproval and to criminalise any sexual relations between natural or adoptive fathers and their children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is being disingenuous in stating that this small Bill is not the appropriate place to do this.  I highlighted this matter on Committee Stage and the Department has had several days during which it could have drafted an appropriate amendment if it was felt the wording of my amendment was deficient.  The loophole I outlined was recognised by Members from all parties, <Col N="572" /> including Government backbenchers, on Committee Stage.  Once again the Minister is procrastinating in the same way as on our bail laws, measures to tackle the drugs crisis and promises to provide prison places.  I am not willing to accept another indication that the Minister will put this matter on the long finger.  I do not trust her to deal with it. Now that the Oireachtas has been made aware of it, it must be dealt with immediately.</P>
    <P>We must protect children from violations of trusting parental relationships, the crime of incest which involves the abuse of love between family members, particularly between fathers and children.  It is not good enough for the Minister to say <i>mañana</i>, as is her tendency in respect of other matters. She could be called the Minister for <i>mañana.</i></P>
    <P>This amendment has received cross-party support.  The officials in the Department of Justice have had adequate notice of the need to draft an amendment to close this loophole.  The Bill was well amended in the Seanad and in this House but it is regrettable that this important loophole is being ignored by the Minister.  When loopholes in legislation are highlighted, the legislation should be amended.  The Minister has failed in her responsibility to draft an amendment that would cover sexual relations between an adoptive father and a child.  The Status of Children Act, 1987 is far reaching and important legislation which I am seeking to apply to the Punishment of Incest Act, 1908.  The obvious intention was that the Oireachtas would make, for all intents and purposes, the rights of adopted children similar to those of natural children.  The Government is being grossly irresponsible in refusing to allow the Oireachtas to apply the provisions of the 1987 Act to the Punishment of Incest Act.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 5, between lines 5 and 6, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;6.&mdash; The provision of sections 2, 3 and 4 of this Act shall apply to any criminal proceedings for an offence under section 1 or 2 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1935.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to highlight an omission in the Bill.  We are seeking to apply the new provisions in relation to lifting the restrictions on the reporting of incest trials to circumstances relevant to a prosecution under the legislation covering the defilement of young girls.  This matter has been debated in great detail here and in the Seanad and the Minister has indicated at all times that she does not see the relevance of this amendment.  We tried to ensure that lifting restrictions on reporting incest cases would apply to cases involving the legislation under which the man at the centre of the X case was tried.  In that case it appeared that the restrictions which have come to light in relation to incest similarly applied and there was a need to deal with that omission in the law surrounding the reporting of such trials.  Deputy O'Donoghue and I have made strenuous efforts to get the Minister to change her mind on this and that is the purpose of the amendment.  I do not intend to go into the detail of the inequities in the system.  There is a need for change but the Minister is refusing to turn on this <Col N="576" /> point, as on many others.  I will not, therefore, press the amendment but I will listen to the debate on the next amendment tabled by Deputy O'Donoghue which addresses the same flaw in the legislation.  I am withdrawing my amendment because it has been pressed by my party in the Seanad and by me earlier on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 4;</P>
      <P>In page 5, between lines 6 and 7, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;7.&mdash;Section 1 (1) of the Criminial Law (Rape) Act, 1981 as inserted by section 12 of the Criminal Law (Rape) (Amendment) Act, 1990 is hereby amended by the addition of the offences of unlawful carnal knowledge of a girl under the age of 15 years contrary to section 1 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1935, the offence of unlawful carnal knowledge of a girl over the age of 15 years and under the age of 17 years countrary to section 2 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1935, and an attempt to commit either offence to the list of `rape offences' set out in that section.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present position in relation to restrictions on reporting is that while certain cases may not be reported in that the names and addresses of victims may not be given, that does not apply to cases of unlawful carnal knowledge.  In incest and rape cases, the name of the victim may not be publised but in cases involving girls under the age of 15, unlawful carnal knowledge is regarded as statutory rape, even if the girl consents to sexual intercourse.  It is an extraordinary feature of our criminal law that the name and address of the victim may be published.  There has been an honourable tradition among journalists in this country whereby they never publish the name and address of victims of the crime of unlawful carnal knowledge, and that is to their credit.  In <Col N="577" /> future, however, some lurid publication could decide to print the name and address of a victim of this crime which is unacceptable.  This amendment would apply the same rules in relation to reporting these cases as those applying in cases of rape and would, to all intents and purposes, put the crime of unlawful carnal knowledge in the same category as the crime of rape.</P>
    <P>It is important to pass this amendment. One is slow to give examples of why a publication would want to publish the name and address of a victim of the crime of unlawful carnal knowledge but, increasingly publications are coming on the market which might do that.  In justice to young girls who find themselves in this situation through no fault of their own, the Government should accept this amendment which would prevent the publication of the names and addresses of victims of unlawful carnal knowledge, that is to say, victims of a felony in the case of girls under 15 years and victims of a midemeanour in the case of girls between the age of 15 and 17 years.  I would like to hear the Minister's views prior to deciding whether to press the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy O'Donoghue's amendment because it addresses concerns expressed on Committee Stage as to the application of the Criminal Law (Rape) Act, 1981 to the offence of unlawful carnal knowledge which it is relevant for the Minister to address at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One aspect of it has not been mentioned by Deputy O'Donoghue.  Under sections 3, 4 and 5 of the Criminal Law (Rape) Act, 1981, counsel on behalf of the defence is prohibited from questioning the victim about her previous sexual experience.  The Rape Crisis Centre, and others, have repeatedly pointed out that the questioning of victims of rape and other sexual assaults as to their sexual history is demeaning and painful for those victims and is usually utterly irrelevant <Col N="578" /> to the issues before the court of trial.  In effect, it generally puts the victim on trial.  That is why reforms of the 1981 Act are so necessary.</P>
    <P>The amendments before the House are designed to ensure that victims of incest are protected from intrusive and irrelevant questioning as well as reporting and at the trial are protected from intrusive and irrelevant questioning as to their previous sexual history. This was swept aside by the Minister in the Seanad on the grounds that in relation to incest consent is not at issue. The Minister's subsequent arguments do not stand up and I do not see the logic of them.  The Minister correctly said that consent is no defence to a charge of incest, but the imposition of restrictions on the kind of questions that can be asked of incest victims would not affect that fact in the slightest.</P>
    <P>The Minister appears to be saying that the only purpose of the restrictions imposed on questioning by the 1981 Act was to ensure that the accused could not construct an argument to the effect that the victim was a woman of easy virtue, that she had consented to intercourse with others and therefore, could be presumed to have consented to intercourse with the accused.  The Minister was correct in stating that the introduction into evidence of a victim's past sexual history was often used to support the argument that the victim consented but she has failed to take into account that the introduction of such evidence was also frequently used in a general mud-slinging exercise against the witness who was the victim.</P>
    <P>The jury could be convinced, for example, that because the victim of incest was sexually promiscuous or had had another sexual encounter, her evidence was worthless; in other words, it would undermine her credibility as a witness.  We are not only concerned about the lifting of restrictions on reporting.  If the Act were applied to incest cases, it would protect the victim from this sort of mud-slinging and cross-examinations by counsel for the defence.  In incest cases there is no legal <Col N="579" /> bar on counsel on behalf of the accused introducing evidence of the victim's past sexual history.</P>
    <P>The Minister said she will put this to a general comprehensive reform of the whole area of child sexual abuse.  I do not accept that, as I do not accept her reasoning for refusing to deal with the amendments on which we have just voted.  When a Bill is before the House it is appropriate to deal with any loopholes or deficiencies if they are brought to the attention of the Minister.  From that point of view I support Deputy O'Donoghue's amendment.</P>
    <P>The Minister said in the Seanad that she was putting in place an immediate review of the whole area but she did not indicate any time scale for that review. The Minister's promises on all issues relating to reform of the criminal justice system, such as the provision of prison spaces <i>et al,</i> are not worth anything because she has not introduced legislation. This legislation was only brought forward because of an imperative which landed this at the doors of the Oireachtas and made clear in a legal judgment that the law needed to be changed.</P>
    <P>This piecemeal knee-jerk reaction just to deal with one small specific aspect of the law is a waste of Oireachtas time when we could be closing two important loopholes in the law which have been drawn to the Minister's attention by Members.  It indicates a lack of recognition of what this House is about.  The Minister should be willing to accept amendments from the Opposition when they are tabled in good faith.  There is no political meat in this for any political party.  In debating legislation we try to make it as comprehensive and relevant as possible.  Now is the time for the Minister to accept this amendment tabled by Deputy O'Donoghue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies will recall that the question of extending the scope of sections 2, 3 and 4 of this Bill to cases <Col N="580" /> of unlawful carnal knowledge was discussed in some depth at the Select Committee on Legislation and Security.</P>
      <P>The protection of the identity and reputation of girls under 15 and 17 years who have been victims of unlawful carnal knowledge is, undoubtedly, a very important issue in the context of our legislation dealing with sexual offences. There is no disagreement between us on this point.  Rather, what we are concerned with is the question of whether we should provide in this Bill for whatever further measures may be necessary to maintain or reinforce that protection.</P>
      <P>In accordance with the commitment I gave on Committee Stage, this matter was brought to the Minister's attention and she confirmed her view that it was appropriate that this issue be left for consideration in the context of the discussion paper she will circulate as quickly as possible after the Bill is enacted.  This is not a decision the Minister has taken lightly.  The fact that the reporting arrangements being provided for in this Bill do not apply to the offences of unlawful carnal knowledge of a girl under 15 or 17 years indeed creates an issue to be addressed, and it is one the Minister is concerned about.</P>
      <P>However, there are other offences where the same issue arises, in particular, the offences of sexual intercourse or buggery with a mentally impaired person, buggery of a person under 17 years and gross indecency with a male under 17 years.  The Minister is anxious that any consideration of the reporting arrangements for sexual offences should be a comprehensive one which takes into account all the victims who need protection.  It is clear from the offences I outlined that, apart from girls and young women, there are other very vulnerable groups, such as mentally impaired persons and young boys for whom the same issues arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, it is important to make the point that the same very urgent considerations that operate in relation to the passage of this Bill, in so far as it applies to incest proceedings, do not apply in the case of the offences of <Col N="581" /> unlawful carnal knowledge of a girl under 15 or 17 years or the other offences I mentioned.  The provisions of section 23 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1951 allow the courts a general discretionary power in any criminal proceedings of an indecent or obscene nature to exclude all persons except officers of the court, bona fide representatives of the press and such other persons as the court may permit to remain. We are not talking about cases heard <i>in camera,</i> a problem which arises in incest cases.  In circumstances where it is not an offence to publish the name of a person in respect of whom an unlawful carnal knowledge offence has been committed, it is the invariable and well-established practice not to do so.  The Minister had discussions on that point with the national newspapers and has been assured that under no circumstances will they depart from their admirable policy of protecting the identity of under-age victims of sexual abuse.</P>
    <P>When I say that for these reasons the Minister does not want to extend the reporting arrangements provided for in the Bill to cases of unlawful carnal knowledge, I hope the House appreciates that she wishes to have the broader issue of the reporting of sexual offences comprehensively examined in a way which the urgent nature of this Bill does not allow.  Deputies will appreciate that there is a pressing need to enact the legislation at the earliest stage in light of the rulings of the Central Criminal Court which held that no details of an incest prosecution can be disclosed to any party.  The Minister indicated she will publish a consultation paper very quickly after enactment of the Bill and has undertaken to bring forward with minimum delay such proposals for law reform as may be required in this area.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donnell said she did not trust the Minister or her assurances and I regret the personal nature of some of her remarks.  They were unnecessary.  If she expects Deputies on this side of the House to accept what she says in good faith she should be prepared to reciprocate. On behalf of the Minister I give <Col N="582" /> the strongest possible assurance to the House that the issues raised by the amendment will be dealt with as a priority.  I hope Deputy O'Donoghue accepts that.</P>
    <P>The effect of the amendment would go considerably beyond the reporting arrangements which should apply in the case of sexual offences.  This is because certain specific consequences follow from the designation of an offence as a rape offence for the purposes of the rape Acts.  Section 8(2) of the Criminal Law (Rape) (Amendment) Act, 1990 provides that the provisions governing the protection of identity of a person charged with a rape offence can be lifted if the person is convicted.  This may well be the correct outcome in the case of an unlawful carnal knowledge offence but I am concerned that such a blanket mandatory provision may not be appropriate in all unlawful carnal knowledge cases and a more discretionary provision may be appropriate to ensure the identity of the victim is not revealed by identifying the offender.  An example might be where the offender is a member of the family but where incest is not involved or where the offender is a next door neighbour as in the X case. These broader issues can best be addressed in the context of the consultation paper.</P>
    <P>I regret I cannot accept the amendment but I hope that on the basis of the firm and clear commitment I have given to the House the Deputy will not press the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>My amendment is clear and simple.  I want the provisions of the Act to apply in circumstances where a person is a victim in a case of unlawful carnal knowledge, the legislative loophole to be closed and the criminal law to provide that the name and address of a girl under the age of 15 or 17 years who is the victim in a case of unlawful carnal knowledge may not be published either in the electronic or print media.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept the good faith and word of the Irish newspapers but some lurid <Col N="583" /> publication in the future could publish the name and address of a girl in those circumstances.  For example, if someone was well known in society a lurid publication could publish the fact that the person had been a victim of sexual abuse.  The Minister of State said the Minister would refer this to a commission. This is not the first commission the Minister for Justice has set up.  At this stage, after seven months in office, there are more commissions and committees in the Department of Justice than there were for the last decade. Everything appears to be long-fingered and sent to a committee of one kind or another.  Someone must shout &ldquo;stop&rdquo;.  If &ldquo;rape&rdquo; was construed as rape in the generally accepted meaning of the word I could appreciate where the Minister is coming from but a rape offence means any of the following: rape; attempted rape; burglary with intent to commit rape; aiding, abetting, counselling and procuring rape; incitement to rape; rape under section 4 of the 1990 Act; attempted rape under section 4; aiding, abetting, counselling and procuring rape under section 4 and incitement to rape under section 4.</P>
    <P>I do not understand why the amendment cannot be accepted.  I accept that the Minister wants to conduct a fundamental review but here is a positive proposal put forward in good faith to improve the criminal law and it is rejected on the basis that if the Minister cannot have the full loaf she will not eat any bread.  That is not the correct way to proceed.  It would be more desirable to accept the amendment than to reject it but the Minister has decided to include other offences and to oppose the amendment.  There is no great logic in her position.  The only conclusion I can reach is that the Minister for Justice has decided to bring forward at some unspecified date a package which will state when the names and addresses of victims may be reported.  I would be failing in my duty if I accepted that.</P>
    <P>The Minister accepted substantial amendments in the Seanad.  For the <Col N="584" /> most part they were taken from the Fianna Fáil Bill which I published.  It is ironic that the Minister will not accept a serious but less substantive amendment in the Dáil.  If the Bill had proceeded without the inclusion of the Fianna Fáil amendments in the Seanad it would not have been possible to publish details of evidence in an incest case.  It is of tremendous importance in incest cases that the details of the evidence, as opposed to the name, address and identity of the victim, are published.  It is of crucial importance to make the general public aware of the circumstances surrounding incest cases so that they are wary and alert of the possibility of such cases.  It will also alert people who might be thinking of deviancy to the fact that the penalties are harsh and fit the crime.</P>
    <P>I presume the Minister is not prepared to accept this amendment on carnal knowledge because it is in my name. However, that is a peripheral issue and I have no intention of being petty. Nevertheless, I am deeply concerned at the attitude of a Minister for Justice who will not accept positive measures put forward in the House and who does not put forward measures herself.  This is no way to run the Department of Justice, which I am well aware has some of the best draftsmen.  The time for procrastination and prevarication is over and I intend to put my amendment to a vote.  In rejecting the amendment the Minister is merely extending the legal vacuum and loophole in criminal law in regard to the publication of the names and addresses of young girls under the ages of 15 and 17 who are victims of this kind of offence.</P>
    <P>If the Bill did not deal with reporting restrictions and the Minister of State could give me the same excuse he gave Deputy O'Donnell for not accepting my amendment then I would have some small understanding of the Minister's motives.  However, the truth is that the Minister is rejecting this amendment which deals specifically with what the Bill is all about, namely the restrictions on reporting and the <Col N="585" /> terms on which reporting may take place, because it is in my name.  The sad and extraordinary conclusion I have come to is that the Minister for Justice will not accept any amendment not in <Col N="586" /> her name.  This is incredible and laughable and makes a nonsense of the workings of the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister intends not to comment on section 4, having upstaged the spokesperson for the Opposition on section 3 in a shoddy way, I will comment on this section and deal with the comment made on this <Col N="589" /> area by Deputy Shatter when the Bill was last discussed.  The Deputy said when this matter was discussed prior to 1986 when the referendum was held, I as Opposition spokesperson said the loss of social welfare rights which would occur would have a devastating effect on the forthcoming referendum.  Deputy Shatter pointed to that in the measures in sections 3 and 4.</P>
      <P>In saying that, I was referring to what occurred in Britain, where Lord Campbell said that having rushed through legislation on divorce he was horrified at the effects, because insufficient preparation had been made. Deputy Shatter said he agreed the changes should be made, as is happening in this Bill some nine years later. This indicates that the Opposition proposal at the time &mdash; that social welfare matters should be clarified before a referendum was held &mdash; was correct and is now accepted by the Government.</P>
      <P>When we spoke previously about this and the other sections, the Minister said the costs would amount to £1 million over the first five years.  There is some confusion about these figures.  They were not clarified the last day so I ask the Minister to be clear about the costings. He seems to know the position and have a reasonable estimate of the cost for the first five years.  As I understood it, he said it would accumulate to £1 million per year; in reply to another Deputy, who said that would be the cost, he did not deny it.  I ask the Minister to clarify whether after five years he expects the costings to be £1 million per year or is it an accumulation to £1 million, running at that rate after five years?  In that event we could at least be clear about the costings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said he needed more time to work out the costing by the tenth and fifteenth years.  Has he found more time in the interim and has he been able to estimate the costs at those points?  I find it extraordinary that the Minister, with the specialists and experts available to him in the Department of Social Welfare is not able to make these estimates at this time.  I can understand <Col N="590" /> he might have needed some time initially but he expected to have them by the time we spoke last on this Bill and I trust he will have them worked out at this stage.</P>
    <P>Section 4 deals with deserted wife's benefit and two issues arise.  One is that the Minister has not made any allowance or arrangement for equal treatment in this benefit.  Earlier in the year he said he expected to do so at this stage and to have it done in advance of the referendum.  In a press release on 19 February 1995 he stated his plans for a new lone parent's allowance, which would not involve a means test, the requirement to prove desertion being dispensed with, equal treatment between men and women for the first time in this area, and a reassurance to existing deserted wives who are working that there would not be a loss of income.</P>
    <P>There is not equal treatment in the deserted wife's benefit; men are not treated the same as women.  We are at an important juncture and are making major changes in our social welfare legislation.  In conjunction with those it is time to put those matters right.  They should be addressed and the Minister said he would do so at this time.  Will the Minister let us know about the issue of equal treatment in deserted wife's benefit and his promised removal of the desertion clause?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already dealt with all these points on the earlier sections of this Bill so I will give a brief resume of what I already said.  If there is any confusion about costings it is on the part of the Fianna Fáil spokespersons. I have made it clear that the cost in the fifth year will be £1 million. It is estimated&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely" hpid="Mr. Callely Mr. Callely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the additional cost?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course.  We are talking about extending rights to divorced persons in relation to survivor's pensions, occupational injuries benefit, FIS and prisoner's wife's <Col N="591" /> allowance.  The additional cost of extending these rights to divorced persons will be £1 million in the fifth year. I do not see where the confusion arises.</P>
      <P>I not only mentioned this information and gave the detail of how we constructed the estimate on the last day that this Bill was debated, I also dealt with the issue at Question Time.  Indeed, in reply to a parliamentary question from Deputy Walsh two weeks ago requesting costings for ten, 15, 25 and 30 years, I indicated that I did not have, at that point, the costing for a ten year period.  It would be impossible to predict the likely costs of any element of social welfare 20 or 30 years hence.</P>
      <P>I provided the information the last time that the estimated cost in the tenth year will be about £2 million &mdash; if we are saying that the cost will rise in the first five years to £1 million in the fifth year, one can guess that it will rise from that to £2 million in the tenth year. Obviously, that would depend on the rate of divorce, the rate of separation, the extent to which people remarrry after divorce and the extent to which women survive their former spouses, etc.</P>
      <P>I have made that clear throughout this debate, so I cannot understand how there can be any confusion on the part of any Member, specifically Deputy Woods, who dealt with this matter in the Department of Social Welfare up to mid-December 1994 and is well aware of the position in relation to costings.  I did not offer to get an estimate for a 15 year period because, to be quite honest, it would be unreal as there is no possible way that we can extend the figures concerned for a 15 year period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Equal treatment is also an issue with which I dealt repeatedly, both at Question Time and on Second and Committee Stages of this Bill.  I made it clear that, as Minister for Social Welfare, I will be introducing a unified lone parent's allowance which will be available to a parent living alone and is separated, deserted or divorced or single and caring for children.  It will no longer be <Col N="592" /> necessary to prove desertion, which is a very progressive development.</P>
    <P>I did not, at any time, say that that legislation would be passed by this time, as Deputy Woods implied.  I said we would be bringing forward legislation in the autumn-winter session of this House and implementing it in 1996.  The Deputy will appreciate that we have yet to sort out a range of other legislation in addition to that area.  The question of equal treatment of men and women has no specific bearing in relation to divorce. It should apply equally, even under the current situation where separation is the Irish form of divorce and, more particularly, demonstrates itself through desertion.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand the confusion which those on the Opposition benches claim exists.  I have clarified a number of times the issue of the lone parent's allowance and the need to provide for men as well as women caring for children.</P>
    <P>Deputy Callely said that the costings which I provided for five years were based on the 1991 CSO figures which showed in the region of 55,000 separated persons.  He estimated that there was in excess of 70,000 separated persons now, which is probably a fairly accurate assessment.  However, I indicated that even if we are 50 per cent off in our calculation, the cost will still only be £1.5 million in the fifth year.  In any event, there is no reason to believe that all people who separate or divorce are automatically entitled to social welfare on the second day of the divorce or separation. The statistics which I quoted in relation to the lone parent's allowance, separated people and those on deserted wife's allowance and benefit indicate that a significant proportion of those in the separated category are not in the social welfare net.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely" hpid="Mr. Callely Mr. Callely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for responding to my queries about the &ldquo;assumption&rdquo;, to use his own words, which he was using, and he referred quite <Col N="593" /> clearly to the 1991 CSO figures.  I welcome the fact that he clarified the figures and indicated that the difference would be only a 50 per cent increase in the amount.</P>
      <P>I also thank the Minister for forwarding to me the figures in relation to separated persons which I requested in the debate.</P>
      <P>To continue the line of the discussion on the last occasion, the real question is to clear up any underlying threat in relation to the financial aspects of this part of the Bill.  I appreciate that the figures which the Minister quoted are based on the 55,000 in the CSO figures and that he referred to the percentage who remarry, those outliving their spouse and so forth.  However, could he refer to the calculations of the number of dependants in the fifth year in this category?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>This issue of costings seems to be obsessing the Fianna Fáil Deputies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely" hpid="Mr. Callely Mr. Callely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a very important issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said, in this Bill we are providing for a situation where a couple divorce and one of the spouses remarries.  Therefore, they have a former spouse and an acutual spouse when they die and the first and second spouse will qualify for a survivor's pension, whether it is a man or a woman. Both will qualify for either a contributory or a non-contributory survivor's pension provided they remain unmarried and are not cohabiting.  Costs will only arise following the death of the remarried spouse.  While Members are surprised at how little the social welfare changes will cost, new rights are not being bestowed.  The purpose of the legislation is to protect the rights of spouses who may be divorced and whose spouse may subsequently remarry.  Widow's pension will account for approximatley 90 per cent of the cost although the figure is likely to be closer to 99 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="594" /> In relation to deserted wife's benefit no additional costs will arise as the person concerned will qualify for the new unified lone parent's allowance if they have children and their income is within a certain range.  The State is obliged to support such a family, even if divorce is not introduced.  The question of additional costs in respect of dependants does not therefore arise.</P>
    <P>Our estimate is based on the 1991 CSO figure of 55,000 separated persons, a divorce rate of approximately 80 per cent, a remarriage rate of approximately 50 per cent and a survival rate of approximately 80 per cent.  I fail to understand why Members opposite are obsessed with this issue of costs.  The position is plain.  It would be worthwhile, given that only a limited amount of time is available, to move on and discuss some of the real issues involved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has said that no additional costs will arise under this section as the families concerned will qualify for benefits regardless of whether divorce is introduced. Before we move on to deal with other issues the position should be made clear.</P>
      <P>It seems the Minister is of the opinion that not one extra marriage will break down following the introduction of divorce. That is where we differ.  He is working on the assumption that the statistics will not change.  Most people would contend, however, that following the introduction of divorce there is a great chance that marriages will break down.  The ethos of Irish people is that marriage is for life whereas a different approach tends to be adopted in California or the United Kingdom because of the availability of divorce.</P>
      <P>The Minister must accept that the statistics will change.  It is extraordinary that he is arguing that no additional costs will arise under this section.  Will he please clarify the matter?</P>

      <P>When we dealt with this Bill last week I explained that there had been a significant increase in marriage breakdown &mdash; I used the deserted wife's benefit as the yardstick &mdash; from about 4,000 in 1985 to 13,000 in 1995.  That is a significant increase in Irish terms but a tiny increase in UK or Californian terms.  I have no doubt marriage breakdown will continue and will probably occur at about the same rate. There is no reason to believe it will dramatically increase simply because a person may go to court and get a divorce instead of a separation.  Divorce enables a person to remarry and currently people are in limbo in that when they separate and enter a second relationship they cannot remarry.</P>
      <P>This Bill proposes to guarantee the social welfare rights of people who divorce. The cost is based on the current trend in separations as they appear on the books of the Department of Social Welfare, those taking up deserted wife's allowance, deserted wife's benefit and lone parent's allowance.  In the fifth year the cost will have reached £1 million extra per year and in the tenth the cost will have reached £2 million.  In the eleventh year there will be another slight increase in cost and so on for each year thereafter.  That cost is based not on predictions of social welfare or cost of living increases but on constant figures, which is the only way it can be based.  Since the figure for the fifth year, which includes the backlog of people who will apply for divorce, is £1 million and £2 million for the tenth year, that clearly indicates an expectation that marriage breakdown will continue more or less at the same rate as it has been occurring.</P>

      <P>We dealt with this matter in detail the last day.  I outlined the figures but the Minister could not understand them.  Since 10 per cent of £1 million is £100,000 and one-fifth of that is £20,000, taking an average of £5,000 per person, only four people will <Col N="599" /> receive payment.

      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>I can only base my figures on the minimal information the Minister is prepared to give.  We asked him this question in many ways but we cannot get an answer.  Based on the Minister's figure of £1 million and the fact that 90 per cent of the cost will cover the implementation of section 3, which means 10 per cent, or £100,000, covers the rest of the Bill, since the average social welfare payment is £5,000 per annum, the money will be divided between 20 people, or four people per annum.  If the Minister finds it difficult to understand that it is because he realises his figures do not stand up.</P>
      <P>The Minister said there will be no additional cost under section 4, but nobody believes that.  The best thing to do is pass the section and see what the people think of it.  It would help the public debate on this matter if the Minister was clear about it.  I am fed up asking the question and since the Minister is not giving an answer I will leave it at that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>I said on Second Stage that one of the reasons this problem has arisen is that the Minister did not produce a financial memorandum with the explanatory memorandum.  I put much blame on the Minister's shoulders for the fact that we are getting bogged down on this issue.  The reason Fianna Fáil does not accept the Minister's figures on these sections is that it believes that introducing divorce will open the <Col N="600" /> floodgates to divorce at will, a premise I do not accept.</P>
      <P>It is extraordinary that I do not agree with either side.  I accept the Minister's figures because I believe, as he does, that what we are talking about in terms of divorce is the right to remarry.  I listened very carefully to the Minister and he said his figures allow for the fact that a number of people are waiting in the hope that the divorce referendum will be passed so that they may get divorced. It appears from what the Minister said that, if on the introduction of divorce the incidence of marriage breakdown increases, there is a cushion against that. I may be wrong but I would like the Minister to clarify that matter.</P>
      <P>I am in favour of divorce because I see it as a right to remarry.  It gives a second chance to many people who are in an impossible position.  I do not accept the premise that divorce will result in a Californian culture here.  The position will be no different from that in Northern Ireland where the number applying for divorce did not mushroom into a colossal figure.  This is a false message.  Other people may have a different point of view and I have no problem with that but I do not accept that what we are talking about is some sort of divorce culture that will create a need for enormous sums of money in relation to those sections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to clarify something that is relevant to this debate and especially to what Deputy Keogh has just said.  Once divorce comes in, deserted wives or widows or widowers, even though divorced, will retain their benefits.  That is the purpose of sections 3 and 4.  All we are trying to establish from the Minister is how much this will cost.  The Committee Stage of a Bill is the time when we should get those costings, when in every section we should be told just what the cost is estimated to be.  That is done on a public service basis, not a political basis.  It is just the factual situation in so far as it is known. If these issues are not raised here they will be raised outside the House.  It <Col N="601" /> would be preferable to be very clear about costs.</P>
      <P>Deputy Wallace has said she finds it hard to see, particularly in regard to section 4, which relates to deserted wife's benefit, how the figures given by the Minister stand up because even a very small increase in the number of deserted wives will more than take up the amounts mentioned by the Minister. That was at year five.  The Minister has told us now that at year ten he expects it to be about £2 million a year extra, which is a relatively small amount of money, and when he is asked where he sees it at year 15 he says he does not know.  I find that hard to believe because there must be estimates and they should be available to the House. He has experts who, I am quite certain, are telling him that at year 15 the estimate is X and at year 20 the estimate is Y.  It is inconceivable that the officials of his Department would not be able to advise the Minister on these figures and provide the House with them.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>On section 4, I would like to ask the Minister the cost of providing equal treatment for deserted spouses in a full year.  This section does not provide for equal treatment.  The Minister is not proposing to make provision for equal treatment here at this time but says he may do so in the future.  We understood earlier in the year that this was the time <Col N="602" /> when he would do so and that this matter would be cleared up in advance of the referendum.  We have already equal treatment in the pensions of widows and widowers.</P>
    <P>This is the next area to receive equal treatment and those who are seeking it outside the House believed that some movement would take place in advance of the referendum.  The Minister has told us that he will not do so now but will do so later, possibly the end of the year or the beginning of next year.  I ask him to give us the costings of providing equal treatment and also the cost of removing the desertion clause.  Could the Minister give us those two figures on a full year basis?</P>

      <P>The major costs of marriage breakdown are with us in our society already and are provided for currently by way of our social welfare system.  The additional costs arising from divorce &mdash; I am sure the Minister or his Department would not claim to have calculated the figure to the final decimal point &mdash; are in the range indicated by the Minister.  There is nobody in our society who is not entitled to some form of social welfare payment if he or she does not have another income. This Bill proposes to provide them with an additional topped-up entitlement. We are ensuring that their entitlement arising from their married status will not be interfered with as a result of a divorce.</P>

      <P>We should accept these figures and tell the public that this measure will be provided at no great additional cost to society because sadly the major costs associated with marriage breakdown are already with us.  I do not accept that the introduction of divorce will lead to Californian-style numbers in terms of marriage breakdown and others have dealt with that point adequately.</P>
      <P>I hope that by the end of this Stage the largest Opposition party will accept also that these figures are correct.  I hope there will not be an attempt during the public debate on the forthcoming divorce referendum to suggest that divorce if introduced, will entail major additional social welfare costs and that it will be accepted that the major costs resulting from the high level of marriage breakdown are already with us.  We will have achieved something if we agree on that by the end of the debate, but I do not have great hopes in that regard.  This would assist the cause we all claim to serve, achieving a successful referendum which will allow some people to remarry.</P>

      <P>The Minister indicated there would be no additional cost incurred under section 4 and that the Bill proposes to put in place a structure to ensure that a spouse will not be disadvantaged in terms of his or her social welfare entitlements whether married, separated, deserted or divorced if divorce legislation is introduced.  It would be helpful to Members on this side of the House if the Minister clarified this matter.  Today he said that the cost involved in year five will be £1 million. When I questioned whether that figure would be an additional £1 million &mdash; as understood by most of us &mdash; he agreed it would.  On Second Stage the Minister said it is likely that the cost will rise to £1 million over the next five years.  We need to clarify whether the figure is the cost in year five or the cost over five years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="605" /> The Minister is recorded as participating frequently in debates.  As an Opposition spokesperson speaking for The Workers' Party to the 1992 budget, he demanded that the living standards for those dependent on social welfare should be improved.  In 1993 he said the only thing that will give dignity to those on social welfare is an adequate income. In 1994 he set out in a document an integrated approach which would significantly increase social welfare levels. In 1995 as Minister for Social Welfare, he referred to the levels of social welfare increases as huge amounts of money by any standard.  The Minister has not adequately addressed the issue of payments for those already dependent on social welfare and new dependants. Will he indicate how he calculated the figure of £1 million and whether it will be the cost in year five or over five years?</P>
    <P>People have told me that they are disappointed by the stance taken by the Minister in Government as opposed to that taken by him in Opposition.  I am sure he is familiar with a recent newspaper article in the <i>Star</i> which indicated that for all he said in Opposition about living standards and the need for an adequate income and in 1992 his criticism of the then Minister for Social Welfare for giving a £3 per week social welfare increase, the £1.50 increase in benefit he gave to old age pensioners would not buy a packet of rashers.</P>

I asked that question at the beginning of the debate and I would have welcomed an answer at that stage rather than having to <Col N="606" /> return to it now.  How did the Minister calculate that figure and how does his figures tally with the amounts to which he has referred?  He indicated earlier that his figure may be out by 50 per cent.</P>

The estimated cost of this measure is based on the CSO figure of 55,000 separated persons in 1991.  We can do no more than make an assumption.  It is assumed that approximately 75 per cent of those people may remarry, but perhaps only 50 per cent will do so.  Seventy-five per cent is a high estimate but that is the predicted figure.  We also predict that 50 per cent of those who avail of divorce will remarry and that 80 per cent of women will outlive their former spouses.  It is not possible to accurately <Col N="607" /> predict social welfare increases over the next ten or 20 years.  I intend to increase social welfare rates and I am sure if Fianna Fáil was in Government it would wish to do likewise.  For the purpose of calculating the cost of implementing the provisions of this Bill, we must make certain estimates.  Based on our estimates the cost in the fifth year will be £1 million.</P>

      <P>If Deputies wish they can do a simple sum and divide £1 million by five and take it that there might be a cost of £100,000 in the first year, £150,000 in the second year, £200,000 in the third year and so on.  In order to give a round figure, in the fifth year the additional cost added to what is already being paid to widows, widowers, lone parents and deserted wives will be £1 million.  This year we will pay out £630 million to survivors, lone parents and deserted wives.  We are talking about an additional £1 million by the time we reach the fifth year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To satisfy the curiosity of Deputies opposite, we tried to estimate the cost for the following five years and at most the cost would be £2 million in the tenth year and something in excess of that figure in the following years.  The marriage breakdown rate may level off, it will not increase exponentially forever.  The rates may not have levelled off in California or the United Kingdom but they have levelled off in countries with a similar ethos to us.  As Deputy Keogh stated we should consider the position in Northern Ireland.  I appeal to Deputies to avoid the temptation to muddy the waters on this issue.  It is too serious an issue to attempt to mislead the public into believing that the figures we are putting forward are inaccurate or <Col N="608" /> uncertain.  They are as certain as any social welfare predictions.</P>
    <P>The estimates I suggest are not new to the Fianna Fáil Party which was in Government until mid-December last. The Fianna Fáil Party had a Minister for Social Welfare until last December and the figures I put forward were as clear to him as they are to me.  The experts who advise me advised him when he presented his memorandum to Government on 7 March 1994.  I am not putting forward figures that were not known to Deputy Woods when he was Minister for Social Welfare.  I appeal to Deputies opposite to stop muddying the waters and discuss the substantive issues of the Bill which are important for people outside, and perhaps inside, this House who are currently in broken or second relationships and want the right to remarry.  We must bear in mind that the more people who remarry the less cost will be involved.  Divorce will provide the right to remarry.  We have already put in place the necessary legislation to protect people's rights in regard to property, family and so on in the case of separations.  The State provides a plethora of protections for people whose marriages have broken down, but it has not yet given them the right to remarry. This Bill will protect social welfare recipients who divorce and, more importantly, it will protect their children.</P>
    <P>Irrespective of what term we use &mdash; deserted wife's benefit, deserted spouse's benefit or lone parent's allowance &mdash; the allowance will be paid to only one person, one half of the broken family.  The person caring for the children will receive an allowance which will be payable irrespective of divorce. Fianna Fáil members appear to be confused in this regard.  Under section 4 we guarantee that following a divorce a person who previously qualified for a deserted wife's allowance or deserted spouse's allowance may continue to be regarded as deserted for the purpose of the social welfare code.  An additional cost will not be involved.</P>
    <P>Deputy Woods requested information <Col N="609" /> on the cost of introducing equality in regard to lone parent's allowance for men and women.  I do not propose to start a debate on the lone parent's allowance scheme.</P>

      <P>On a point of order, I understand that, as a Member of this House on Committee Stage of a Bill, I am entitled to ask the Minister the cost of providing equal treatment under this <Col N="610" /> section, which provides that a deserted wife who becomes divorced will continue to be regarded as a deserted wife for the purposes of deserted wife's benefit.  What would be the cost of including deserted men as well?  That is the simple question I asked the Minister. It has been the tradition in this House that the Minister would inform Members of the cost.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the Minister's last remarks, we have witnessed a display of arrogance and ignorance in this House which, while perhaps not surprising, is certainly unprecedented. Deputy Joe Walsh, having been requested to ascertain whether he could return here by 9 p.m. this evening, subsequently was asked whether he could return by 5 o'clock and arrived at approximately 5.5 p.m., at which time the Minister had done a quick trick to jump on a section of this Bill, when the vote had just been completed, when the Progressive Democrats had not returned, and Members on this side were just coming back into the House.  I want to keep the record clear on that.</P>
      <P>The Minister has stoutly refused to give us information about his proposals in relation to this section, which is quite extraordinary.  If that is the kind of arrogance we can expect from this Government in future, whether this House can continue to function as a democratic forum becomes questionable.  It is not the prerogative of a Minister to inform the House of the information on his files, when he chooses, at some future date.  Not so long ago there was a great row here about Ministers not having given information they should have had at the time, whereas this is a matter of a Minister who had information but refused point blank to provide it on Committee Stage of a Bill, which is totally unprecedented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask that this be considered by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges <Col N="614" /> because Members' privileges are being totally scorned by this Minister.  If that is the manner in which questions are to be dealt with in future, we face a very serious erosion of democracy in this House.  It is also a matter the Taoiseach must consider very seriously because if Ministers are to obfuscate and conceal information deliberately and knowingly, as this Minister has done, it would represent the cessation of any transparency or democracy.  That point must be made. The Ceann Comhairle should formally refer this matter to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely" hpid="Mr. Callely Mr. Callely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>I am also concerned about the manner in which this area of the Bill has been responded to in the House.  I echo the sentiments expressed by my colleague, Deputy Woods.  When in Opposition, Deputy De Rossa always spoke about his concern for less well off people and those in receipt of social welfare benefits.  The statements made by him this year as Minister and his contributions in the past are as different as chalk from cheese.  He let down many social welfare recipients who were aware of his previous statements.  Some of those people have told me they believe the Minister for Social Welfare is a fraud and that he has not been open or accountable.  That was evident tonight and it is right that people like myself pose these questions.  The issues have been clouded but not by anyone on this side of the House.  I regret this is the way the debate on this section has to conclude.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to this section, the Minister referred to a Government memorandum of March 1994 and the proposals contained therein.  I intended raising this matter at a later stage but since the Minister introduced it I will deal with it now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Second Stage, I stated that the <Col N="615" /> Bill met only the basic minimum requirements for holding a referendum, that it was neither imaginative nor progressive and that it was narrow and restrictive as evidenced by the fact that the costings turned out to be so low.  At the time the Bill seemed to be consistent with the Government's thinking in relation to current cutbacks in this area and it was barely adequate to meet the requirements for the projected divorce jurisdiction and impending referendum.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to my proposals at that time which were much more wide-ranging than those contained in the Bill.  I wanted to address the issue of individual rights for women and I believed that was the time to do so.  We should have begun &mdash; even on a phased basis &mdash; to resolve the position of women.  However, while we were facing major changes in our legislation to meet the requirements for a divorce jurisdiction &mdash; I realise people object to the term &ldquo;divorce jurisdiction&rdquo; but I use it for the sake of simplicity &mdash; we should have provided for changes to support and promote the family and women who work in the home.  We should have provided them with options in the social welfare code to enable them to spend some time at home and some time in the workplace.  That is what was contained in the memorandum.  I realise the cost of such measures would have been quite high but I wanted to see real progress made in regard to, for example, the position of young women starting out in the workforce.  I wanted homemakers to receive independent payments and young women joining the workforce should have the option of time out. There has been one development in that area to date and I felt it was time to introduce equal treatment for women and to tackle all the other relevant problems, even in a phased way.</P>
    <P>Anomalies will arise as a result of the Bill which will affect women over the age of 66.  If a woman is divorced or deserted, she will receive the full rate of payment on an individual basis.  That is right because we must protect those <Col N="616" /> women, but what about women over the age of 66 who are regarded as adult dependants?  They too have feelings, they are part of our society and have made a contribution through their work in the home and in the community over the years.  Such women should have been covered by the provisions in the Bill and their rate of payment increased to at least the rate paid to widows and deserted wives.  Such payments could be spread over a number of years.  We have an opportunity to do that now but it is not being taken, and those of us on this side of the House cannot table amendments to that effect because they are ruled out of order by the Chair on the basis that they will impose a cost on the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>Contrary to what Deputy Keogh believed, my thinking on this issue was much broader.  I felt we should have proceeded with a divorce referendum and do what should have been done before 1986, but people took the view this would have been a great liberal jump.  However, the public calculated the benefits they might lose if divorce were introduced, which would have included the deserted wife's benefit, the widow's pension and other benefits.  An opportunity existed to go a little further in this Bill but it was not taken.</P>
    <P>I intended raising this matter under section 10 which deals with the increases for adult dependants.  However, that will not be necessary now since the Minister introduced it to the debate.  We should take a much wider approach to this problem.  I do not want to criticise what the Minister is doing although it is barely adequate.  That is borne out by his statement that this will cost only £1 million in the fifth year and £2 million in the tenth.</P>
    <P>If we were to tackle the problem more broadly, it would obviously cost more, but we should provide for that expenditure now.  On equal treatment, in the context of deserted wife's benefit, there are men outside this House who want to know why they do not get equal treatment.  It is extraordinary that a Minister who never stopped talking <Col N="617" /> about equal treatment when he was on this side of the House now refuses to discuss it and tells us we should wait until some time in the future.</P>
    <P>I am happy to see the Bill pass.  Its measures meet the minimum requirements, but they are not generous, imaginative or progressive and they do not develop the social welfare code to meet the new situation.  That is what was in the memorandum to which the Minister referred.  I am not used to referring to Government memoranda in the House; it was the Minister who introduced the subject, but there was more in it than the Minister said and at least it was an effort to make progress.  What is being done here is certainly the minimum and we welcome and support that.</P>
    <P>I am sorry that some Deputies have, from time to time, almost suggested that we were not supporting this measure. The problem is that the time to debate it is so limited.  On Committee Stage, the Opposition is entitled to be given the whole picture and to be told of the possibilities in regard to any section.  It is in such debate that that information should be forthcoming.  No Minister for Social Welfare has acted as this Minister has today.  Any Minister for Social Welfare would have answered the questions put on Committee Stage and given the Opposition the information requested. Unfortunately, the replies to parliamentary questions are similarly evasive.  I am sorry to have to say that that indicates a drop in the traditional standard in this House.</P>
    <P>On equality, law reform, the divorce referendum and so on, these sections provide the minimum necessary to ensure that nobody who is in receipt of a benefit will lose, such as, deserted wife's benefit or widow's or survivor's pension.</P>

      <P>I had hoped we were winding up on this section and I have no wish to prolong the debate on it.  I sat through some of the earlier exchanges in this debate with the Minister, Deputy De Rossa, and was <Col N="618" /> greatly disappointed at the level of discussion. Many of the people who will be dependent on this legislation and are looking forward to its passage through the Houses will be greatly disappointed also at the level of debate.</P>
      <P>Simply, the Bill seeks to provide for the continuation of certain social welfare entitlements if divorce is permitted. There are many amendments to the Bill and we are still debating section 4.  It is unhelpful to have a prolonged debate on any section while there are amendments, particularly those in Deputies' names, to be considered.</P>

      <P>It is extraordinary that the Minister of State does not have the costing for a provision.  The Minister advised us earlier that the costing was £1 million, 90 per cent of which would be spent on implementing section 3 and that there was no additional cost in regard to section 4.  We are dealing with section 5 and I cannot believe the House is carrying on in this way.  My question is simple: will there be any additional cost and what is it?  We <Col N="619" /> should be able to get that information on Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>I understand the costing is very small.  It is fair to say that we are dealing with estimates, and the Minister earlier gave an overall estimate of the cost of implementing the provisions of this Bill.  Any Member will accept that the cost is relatively low.  It is acknowledged that the cost is based on an estimate and, as the Minister indicated, even if his estimate were out by 50 per cent, the additional cost would still be relatively low.  It is essential to bear in mind that we are talking about a net figure. This relates to costings arising post divorce referendum in respect of people who are in receipt of payments.</P>

      <P>Sections 152 (4) and 155 <Col N="621" /> (4) of the Principal Act, inserted in sections 6 and 7 of the Bill, provide that deserted wife's allowance and prisoner's wife's allowance will not be payable to a woman for any period after her remarriage. Amendments Nos. 2 and 4 have the same effect in that they provide that such payments will cease as and from the woman's remarriage.  While the proposed amendments do not alter the substance of the Bill they are consistent with the text of an equivalent provision on deserted wife's benefit in section 4.  I am prepared to accept the amendments subject to Deputies Wallace and Walsh agreeing to two technical changes.  The word &ldquo;benefit&rdquo; in both amendments should be replaced by the word &ldquo;allowance&rdquo;. This is necessary as the payments in question are deserted wife's allowance and prisoner's wife's allowance. The words &ldquo;subject to this Chapter&rdquo; should be inserted in amendment No. 4 after the words &ldquo;a prisoner's wife's allowance shall&rdquo;.  Amendment No. 2 would then read &ldquo;a deserted wife's allowance shall, subject to this Chapter, continue to be payable to a woman unless she remarries and in such a case the allowance shall cease as and from her remarriage.&rdquo;.  Amendment No. 4 would read &ldquo;a prisoner's wife's allowance shall, subject to this Chapter, continue to be payable to a woman unless she remarries and in such a case the allowance shall cease as and from her remarriage&rdquo;.  Subject to the Deputies agreeing to accept these changes I am prepared to accept amendments Nos. 2 and 4.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">

Deputy Keogh's amendment provides that the spouse being maintained would have to be in receipt of a regular payment of money on foot of a court order or maintenance agreement.  This gives rise to a practical difficulty in that not all maintenance is paid on the basis of a court order or maintenance agreement.</P>
      <P>The amendment proposed by Deputies Wallace and Walsh provides that the spouse being maintained would have to be in receipt of a regular transfer of income.  The amendments are unnecessary in that section 10 (3) of the Bill contains regulatory powers to determine the circumstances in which a person is to be regarded as wholly or mainly maintaining another person. These powers will apply to all social welfare payments, including family income supplement.  In view of these provisions I oppose the amendments.</P>

    <P>The following motion was moved by Deputy O'Donoghue on Tuesday, 27 June 1995:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann deplores the short-sighted decision of the Government to halt the provision of additional prison spaces at Castlerea as well as the building of a women's prison in Dublin in view of vandalism on the rampage, the spiralling escalation of serious crime, particularly in Dublin, as well as the need to relieve prison overcrowding and provide modern, humane conditions conducive to the prevention of re-offending, as called for by the Mountjoy Visiting Committee and on which action was promised by the Minister for Justice, and calls on the Government to take a number of co-ordinated measures to deal with crime, including:</P>
    <P>&mdash; the immediate reinstatement of the prison building in Castlerea and the women's prison in Dublin and the finding of the necessary economies in public expenditure elsewhere;</P>
    <P>&mdash; proceeding with a special detention unit for drug addicts and measures to stop the free circulation of drugs within prison;</P>
    <P>&mdash; the formulation of a constitutional amendment on the law of bail; and</P>
    <P>&mdash; the bringing forward of legislation to streamline criminal procedures.</P>
    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 1:</P>
    <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    <P>Dáil Éireann</P>
    <P>&mdash;  welcomes the setting up of an <Col N="625" /> inter-departmental committee to review all aspects of the prison project for Castlerea, County Roscommon, taking into account the social and economic impact on Castlerea and the surrounding area and the need to identify and prioritise measures to address such impact;</P>
    <P>&mdash;  notes that the inter-departmental committee will involve formal input from the Castlerea Development Co-operative Society Ltd.;</P>
    <P>&mdash;  notes that the inter-departmental committee will report by end December, 1995, and that there is a commitment to bring the recommendations of the committee to Government without delay;</P>
    <P>&mdash;  recognises the need, at this time, to examine the State's overall offender management structures and capacity against the background of developments taking place in relation to juvenile justice and the impact of the peace process;</P>
    <P>&mdash;  notes that the Government, in deciding to defer the Castlerea prison and the women's prison projects, also decided to conduct a full-scale review of offender treatment options generally, including the wider use of community sanctions and measures as recommended by the 1985 Whitaker Report and more recently in the Prisons Five Year Plan;</P>
    <P>&mdash;  welcomes the measures being taken to prevent drugs being smuggled into our prisons and the provision of treatment programmes within our prisons for those prisoners suffering from drug addiction;</P>
    <P>&mdash; welcomes the opportunity the peace process presents for reduction in security commitments in favour of greater concentration of Garda and other resources in <Col N="626" /> tackling organised and drug-related crime; and</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Donoghue rightly pointed out that people walk in fear of crime on the streets of every city, town and village. Reference is constantly made at meetings to the spiralling rise in crime, a crime wave which has gained frightening momentum.  The public commends Deputy John O'Donoghue and the Fianna Fáil Front Bench on their initiatives in the administration of justice.  In his concluding remarks Deputy O'Donoghue referred to the legislative measures he has brought before the <Col N="627" /> House.  We have now reached the position where more criminal justice legislation has been prepared by Fianna Fáil, the main Opposition party, than by the Minister for Justice.</P>
    <P>The Government's lack of progress in this area reflects its removal from reality and from the serious concerns of citizens. The fact that the main Opposition party has brought forward so much legislation in this area speaks volumes and shows that Fianna Fáil is determined to tackle the issues which afflict people in every city, town, village and parish.  It must be the aim of the Legislature to make our streets safe and Legislation which will make life more tolerable for the vast majority of people must not be voted down in the House. Citizens have the basic right to be safe in their homes and on the streets while going about their everyday business. There is now a widespread public perception that criminals have all the rights and that the rights of victims are practically non-existent.</P>
    <P>Crime is prevalent in every parish. Last week's edition of my local newspaper, <i>The Anglo-Celt,</i> carried a front page report on vandalism, robberies and the desecration of a graveyard.  This is a stark reminder that people cannot even have their dignity preserved in their final resting place.  Provincial newspapers carry weekly reports on crimes against people and property.  In his Criminal Law (Bail) Bill, 1995, Deputy O'Donoghue made a fair and honest attempt to curtail the ability of people to commit further crime while on bail. The number of such crimes is a cause of further worry for citizens who have suffered serious personal injury or had their property damaged.  The demand for the urgent reform of our bail laws has widespread support among the public.</P>
    <P>The drugs problem is a cancer which is eating away at the heart of our society and destroying the lives of thousands of young people.  Regardless of who they are, people who push drugs on young people are the greatest scourge in the <Col N="628" /> community and deserve appropriate punishment.  To allow them to continue destroying the lives of many of our young people is to inflict serious damage on society in both the short and longer term.  It is outrageous in the midst of a crime wave that the Government should decide not to proceed with the provision of much needed prison places.</P>
    <P>If the Government is serious about solving the escalating crime problem then decisions and measures must be taken to eradicate the growing drugs problem.  One problem feeds off another and multiplies, leaving nothing but devastation in its wake.  Effective punishment must be meted out to those who peddle drugs to young people, destroying their lives and those of their families.  We should be up front and honest about the problem.  Ordinary people on the streets know who the drug pushers are, yet they are allowed to walk around the streets and push their lethal goods on young people.  We cannot tolerate this situation any longer and the Garda must be given the power and resources they need to take these so-called human beings off our streets and out of the community for good.  The message which must go out from this House is that drug pushing does not pay and that those who engage in such activities will be treated with the utmost severity.  It is incumbent on the Government to send out the proper signals in this regard and to ensure that those who commit crime against people and property will not be allowed to walk our streets because of a lack of prison places.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely" hpid="Mr. Callely Mr. Callely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>This motion deals with a matter of such grave importance that it is difficult to know where to begin.  It refers to the Castlerea prison project, the building of a women's prison in Dublin, the escalation of serious crime, particularly in Dublin, and the need to relieve prison overcrowding and to provide modern, humane conditions in detention centres.  It also calls for the immediate reinstatement of the <Col N="629" /> Castlerea prison project, the establishment of a special detention unit for drug addicts and measures to stop the free circulation of drugs within prison, the formulation of a constitutional amendment on the law of bail and the introduction of legislation to streamline criminal procedures.  I am bitterly disappointed that the Government's amendment proposes to delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; in the motion.  This gives a clear message that the Minister does not want to know about the escalation in serious crime in Dublin and elsewhere, the need to provide more places in detention centres or to set up a special detention unit for drug addicts.</P>
      <P>It is despicable that the Government's amendment begins by stating that Dáil Éireann welcomes the setting up of yet another committee to review all aspects of the Castlerea prison project, taking into account the social and economic impact on the area.  In reply to a parliamentary question from me in March 1994 about the increase in drug-related activities in the Dublin area the then Minister for Justice gave a detailed response on how she proposed to deal with this problem.</P>
      <P>Another question asks the Minister how she intends to address drug related crime.  This is an issue on which one could spend much time and debate but, unfortunately, I do not have sufficient time to go into detail.  The Minister came along with a glossy report on drug related crime.  She intended to bring to Government as soon as possible proposals designed to identify the best arrangements for achieving a cohesive and co-ordinated response to drug trafficking but she did not address the problem of drug related crime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also asked the Minister if she would clarify her commitment to provide the Garda Síochána with the necessary resources to deal effectively with serious, organised and violent crime, the measures she was considering and the submissions and requests she had received on this matter.  Again the Minister gave a detailed reply but none of <Col N="630" /> the measures she outlined has been implemented.</P>
    <P>On the occasion of my visit to Mountjoy Prison I was appalled to find that drugs were freely available.  I collected whatever information I could from the prisoners and reported it to the governor who said he would take draconian measures to address the drugs problem in the prison.  I tabled a question to the Minister on this issue and I was disappointed with the response which was similar to the governor's.</P>
    <P>In opening the debate Deputy O'Donoghue said old people spend sleepless nights in fear of intruders; that in every house parents are increasingly and justifiably in fear of the free availability of drugs; on every street of every town and village people walk in fear of crime.  He went on to indicate the level of violence in shops and said that £10 million had been spent on security equipment to protect personnel and to discourage attack, that £11 million had been lost in cash, goods and damaged property from retail outlets and that there have been 3,800 detected drug offences.  He stated we are experiencing a crime wave, unlike anything we had seen previously.  I urge the Minister to grasp the nettle on this issue and ensure that the punishment fits the crime.  The culture that those involved believe that the punishment does not fit the crime is spreading rapidly.  We need to introduce appropriate and radical measures to the issue of crime in society today.  There are many suggestions from various interest groups in society on how to address the broad issue of crime.</P>
    <P>I regret we do not have sufficient time in which to debate this issue.  In relation to crime across the broader spectrum of our community we need to ensure that the punishment fits the crime.  We must take additional radical measures and an innovative approach addressing drug related crime.  Somebody will have to be strong enough to address the problem.</P>
    <P>A paragraph from the report, `Violence in Shops', states:</P>
    <P>What is especially starting now is <Col N="631" /> that the nature of theft has changed. It is no longer the quick snatch at the till or the break in late at night when the shop is closed.  Theft is now extremely violent, sometimes carefully planned, often drug induced without any heed to the safety of persons or property.  Unless concrete action is taken immediately, the situation will deteriorate even further.  It will also prompt retailers in desperation to place themselves at greater risk by taking action to defend themselves. This would be a sad reflection on our political and judicial systems.</P>

      <P>The motion and the amendment are cold comfort to the 150 people who thought they would be working in Castlerea prison who have been told that the work will not be there but that the Government will set up a committee to review the situation.  It is further cold comfort to be told that there will be formal contact between the new committee and Castlerea Development Co-operative Society Limited who will have a voice in the decision-making process.  I can tell the Minister, or anyone who cares to listen, that the decision <Col N="632" /> of the Castlerea Development Co-operative Society Limited will be that work should recommence on the completion of the prison in Castlerea forthwith. There will be no need to devote any further time to worrying about that aspect.  This is a case of the cart being put before the horse.</P>
      <P>Two and a half years ago the then Government decided that one of the best ways of fighting crime was to provide extra prison places.  In June 1994 the first sod was turned on the foundation of the perimeter wall and 12 months later the plug was pulled.  A Government Minister made a most unkind remark about the people of Castlerea to the effect that they must have reached an all time low when they rely on the provision of a prison to keep their spirits high.  It is easy for a person in a good position to be critical of people who are less fortunate and perhaps unemployed.  The people around Castlerea have three options: to go on the dole, to emigrate or to try for work that might be available at home.</P>
      <P>Any person who has ever embarked on that God forsaken boat trip to London and other cities throughout the world knows that at least 95 per cent of those who emigrate would willingly come home and remain at home if they could find work but that has been denied to the people of Roscommon.  In the past Roscommon lost some jobs. That was not under a particular Government, all parties governed during such periods.  The waste of money in Castlerea is a disgrace.  In private enterprise, anyone who caused his employer to lose £1.25 million would soon be handed his cards.  There is only one way any self-respecting Member of this House can vote this evening &mdash; that is in favour of the motion.</P>

      <P>As one closely affected by this motion I welcome the opportunity to speak to it.  I also welcome the amendment and I hoped my colleague, Deputy Foxe would say a Deputy from the area should vote for it.  The amendment states the House welcomes the setting up of an interdepartmental committee to review all aspects of the prison project for Castlerea, and there is a commitment to bring the recommendations of the committee to Government without delay.  It is a unique decision for a Government to bring the focus of so many major Departments to bear on this problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the building of this prison and do not agree with the decision to defer it.  We have said for a long time that the penal system needs more prison places but I do not accept the hypocrisy from across the floor. Since Fianna Fáil went into office in 1987, serious crime has increased at least fivefold.  There were 100,000 serious indictable offences last year; it was barely half that figure in 1987 &mdash; that is how far this has become out of hand.  It is somewhat rich to hear Opposition spokespersons mentioning the need for more prison places and a tougher fight against criminals.  Their record in that area has been abysmal. We need prison places whether they are provided in Castlerea or elsewhere.  It has been stated that 700 people who are out of prison ought to be inside, but have been prematurely released because there are not enough places in the prison system.  This started under Deputy Callely's party.  Many of those people are re-offending, which is an absolute scandal.  Between £1.2 million and £1.3 million has been spent on the construction of the wall in Castlerea and as a radio reporter said this morning, it is hideously ugly to look at although the building itself is very good aesthetically. In addition, it is often forgotten that the Western Health Board received £3.2 <Col N="634" /> million as a special allocation from the Department of Health to provide alternative facilities for the patients and staff in St. Patrick's Hospital.  It had to buy a local hotel and a number of houses to be used as day care centres, not alone in Castlerea but in Boyle, Ballaghaderreen and Strokestown.  The health board also had to purchase a site for a training centre outside the grounds of St. Patrick's Hospital where there already was an excellent centre.  The level of public spending on this project to date is of the order of £5 million and there can be no going back.</P>
      <P>The first paragraph of the amendment to the motion welcomes the establishment of an interdepartmental committee to consider all aspects of the Castlerea prison project.  There may be up to five Government Departments involved in this review but the main focus must be on the prison and the provision of places.  As a person who represents the area, I think we have gone too far to go back; I do not believe we will do so but I must utter the words of warning.  It must be completed.  We find ourselves in this confusion partly because when the Department of Justice made this decision over a year ago, it did not say what type of prison this would be or what type of prisoner it would accommodate.  In one statement by the Minister it was called a high security prison; in another by a member of the Government it was said it would be a medium security or a juvenile prison.  We need time to sort out what kind of prison it will be &mdash; whether it will be open or semi-open, or for juveniles, or high security, etc.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>The focus must be on establishing the prison.  I am glad the committee will have a broader remit to look at the economic problems of Castlerea, which has suffered more than most towns and urban areas in recent years.  The last census, published in <Col N="635" /> 1991, covers the inter-censal period 1986 to 1991; for most of those years Fianna Fáil was in office.  The population of that region fell by 9 per cent in that time, which was probably the greatest level of reduction of any part of the country.</P>
      <P>In 1982 there were 125 industrial jobs in Castlerea; by 1988 there were only 20, such was the effect of the recession on the town.  There was also the proposed closure of St. Patrick's psychiatric hospital, which did not occur until now. In 1986 over 300 people worked in that hospital, which was the major employer in the area.  Like all State employment, it was well paid and secure.  Naturally, it had an economic effect in the surrounding region.  The dispersal of the services around the county and the removal of two-thirds of them from Castlerea, on top of the loss of over 100 industrial jobs, had a huge adverse effect.</P>
      <P>It was a long time before there was a response, but I acknowledge that the previous Government agreed to put decentralised Government employment in the town.  It was not the most attractive form of decentralisation, perhaps the one type most other areas would not want.  However, since Castlerea had been driven so far down the economic spiral it was glad to accept these jobs.  It was willing to take a prison despite the problems which would attend upon it. The town was glad of it and welcomed it with open arms.</P>
      <P>The Government had to be pleased about that because if it had placed a prison anywhere else it would have run into a storm of protest.  In Castlerea, it was the opposite.  The prison was seen by the people as giving an economic lifeline to the area.  For that reason it must not be stopped and must be seen through to completion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appeal to the Castlerea Development Co-operative Society, which has done much good work on this project to make an input to this interdepartmental committee.  It is being given an opportunity to put its case to the heads of five of the most important Departments who <Col N="636" /> have a major impact on social and economic affairs.  I appeal to it to sit on the committee because it can have an influence there.  This committee must report by 31 December and if its findings and deliberations have financial consequences, that will be reflected in the 1996 budget.  It is important that the committee is given every chance to operate and, above all, that the area most affected is represented.  Nobody can put the case for the area better than local representatives.</P>
    <P>The Transfer of Sentenced Persons Bill is very important legislation.  It means that Irish persons serving sentences abroad can be transferred to serve their sentences in Ireland, as long as the authorities in the host country are willing to transfer them.  It has been estimated that might mean 250 additional prisoners in this country within two years.</P>
    <P>We are also proposing a referendum, which I support, to reform the bail laws, which have been a great source of complaint. Their abuse is a disgrace and thousands of people are being allowed out on bail to reoffend when they ought to be in captivity.  If we reform the bail laws and enact the necessary legislation we will, of course, create a situation where many people who are now out on bail will have to be kept incarcerated putting further pressure on prison spaces.  The case is unanswerable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Deputy Connor, when I heard that Castlerea was getting a prison, while I did not exactly throw my hat in the air and say that it was what Castlerea wanted, I agreed with it for two reasons.  One was the overall national reason that we appear not to have enough prison spaces. Everybody dealing with crime tells me that this is the case and I believe it is true.  The other reason was it needs an injection of spending power.  My constituency is very close to Castlerea and I know a fair amount about what is happening there.  I do not have to tell this <Col N="637" /> House that prosperity leads to population stability, which is the most desirable aim in the west.</P>
      <P>Any Government, particularly this one, has a responsibility to control public spending.  The irony is that on the day the Government decided that the public finances were out of kilter and had to be controlled, the Leader of the Opposition was in Cork shouting at the top of his voice that the Government had lost control of public expenditure.</P>

I was at another public meeting when 800 people lost their jobs in Digital in Galway a few years ago and she was one of a number of Ministers who failed to turn up in her own city.</P>
      <P>I find it very difficult to accept the crocodile tears shed by the Opposition over what is happening in Castlerea.  I will nail my colours to the mast and say that I hope that the new assessment will ensure that this project will recommence in Castlerea.  I am not sure what sort of a prison it will be.  However, the people of Dublin cannot tell me that there is a need for a prison or that it is not the right place.  I do not hear any criticism of the open prison at Loughan House, County Cavan, which is much more isolated than Castlerea.</P>
      <P>Like every household, when it comes to watching how money is spent it is good government to keep our public finances in order.  However, the need for checks and balances does not mean that worthwhile projects which have been shelved could not be reactivated in the near future.</P>

      <P>If Fianna Fáil really believes that Government inaction is responsible for a substantial proportion of the crime committed, then its motion is an admission of failure on its part.  It is a confession that Fianna Fáil failed to build a women's prison in Dublin; to proceed with a special detention unit for drug addicts; to take measures to stop the free circulation of drugs within prisons; to formulate a constitutional amendment to the laws on bail and to bring forward provisions to streamline criminal procedures.  Repentance and confession are probably good for the soul but I do not think that this House should have its time wasted by public breast beating of this kind, and by public flagellation of Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn by her Fianna Fáil colleagues.</P>
      <P>Much has been said about the wall at Castlerea.  Deputy O'Donoghue does not seem to remember that for a substantial part of the period of seven years Fianna Fáil was in power between 1987 and 1994 there was only a wall at Wheatfield in Dublin and stage two of that prison did not proceed.  It is calling for the reinstatement of the prison building project at Castlerea and the women's prison project in Dublin and the finding of the necessary economies elsewhere.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Donoghue said that it is not the business of the Opposition to find these economies.  Perhaps not, but if the Government proposed the necessary economies to allow these projects to go ahead the Deputy and his colleagues would oppose them.</P>

While the law can lay down sanctions and the Garda Síochána can make it more difficult for people to commit crime, there is only one group of people who can stop crime, those who are about to commit a crime.

      <P>The incidence of crime, especially violent crime, has reached unprecedented levels.  There is widespread agreement that there is a need for extra prison places with improved community policing and rehabilitative services. Unless these measures are implemented in an integrated fashion within the context of a coherent programme for the management of offenders we will simply be applying sticking plasters to society's wounds.  That is what the project at Castlerea represents to give the impression that action is being taken when little is being done to tackle the problem.  It is for this reason that I welcome the Minister's decision to establish an interdepartmental committee to examine all aspects of the project, judicial, social and economic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am delighted that a decision has been taken to conduct a five-year review of offender treatment options with particular reference to the Whitaker report which has been gathering dust for the past ten years.  I also support the five-year plan for the management of offenders.  Extra prison places must be provided.  It is unacceptable that violent criminals are released early having served only a fraction of their sentence.  A revolving door <Col N="643" /> system is being operated because of massive overcrowding and the need to release prisoners early.  This is unacceptable.  It is also unacceptable that prisoners are placed in overcrowded conditions outlined in vivid detail in the recent report of the Mountjoy Prison Visiting Committee. Just as important as the number of prison places available is the regime which confronts a prisoner at the start of his sentence.</P>
    <P>We still have to tackle the drugs problem in our prisons.  We continue to ignore the simple fact that 80 per cent of petty crime in the capital city is drug related and that our prisons are the final destination for many drug abusers. Every drug abusing prisoner must have access to a methadone maintenance programme and be enabled to continue this programme in the community following his or her release.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donoghue would have us believe that the vast majority of those convicted of crimes are murderers and rapists.  That is arrant nonsense.  A large proportion are drug abusers who have been convicted of drug related offences. Our crime levels will not drop unless radical steps are taken in this regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>Initially I would like to stress a simple reality, that vigilant maintenance of law and order is at the very core of any civilised society.  It is a basic requirement that each and every member of society feels free to go about their daily life without fear of any form of attack or abuse.  Similarly there is no doubt but that in our society the grave duty of ensuring the maintenance of law and order rests with the Government of the day, particularly the Minister for Justice.  Therefore the Minister, Deputy <Col N="644" /> Owen, is the person with the ultimate responsibility.</P>
      <P>After a period of six months or so in office we must ask whether the Minister has been effective in dealing with her vitally important brief.  It gives me no pleasure whatsoever to observe that she has presided over a period of an alarming increase in the level of crime of every type.  As a public representative I am only too aware of the growing sense of outrage in the community at what is seen as the rapid development of lawlessness in society.</P>
      <P>It would be extremely wrong to blame each and every problem on the Minister. Crime existed before her arrival in ministerial office, and undoubtedly will continue after she leaves her present position.  It serves no purpose to claim otherwise.  I am concerned however about the appalling change in law and order since the rainbow Coalition took office.  Before the last Government left office, we had a Minister who was totally on top of her brief and was energetically involved in a fast moving and exciting programme of policy development and law reform.  It was generally agreed that the then Minister, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, was making substantial progress in leading the fight against crime.  What do we now have a few short months later?</P>
      <P>There has been an alarming increase in crime and the Government seems to have totally given up on the vital need to take on the criminals at every level with all the legislative power and authority of the State.  It is frightening to recall the various disasters and mistakes of the last few months.  Within a short period of the Minister taking office there was a major robbery at Brinks-Allied. Subsequently there was a major increase in grievous crimes.  People are increasingly being gunned down in the street, illegal drug dealing seems to be spiralling out of control, and convicted criminals are either not serving their sentences or are released ahead of time because of lack of prison space.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has publicly promised to introduce vital legislation in the area of <Col N="645" /> bail without even consulting with Cabinet. Perhaps not surprisingly her Cabinet colleagues have responded badly to her acting in this manner and have largely isolated her.  As a result she has been forced to withdraw her only meaningful policy which was to increase the number of prison places by setting up a new facility in Castlerea.  What has happened to that project?  The rug has been pulled out from under the Minister by her fellow Ministers and we are told that the project is now on hold.  When was it decided to set up a committee to examine this matter?  The Minister had no such intentions until the Minister for Finance made his announcement, of which she was not even made aware; the previous week she had a different view of the matter.</P>
    <P>What is the ordinary law-abiding citizen to make of all this?  The only people who are happy with the current lack of policy or direction in the Department of Justice are those who are committed to crime.  The slightest sign of lack of commitment and determination in the fight against crime on the part of the authorities is welcomed with open arms by criminals.  Any sign that they are winning the battle against our law enforcement agencies only encourages the criminally minded to expand their nasty activities.  Unfortunately the only clear signal being sent by the current administration is that it is indifferent, or at least totally incompetent, in taking on and defeating the criminals once and for all.</P>
    <P>The Minister's weak performance might not be so serious if the escalation of crime was confined to petty crime. Unfortunately the reality is otherwise. Hardly a week passes without examples of violent crime on our streets.  In many cases these incidents have led to either death or serious injury.  Similarly, there is every indication that drug-related crime is increasing at a very frightening rate.  Does the Minister have the slightest idea of the alarm and fear that is generated among the vast majority of law-abiding people when there is increasing evidence that the Minister is <Col N="646" /> totally paralysed at a time when leadership from her office is absolutely vital to turn the tide?</P>
    <P>This is a matter on which there is no room for complacency or inaction.  The Minister must do everything in her power to ensure that our law enforcement agencies have every possible support in the battle against crime.  In particular the Minister must be seen to immediately respond to the need for legal reform and innovation.  Unfortunately the only leadership that the House has seen in the Justice portfolio in recent months has come from the Opposition benches, particularly from my colleague, Deputy O'Donoghue who has worked tirelessly to develop new and vital proposals for law reform. Unfortunately the Minister has not showed the slightest inclination to adopt or amend Deputy O'Donoghue's proposals, or at least follow the energetic example of the Deputy.</P>
    <P>Much play has been made of Castlerea prison.  When Deputies raised the question of the decision not to proceed with the building of the prison the Minister and the Minister of State, Deputy Coveney, said that because of the peace process we do not now need a prison.  It seems that because of the peace process we will have a society free of crime, but everyone is aware of what is happening on the ground.</P>
    <P>Joyriding is a major problem in Cork. Recently a joyrider drove through Cobh at 100 miles per hour.  That person was on early release from Spike Island and was on his way from Limerick to Spike Island to sign in before he returned home again.  Furthermore the State pays for his travel.  That would not be tolerated in any society.  That incident should be checked out.</P>
    <P>The numbers in the Garda Síochána have been reduced.  I am concerned that the Minister for Justice has been sidelined by her colleagues.  The position of law and order is very serious; if law and order breaks down everyone pays.  I want to send a clear signal to the Government that we will not tolerate inaction.  There are problems with early <Col N="647" /> prisoner release and overcrowding in prisons, and we have been told that because a number of political prisoners &mdash; the figure of 100 or 120 was given by one Minister &mdash; will be released from Mountjoy all our problems will be solved.  The peace process is at a very early stage, and the Government is doing a disservice to the people in sending out such a message.</P>
    <P>The Government has not dealt with the problem of people who commit crime while on bail.  The Minister said that a referendum on bail would be held, but that matter was put on the back burner because some members of the Government parties were not happy with it.  We only have to look at recent statements to see that.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Government to reverse the decision on Castlerea prison.  When the Government was told in January that it was going down the wrong road in terms of public finances it did not listen, but six months later it changed course.  Since it was big enough to realise that it was on the wrong course in terms of public finances it should now do likewise and reverse the decision on Castlerea prison.  The peace process should not be used as an excuse that we do not need further prison spaces.  There are people who should be behind bars but due to lack of prison spaces they are free.  I am in favour of education and support of the less well off in the community, but there is only one solution for offenders: put them behind bars, and the sooner that is done the more protection the public will have.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I too am concerned that the Minister for Justice has been sidelined by her Cabinet colleagues.  She has been short-changed in terms of a very important aspect of her brief, the management of prisons.  It is wrong to place all the blame on the Minister for the reversal of the decision on the prisons. That was a collective Cabinet decision for which the Cabinet must take responsibility.  Just as the Minister <Col N="648" /> for Justice has had to accept responsibility for the refusal by the Labour Party to agree to the constitutional referendum on bail, that party must accept responsibility for the reversal of the decision to allocate 210 extra prison spaces which are badly needed.</P>
      <P>In no area of Government is there more need for certainty and equality and decisiveness than in the Department of Justice. If criminal justice policy is faltering, unsure or subject to backsliding, which I believe has been a feature of this particular Minister for Justice, there is a fall-off in public confidence in the competence of the forces of law and order to deal with lawlessness, and that is a very important aspect of people's quality of life.  If they do not have confidence in the justice system to protect civic-minded people in their everyday lives from the forces of lawlessness it is a very dangerous development in a democracy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Enforcement agencies such as prison officers, gardaí and other people who work so hard in the justice area to bring about the protection of individual citizens experience a slippage in morale when there is a backsliding on policy, a revolving policy.  We have talked at length in this House about a revolving prison population but it now appears that we have, in terms of justice, a revolving policy, so that when it comes to implementing what was to be a policy there is a change in the Cabinet's attitude to that policy.  There was a halfhearted attempt by the Minister to introduce a much needed constitutional referendum on bail which, after the bleating of the Labour Party, was retracted.  Now we have a very unpopular decision which had to be made in the context of public spending cuts.  The Government is in a pickle, because it is a very unpopular decision and across all sides of this House there is very little support for this cut.  My party has been strong in advocating the proper management of the public finances but I believe the provision of prison spaces would be the last area in which we <Col N="649" /> would have advocated a cut.  We have been consistent in calling for more prison spaces.  We are chronically disabled in our ability to cope with our existing prison population and the demands of the courts who are daily sending people to Mountjoy and to other custodial centres to be dealt with by the penal system.</P>
    <P>The Government has made this very unpopular decision, an unfortunate decision for the people of Castlerea and I have sympathy for those people who have found themselves gravely wounded by this reversal of policy by the Government.  The Minister has offered no alternative.  Whatever about Castlerea the Minister has not offered another site or has not said we will go ahead with the prison spaces in Wheat-field or a green field site.  She has just procrastinated and said that this decision has been scrapped or deferred.</P>
    <P>The Government amendment on the Order Paper today is the most weakminded, unprincipled response to the debate in this House about the decision to scrap prison spaces.  It talks about the setting up of an inter-Departmental Committee to review all aspects of the prison project for Castlerea, County Roscommon, taking into account the social and economic impact on Castlerea.  With the greatest of respect, it is not the brief of the Minister for Justice to look into job creation and to look into the decline in the west of Ireland. The brief of the Minister for Justice is to deal with the proper management of offenders in this State.  I believe the motion before us tonight is unprincipled.  It is an attempt to assuage hurt public opinion in Castlerea and to assuage the backbench Deputies of the Government and indeed of other parties. It is not her job, it is the job of the Minister for the West to deal with the decline in the economic prosperity of the west.  It is the job of the Minister for Justice to deal with her own brief, that is the proper management of our prison population.</P>
    <P>In general terms the Government is in a pickle because it went mad in the <Col N="650" /> first six months.  It went on a profligate spending spree across all Government Departments.  It introduced two new ministries.  The very first act of this new Government was to introduee two new junior ministries which were unnecessary. It introduced a range of paid chairmen of unnecessary committees and extended and proliferated the whole expensive range of consultants, advisers and programme managers.  That is where the spending went mad.  It went mad also in the public service.  Any objective economic assessment of this Government's economic performance would be that the time had come to call a halt but what a place to cut public expenditure, in the most critical area of this Government's responsibility, crime and lawlessness?</P>
    <P>We have received many reports, in this House.  We had the Lord Mayor's Commission on Crime, the Whitaker Report, the whole panoply of reports that are gathering dust, from select committees of this House.  One of the constant features of all that deliberation and the intellectual investment that went into them was that we did not have enough prison spaces.</P>
    <P>In general terms the Minister has a tendency to procrastinate.  That is very unfortunate in a Minister for Justice.  I have mentioned bail, I have mentioned a whole range of other matters which the Minister has put off to another day. <i>Manana</i> is a feature of this Minister and it is very unfortunate.  I believe she is not getting support from her Cabinet colleagues, particularly in the area of provision of prison spaces.  As has been stated loudly and clearly by the Garda, by the Prison Officers Association, by the people who are trying to stem the tide of and the escalation of lawlessness in this State, it is absolutely ridiculous to have a situation in which convicted offenders are being released back into the community with reckless disregard to their propensity to re-offend just in order to make space for people who are being sent by the courts to be dealt with by the prison system.</P>
    <P>This is one of the chronic causes of a <Col N="651" /> breakdown in law and order in the State.  We are blue in the face talking about it in this House.  There is crossparty support for the need for extra spaces.  Up to 50 per cent of the population in Mountjoy are heroin abusers. When released early they are out to re-offend to feed their habit.  This Minister has not introduced one measure to address the impact on criminality of drug addition.  It is a crucial part of our re-offending prison population.  Any profile of our prison population will show that clearly.</P>
    <P>We are not underpoliced.  We are underpoliced in Dublin but we have 10,800 gardaí in the State.  Where are they?  We have to look at how gardaí are deployed at the moment.  The Minister constantly abdicates her responsibility for this to divisional heads of the Garda Síochána.  The time has come for her to take a positive, proactive attitude on where gardaí are, what duties they are performing.  She should look at their rostering, look at the need for community policing.  I believe the ratio of one garda to every 326 Irish citizens is fair but we have to look at what they are doing and whether they are being usefully deployed.</P>
    <P>The time has come to change the criminal justice system in relation to organised crime and serious drug-related activity.  We should look at introducing radical changes in the way in which we investigate crime.  We are proposing in our amendment tonight that consideration should be given to the inquisitorial system for dealing with specified serious drug-related criminal offences.  The distinguishing feaure of our criminal system at the moment is that it is based on the adversarial system, the need for the prosecution to prove the offence beyond a reasonable doubt.  I believe the time has come, with a serious escalation in organised crime and drug-related criminality, to change radically to an inquisitorial system which places the burden of proof on the tribunal and the judge.  This is a system which, with specific precautions, such as <Col N="652" /> the video taping of interviews, could go a long way to providing the Garda with the necessary powers of arrest, a change in the right to silence without inferences being drawn and so on.  All those measures worked well in the past when the defendant had little protection from the State.  Three hundred years ago defendants were not allowed to give evidence, they were often illiterate and had no right to the advice of counsel.</P>
    <P>The time has come to consider introducing strong measures based on the inquisitorial system, such as exists in France, for specified criminal offences, particularly organised crime.  The essential difference between that system and ours is that in ours the body charged with deciding the issue of guilt or innocence leaves responsibility to the prosecution and the defence to present their cases.  The outcome is decided on who fights the best battle.  All the aces are stacked in favour of the accused.  I have studied this; I have been a student of law and I know the criminal justice system is stacked in favour of the accused. The time has come to redress the balance in favour of the State and the victims of crime.</P>

      <P>I support the Opposition motion, the terms of which are both specific and general.  The need for western development underlines its motivation.  The case for Castlerea has been well made and it is hard to defend the decision not to proceed with the prison.  That decision will have a knock-on effect in allowing crime to spiral and it will force people, with whom I am familiar particularly juveniles to suffer in secure centres that were never designed to hold them.  Excuses given for that decision include difficulties regarding public finance and that the Department of Justice will bow to the Department of Education in leaving it to address problems in certain cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree there is a need for education <Col N="653" /> and rehabilitation but in my constituency the Oberstown Boys Centre, the Oberstown Girls Remand and Assessment Centre and Trinity House are being used as a safety valve for an inadequate penal system emphasised by the decision not to proceed with the Castlerea prison project.  Those centres are being run by the Department of Education and yet they house offenders who have committed serious crimes, who escape regularly and are secured only by local gardaí.  The gardaí in Lusk, three individuals are charged with the responsibility of overseeing people who have been a danger to society.  These criminals are being allowed to wander around a rural community and around farms where people live in isolated areas.</P>
    <P>The Government is not simply guilty of mismanagement and neglect of the west, but of being seriously irresponsible on allowing a problem responsibility for which properly lies with the Department of Justice, to be hived off to the Department of Education, a Department which is neither interested nor able to deal with the cases with which it has been charged.  The Minister for Education has not visited that area and the Minister for Justice in whose constituency it is, would wash her hands of this matter and would not consider it her responsibility.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister for Justice co-operate with her colleague the Minister for Education and not only reverse the decision on Castlerea, but listen to the people who are being forced to accept the results of mismanagement by the Department of Justice?</P>

      <P>With due respect to the Minister of State, Deputy O'Shea, the Government is showing its disdain for one of the most important problems facing our country in the absence of a Cabinet Minister.  Crime and drugs abuse are prevalent and it is an insult to the House and to the citizens that a Cabinet Minister is not present for this debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last week there were disturbances in <Col N="654" /> my town of Midleton, gardaí were attacked around 12.30 a.m. and one was seriously injured.  Such incidents are not frequent in east Cork, but are increasing. In my village of Carrigtohill the Garda barracks was damaged for the umpteenth time.  A good deal of these problems result from the abuse of drugs. It is important that we face up to this problem and attempt to control it.  The Government's inaction indicates it is not taking the necessary measures to address the problem.</P>
    <P>Parents of teenagers are very worried about the prevalence of drugs and the drug culture that is beginning to take over in this country.  Ordinary decent law-abiding citizens are asking what the Government is doing to tackle not only the drug problem, but the escalating crime problem.</P>

      <P>Has the decision to stop work on the prison projects at Castlerea and Dublin been taken because the Minister for Justice stated <Col N="655" /> that the ceasefire in Northern Ireland would make available sufficient places for those responsible for serious crime? I do not recall any great support for that facile excuse.  Nobody believes it.  The increased numbers of indictable offences, more than 300 a day, indicate the Minister has her head buried in the sand in terms of addressing the real problems.</P>
      <P>The walls of Castlerea will be a stark monument to the failure of the Government to face up to the real problems afflicting the peaceful life of the old and the young.  The walls in Meath will not make up for the dereliction of duty in not finishing the work on the prisons in Castlerea and Dublin.  Where will the Minister provide the 210 additional prison places she promised earlier in the year?  Those questions are being asked throughout the country and we have not been given answers.  I am sure the Minister of State, Deputy O'Shea will tell the Minister for Justice and his colleagues the questions being asked daily which are not being answered.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I protest at the absence of the Minister for Justice for a debate on one of the most important motions to come before this House since the rainbow coalition took office. The Minister for Justice and what I described here last night as this Billy Bunter Government are becoming increasingly predictable with each passing day.  The game plan appeared to be to refer every difficulty to a committee, a commission or an interdepartmental committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a bid to hide her embarrassment at her failure to erect a prison in Castlerea and a woman's prison in Dublin, the Minister for Justice decided to set up an interdepartmental committee to review all aspects of the prison project for Castlerea.  Such procrastination and abdication of responsibility will not fool anybody.  Previous to that the Minister announced with great aplomb that she would carry through on the commitment made by the previous Minister for <Col N="656" /> Justice, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, and build a prison at Castlerea and a women's prison in Dublin, thereby providing 210 prison places.  Is it not extraordinary that at that time the Minister did not see any reason to have the matter considered by an interdepartmental committee?  Is it not extraordinary that it was only when the Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, cracked the whip that the interdepartmental committee arrived on the scene?</P>
    <P>In retrospect, I suppose one could say that the public should be thankful the matter is being referred to a committee because, in the light of recent events, it would appear that it was a choice between a committee or building another wall.  I hope the interdepartmental committee will be cheaper than a wall.  However, no amount of prevarication, indecision or downright obfuscation will hide the truth from the public, which is that this rainbow coalition Government mismanaged the spending of public money so badly that it was obliged to retreat from tackling one of the most serious problems ever to face the country, that of spiralling crime. Countless victims of crime and their families and neighbours will not hold their collective breaths for yet another committee to report to this Minister for Justice.</P>
    <P>The people of Castlerea and Roscommon will not be taken in by Deputy Connor's speech or by the Minister's decision to have the committee consult with the Castlerea Development Cooperative Society.  If that is such a desirable objective why was it not mentioned when the original announcement was made?  In yet another death defying leap into fantasy land the Minister stated that what needs to be addressed is the need for enhanced offender management capacity and the Castlerea project is deferred.  There is even a question mark over the validity or accuracy of that statement.  The Minister for Finance has yet to say the project is being deferred.  It is without doubt an open secret that he wants the project abandoned altogether.  This shambles is a <Col N="657" /> remarkable display of political insensitivity and crass ignorance of the plight of the people living along our western shores.</P>
    <P>Deputy Foxe is correct in stating that the people of Castlerea would not be so foolish as to believe that a prison will save their livelihoods.  It is true that a prison will not save the livelihoods of the people of Castlerea, but it is also abundantly clear that it would enhance the locality and assist people's livelihoods. The Minister for Finance would not have behaved as he did, nor would he have said the things he said if the Labour Party had a Deputy in the constituency of Longford-Roscommon.</P>

      <P>The people of Longford-Roscommon will draw their own conclusion.  This Government's policy on crime is one of reverse mathematics.  It appears to believe that crime contracts to fit the available prison spaces.  That is akin to saying that building hospitals encourages people to get sick.  This is the same kind of policy that gave rise to the miserly increase in old age pensions provided for in the last budget, presumably on the basis that if people had this money they would be better off.  The Government appears to believe money can be saved by building walls, that if a wall is built around the Taoiseach's residence, one will save on security costs; equally, that a wall around a psychiatric hospital in Castlerea will save on the cost of a prison. The only question remaining is at which wall should the taxpayers wail?</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 9:</P>

    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>We had some difficulty with the definition of cohabitation.  It would be useful under this section to define what we mean in exact terms so that there is no uncertainty in regard to people in what might be termed a short term relationship which could not be said to be similar to that of a married couple.  I am not saying there should be permanency, but some period of time should be stipulated to delineate the relationship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy Keogh's amendment.  I also raised the question of the lack of definition.  It is important in the interests of clarity that people should know what precisely is meant by cohabitation.  Do we mean one night, one week, or a longer period? It would be worthwhile to spell it out. I look forward to the Minister's elucidation of the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. Gilmore) Eamon Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. Gilmore)</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know why Deputy Walsh should presume that I am an expert on cohabitation, but I will respond to the amendment. The amendment proposed by Deputy Keogh would mean that a cohabiting couple would not be recognised as such for the purposes of the family income supplement scheme unless they had been cohabiting for a period of at least one year.  Either of the couple could still claim FIS, however, if they were on low pay, in the same way as a lone parent is entitled to FIS.  The partner would not be regarded as a member of the family and, as a result, the partner's income would not be taken into account in determining entitlement to FIS.  The practical effect of the proposed amendment, therefore, would be that in certain circumstances a couple who had been cohabiting for less than one year would be treated more favourably than a married couple.  This would clearly be in breach of the Constitution, and for this reason I have to oppose the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed.  As the whole premise would be that the couple would not be seen as living together as man and wife for that year, the point the Minister of State makes is not valid. Perhaps I have not understood him very well, but that is how it appears to me. Perhaps he would elucidate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the purpose of Deputy Keogh's amendment is to try to limit the circumstances under which family income supplement would be paid to cohabiting couples to couples <Col N="667" /> who have been cohabiting for one year. There are two possibilities.  One is that a couple cohabitating for less than one year would not qualify for family income supplement.  A second scenario &mdash; and perhaps it is an unintentional consequence of Deputy Keogh's amendment &mdash; is that a cohabiting couple under this arrangement could end up in a more favourable position financially than a married couple.</P>
      <P>For example, if a couple is cohabiting and one partner is on a low income, the income of the other partner is not taken into account.  In such circumstances, the couple will be in receipt of family income supplement in the first year of cohabitation which they might not receive if the other partner's income were taken into account.  They would be better off financially than if they were married.  Other practical difficulties also arise.  Under existing arrangements a total of 20 hours a week must be worked and the couple may aggregate the hours. That would not be possible in the first year of cohabitation under Deputy Keogh's amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>Do we accept that a couple are cohabiting when they say they are cohabiting?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The state of <i>de facto</i> cohabitation is considered as cohabitation.  The time limit which the Deputy proposes could be unfair to cohabiting couples who may not qualify under it and it could also give rise to practical difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept what the Minister said but it would be beneficial to define &ldquo;cohabitation&rdquo; in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the conditions of entitlement to social welfare payments is that a person is not cohabiting. This condition applies in the case of lone parent's allowance, deserted wife's benefit and allowance and widow's and <Col N="668" /> widower's contributory pension.  Disqualification on grounds of cohabitation is rare.  Some 114 people were disqualified in 1994.  They were mainly unmarried parents in receipt of lone parent's allowance and 40 people were disqualified to date this year.  In deciding whether a person is disqualified a deciding officer must be satisfied that the claimant is living with someone as husband and wife.  There is no single factor by which this can be determined.  As relationships and domestic and financial arrangements between husbands and wives vary considerably each case must be decided on its merits.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;or</P>
      <P>(c)  each person of a married couple;'.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The definition of spouse includes (a) a party to a marriage which has been dissolved and (b) a man and a woman who are not married.  This amendment proposes that the definition should also include each person of a married couple.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Sections 9 and 10 provide that for the purposes of the family income supplement scheme and determining entitlement to an increase for an adult dependant the word <Col N="669" />&ldquo;spouse&rdquo; shall include a divorced person where the divorced is recognised and one of a cohabitating couple. Amendments Nos. 19 and 12 propose that the word &ldquo;spouse&rdquo; shall also include one of a married couple.  These amendments are unnecessary since, by definition, the word &ldquo;spouse&rdquo; means one of a married couple.</P>
      <P>As Deputies will expect, very careful consideration was given in the Department and the Office of the Attorney General to the text of the Bill and in this context an approach along the general lines of the amendments was considered. However, on the advice of the parliamentary draftsman it was decided not to refer to one of a married couple in the Bill.  Sections 9 and 10 as initiated make it unnecessary to refer to one of a married couple as the word &ldquo;spouse&rdquo; means one of a married couple.  For these reasons I cannot accept the amendments.</P>

      <P>I accept the points made by the Minister.  Our amendment on the weekly family income supplement was disallowed but I ask the Minister to look at it again as we are anxious that the second family is not impoverished.  Under the Bill a man could be regarded as having two wives. If he has five children by each wife he will be able to claim a family income supplement for two adult dependants and ten children.  However, we do not know if the money will be passed to them.  Under a maintenance order he is obliged to look after his first family and as a result the second family may be impoverished.  Will the Minister clarify the meaning of the word &ldquo;family&rdquo; in section 9?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment, which was ruled out of order, proposed that for the purposes of determining entitlement to family income supplement any maintenance payment made by a member of the family to their former spouse would be deducted in determining the weekly family income.  This would have meant that the Exchequer would have <Col N="670" /> had to subsidise maintenance payments made by a divorced person to their former spouse.  This would have implications for other areas of the social welfare code and would have to be considered very carefully.</P>

      <P>Section 10 (3) proposes that regulations may provide for determining the circumstances in which a person is to be regarded as wholly or mainly maintaining another person.  The substitution of the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; for the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; would impose an obligation on the Minister to make the regulations. The Minister would not have taken these powers if he did not intend making the regulations provided for in the section.

      <P>I move amendment No. 14:</P>
      <P>In page 7, between lines 24 and 25, to insert the following subsection:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(5)  Any increase in a social welfare payment in respect of an adult dependant shall, if requested by <Col N="671" /> any such adult dependant, be payable to the adult dependant in his or her own right.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment deals with the core issue in the Bill.  I would not wish to be regarded as a dependant as it is demeaning and we strongly believe that a person should receive a payment in his or her own right.  We have gone some way along this road in other enlightened social welfare legislation.  However, under this Bill reference is made to an adult dependant, a prisoner's wife, a deserted wife etc.  This dependant category is not relevant in the 1990s and people should be paid their entitlements in their own right.  I do not understand why the Bill insists that a person should be regarded as an appendage of someone with whom they no longer live.  We will press this amendment to a vote.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment proposes that an increase in a social welfare payment in respect of an adult dependant would, at the request of the adult dependant, be payable directly to him or her.  Under existing legislation payment may be made directly to an adult dependant where the circumstances so warrant.  These are known as separate payments.  These provisions are used in cases of difficult family circumstances which generally involve situations where the claimant is not using the benefit or allowance to support the dependant.  Where the adult dependant <Col N="672" /> is living with the claimant they can receive half of the married rate of payment, that is half the personal rate plus the increase for the adult dependant, and the full increases for children. These provisions are more favourable than those provided for in amendment No. 14.  In cases where the adult dependant is not living with the claimant they may receive the adult dependant increase and the full increases for any dependent children.  Again, these provisions are more favourable than those provided for in the amendment.</P>
      <P>I am not opposed to the amendment in principle but I do not regard it as directly relevant to the divorce issue. This is a much broader issue and is along the lines of the points made by Deputy Keogh on Second Stage about the introduction of provisions to enable women in the home qualify for contributory pensions in their own right.  I consider that the issue needs to be examined in this broader context and for this reason I will oppose the amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 15:</P>
      <P>In page 7, before section 11, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;11.&mdash;(1)  Rule 1 of Part I of the Third Schedule to the Principal Act is hereby amended by&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  the insertion in paragraph (2) after subparagraph (p) (inserted by section 18 of the Act of 1994) of the following subparagraph:</P>
      <P>`(q)  subject to paragraph (6), any moneys derived from insurable employment of a seasonal nature;'</P>
      <P>and</P>
      <P>(b)  the insertion after paragraph</P>
      <P>(5) of the following paragraph:</P>
      <P>`(6)  In the case of a person who makes a claim for unemployment assistance in respect of a day of unemployment which occurs during a period in which he is engaged in insurable employment of a seasonal nature, the value, ascertained in the prescribed manner, of any moneys derived from the said employment and the value so calculated shall be deemed to constitute the weekly means of that person from such employment for the purposes of Chapter 2 of Part III:'.</P>
      <P>(2)  Paragraph (a) of section 4 (4) of the Principal Act is hereby amended by the substitution for Rule 1 (2) (m) of Part I' of `Rules 1 (2) (m) and 1 (6) of Part I'.</P>
      <P>(3)  Section 119 of the Principal Act is hereby amended by the substitution in the definition of `weekly means' of `shall, subject to Rule 1 (6) of Part I of the Third Schedule, be the yearly means' for `shall be the yearly means'.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to change the method of assessment for <Col N="676" /> entitlement to unemployment assistance for seasonal workers.  On becoming unemployed at the end of the working season, seasonal workers normally claim unemployment benefit, which is based on their PRSI contributions.  However, some workers may not qualify for benefit because they do not have the necessary contributions or have already exhausted their entitlement to 15 months' benefit and have not paid the 13 contributions required to requalify. In this instance they have to rely on unemployment assistance for income support for the period of unemployment.</P>
    <P>The assessment of means for unemployment assistance was changed in July 1992.  Since then earnings from insurable employment have been assessed as means.  This change has caused particular difficulties for seasonal workers, such as those in Bord na Móna and in the meat processing and tourism industries, because their earnings from seasonal employment results in their qualifying for a reduced rate of unemployment assistance and, in some cases, not being entitled to any unemployment assistance on grounds of means.</P>
    <P>Under the existing provisions means are assessed on an annual basis and account is taken of all earnings which a person may reasonably expect to receive in the coming year.  In effect, earnings which they received in the preceding year are assessed.  The practical effect of these provisions is that when seasonal workers apply for unemployment assistance on the cessation of their seasonal employment they are assessed on their earnings from that employment, although by then the income has probably been spent.  Consequently, they qualify for a reduced rate of unemployment assistance for the remainder of the year and in many instances are required to apply for a top-up payment under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.</P>
    <P>Under this proposed amendment seasonal earnings will not be assessed in <Col N="677" /> respect of claims made outside the period of seasonal employment.  This approach will enable workers to qualify for the full rate of unemployment assistance on the cessation of employment until they resume their seasonal employment in the following year.  If they claim unemployment assistance for any day of unemployment during the season, their current earnings will be taken into account in assessing their means.  This amendment will enhance the attractiveness of taking up seasonal work by eliminating the disincentives under the current arrangements.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 18 is a consequential amendment to section 11 (3).  It provides that the provisions of the Bill will be brought into force by way of a commencement order.  The purpose of this amendment is to enable the proposed new provisions for the assessment of means for seasonal workers to be brought into force separately from the other provisions of the Bill.</P>

      <P>
        <i>:</i> I strongly support this amendment; in my short period in this House this is one of the most welcome changes in social welfare legislation.  The Minister said that the change which resulted from the 1992 amendments to social welfare regulations impinged particularly on Bord na Móna workers.  My colleague, Deputy Penrose, and I represent two midlands constituencies which contain the vast majority of those workers and we are aware of the gradual erosion of the attractiveness of seasonal work as the 1992 changes were put in place. Initially, it did not affect them that much but as the practice evolved and as various cases were dealt with by Department of Social Welfare deciding officers and the social welfare appeals office, the effects of this change in the regulations were felt.  Families were in dire poverty because of the way in which this was working out in practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In late 1993 I brought it to the attention of the then Minister.  Deputy Woods, who inquired into it and tried to assist.  As the year went on, more and <Col N="678" /> more cases came to light.  I have a large file in which individual cases are documented. As last year's Bord na Móna season got into fullswing, it became apparent that hundreds of families were being adversely affected by this provision.</P>
    <P>We had a special sitting of this House at the end of August and the beginning of September for another purpose.  At that time, Deputy Penrose and I met the then Minister, Deputy Woods, to impress on him the severe hardship and disincentive to work which was being created.  A ludicrous situation arose where people who were let go at the end of August 1994 were, in some cases, being assessed on the basis of income which they earned in the summer of 1993.  They were told that what they earned during a ten or 12 week period in the middle of 1993 was supposed to see them through the winter of 1994-95.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, we did not get a resolution of the problem at that stage. However, we did not give up and compiled our cases carefully and in detail. When Deputy Proinsias De Rossa took office as Minister, Deputy Penrose and I and the secretary of the Bord na Móna group of unions met with him at a very early stage and went through it in detail. He gave us a commitment that he understood the effect this was having on the Bord na Móna workers and undertook to have it reviewed in the Department. I am delighted that this amendment has been tabled.  Deputy Penrose and I probably know better than anybody else in this House the practical benefit which it will bring to families. They already had low incomes, even through taking employment, but were being discouraged from taking up seasonal employment this year because of the effect of the 1992 regulations.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister.  I regard this as a very good example of what the social welfare code should do, which is to encourage people to take up work rather than discourage them.  It is greatly welcomed in the midlands, particularly by the Bord na Móna seasonal workers.</P>
    <Col N="679" />
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to echo the comments of my colleague, Deputy Gallagher.  I come from the midland county of Westmeath and Deputy Gallagher is from the adjacent county of Offaly, and we realise the significance of this change in social welfare legislation. I was totally taken aback by the assessment of means for unemployment assistance which was brought in in July 1992.  It was a good example of bureaucracy gone mad.  It disregarded the poverty imposed on seasonal workers, particularly the Bord na Móna workers and workers in meat factories and tourism. It was a major disincentive to take up seasonal employment.</P>
      <P>Bord na Móna was in the vanguard of change in the midlands.  We lost 2,000 jobs and many of those people could only resort to seasonal employment with Bord na Móna, because of the seasonal nature of the production.  We brought in legislation in 1992 which put this work out of reach of most of them. I had an example of a separated person with two children who received £37 a week as a result of the provisions whereby means were assessed on an annual basis and account was taken of the earnings which a person might reasonably expect to earn during the year.</P>
      <P>When bureaucracy goes mad there is no limit to the madness.  Instead of getting their entitlement from the Department of Social Welfare after working a hard 16, 18 or 20 weeks in the bog, people had to go to the community welfare officer to look for their other £65 or £70.  I was astounded that was allowed to happen.  I made my feelings known in no uncertain terms to the then Minister, Deputy Woods, who knew about it and tried to deal with it, and then to the current Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad that this change has taken place because it is important that we ensure people's dignity rather than making them go to two separate places to get their entitlements.  This amendment ensures that people get their entitlements after working for 20 weeks. <Col N="680" /> Those people would love to have fulltime jobs and it is not their fault that there are only 20 weeks of work in the summer, from April to September or early October, if they are lucky &mdash; often it is only 13 or 14 weeks.  I am delighted that seasonal earnings will not be assessed in respect of claims made outside the period of seasonal employment.</P>
    <P>Many Bord na Móna workers have signalled that this is an important change which they welcome.  Deputy Gallagher and I, as ordinary backbenchers, brought this to the attention of the previous and current Ministers and it shows the importance of bringing forward common sense proposals, and of people listening to and implementing those proposals.  I am delighted with the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch" hpid="Kathleen Lynch Kathleen Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Kathleen Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this amendment.  This matter has been highlighted since 1992.  The Minister has only been in office for seven months but we can already see the necessary changes which he is quite prepared to make.  This is one of the changes which came about without any great publicity or fanfare.  People were only affected by it when they went to claim unemployment benefit or assistance and their previous year's earnings were set against them.  Those earnings might have been earned, as Deputy Penrose said, in a very short period of time and could not have been expected to last people over the 52 weeks of the year.  They were expected to live on those earnings with very small payments from the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recognise that the midlands are greatly affected by this, but Mitchelstown Co-op, Waterford Co-op and various areas around the country were also affected by these draconian measures and the dirty dozen cuts.  It was a disincentive to work.  Why would anybody take 20 weeks work if it was going to be held against them for the rest of the year?  People could not budget with that kind of legislation hanging over their heads.  The Minister for Social Welfare <Col N="681" /> must be congratulated on this amendment. I know that every seasonal worker will be singing his praises tonight.</P>

      <P>I welcome this measure. There was a great deal of anxiety in relation to this matter which caused difficulty for people who work on a seasonal basis with the dairying, meat and tourism industries and in specific localised situations in Bord na Móna and elsewhere.  The measure will help people and industries.  Under the amendment earnings from seasonal employment will not be taken into account.  I welcome that unreservedly.</P>

      <P>This is an important amendment.  Although we tried earlier to make some interim arrangements the matter will require more thought and consideration to find a solution.  This amendment meets the requirements of some of the categories involved.  It therefore sets a precedent.  The position of other categories, including the self-employed such as carpenters and journeymen who have been forced out of the system and to become contractors, needs to be examined.</P>
      <P>Any income from seasonal employment is taken into account by the Department of Social Welfare in assessing applicants for assistance.  This presents a problem.  A number of measures have been introduced since 1992 to rectify the anomalies in the system. This amendment will have a beneficial effect and is therefore a welcome addition to the Bill.</P>
      <P>Earlier the Minister would not entertain any discussion on matters covered by the Bill.  This is an indication that he was not being consistent.  Despite this we support the amendment.</P>

While <Col N="682" /> this amendment is welcome in addressing the issue of divorce, other more pertinent proposals were not accepted by the Minister.  I find this extraordinary. He cannot have it every way.  In enacting legislation one has to be consistent. This is not to take away from the amendment the purpose of which is to solve a particular problem but it is wrong to prevent the Opposition from raising particular points relating to the object of the Bill.</P>

      <P>Deputy Woods mentioned that this amendment sets a precedent and that the position of other categories of atypical workers should be examined.  In regard to the self-employed the position is changing.  This matter is being examined in the Department of Social Welfare.</P>

      <P>I am confining my remarks to the comments made by the Minister in that connection.  The purpose of the Bill is to deal with issues relating to divorce and the changes in social welfare resulting therefrom.  If the Government had approached the Opposition yesterday and said it wanted to introduce a simple Bill for that purpose and to put it through quickly, it would have had the support of all sides of the House.  Instead we are faced with an amendment which will have complex implications.  We accept the Department knows what it is doing and that the amendment will meet the requirements. I did not see the amendment until this afternoon; neither did the Opposition spokesperson see it until today.  A proper explanation in that regard would <Col N="684" /> have been helpful to the Opposition spokespersons.</P>
      <P>It is somewhat disingenuous of the Minister to suggest that the Opposition is being other than open, helpful and generous in its approach to this section. This issue should have been included in the main Social Welfare Bill, but its complexity did not allow for that.  I understand the difficulties experienced by the Department in this regard.  Notwithstanding the way this amendment has been entered we welcome it.  Let us not play politics with this issue.</P>

      <P>I do not wish to be long-winded, but the Minister's choice of words was unfortunate.  It is not right to describe as ungracious the remarks made by me and other members of the Opposition.  As Deputy Woods said, we welcome the amendment.  We are dealing with a specific issue relating to divorce and social welfare entitlements.  It would be wrong not to point out that there are issues in the Bill that were not approached in as open a fashion as they might have been.  I am simply making a point, not being ungracious.</P>
      <P>Some of the debate today was fractious. It started off on the wrong footing. I appreciate the Minister of State has approached this matter in an open manner, but his remarks were not helpful. The Opposition is entitled to criticise a Bill and ask for clarification on aspects of it.  I am extremely disappointed the Minister reacted in such a way.</P>

      <P>A simple way to deal with this matter would be to introduce a separate Bill.  However, we welcome the amendment even though it has been tagged on at the end of a Bill which specifically deals with issues relating to divorce.  When we tried to raise related matters dealing with deserted spouses, adult dependency and the cost of various sections, they were not accepted.  The Minister was very difficult with us when we asked ordinary Committee Stage questions, yet he has <Col N="685" /> tagged on to the end of the Bill an unrelated matter.  Despite that fact we welcome the amendment.  I question the way the Minister handles business such as this.</P>

      <P>In making my remarks I did not intend to provoke Members of the House.  There was a necessity to introduce this amendment to deal with the issue.  If the matter had been dealt with, for example, in the Social Welfare (No. 3) Bill, which will address many of the issues raised during the course of the debate, it would be too late for the seasonal workers because their season ends in September.</P>
      <P>On the notice given of the amendment. I appreciate that sometimes Members may not receive documents or information, but as I understand it this amendment was circulated on Friday last.  Deputies are perhaps being a little over-sensitive about the remarks I made.  An open approach has been adopted to the debate &mdash; for example, amendment No. 11 which had been ruled out of order was responded to in order to be helpful and to promote open and free discussion.  It is unhelpful for Members to be too sensitive.  It would be much better to concentrate on the text and substance of the Bill rather than reopen some of the old sores of the earlier part of the debate.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 16:</P>
      <P>In page 7, before section 11, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;11.&mdash;In all circumstances where a person is entitled to a social welfare payment on the basis of a marriage which has been dissolved, being a dissolution that is recognised as valid in the State, such payment shall be called a `special maintenance payment'.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The difficulty with this Bill is that it was very poorly researched and sloppily put <Col N="686" /> together.  The information we sought has not been forthcoming.  Instead we have received lectures and insults.  We want to give clarity and precision to the Bill, to ensure people are treated in a fair and humane way and that, on the dissolution of a marriage, they do not carry demeaning tags.  For example, for the purposes of the Bill people who have separated are still regarded as deserted wives and prisoners' wives.</P>
    <P>Why should somebody who has terminated a marriage arrangement be labelled a prisoner's wife?  It is deeply hurtful to people in that situation.  I will not insist on the term &ldquo;special maintenance payment&rdquo; but the present wording is absurd and shows very little thought was given to the person left in this situation. Similarly why should somebody be regarded as an adult dependant?  People should get their entitlements with proper designations.  Only last year I brought it to the attention of the Minister that people in receipt of a blind pension, even if only in their twenties or thirties, were given an old age pension book.  They resented that.  If I had terminated a marriage and was a free person and got a prisoner's wife's allowance book I would deeply resent it.  It is archaic, unfair and demeaning.  I want to press this amendment.  We want to get away from the dependency culture in this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with all Deputy Walsh has said.  We are very concerned about this, particularly from the point of view of the woman who is divorced.  She is still called a wife, a deserted wife or a prisoner's wife.  It seems extraordinary that a man could have two wives.  In fact, her former husband could go to jail some time after the divorce and yet she will become a prisoner's wife.  Despite the fact that they have gone their separate ways and she does not want to hear from him again, because he is sent to jail she gets a new book and is a prisoner's wife.  It is an extraordinary situation.  A different terminology should be used.  We suggest &ldquo;special maintenance payment&rdquo; but we <Col N="687" /> would agree to any wording that would mean the person is entitled to a payment in her own right.</P>

      <P>I have no option but to oppose this amendment.  The text is defective in that it refers to a person entitled to a social welfare payment on the basis of a marriage that has been dissolved.  There are no provisions in the Bill to entitle a person to payment on the basis of a marriage which has been dissolved.</P>
      <P>Futhermore, I am advised that even if the deficiency were rectified it is likely that the amendment would necessitate certain consequential amendments to other provisions in the Social Welfare Acts.  These would include section 209 which deals with overlapping provisions under which as a general rule a person is not entitled to receive more than one social welfare payment at the same time.  Amendments to section 30 of the Principal Act which describe social insurance payments and to section 118 which describe social assistance payments would also have to be considered. In effect, the nature of the amendment is such that it would be necessary to have a comprehensive examination of the Social Welfare Acts and regulations to identify all of the consequential changes.  For these reasons I oppose the amendment.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister of State accept the principle of what we are trying to say here with regard to the terminology being used and the offensiveness of the terms used in the Bill?  It was cobbled together to make these payments but it is very offensive. Will the Minister accept that it is unsatisfactory to call somebody a deserted. <Col N="688" /> wife or a prisoner's wife when she is no longer a wife?  This terminology is exceedingly offensive and does the Minister of State accept that it simply has to be changed.</P>

      <P>Indeed.  From some of Deputy Wallace's earlier contributions one would think that following the introduction of divorce the country would be flooded with people rushing to engineer a breakdown of their marriages and seek a divorce.  From her more recent contributions I am led to the conclusion that if this Bill is passed the country will be flooded with prisoners' wives.  There are only eight women currently in receipt of prisoners wife's allowance.  However, I accept the general thrust of the argument that it is undesirable to have people permanently labelled by reference to the type of social welfare book or card they have. As I understand it, that is an issue that is being examined in the Department of Social Welfare and it will be addressed at some stage in the future.  However, the amendment before us does not adequately address that.  First, it is technically flawed but second, and perhaps unwittingly, it may also introduce another form of categorisation because the term &ldquo;special maintenance payment&rdquo; could create a special category of payment for payments to spouses of divorced people and that might create another form of labelling.  The whole issue of the titles and the labels used for different types of social welfare payments is being looked at by the Minister for Social Welfare.  The formula suggested in this Bill does not address that problem.  It is technically flawed and introduces another label which is probably an unwelcome addition to those in place.</P>

      <P>I have sympathy with Deputy Walsh's argument about the terminology used in the social welfare code in describing types of social welfare payments, but it has been in place for some time.  It was in place when he and his colleagues were in Government.  It has not been addressed.  It is being currently examined by the Minister and he will deal with it in time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In referring to the eight people in receipt of prisoner wife's allowance I did not intend in any way to dismiss them or to say that they were less important.  They are important as individuals. I made that point in reply to the contributions made by Deputies Walsh and Wallace.  They painted a picture that there would be large numbers of people in receipt of prisoner wife's allowance.  What is wrong with the terms survivor's pension, widow's pension or family income supplement? There is nothing wrong with them.  As <Col N="690" /> stated earlier, the bulk of the people who will ultimately benefit from this Bill will be in those categories.  There is an element of exaggeration in this regard. An issue must and is being addressed, but to a degree Deputy Walsh has overstated his case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>Earlier the Minister said that a No. 3 Bill will deal with a unified lone parents allowance, but we must bear in mind that not all deserted wives have children.  We sought to debate the issue of deserted spouses who do not have children and the terminology used in that regard.  The term &ldquo;deserted&rdquo; may be enshrined in the social welfare code for some time, but the term &ldquo;wife&rdquo; must be addressed in circumstances where the marriage has been dissolved.  This question arises when discussing a special payment. When a marriage is dissolved one spouse should not be referred to by the term &ldquo;wife&rdquo;.  That matter arises now, but it did not arise before under the social welfare code.  When the marriage no longer exists one spouse should not be described as the other spouse's wife regardless of whether that spouse deserted the other spouse or is in prison.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to eight people being in receipt of prisoners wife's allowance, but there are many deserted wives.  The term &ldquo;wife&rdquo; may affect many people as they will continue to be described as the wife of the spouse who deserted them to whom they may no longer be married.  The term &ldquo;wife&rdquo; needs to be examined.  I would be satisfied if the Minister accepts the principle that the terminology in the social welfare code needs to be changed across the board.</P>

      <P>In page 3, line 34, before &ldquo;spouse&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;that last&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the Committee Stage debate last week the Minister agreed to a request <Col N="692" /> from Deputy Keogh to have the definition of spouse contained in section 3 reviewed by the Attorney General to ensure that it will enable survivor's pension to be paid to the legal spouse of the deceased and any former spouse, subject to their satisfying the conditions for entitlement.  The definition contained in section 3, as initiated, provides that the spouse, in relation to a survivor who has been married more than once, refers only to the survivor's last spouse and for this purpose &ldquo;spouse&rdquo; shall be construed as including a party to a marriage that has been dissolved, being a dissolution that is recognised as valid in the State.  Opposition Deputies suggested that this definition should be amended to read &ldquo;parties to marriages that have been dissolved being dissolutions that are recognised as valid in the State&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Minister had that definition reviewed by the Attorney General, as promised, and he confirmed that the definition as it stands is correct.  He considers that in order to clarify the intention of the definition, the words &ldquo;that last&rdquo; be inserted in the definition so that it would read as follows &ldquo;spouse in relation to a survivor who has been married more than once refers only to the survivor's last spouse and for that purpose that last spouse shall be construed as including a party to a marriage that has been dissolved being a dissolution that is recognised as valid in the State&rdquo;. I propose to amend section 10 (3) as advised by the Attorney General.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The case of Koigi wa Wamwere is a matter of grave concern not only here but internationally.  The issues involved go far beyond the concerns of the individual and his co-accused.  The individual concerned was arrested on what has been described by all independent observers at the trial as trumped up charges of a criminal nature.  It is obvious that President Moi and the Kenyan Government want to give vent to the lie that there is no such thing as a political prisoner in Kenya.  The fashion is to concoct criminal charges and arrest any person who opposes its regime in a peaceful manner by <Col N="695" /> operating through the democratic process. It is of the utmost importance that our Government makes it clear to the regime in Kenya, which is supposed to be part of the fledgling democracies emerging in the world, that democracy does not mean dictatorship with a new brand image slapped to it.  That is crucial in the case of developing Third World countries and there is a responsibility on this and other Governments throughout the world to ensure that message is given in the loudest and most forceful terms to any Government or country that seeks to abuse democracy and the rights of the individual.</P>
    <P>The facts highlight that this person was arrested on a trumped up charge of robbery, which it is clear neither he nor his co-accused committed.  They have been tortured relentlessly while in custody. Some of the individuals concerned have been beaten even within the confines of the courtroom.  This is an unacceptable way to treat people, particularly in a country that is a signatory to the covenants on civil and political rights.  It is also a signatory to the African Charter on Human and People's Rights.  In a country that is a signatory to such charters, surely it is not possible for us in the free world to stand by and see an individual's rights trampled on by President Moi and his so-called Government.  Democracy is the only way forward for most countries in Africa but it will not be achieved if democratic nations stand by and allow its abuse to be part and parcel of the order of the day.</P>
    <P>There are three things this Government must do in this case.  It is pointless expressing concern to me or to the converted. Concern must be expressed in forceful terms directly to the Kenyan Government, stating that we are deeply concerned that prisoners of conscience should face false charges because they have been involved in non-violent opposition to the Kenyan Government.  We should also express deep concern that the trial should conform to international standards for fair trial.  International <Col N="696" /> observers from the Bar Association in the United Kingdom have stated independently and publicly that the trial is a sham, that the behaviour of the judge is disgraceful, that it does not conform to any standards of international practice of law and that it is an outrage.  We should call immediately on the Kenyan Government for the unconditional release of the four prisoners of conscience involved.</P>
    <P>The Paris group of countries that support the Kenyan Government by providing aid to it are due to meet on 24 July.</P>
    <P>It is clear that no decision on this trial will be forthcoming on the part of the Kenyan authorities until the Paris group of countries have met and decided on new additional aid to Kenya.</P>
    <P>Our Government, in association with its counterparts within the European Union, must exert the greatest pressure on the Kenyan Government in advance of that Paris group of countries meeting on 24 July.  If no positive action has been taken in the interim by the Kenyan Government, those countries attending that meeting will have to take a clear decision, that is to discontinue their support until such time as the human rights abuses in Kenya which have reached outrageous proportions, cease.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister of State will make absolutely clear to the Kenyan Government our abhorrence of such abuses, if the Government has not already done so.</P>

      <P>Mr. Koigi wa Wamwere, is a former member of the Kenyan Parliament and human rights activist who has been a prominent critic of the Kenyan authorities who have detained and imprisoned him for several long periods without trial since 1975.  He was last detained in November 1993 along with his brother Charles Kuria Wamwere, his cousin James Maigwa and G. G. Njuguna Ngengi a councillor and former army officer.  They were brought to trial on 12 April 1994.  All four were charged <Col N="697" /> with attempted robbery with violence, an offence which carries a mandatory life sentence.</P>
      <P>Amnesty International believes that the charges against them are false and that all four are prisoners of conscience. It also believes that the cases against them are weak and that all four have alibis.  For example, Mr. Koigi wa Wamwere claims to have been in Nairobi staying with a prominent human rights lawyer, Gibson Kamau Kuria, at the time of the alleged raid on Bahati police station upon which charges against him and his co-accused were based.</P>
      <P>Since it began in April 1994, the trial has been attended regularly by observers from international human rights and legal organisations, including Amnesty International, the British and Norwegian Bar Associations, the International Bar Association, the Kenyan Law Society and the International Committee of Jurists.</P>
      <P>Several aspects of the trial, which is being held at magistrate court level, have given rise to concern.  These include the fact that the defence claims that it did not get adequate time to prepare its case.  Nor did it have advance disclosure of prosecution evidence and witnesses which would facilitate such preparation.  The presiding magistrate records the proceedings.  Consequently the record of the trial is not considered to be sufficiently independent by observers.  Therefore, they have questioned the reliability of the record of the proceedings and the impartiality with which they have been conducted.  They have also pointed to inconsistencies and flaws in the prosecution case.  Observers and others attending the trial have reported harassment by the authorities and that they were ordered by the magistrate not to take notes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In June 1994 a constitutional application was made to the Kenyan High Court to have the case dismissed on the basis of bias in favour of the prosecution and lack of fair trial contrary to the Kenyan Constitution.  This application was dismissed in August 1994 and the <Col N="698" /> trial referred back to its original magistrate.</P>
    <P>In view of the circumstances and concerns surrounding this case the Government supported a démarche by the EU to the Attorney General of Kenya, Mr. Amos Wako, on 16 August 1994.  In it the EU expressed its concern about the legal treatment of the case of Mr. Koigi wa Wamwere.  It also urged that he be given a fair trial.</P>
    <P>In its statement to the informal international donors' consultative group meeting held on 15-16 December 1994, the EU specifically referred to the Koigi wa Wamwere case and the fact that it continued to raise concerns as to the independence of the judiciary and its ability to provide for just and fair trials in cases with political connotations.</P>
    <P>The case of Mr. Koigi wa Wamwere is indicative of continued decline in the political and human rights situation in Kenya.  The ethnic situation in the country and the manner in which it is being dealt with at local level continues to be a cause of serious concern.  The forced removal of the population of Maela camp last December was a particular case in point.  On 7 February 1995 the EU responded to this and similar incidents by making a démarche to the Kenyan Minister for Foreign Affairs.  The EU is also very concerned about recent restrictions on the printed media, opposition parties and other democratic institutions.</P>
    <P>At the 51st Session of the UN Human Rights Commission in Geneva last February, Ireland and the member states of the European Union called on the Kenyan Government to take measures which would alleviate ethnic tensions in consultation with the UNDP and all concerned parties.</P>
    <P>The EU and its member states are the largest donors to Kenya.  The Irish Government considers it essential that the Union increase pressure on the Kenyan Government to take necessary measures to support proper democracy and recognition of human rights.  This view is shared by other member states and international donors who have <Col N="699" /> called for an unscheduled donors meeting in Paris in July to which Deputy Cullen referred.  This reflects their fears that Kenya is backing away from democratic reform.</P>
    <P>While the EU has been expressing its concern about these matters in its démarches and in its regular contacts with the Kenyan Government, it is the Government's view that more effective pressure must be exerted.  The case of Mr. Koigi wa Wamwere and his co-accused are an essential element in this approach which is under consideration in my Department which we shall raise with EU partners.</P>

      <P>Sdaly, ecstasy has become the recreational drug of choice of many young people and is now being traded openly in Dublin city and other areas at between £8 and £15 per tablet. It is predicted that its price will fall to around £3 per tablet by the end of the year.  It may be significant that one of its street nicknames is &ldquo;smarties&rdquo;, a small, brightly coloured sweet.  Ecstasy is being marketed by the drug dealers as a &ldquo;safe&rdquo; recreational drug with few, if any, side effects, as a sort of &ldquo;prozac&rdquo; for dancers.</P>
      <P>However, the reality is very different, brought home sadly again yesterday when a 19 year old youth collapsed and died after taking ecstasy at a rave disco in the Point Depot.  We all know he was not the first victim of ecstasy.  It has been estimated that up to 14 people may have died after taking the drug, which would not include the unknown number who have suffered severe side effects which can affect the heart and other internal organs leading to severe dehydration and over-heating of the body.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that many people who take ecstasy would not dream of taking so-called hard drugs such as heroin, fearing that the health consequences of taking such hard drugs would be too great.  However, they appear to believe <Col N="700" /> that ecstasy is a safe drug over which they have personal control.</P>
    <P>Obviously the requisite message is not getting across, which is that there is no such thing as a &ldquo;safe fix&rdquo;.  While its control comprises one part of the solution &mdash; dealt with extensively last evening &mdash; there are limits to what can be done to control a drug as easily concealed as is ecstasy.  Nonetheless there should be increased vigilance on the part of the Garda and dance promoters at any event where ecstasy is known to be sold.</P>
    <P>Another component of the solution is to tackle its supply at source at international level.  We are all aware that Ireland does not produce the drug ecstasy, that it is imported largely from the former Eastern European countries. I am informed that its manufacture is easy, that border controls are few and it is predicted we shall have a glut of it on the market very soon, if that is not already the case.  The sad reality is that it may cost a mere £1 for a pill in the very near future.</P>
    <P>There is obvious need for concerted action at European Union level to prevent the drug ecstasy entering the European Union initially, together with support mechanisms to help the authorities in countries such as Czechoslovakia and Hungary where I understand the drug is being manufactured.</P>
    <P>In addition to the outside forces we must also educate our young people about the dangers of ecstasy but it is my understanding that nothing significant is being done at present in this respect. We have to take the message to the classrooms and the venues where ecstasy and similar substances are consumed or abused.  We must ensure that young people who may be tempted to buy some type of drug are fully informed of the health consequences. We must ensure also that clear, no holes barred leaflets are distributed in public houses or venues where concerts or dances are held.  I recognise that regardless of all the warnings that may be given, ecstasy will still be taken by some vulnerable young people.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="701" /> One of the effects of taking ecstasy is severe dehydration and to compensate for that, abusers must drink copious amounts of water.  I understand the proprietors of some venues in the city and elsewhere at which ecstasy is taken are charging for water in the full knowledge that the drug is being consumed on their premises.  We must examine the possibility for introducing measures that will make organisers and proprietors responsible for the substances consumed on their premises to ensure they do not become the silent accomplices of the drug dealers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. O'Shea)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this important issue. I listened with interest to the points he has made.  Recent tragic cases have given rise to concern about the use of legal and illegal substances by young people and I welcome this opportunity to outline the action taken by my Department to promote awareness of the dangers of using ecstasy and other harmful drugs.</P>
      <P>For many years, the Health Promotion Unit of my Department has been actively working to increase awareness of the dangers of drug abuse and provides a series of booklets and leaflets for health professionals and the general public, some of which specifically refer to ecstasy.  In addition, the unit has also developed a range of educational and health promotion materials especially targeted at young people.</P>
      <P>The provision of accurate information about the effects of drug taking is an essential component of any drug education programme.  However, effective and extensive education about drugs also involves examining attitudes, promoting decision-making skills and building self-esteem.  A crucial part of the process is using appropriate settings where young people will be receptive to health messages and where the necessary life skills can be encouraged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Young people are subject to many influences and the school provides an <Col N="702" /> ideal setting for primary drug prevention strategies.  An important element of the fight against drug abuse is the substance abuse prevention programme which is now available to all second level schools.  This programme was developed by the Health Promotion Unit and the psychological service of the Department of Education with assistance from the Mater Dei counselling service.  It is a comprehensive drug education programme, the aim of which is to enable students to take charge of their mental health and develop their ability to make informed decisions about the use of drugs in their lives.  Programme materials include information on ecstasy and its effects.</P>
    <P>The Health Promotion Unit also runs a community based training programme with the health boards which examines the extent of the drug problem at local level and seeks to provide local answers. It involves a multi-sectoral approach for health and education professionals and others interested in drug related problems which they meet in their own work. I understand the response of those who have participated in the training has been extremely positive.</P>
    <P>A further programme is the pilot project on parent education on alcohol, drugs and family communication which was developed by the Health Promotion Unit in conjunction with the Cork Social and Health Education Project of the Southern Health Board.  This project recognises that young people and their parents must be provided with assistance to help them deal with the problems posed by licit and illicit drugs.  A course has been developed which focuses not only on the drugs themselves but also on the skills and personal attributes that help people to deal with drugs.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be interested to learn that the Health Promotion Unit has also worked with the National Youth Council of Ireland to develop solvent abuse materials for use by youth leaders, instructors of community training workshops and Youthreach projects as well <Col N="703" /> as the formal education sector.  The contents of the package are also flexible enough for use in special schools, residential centres and as an aid to the juvenile liaison scheme of the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>On an international level, the second European Drug Prevention Week took place last October.  The week initiated a <Col N="704" /> major drug misuse prevention drive throughout Europe and its purpose was to educate the public and young people in particular regarding the dangers of drug misuse and to highlight drug prevention strategies already in place.</P>
    <P>I hope this clarifies the situation which I will keep under review.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 11 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 29 June 1995.</P>

However, I can assure the Deputy that Ireland will continue to benefit from Structural Funds after 1999, even if not at the current level.  I would also like to assure the Deputy that the Government will be considering all the possible scenarios and their implications, including the consequences of any change in the level of Structural Funding for Ireland as a result of the increase in Ireland's GDP <i>per capita</i> as a percentage of the European Union average, and will ensure that Departments and agencies adjust to the post-1999 situation with minimum budgetary dislocation.  The improvement in Ireland's relative position is welcome and is a tribute to the successful implementation of our stabilisation policies and to the productive uses which continue to be made of the EU Structural Funds.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>There are formal procedures laid down for competitive tendering in all facets of public procurement including the engagement of consultants for construction projects, whether by Government Departments, local authorities or State Bodies and I would like to assure the Deputy that the Government is fully committed to observance of these procedures by all concerned.  Competitive tendering should always be used unless there are exceptional reasons for proceeding otherwise.  This policy ensures the maximisation of value for money for taxpayers and openness and fairness for suppliers.  All suitable suppliers should have a fair chance and opportunity of competing for public business. Depending on the circumstances and legal requirements the operation of a panel of suitably qualified consultants, as recommended by the Deputy, may or may not be an appropriate mechanism to apply when consultants for construction projects are being engaged. However, irrespective of what mechanism is employed the principles I have just mentioned should be observed.</P>
      <P>The rules governing procurement depend on firstly, the nature of the contracting body and secondly, the value of the contract in question.  There is a legal obligation to advertise throughout the EU and follow procedures set out in the relevant EU Directives for contracts above specified values.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of contracts below the EU value thresholds the procedures are set out in my Department's <i>Public Procurement</i> booklet.  These guidelines are <Col N="449" /> directed at Government Departments, local and regional authorities and other bodies dependent on State funding.  In the case of State Bodies my Department's <i>State Bodies Guidelines</i> advise that competitive tendering should be normal procedure save in exceptional circumstances.</P>
    <P>There are two EU Directives governing service contracts over certain threshold values.  Consultancies of the type referred to in the question are covered by those Directives where the estimated value of a contract exceeds the threshold value in the Directive.  The formal procedures outlined include advertisement in the official journal of the European Communities and the award of contracts using an open procedure where anyone can apply, or a restricted procedure where the Contracting Authority advertises for interested parties, and then forms a short list from which tenders are invited, or a negotiated procedure where there is an advertisement and then negotiations are carried out with one or more selected companies.</P>
    <P>There are also specific national guidelines relating to the engagement of consultants. These procedures are also set out in the booklet <i>Public Procurement.</i></P>
    <P>In summary, the basic policy is that public procurement should always be conducted on the basis of market-testing and executed in as open a manner as possible.  Where EU Directives apply, the procedures set out therein have their own built-in safeguards to ensure fair competition.  Given the procedures and safeguards already in place, which I am generally satisfied are adequate, and the binding legal requirements of the EU Directives, it would be neither practicable nor lawful for me to direct that a panel or list system of qualified construction consultants be used in every instance.  Only general guidance can be issued centrally given the hundreds of contracting entities in the public sector and the very wide variety in the types and scale of procurement involved.</P>

      <P>At budget time I announced an average live register forecast of 266,000 for 1995. As is customary at this time of the year, my Department is reviewing its economic forecasts, including the live register forecast, in an integrated fashion.  Its considered view, including any revision to the initial estimate of the live register for 1995, will be published in <i>Economic Review and Outlook</i> in the weeks ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, at this stage it does seem clear from developments to date that the average live register this year will exceed the initial forecast by some thousands. It is too early yet to predict the <Col N="453" /> overall outturn on the Social Welfare Vote with any degree of certainty.  My Department will be reviewing expenditure trends closely on a continuing basis, and will take into account any revision to the live register, as well as all other relevant factors, in its assessment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 31 and 45 together.  On the basis of current levels of disposals, it is estimated that the full year cost to the Exchequer arising from a reduction in the 40 per cent and 27 per cent rates of capital gains tax to 20 per cent would be in the region of £15 million.  Information is not available on the buoyancy in capital gains tax revenue which would result from such a reduction or on the effect it would have on income tax and corporation tax yields.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the nominal rate of capital gains tax might appear high, the reality is that, when account is taken of <Col N="454" /> indexation and other reliefs, the effective rate of capital gains tax is often well below the 40 per cent rate.  A number of reliefs, including the 27 per cent rate for certain share investments, have been introduced or extended in the last few years to encourage enterprise and job creation.  These concessions are felt to be more effective than a general rate reduction.</P>
    <P>In setting the rate of capital gains tax, the Government must take tax equity considerations into account and the rate should bear a reasonable comparison with the rates applying to earned income.  It is also important to minimise disparities with income tax and corporation tax rates in order to reduce the scope for avoidance through the conversion of income into capital gains.</P>
    <P>I have no detailed information on the numbers who emigrate to avoid capital gains tax.  I should add that under revised rules on residence which were introduced in the Finance Act, 1994, it is now more difficult for individuals who are ordinarily resident in the State to avoid capital gains tax by leaving the country.  This is because under the revised rules, ordinary residence can only be shed after three consecutive years of non-residence, whereas previously it was possible for an individual to lose his or her ordinary residence on the date of departure from the State.  On the other hand, the rules allow non-residents to spend more time in the State without becoming resident and thus they provide an alternative for those who might otherwise have opted for long term emigration for tax reasons.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 32, 98, 99 and 100 together.</P>
      <P>INTERREG I was intended to help Border areas prepare for a Community without internal frontiers.  The Joint Operational Programme prepared by Ireland and Northern Ireland for the period 1991-93 aimed to assist the Border region overcome its special development problems and to promote the creation and development of networks of cross-Border co-operation in order to maximise growth potential.</P>
      <P>It was the third largest INTERREG programme in the EC, with a total of (in 1993 terms) £66 million provided by the Community, £34 million provided by national administrations and £18 million by private funding.  This amount was split evenly between North and South. The programme covered the six Border counties of Donegal, Leitrim, Sligo, Cavan, Monaghan and Louth in the Republic, and all of Northern Ireland with the exception of Belfast.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="456" /> The programme was multi-sectoral and covered the following sub-programmes &mdash; tourism, agriculture-fisheries-forestry, human resources, environmental protection and regional development. The regional development sub-programme included community development, infrastructure (mainly roads and energy) and cross-Border linkages between bodies engaged in economic development.</P>
    <P>The programme allowed for assistance to be given to both stand-alone and cross-Border projects and over 600 applications for assistance were received.  More than half of these were successful in getting funding under INTERREG.</P>
    <P>The independent evaluation carried out on behalf of the Commission by consultants KPMG showed that by and large the programme had succeeded quite well.  Many worthwhile projects were assisted and a good co-operative foundation was laid for the successor programme which is now in operation.</P>
    <P>Because of the nature of the programme it is not appropriate to break funding down on a county by county basis.  However, I append a tabular statement to this reply setting out the details of the projects funded and their locations.  The Deputy should bear in mind that many of the projects have a multi-county impact.</P>
    <P>Final payments under the programme fall to be made by the end of the month. All of the projects funded succeeded to a greater or lesser degree in meeting the objectives of the programme.  It is not known if some projects failed to go ahead because of difficulties in sourcing matching funding.  Adequate provision has been made under INTERREG II for matching funding in cases where an otherwise worthwhile project would fail to proceed.  I should add, however, that taking a real stake in a project, whether financially or otherwise, confers a sense of ownership of the project on the promoters.</P>
    <P>There have been no instances where allocated money has had to be returned unspent to the EU.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="457" /> INTERREG I was a multisectoral programme covering a wide and diverse range of project areas.  It also supported developments under other Operational Programmes and IFI programmes.  Its aims were to support economic development in the eligible area and to support <Col N="458" /> cross-Border co-operation.  While it obviously had a significant impact, in terms of the funding available to it, on employment levels it is not possible to easily disaggregate figures in terms of employment created directly attributable to the programme.</P>

      <P>Because of its clandestine nature, it is not possible to provide reliable estimates of the level of smuggling or of its effect on Exchequer revenue.</P>
      <P>There is evidence, based on intelligence and levels of Customs and Excise seizures, of considerable smuggling of tobacco products &mdash; mainly cigarettes &mdash; and of some smuggling of alcoholic drink.  Over £1 million worth of smuggled tobacco products were seized by Customs in 1994 and over £3 million worth in 1995 to date.  About £250,000 worth of smuggled alcoholic drinks, including spirits, beer and wine, were seized in 1994 and some £75,000 worth in 1995 to date.</P>
      <P>The Revenue Commissioners are alive to the dangers of smuggling of high duty goods of these kinds and, as the level of seizures would indicate, they take appropriate measures to combat this trafficking.</P>
      <P>Particular measures are being taken at present to combat the illegal importation of cigarettes and other tobacco products.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the institution of delegated administrative budgets in most parts of the Civil Service, my specific authority has not been required to fill or create posts up to higher executive officer level in Civil Service Departments or offices which operate administrative budgets. Such Departments and offices, once they adhered to the conditions of delegation, were free to create and fill posts in this category (which account for the majority of posts in the Civil Service) without reference to my Department.</P>
      <P>My sanction was, however, required for the creation of posts at these levels in the very limited area of the Civil Service where administrative budgets do not apply.</P>
      <P>My Department did not between 1 January and 9 June 1995 impose any restrictions on the filling of vacancies which occcured in grades outside the administrative budget categories.</P>
      <P>The number of new posts in categories for which my authority was required and obtained since January of this year, was 132 of which 90 were sanctioned in the period to the start of May, 26 during the month of May and 16 during the period 1 June to 8 June.</P>
      <P>Under the recent Government decision, the creation of any further posts will now require Government approval.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Departments are however obliged to notify my Department of the numbers <Col N="483" /> of staff serving at the end of each quarter. The number of non-industrial civil servants serving on 31 March, 1995 (the last date for which figures were notified in the normal course) was 28,616.</P>
    <P>Vacancies within that number and posts subsequently authorised by me or by the Government from 9 June 1995 may be filled in the normal way.</P>
    <P>In so far as the public service bodies under my aegis are concerned, the only institutions concerned are the IPA and the ESRI.  There have been no additional recruitment and no new posts have been approved in the IPA this year.  An additional seven persons have been recruited in the ESRI since 1 January 1995 &mdash; on a fully self-financing basis.</P>

      <P>The North-West Study was commissioned by the North-West Region Cross-Border Group with the aim of setting out a preliminary economic development strategy for the region. This in turn led on to a more detailed development programme for the North-West Region set out in <i>A Window of Opportunity,</i> which was published last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The development programme set out a comprehensive approach to meeting the perceived needs of the region.  The group distributed copies of the programme to the various sectoral Departments and agencies involved and bilateral contacts between the group and individual Departments in relation to the specific proposals put forward have been made.  The individual elements of the programme fall to be addresssed under the various operational programmes of the 1994-99 Community Support Framework together with <Col N="484" /> Community initiatives where relevant, in addition to the North's Single Programme Document.</P>

    <P>It is not possible to say precisely how much of the figure of £143 million for land and buildings is attributable to the transfer of houses but I am informed that the yield on such transfers was probably in the region of £70 million in 1994.  In the absence of a comprehensive property tax, stamp duties make a very significant contribution to Exchequer revenues and help to keep other taxes down.  As part of the overall strategy of broadening the tax base and reducing the relative tax burden on earned income, the policy of the Government is to ensure that the revenue yield from stamp duties is maintained and, where possible, increased.  This is in line with the commitment under the <i>Programme <Col N="485" /> for Competitiveness and Work</i> to increase the yield from capital taxes.</P>

      <P>My response to this question is confined to the Civil Service, as my responsibility in this matter does not extend to the wider public service.  In so far as the Civil Service is concerned, there are standard disciplinary procedures for dealing with civil servants who have been found to be negligent in the performance of their official duties.  I have no plans to change <Col N="486" /> these procedures.  However, as indicated in the answer to a separate question, all aspects of personnel management in the Civil Service, including the somewhat cumbersome tenure arrangements, are currently under examination in the context of the strategic management initiative and I hope to be in a position to report on the outcome to those deliberations later in the year.</P>

      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to the Community Support Framework for Ireland, 1994-99 which was negotiated on the basis of the National Plan submitted to the Commission.  The Community Support Framework provides for a mid-term review which will take place in the first half of 1997.  I consider it would be inappropriate to bring forward the mid-term review of the Community Support Framework at this stage.  However, I have asked Departments responsible for the various operational programmes under the framework to examine the possibilities for refocussing their programmes in the light of the proposals put forward under the Programme for Peace and Reconciliation. I do not envisage that a major recasting of programmes will be necessary. The Departments concerned will examine possibilities such as advancing the timing of projects located within the Border region and increased opportunities for cross-Border co-operation.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 47 and 65 together.</P>
      <P>I have no proposals to bring forward legislation to give the National Treasury Management Agency statutory responsibility for the debt management of the semi-State bodies, local authorities, health boards or other agencies of the State.</P>
      <P>The National Treasury Management Agency was set up under the National Treasury Management Agency Act, 1990.  The principal functions of the agency are to perform, on behalf of the Minister for Finance, the functions of the Minister delegated to it by Order of the Government under section 5 of that Act.  The functions that may be delegated to the agency are those relating to borrowing and management of the national debt.  The national debt is the biggest portfolio of debt in the State and requires specific attention.  The National Treasury Management Agency was set up for this purpose.  The entire portfolio managed by the agency consists of State debt.</P>
      <P>The debt of semi-State or State sponsored bodies, even when it carries a State guarantee, is not part of the national debt.  The management by NTMA of the liabilities of such bodies does not arise under the 1990 Act.  Some of the debt of these bodies carries a State guarantee.  Were any such guarantee ever to be invoked or were such debt to be assumed by the State, thereby becoming part of the national debt, naturally it would fall to be managed by the NTMA.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="488" /> My Department co-ordinates the borrowing activities of the NTMA and other public sector agencies involved in borrowing, such as the commercial semi-State bodies and the intervention agency.  I issue formal guidelines to the NTMA and my Department seeks to influence the borrowing activities of the public sector bodies within that overall framework.  The advice and expertise of the NTMA is already availed of by my Department in the performance of these functions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, a Customs National Drugs Team &mdash; CNDT &mdash; was set up by the Revenue Commissioners with the advent of the Single Market and in view of the increased role Ireland is now required to play in protecting our coastline as well as that of the European Union, in the battle against the illegal importation of drugs.  The CNDT, comprising over 70 staff, consists of intelligence units, operational units, maritime units and sniffer-dog units which are strategically placed throughout the country.  All units are mobile and are based at locations covering the entire coastline.  These specialist officials supplement the general cadre of Customs and Excise staff who are also responsible for the detection and prevention of drug smuggling as part of their normal duties.</P>
      <P>The CNDT includes five maritime units, located in Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Sligo.  Two units are located in Cork as a response to the level of activity which has been encountered along the south west coast and because Cork is used as a training base for maritime duties.  Maritime Units use semi-rigid inflatable boats at inshore locations in coastal waters.  The Naval Service and the Air Corps provide assistance to Customs, on request, when there is need to monitor suspect ships and yachts out to sea.</P>
      <P>There are six sniffer-dog units, located in Dublin &mdash; which has two units, Rosslare, Cork, Shannon and Sligo.  Because they are mobile, these units may also be deployed to other locations as necessary.</P>
      <P>CNDT staff are provided with specialist equipment, including fibrescopes, to facilitate examination of cargo, etc., radio scanners, cameras, surveillance equipment and night scopes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because of the vital role played by <Col N="490" /> intelligence in combating drug smuggling, the Customs Service has devoted considerable attention to ways of enhancing intelligence gathering. Twenty-eight staff of the CNDT are specially dedicated to this work.  The co-operation and assistance of trade associations as well as individual companies involved in the movement of goods and persons has been enlisted through the conclusion of Memoranda of Understanding. These are aimed at heightening the awareness of employees of shipping companies, freight forwarders, ferry companies and so on to the dangers of drugs smuggling and provide them with ready channels of communication with Customs.</P>
    <P>The assistance of the general public has been sought through the drug watch programme under which Customs enlist the assistance of coastal communities, maritime personnel and people living near airfields by encouraging them to report unusual occurrences in their areas to Customs by Freefone or Freepost.</P>
    <P>At international level, the Customs Service maintains close liaison and shares intelligence with other EU countries through direct contacts as well as through a computerised network known as the customs information system. There are now in excess of 300 computer terminals strategically located in EU members states, including Ireland, at all major ports and other entry points. The system provides a mechanism whereby Customs staff throughout the Union may send and receive at local operational level timely intelligence on the movement of suspect passengers, freight and transport.  The Customs Service maintains contact and exchanges intelligence with non-EU countries in the context of Ireland's membership of the World Customs Organisation, which has now over 130 member countries.</P>
    <P>There is close co-operation between all Government agencies &mdash; Customs, Garda, the Naval Service and the Air Corps &mdash; in the battle against drug smuggling.  The Deputy may also know that the Minister for Justice, on foot of <Col N="491" /> a report prepared in her Department in consultation with all concerned, will be putting proposals to Government to ensure that this co-operation is maximised.</P>
    <P>Funding of almost £500,000 has been received from the EU Commission which has been used to acquire inshore craft, vehicles and specialist equipment for the CNDT.  The possibilities for obtaining further EU funding to assist in combating drug smuggling are kept continually in mind.</P>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners are fully alert to the danger of drug smuggling by sea and other routes.  I am satisfied that the measures I have outlined above provide adequate protection against the illegal importation of drugs. These measures will continue to be kept under review in the light of experience.</P>

      <P>No payments have been made by my Department in respect of compensation for flooding victims in the years 1992 to date in 1995.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that, following severe flooding in June 1993, the Irish Red Cross Society distributed a total of £160,000 which was provided by the <Col N="492" /> European Union for humanitarian aid to victims of flooding at that time. Details of individual recipients of that aid are not available to me.  I understand, however, that no distinction was drawn between urban and rural dwellers in assessing the need for assistance. Indeed the Deputy may be interested to know that approximately 61 per cent of the funds available on that occasion were allocated to Dublin recipients.</P>
    <P>I am advised that the payments issued by the Irish Red Cross Society included an amount of £44,000 approximately paid in 26 cases in Baldoyle.  It may be of interest to the Deputy that £44,585 was paid out on 38 cases in the Clondalkin area.</P>
    <P>I understand that to date no compensation payments, other than payments under the Department of Agriculture scheme, have been made to recent victims of flooding in South Galway.</P>
    <P>Following representations by the Government, a sum of approximately £260,000 was made available by the European Union for distribution by the Irish Red Cross Society as humanitarian aid to victims of flooding in Ireland following the bad weather earlier this year. I understand the society is currently completing its processing of the many requests for assistance it has received and will very shortly issue payments.</P>
    <P>As in 1993, hardship is being assessed under a number of criteria, the principal ones being, death, personal injury, damage to home and loss of income.  No distinction is being drawn, between claimants in urban and rural areas.</P>
    <P>The Government has decided in principle to allocate additional funds for humanitarian relief to the victims of the flooding earlier this year.  I will shortly make proposals to Government regarding the nature of and extent of these funds, which it is intended will also be distributed by the Irish Red Cross Society on the basis of the criteria I have already outlined as well as their recommendations which I expect to receive shortly.</P>
    <P>It is not possible to use the funds currently available to deal with problems <Col N="493" /> arising from the 1993 flooding.  The suggestion that there is a discrepancy between the treatment of urban and rural victims is without foundation.  I would emphasise that the payments to which I have referred are for humanitarian aid and not compensation.  Payment of compensation to victims of flooding is a matter for insurance companies or others who may have a legal liability towards them.  The State has no such liability and decided to act in this particular instance because of the exceptionally severe hardship caused to many people by the flooding earlier this year.  This must not be regarded as a precedent for the future and people must ensure, in so far as they possibly can, that they adequately insure their property or businesses against losses arising from flooding or similar causes.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 51 and 68 together.</P>
      <P>The Treaty on European Union sets out a timetable for movement to the third stage of economic and monetary union-EMU.  Briefly, if a majority of member states meets the conditions, the third stage can begin in 1997; if a date for the start of the third stage has not been set by end-1997, it will begin in 1999.  There is now broad acceptance among member states that 1999 is the realistic date for the formation of EMU.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="494" /> As Deputies will recall, a referendum was held in Ireland in 1992 which endorsed the Treaty on Europen Union, including its centrepiece, EMU. Ireland's objective continues to be to qualify to be among the first group of member states to move to European Monetary Union under the Treaty.  It is not at present expected that EMU will be on the agenda for the 1996 Inter-governmental Conference.</P>
    <P>The European Commission has recently produced a Green Paper on the Practical Arrangements for the Introduction of the Single Currency.  The Green Paper, as a discussion document, raises many issues which need to be addressed by all member states in the coming months and years.  I agree with the view set out in the Green Paper that an extensive communication campaign is needed to bring home to citizens the advantages of the single currency and to set out the practical measures needed to introduce it.  The European Monetary Institute, the forerunner of the European Central Bank, will also be producing a paper later this year on movement to a single currency; in addition, this week's European Council in Cannes has also requested studies to be prepared on the move to EMU and a single currency.</P>
    <P>Each member state will be considering how best to prepare for EMU and a single currency.  My Department has already initiated such preparations.  At this stage, it would be premature to publish a policy paper on Ireland's approach to EMU, or to set up a national forum on the issue.  However, I can assure Deputies that wide-ranging consultation will take place with the relevant interests on this matter of vital public importance.</P>

      <P>There are no plans for the introduction of impositions of the type referred to by the Deputy.  I am satisfied that, taking account of our economic, social and budgetary requirements as well as our obligations under EU law, the current indirect tax arrangements are appropriate. In the normal course of events, these arrangements will fall to be reviewed in the run-up to the 1996 budget.</P>

      <P>The position regarding the tenure of civil servants is governed by the Civil Service Regulation Act, 1956.  Established civil servants hold office at the will and pleasure of the Government which, in effect, means that a Government decision is required to dismiss an established civil servant.  Unestablished civil servants may be dismissed by the &ldquo;appropriate authority&rdquo; who is usually the Minister in the Department in which the civil servant is serving.  These provisions in no way preclude the dismissal of a civil servant for performance deficiences. The procedure is, however, cumbersome. All aspects of personnel practice in the Civil Service are currently under examination in the context of the strategic management initiative.  I hope to be in a position to report on the outcome of these deliberations later in the year.</P>

      <P>Statistics are not kept in a fashion which would allow a precise answer to be provided to the question.  However, it is estimated that during 1994 approximately 250,000 social welfare recipients paid some tax on their incomes.  The extent to which taxation actually arises depends essentially on the amount of other income which the social welfare recipient, or the recipient's spouse, receives in the same tax year.  If there is no other income in addition to the social welfare payment, the existing exemption limits and allowances, nearly all cases, will ensure that there is no tax to be paid.</P>

      <P>The tax wedge in respect of a single person, full rate PRSI contributor, earning the estimated average industrial wage is 37.3 per cent in 1995.  Without the measures introduced in the 1995 budget the tax wedge would have been 39.1 per cent.  A reduction of 1.8 percentage points in the tax wedge in respect of single persons on the estimated average industrial wage is a significant achievement and reflects the Government's commitment to reduce the tax/PRSI burden.</P>

      <P>The Treaty on European Union sets out a timetable for movement to the third stage of economic and monetary union &mdash; EMU.  Briefly, if a majority of member states meets the conditions, the third stage can begin in 1997; if a date for the start of the third stage has not been set by the end of 1997, the third stage will begin in 1999.  There is now broad acceptance among member states that 1999 is the realistic date for the formation of Economic and Monetary Union.</P>
      <P>Ireland's objective continues to be to qualify to be among the first group of member states to move to Economic and Monetary Union under the treaty. As the Deputy will be aware, both in 1994 and this year the European Commission judged Ireland to be among the very small number of member states not to have an excessive deficit as defined in the Treaty on European Union.  The Government is committed to ensuring that Ireland continues to meet the treaty convergence criteria for movement to Economic and Monetary Union.</P>

      <P>A draft operational programme under the EU Community initiative for peace and reconciliation in Northern Ireland and the Border counties is at present being discussed by the relevant Government Departments in Ireland and Northern <Col N="499" /> Ireland and the European Commission services.  It is hoped that the programme will be approved by the Commission during the course of July.</P>
      <P>As part of the preparation of the programme an extensive consultative process was carried out.  The Department of Finance and Personnel, Northern Ireland, held a one day conference in Newcastle, County Down, on 29 March 1995 at which some 200 delegates from the state, business and voluntary sectors attended.  A second one day conference was organised by the Department of Finance, in conjunction with the Border Regional Authority, in the Slieve Russell Hotel, Ballyconnell, County Cavan, on 25 April.  The attendance was over 200 representing a wide range of interests and the conference successfully achieved its primary objective of giving these interests an opportunity to put their views.  Another conference was organised by the North's three MEPs in Belfast on 11 April last.</P>
      <P>The Border Regional Authority, with the support of its EU operational committee, made a submission, at my invitation, on its views on the content of the programme.  The EU operational committee of the Regional Authority includes representatives of local authorities, county managers, the social partners, the community and voluntary sector and Government Departments.</P>
      <P>All Government Departments were also consulted and they in turn will have consulted their respective agencies as appropriate.  Many representatives of the development agencies also participated in the Ballyconnell Conference and in the work of the EU operational committee of the Regional Authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very important that the best possible use is made of the funding available in support of the objective of the initiative of promoting peace and reconciliation in Northern Ireland and the Border counties in the context of the peace process. This has been an important consideration in preparing the programme. The effective use of the funding will be <Col N="500" /> monitored and evaluated throughout the implemenation phase also.</P>

      <P>As indicated in my response to a written question put down by Deputy Liam Burke for answer on Tuesday, 13 June last, the preparation of the 1996 budget is proceeding on the normal schedule, under which the Financial Statement is presented on the final Wednesday of January.  In accordance with established practice, the precise date of the 1996 budget will be announced in this House on the last sitting day before the Christmas recess.</P>
      <P>I am aware that the presentation of the budget prior to the year to which it refers offers certain theoretical advantages. However, such a change would require careful planning of what would be a significant adjustment of the existing budgetary timetable.</P>
      <P>I would add that the present arrangements, which minimise the uncertainties inherent in an autumn projection of the current-year's fiscal outturn and the budget-year's economic outlook, have served the nation well.  Indeed, Deputies will be aware that for the second consecutive year, Ireland remains in the very small minority of EU member states which currently satisfy the Masstricht Treaty's fiscal convergence criteria.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 69 and 109 together.</P>
      <P>The Government clearly signalled in <i>A Government of Renewal</i> its intention to introduce legislation to extend the powers of the Office of the Ombudsman. It stated that: &ldquo;legislation will be introduced to extend the remit of the Ombudsman, including the Administrative Procedures Act.  Exemptions to the Ombudsman's jurisdiction in existing law will be reviewed, with a view to a major extension of the Ombudsman's powers.  This will cover a wide range of agencies established since 1980, as well as agencies to be established in the future&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Obviously, any proposed root and branch re-examination of the remit of the Office of the Ombudsman is something which could not be undertaken, in <Col N="502" /> any meaningful way, without first ascertaining the views of the Ombudsman and of his staff on the operation of the existing Act and the powers and responsibilities arising therefrom.</P>
    <P>As is explained in the recently published Annual Report of the Ombudsman, discussions on the content and scope of the proposed legislation have already commenced.  These discussions have to date taken the form of exchanges of views both orally and in writing.  Formal meetings will be arranged as and when necessary.</P>
    <P>It is hoped to bring this dialogue to a conclusion shortly so that draft proposals for legislation can be prepared and circulated in the normal way with a view to bringing draft legislation before the Oireachtas without delay.</P>

    <P>As indicated in the written reply of my predecessor, Deputy Jim Higgins, then Minister of State, to the Deputy's earlier question No. 94 of 28 February <Col N="515" /> 1995, Column 1779, Volume 449, of the Official Report), the Commissioners of Public Works were unable to agree terms for a lease of this former school property to the local Community Development Association and had no option but to offer it for sale on the open market.  The purchase offers received were unacceptable and, as the Association has recently indicated that it is prepared to reconsider the question of taking a lease of the premises for community purposes, the Commissioners are in correspondence with them with a view to ascertaining whether mutually acceptable terms for such leasehold interest can be agreed.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The North-West Cross-Border Group comprised the local authority areas of Donegal County Council, Derry City Council, Strabane District Council and Limavady Borough Council.  The group submitted 14 project applications in all under the INTERREG I Programme, some cross-Border, some Northern Ireland only and some Ireland only.  Of the 14 applications received one was approved under the economic development measure which was jointly administered by my Department and the Department of Economic Development <Col N="516" /> (NI).  This involved the funding of a secretariat headed by a development officer and whose chief functions were the implementation throughout the four council areas of short term projects; facilitating of larger key projects; communications and public relations and organising/mobilising of the Group. The Secretariat addressed the recognised need for a mechanism of co-ordinating the Cross-Border Group's recommendations put forward in the North West study.  Grants of IR£30,491 and Stg £31,650 were paid to the group in respect of the secretariat.</P>
    <P>Five other projects submitted by the group were approved and carried out by the appropriate promoters.  The Water Quality Management Plan for Lough Foyle and Strabane-Londonderry road improvement were approved by the Department of Environment (NI). Other applications approved for road improvements by the Department of the Environment in the South included roads linking the Beleek/Ballyshannon, Bridgend-Buncrana and Letterkenny.</P>
    <P>Applications received under the INTERREG I Programme were examined by joint North-South working groups comprising of representatives of the relevant sectoral Departments and agencies involved in the particular areas involved.  All relevant technical expertise was thus available to the Departments concerned and, where applications had to be rejected, there were sound economic grounds for so doing. The European Commission was satisfied with the operation of the working groups and approved similar arrangements under INTERREG II.  My Department had no function in the examination or approval of project applications other than those received under the Economic Development measure of the programme.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="520" /> Legislation dealing with semi-State companies and financial institutions sets out the responsibilities of the Minister for Finance in relation to borrowings.  In all cases the consent of the relevant Minister and of the Minister for Finance is required for borrowings of such bodies. In addition, legislation usually enables the Minister for Finance, on the recommendation of the relevant Minister, to guarantee individual loans.</P>
    <P>Information on borrowings guaranteed by the Minister for Finance is published in the annual Finance Accounts which is laid before the House.  Semi-State companies include details of borrowings in their Annual Reports and Accounts which are also laid before the House.</P>
    <P>The level of borrowings of individual State bodies is, in the first instance, a matter for the Boards of the bodies concerned having regard to their overall financial position and for the appropriate Minister within the framework of the legislation applicable to borrowings.</P>
    <P>In considering requests for approval to borrow, the relevant Minister obtains all the information required in relation to operations, results and financial position from the bodies concerned.</P>

      <Quest>if he has satisfied himself with the targets set out in Ireland's Convergence Programme 1994-1996; if the programme has been altered; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>Ireland's Medium-Term Convergence Programme 1994-1996 sets out targets in relation to meeting the fiscal convergence criteria of the Maastricht Treaty, as well as macroeconomic forecasts for Irish economic growth over the period of the programme.</P>
      <P>I believe that the target for the Government deficit contained in the programme, which is to keep the General Government Deficit below 3 per cent of GDP each year, is satisfactory and is sufficient to ensure that Ireland will continue to satisfy the fiscal convergence criteria for participation in phase 3 of Economic and Monetary Union.  Of course, performance proved better than this target in 1994, and looks like doing so again this year.  In 1994, the General Government Deficit amounted to only 2.3 per cent of GDP, and this year it is projected that the deficit will again be comfortably below the 3 per cent target.</P>
      <P>As well as bettering the fiscal deficit target contained in the Convergence Programme, the Irish economy has also out-performed the forecasts for economic growth which were contained in the programme.  Real GDP growth of 3.9 per cent was projected in 1994, followed by 4 per cent in 1995 and 1996. However, the actual rate of growth in 1994 was much higher than had been expected, with real GDP growing by over 6 per cent.  As a result of this and the lower fiscal deficit I already referred to, the General Government Debt to GDP ratio fell by almost 7 percentage points in 1994 and, based on the current outlook for economic growth and annual deficits below 3 per cent of GDP, further significant falls are expected this year and next year. According to both the OECD and the European Commission, the outlook, now, for 1995-96 is also for higher growth rates than those envisaged in the Convergence Programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to the question of whether the Convergence Programme has been altered, this issue does not arise.  The Convergence Programme was submitted to the Council of Finance Ministers as a three-year programme, and was approved by them.  It is not intended to alter the programme, although my Department does, of course, brief the European Commission in relation to <Col N="523" /> how our latest projections compare with those contained in the programme.</P>

      <P>The information sought by the Deputy, as at each year-end, is set out in the following tabular statement.  It should be noted that the national debt figure for 1977 is calculated on a different basis from the figures for 1983 and subsequent years.  This arises from changes which were made in the method of calculation in 1987 under which circular transfers resulting from the enactment of the Local Loans Fund (Amendment) Act, 1987 were eliminated and a deduction in respect of liquid assets was introduced.  The figures for 1983 and subsequent years have been calculated on this amended basis.  For comparative purposes, the Deputy may wish to note that the national debt figure for 1982 under the old method of calculation was £12,817 million, while the corresponding figure on the amended basis was £11,669 million.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Coveney)</NameTxt>
      <P>Earlier this year, the Government secured funds amounting to approximately £260,000 from the European Union for humanitarian aid for the relief of hardship suffered by the victims of the flooding including victims in South Galway. These funds are being distributed by the Irish Red Cross Society.  The society inserted advertisements in the newspapers inviting people who had suffered hardship to submit details to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government intends as an exceptional measure, in view of the unusually severe hardship caused to many people by the flooding earlier this year to make additional funds available for humanitarian relief.  I will shortly make a submission to Government on the nature and extent of that package.  It is intended that any funds made available <Col N="525" /> will also be distributed by the Irish Red Cross Society.</P>
    <P>There are a number of houses in the South Galway area which have suffered severe damage as a result of prolonged flooding.  These have been examined by technical officers of the Office of Public Works and I expect to receive their report on the condition of the houses shortly.  When I receive their report I will decide what, if any further action is open to me in relation to relocation.</P>
    <P>My predecessor, Deputy Higgins, has had a number of meetings with the South Galway Flood Victims' Action Group at which the problems of the area were outlined.  A document setting out the views of the action group in relation to the issues of compensation and relocation was given to him and to representatives of the Office of Public Works.  I met representatives of the group who were accompanied by Deputies Connaughton, Kitt, Molloy, Treacy and Senator Fahey last Thursday. My officials and I are well aware at this stage of the extent of suffering among victims of the flooding in South Galway and indeed elsewhere.  I have however invited the Action Group to forward the details of their losses to me. I understand the information has already been supplied to the Irish Red Cross Society.  A meeting with the loss assessor can be arranged, if necessary, following receipt of the information.</P>

      <Quest>when a report on the South Galway flooding crisis last winter will be ready for publication in view of the fact that the appointment of a consultant has been delayed to July 1995.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Coveney)</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been no unavoidable delay in the appointment of a consultant to undertake the multi-disciplinary study into the causes of and possible solutions to the unique flooding problems in South Galway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The time allowed to consultants to submit outline proposals showing how <Col N="526" /> they would undertake the proposed study was kept to the minimum which is necessary to comply with EU Regulations.</P>
    <P>Applications to be considered for the Commission were received from thirty-one multi-disciplinary teams of consultants both Irish, British and European. All of these submissions had to be examined in detail and following completion of this examination six firms were invited to make more detailed oral presentations of their proposals.</P>
    <P>A short-list of three firms have been invited to submit firm proposals including time-scale and costs for undertaking the proposed study.  These proposals are to be submitted by 29th June.  They will be considered immediately they are received and it is intended to make an appointment as early as possible.</P>
    <P>The causes of the flooding in South Galway are unique and very complex. The area is extremely environmentally sensitive.  The team appointed to undertake the proposed study must establish clearly their capacity to deal with all aspects of the problem and any potential solutions and it has therefore been necessary to follow the course of action outlined above in order to try to ensure that the best possible team of consultants is selected.</P>
    <P>It is not possible at this stage to say when the final report and recommendations will be available.  However, given the complexity of the issues involved it is likely to take some considerable time. It will be a condition of the Commission that an interim report will be submitted within 2 months.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East)</i>: The signature or ratification of international treaties or Conventions is so far as they affect the health area are not currently under consideration.</P>
      <P>The Hague Convention on Protection of Children and Co-operation in respect of Intercountry Adoption was completed in May 1993.  The primary objectives of the convention are to provide safeguards to prevent the sale of, or trafficking in, children and to establish a system of co-operation amongst countries in order to ensure that intercountry adoptions take place in the best interests of the children concerned.</P>
      <P>The National Health Strategy contains a commitment to amend the current law on the recognition of foreign adoptions so as to enable the convention to be ratified here.  However, the absolute legislative priorities in the child care area are the implemenation of the Child Care Act and the preparation of new legislation to improve the position of natural fathers of non-marital children in the adoption process in the light of the judgment of the European Court of Human Rights in the case of Keegan <i>v.</i> Ireland.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East)</i>: The Eastern Health Board is responsible for the provision of <Col N="531" /> psychiatric services in south-east Dublin. The total budget for psychiatric services in this area is approximately £4.7 million.  The Hospitaller Order of St. John of God operates Cluain Mhuire, the community-based psychiatric service in the catchment on an agency basis for the Eastern Health Board.  This service has a budget of £4.2 million, composed of £3.7 million for adult psychiatry and £0.5 million for child psychiatry.  In addition to the services provided in the catchment by the Cluain Mhuire service, the Eastern Health Board provides subvention in the order of £0.5 million for nursing home placements directly related to general psychiatry and psychiatry of the elderly.  This includes a sum of £70,000 for the care of elderly patients whose primary need is non-psychiatric and whose care needs were paid out of the special hospital care programme until this year.</P>
      <P>While <i>per capita</i> expenditure on mental health can be calculated on the basis of total expenditure and population numbers, such a crude figure is not used in the determination of budgetary requirements.  Factors such as demographic structure, the geographic spread of the population and the type of service being provided &mdash; whether institutionally or community-based &mdash; are more important determinants of budget need and when these are taken into account the Eastern Health Board is satisfied that the service provided in south-east Dublin compares favourably with other services in its functional area.</P>

      <P>The provision of signposting on public roads is the statutory responsibility of local authorities.  I understand from Dublin Corporation that the quays are just one of several signposted routes to Dublin Port.  The full implementation of a comprehensive heavy goods vehicle management system in the city centre along the lines recommended in the final report of the Dublin Transportation Initiative is contingent upon the completion of the C-Ring motorway and the Northern Port Access Route.  It is only at that stage that the removal of heavy goods vehicle traffic from the quays will become a realistic option.</P>

      <P>Ireland has concluded bilateral social security agreements with Australia, Austria, Canada, New Zealand, United States and Quebec.  All of these agreements have been put into operation.  Ireland is currently negotiating social security agreements with Switzerland and the United Kingdom, in respect of the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man.  The proposed agreement with the United Kingdom covers non-EU nationals.</P>
      <P>The main purpose of bilateral social security agreements is to protect the pension rights of workers who have had periods of social insurance in both countries. The agreements also allow workers who are sent by their Irish employer to work in the other State, for short periods, to remain in the Irish social insurances system, thereby being exempt from double payment of social security contributions.</P>

      <P>The determination of applications from non-Irish nationals for residency in this country is a matter for the Department of Justice.  There are four <Col N="555" /> main categories involved: refugees, programme refugees, asylum seekers and people here on humanitarian leave.</P>
      <P>Those awarded refugee status have work permits and visas and as a consequence, have the same social welfare entitlements as an Irish citizen.</P>
      <P>Programme refugees are groups of people who are admitted to Ireland under a Government decision for resettlement in Ireland.  The Refugee Agency under the aegis of the Department of Foreign Affairs co-ordinates measures to integrate refugees admitted to Ireland under Government decisions.</P>
      <P>These refugees include Bosnians and Vietnamese boat people.  They have work permits and visas and also have the same social welfare entitlements as an Irish citizen.</P>
      <P>The 1951 Convention on Refugees and Asylum Seekers specifies the right of refugees but leaves a lot of discretion with individual states regarding asylum seekers.  Asylum seekers who enter Ireland apply for the status of refugees and are granted permission to remain in the State while their applications are being processed.  They do not have work permits and as a consequence, have no entitlement to unemployment payments. However, they may qualify for assistance under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme if they have no other income.</P>
      <P>People who are granted leave to remain in Ireland on humanitarian grounds have the same social welfare entitlements as persons recognised as refugees.</P>

      <P>Child benefit is payable at double the normal rate in respect of each child, where three or more children are born together.  A special once-off grant of £400 is also payable where four or more children are born together, £300 on the birth of triplets and £200 in respect of twins.  These arrangements are designed to give recognition to the special nature of such births and the additional costs associated with them.</P>
      <P>The Government is committed to improving the child benefit scheme and this year's budget increased the monthly rates of payment from £20 to £27 for each of the first two children and from £25 to £32 for the third and subsequent children.  The benefit is also being extended to include 18 year olds who are in full-time education or are physically or mentally handicapped.</P>
      <P>While I appreciate the view expressed by the Deputy, paying double rates of child benefit in respect of twins would have long term expenditure implications. The expenditure involved could not be undertaken this year, but I do intend to keep this question under review in the context of future budgets.</P>

      <P>Regular part-time employees also enjoy the protection of the Maternity Protection Act, 1991, Adoptive Leave Act, 1995 and the Terms of Employment (Information) Act, 1994.</P>
      <P>Because of the serious situation that has developed in regard to the Dunnes Stores dispute, the Labour Court has intervened in accordance with the terms of section 26 (5) of the Industrial Relations Act.  Invitations have been issued to both parties to attend the court today to assist the court in its investigation.  I understand that Dunnes Stores is making a submission to the Labour Court.  I hope that this initiative by the court will lead to an early resolution of the dispute.</P>
