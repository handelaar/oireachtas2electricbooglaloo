      <P>Before proceeding further I feel sure the Members of the House would wish very much to join with me in extending a most warm welcome to a parliamentary delegation from Namibia, led by the Honourable Doreen Sioka, MP.  It is our hope that their stay with us in Ireland will be most happy, successful and memorable.  On behalf of the House I extend to you céad míle fáilte, a hundred thousand welcomes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to seek leave to more the Adjournment of the Dáil in accordance with Standing Order 30 to discuss a matter of urgent public importance, that is to afford the Taoiseach the opportunity to outline to the House the reasons he failed to disclose to the Dáil <Col N="814" /> yesterday the material reasons for the delay in dealing with important correspondence relating to the Fr. Brendan Smyth case and why he did not disclose all the facts known to him and, further, whether he disclosed, at the time of the formation of the Government, to his Coalition partners the private understanding he had with the Attorney General relating to future investigations in his office concerning the Fr. Brendan Smyth case.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to announce for the information of the Dáil, (1) that having informed the Commission constituted as provided in section 2 of Article 14 of the Constitution, that Dáil Éireann has approved my nomination of Deputy Seán Barrett to be a member of the Government, the Commission yesterday appointed him accordingly; (2) I subsequently assigned the Department of Defence and the Department of Marine to Deputy Seán Barrett and, further, that the Government today appointed Deputy Jim Higgins as Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach with special responsibility as Government Whip and as Minister of State at the Department of Defence and, further, Deputy Hugh Coveney as Minister of State at the Department of Finance.</P>

    <Title>Order of Business.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 11, 12, 3, 1 and statements in relation to the Attorney General's office to take place at 12 noon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is also proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that: 1. In relation to the statements, the following arrangements shall apply &mdash; (i)  The opening statements of the Taoiseach, <Col N="815" /> the main spokespersons for the Fianna Fáil Party and the Progressive Democrats Party shall not exceed ten minutes in each case; (ii) the statement of each other member called upon shall not exceed five minutes in each case; (iii) the Taoiseach shall be called upon not later than 12.45 p.m. to make a statement in reply not exceeding five minutes; (iv) following the Taoiseach's concluding statement, the Taoiseach shall take questions for a period not exceeding ten minutes, and (v) the order shall resume thereafter.</P>
    <P>2.  Private Members' Business shall be No. 20 and the proceedings thereon shall be brought to a conclusion at 8.30 p.m. tonight.</P>

      <P>There are two matters to put before the House.  May I ask, first, if the proposal for dealing with statements is satisfactory and agreed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it is not agreed because we regard this matter as extremely urgent.  We would rather that the debate on this issue started immediately. My Fianna Fáil colleagues, having considered the matter this morning and in an effort to be helpful, would agree, if the Taoiseach needs further time to prepare full answers, to amend the Order of Business by deleting part of (iv) which would then read &ldquo;Following the Taoiseach's concluding statement, the Taoiseach shall take questions&rdquo; and delete (v) in total.  The idea is to debate this matter in a question and answer session because statements are almost meaningless.  What is important is the question and answer session.  The matter being dealt with is what resulted in the Taoiseach getting into Government. The issue is that he appointed the Attorney General&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to make <Col N="816" /> a statement.  I want to make a few points.  That is reasonable enough.  On coming to office the Taoiseach appointed a constitutional law officer of the State.  The constitutional law officer of the State made certain facts available to the Taoiseach.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>We want an open ended question and answer session.  We want an opportunity on this side of the House to ask questions about the matters on which the Taoiseach misled the House yesterday.  The questions tabled yesterday were intertwined and the Taoiseach did not answer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has made a very serious and false allegation in suggesting that I misled the House.  I did not do so and I will clearly indicate that. In an effort to accommodate the Deputy I will be quite happy to answer any questions about this matter for as long as anyone wishes to ask them.  I warmly welcome the opportunity and will not hesitate to answer questions for a longer period than ten minutes if agreement can be reached on that.  From the point <Col N="817" /> of view of the order of the House, if the Opposition are unhappy with ten minutes &mdash; and I quite understand they might be and I have no problem with changing it &mdash; the Government and Opposition Whips might meet to fix a time that is satisfactory to all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no need for a meeting of the Whips.  I propose that Nos. 1, 2 and 3 stand, that No. 4 should read &ldquo;Following the Taoiseach's concluding statement the Taoiseach shall take questions.&rdquo;, and that No. 5 be deleted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to get into a tangle on this.  From the point of view of the ordering of the House there has to be some time limit.  I would be quite happy with 30 minutes.  I have no wish to avoid answering any questions other than those in respect of which I must abide by the requirement of fair procedure as I outlined in the House yesterday.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is unreal to go into other business before this.  The time of 12 noon which is suggested here should be amended to 11 a.m.  The remainder of the motion should then read as amended by Deputy Ahern.  The question and answer session will not be open ended but will conclude at 2.30 p.m. That will give ample time to people to make statements and ask questions, and it is hoped that on this occasion we will get answers which we failed to get yesterday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>We agree to Deputy O'Malley's proposal.  However, there is a sos from 1.30 p.m. to 2.30 p.m. so the entire debate will take only an hour and a half.  However, I am sure we can make <Col N="818" /> arrangements to conclude the debate at 2.30 p.m. rather than 1.30 p.m.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We can cancel the sos and have the questions during that time. That would not bother me in the least. The House can ask as many questions as often as it likes and I will give full and truthful answers other than in respect of matters where I believe there is a problem in regard to fair procedure.  I have nothing to worry about concerning any questions that any Member of this House wishes to put to me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not, a Cheann Comhairle.  On a point of order, the officials under the control of the Chair wrote to Deputy O'Donnell on Monday to the effect that the questions which the Taoiseach is so anxious to answer now would be transferred to the Minister for Justice on 9 June.  I am asking the Chair to protect Deputies in this House.  I am asking him to stand up for the rights of individual Deputies and to stand up against a Taoiseach who is hiding behind the Chair's officials in a dishonest attempt to avoid answering questions in the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the question Deputy McDowell has put, I will deal with it now.  First, there were other problems with which I had to deal over the weekend.  I believe officials of my Department inquired, with my knowledge, about the appropriateness of transferring this question to the Department of Justice, since previous questions on that matter had been answered by that Department.  However, when I came to address the issue I came to the conclusion that it would not be appropriate to transfer the matter to the Department of Justice, that as I am the Minister, under whose aegis the Attorney General operates, I should answer the question, and that is why I answered it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have indicated to the House that I am willing to answer questions for as long as necessary and everybody will now accept that, although they may have come into the House assuming otherwise.  From the point of view of ensuring that the order of the House is effective and that business can be transacted, I suggest that the Whips meet to fix on a time for this. That is the most reasonable way of proceeding rather than dealing with it on the floor of the House.  I will meet any reasonable request.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>We will agree to that if the question and answer session is to <Col N="820" /> be open ended, which means that it will go on until 1.30 p.m. or 2.30 p.m. &mdash; the Whips will discuss that.  The Taoiseach referred three times already this morning to matters that he cannot answer.  I ask the Taoiseach, before we agree to the proposed arrangement, to assure us that he will not say he cannot answer questions on matters relating to the Attorney General, because one of the main issues the Taoiseach must answer in this debate is why the Attorney General sent letters back to the committee of inquiry and refused to indicate that he was compromised on this issue.  If the Taoiseach refuses to answer these questions we cannot debate the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I am asked to agree to terms for this debate although the Taoiseach, on three occasions, has said there are certain questions he will not answer. The Attorney General refused to declare to the committee of inquiry, a committee of this House, that he was compromised on this issue.  If the Taoiseach says he cannot answer questions relating to that, we cannot debate it.  I know why he cannot answer.  It is because he is acting for Mr. Russell.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the constraint which anybody who understands the <Col N="822" /> law, industrial relations and the requirements of fair procedure should understand. Any Deputy who puts me in a position where I am being asked to answer questions that they know in their hearts I cannot answer on that basis is not serving the interests of natural justice. I appeal to Deputies who naturally have a political agenda to pursue &mdash; that is perfectly all right &mdash; to pursue it with respect for the rights of individuals whose cases have to be looked at by me in an objective and unprejudiced way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Stagg)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 10, lines 9 and 10, to delete &ldquo;for contravening this section&rdquo; and &ldquo;substitute &ldquo;under this section&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>These amendments, which arise from consideration of the Bill by the Select Committee on Enterprise and Economic Strategy, make it clear that the defence in section 11 (2) applies in any action brought against the retailer under section 11 (4).  Amendment No. 2 brings section 11 (4) into line with section 11 (3) by specifying that the retailer will be liable to compensate the consumer for damage caused to the consumer as a result of his reliance on information in a brochure which is false or misleading.</P>
      <P>On Committee Stage, Deputy Brennan referred to section 11 (4) which relates to the retailer's liability for damage caused to the consumer by the consumer's reliance on false and misleading information contained in a brochure supplied by the retailer. Deputy Brennan proposed that the retailer should be liable under section 11 (4) only if he or she supplied a brochure knowing or having reasonable cause to believe that it was false or misleading. The Deputy referred to similar wording in section 10 (2).  I undertook to consider this proposal further before Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 10 (2) related to brochure content.  This subsection provides that a retailer shall not supply a brochure knowing, or having reasonable cause to believe, that it does not contain the <Col N="828" /> information specified in section 10 (1). Summary proceedings may be brought and prosecuted by the Director of Consumer Affairs for offences under section 10 (2).  Before bringing proceedings the onus will be on the director to be satisfied that the retailer knew or had reasonable cause to believe that the brochure did not comply with the requirements of the section.  The director has the necessary expertise and resources for this function.</P>
    <P>Under section 11 (4) a retailer will be liable to compensate the consumer for any damage caused to the consumer as a result of the consumer's reliance on information in the brochure or which is false or misleading given by the retailer in respect of the brochure.  Proceedings under section 11 (4) would be a matter for civil action between the consumer and the retailer.  Under the wording proposed by Deputy Brennan the consumer could take an action against the retailer for offences under section 11 (4) only in cases where the retailer knew or had reasonable cause to believe that the brochure contained false or misleading information.  This would not be appropriate as it would place an unreasonable onus on the consumer and limit unduly the scope for an action against the retailer.  It could be very difficult for an individual consumer to prove that the retailer supplied the brochure which the retailer knew contained false or misleading information.</P>
    <P>For offences under section 10 (2), which deals with brochure content, the Director of Consumer Affairs has the resources necessary to establish whether the retailer knew, or had reasonable cause to believe, that the brochure did not comply with the requirements of section 10.  This is not a parallel with putting the onus on a consumer to prove that the retailer supplied a brochure which the retailer knew, or had reasonable cause to believe, contained false or misleading information.</P>
    <P>The main purpose of the legislation is to make it easier for the consumer to seek redress in the event of, for <Col N="829" /> example, a brochure being false or misleading. In any civil action brought under section 11 (4) the defence in section 11 (2) will apply.  Under this provision it will be a defence for the retailer to show he did not know and had no reason to suspect that the brochure or other descriptive matter contained false or misleading information.  The two amendments I proposed to section 11 will make it clear that a retailer's defence under section 11 (2) also applies to section 11 (4).  This meets Deputy Brennan's proposal.  The retailer will be liable to compensate the consumer only for damage caused as a result of the consumer's reliance on false or misleading information contained in the brochure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister to taking the import of my proposal into account in amendment No. 1 and I have no difficulty supporting it.  He has, however, done that within certain confines in that he has retained the liability of the retailer.  In amendment No. 2 he proposes to add a phrase to section 11(4) to read: &ldquo;A retailer shall be liable to compensate the consumer for any damage caused to the consumer as a direct consequence of and attributable to the consumer's reliance on information which is false or misleading&rdquo;. The phrase &ldquo;which is false or misleading&rdquo; will be included, but I am not sure how it will be proved.  In whose opinion will it be considered false or misleading? The Minister will encounter some legal difficulties by including such a bald statement as &ldquo;information which is false or misleading&rdquo;.  I understand the Minister's intent and I support its general thrust.  I will vote against the amendment, but I doubt whether the phrase &ldquo;which is false or misleading&rdquo; will hold up at the end of the day.  I suppose that is a matter for the courts to decide.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My concern is that it is not acceptable that the consumer should claim against a small travel agent, say, one in a rural area, on foot of misleading information in a brochure.  I asked the Minister to consider on Report Stage whether it is <Col N="830" /> intended that a high street rural travel agent should be totally responsible for every sentence in a holiday brochure produced by a multinational firm.  The Minister has stuck to making the retailer liable, but allowing him or her a defence.  I proposed not making the retailer liable unless it could be shown that he or she should have been aware of the matter.  I made the point that there are 300 or more small travel agents around the country each employing two or three persons who would find it extremely difficult, if not impossible, to stand over every line of every brochure produced by a multinational company.</P>
    <P>The Bill also makes it clear that the organiser can be sued.  I made the point on Committee Stage that whatever about suing the organiser, which is legitimate enough we need to consider the large number of small travel agents who could not reasonably be expected to stand over every line of every brouchure that comes in.  If a small travel agency in Naas or Maynooth displays a brochure promoting apartments in Athens &mdash; one of a few hundred such brochures &mdash; which contains false or misleading information, it would be difficult for that agency to know it.  The Minister had addressed this problem by making it the responsibility of the travel agent to know and to offer as a defence that he could not reasonably have known.  That is a fair compromise which I do not have any difficulty accepting.</P>
    <P>I want to highlight on this Stage the large number of small travel agents who are affected by additional consumer protection legislation.  I know there must be a fine balance and we must have consumer protection, but it must be reasonable and sensible.  Given that we have a few hundred small travel agents each employing two or three people, it is not reasonable to expect them to be familiar with the minutiae of international travel brouchures and to check them out.  Should they be expected to fly to destinations to check on information in a brochure or should they accept the organiser's word?  I am <Col N="831" /> extremely anxious that retailers should only be held liable for information of which they could be reasonably expected to be aware given their size.  It is one thing to expect a large travel agency employing a few hundred employees with legal and other specialist departments to know about these things, but another for a small travel agency employing two or three people who take brochures at face value.  I thank the Minister for taking on board the import of what I said and I support these amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for bringing this valid point to my attention and I have gone as far as is possible to accommodate it in the Bill.  The Director of Consumer Affairs will be responsible for implementing the legislation.  It will be his job to ensure that either the organiser or the travel agent does not issue brochures containing false information and he will have the resources which would not be available to the ordinary consumer to check that.  The consumer will be entitled to take action against a retailer when damage arises as a result of misleading information, but the retailer will have a defence and would not be liable for damages unless he knowingly distributed misleading information.  In some cases where the organiser is outside the jurisdiction only the retailer is available to the Director of Consumer Affairs.  We have had large-scale instances in the recent past, for example during the last World Cup, where only the travel agent could be contacted by the consumer regarding a possible claim but no liability was involved in those instances.</P>

      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to make it clear that information about health formalities which must be given to the consumer before the conclusion of a contract refers to requirements imposed by national administrations in other countries.  This amendment meets proposals made by a number of Deputies during Second and Committee Stages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment relates to section 12 (1) (b) and the Minister proposes after the word &ldquo;required&rdquo; to insert the words &ldquo;by national administrations&rdquo;.  That subsection will now read &ldquo;information about health formalities required by national administrations for the journey and the stay;&rdquo;.  I thank the Minister for tabling this amendment as I and other Deputies raised this point on Committee Stage.  I am not sure if it completely meets the concerns of Deputies, but I acknowledge the Minister has met us halfway.  It is consoling to know that points raised on Committee Stage are listened to and studied by the Minister and his officials. The Bill requires intending passengers to be given information on a range of issues including health formalities for their journey and holiday stay.  That requirement is onerous and could result in many legal actions being taken.  If a person contracted the AIDS virus during a stay abroad, there could be considerable scope for legal action as the Bill requires a travel agent to indicate in advance to the traveller all necessary health formalities.  The word &ldquo;formalities&rdquo; concerned me somewhat because it is not defined.  Perhaps the Minister's amendment which includes formalities required by national administrations <Col N="833" /> may make the position clearer.  Presumably that means the administration of the country a person visits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps it might also extend to include EU and international health requirements.  In acceding to my request to define what he means by &ldquo;health formalities&rdquo;, is the Minister weakening the provision by limiting it to national administrations when he means health formalities which could reasonably be brought to one's attention by travel agents?</P>
      <P>The Bill requires travel agents to have expertise and competence in the area of health but surely small travel agents could not be expected to have such competence. The Bill is still somewhat loose in that travel agents must make the traveller aware of the health requirements of national administration.  I can only assume that the travel agent must contact the department of health in the country to which a person is travelling to establish its health requirements. Do small travel agents in, say, Ballinasloe or Naas booking a ticket for a person to travel to Greece have to telephone the Greek Embassy in Dublin to obtain a copy of the health requirements in Greece or are they expected to have an up-to-date copy of such information in their offices? Will it suffice if they merely refer the person to a leaflet and leave it to that person to obtain it?  On Committee Stage I suggested a way around this difficulty would be for the Department of Health to make a standard health briefing leaflet available to all travel agents which they could pass on to travellers.</P>
      <P>The Minister has met us half way, but while it may be realistic to expect small travel agents to brief travellers on the health formalities required for their journey, it is unrealistic to expect them to brief them on the health formalities required for their stay in another country. Is that a reasonable way to proceed?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I spoke at length on this matter on Committee Stage and I am pleased the Minister's attitude is more forthcoming now.  I thank him for at least agreeing to amend the section, although not in as comprehensive a manner as I requested.  However, his amendment strengthens the section in that contracts now entered into place an obligation on the organiser of the package holiday to provide information to customers about the health formalities required by the national administrations in the countries to which they are travelling. The Bill as originally drafted obliged the organiser of the package only to provide information on health formalities required for the journey, which was rather vague.</P>
      <P>On Committee Stage I highlighted the many diseases with which people travelling abroad can become infected. People buying a holiday package should be made aware not only of the health risks involved, but of how they can be immunised against diseases with which they may come into contact.  How will organisers of package holidays meet this new requirement?  What obligations will be placed on them?  Will they be obliged to supply the addresses of health centres where people can be immunised against diseases?  In other words, will information be supplied to enable people to comply with the health requirements of other national administrations?  It would be helpful if the Minister elaborated on how he perceives the section as amended being implemented in practice. To what extent will organisers of package holidays be obliged to comply with the regulations?  Will the requirement apply to the organiser of the package holiday?  Subsequent to the passing of the Bill, does the Minister propose introducing regulations setting out in detail how the section can be complied with to ensure maximum protection for the consumer?</P>

People are not allowed to enter certain countries without being inoculated against yellow fever and tour operators inform people travelling to such countries of the requirement to have such inoculation.  There is no particular health requirement of which I am aware for people entering this country, but that does not apply to all countries.

      <P>I thank Deputies for their general support for the Bill and for their co-operation at the various Stages.  We accepted a number of amendments on Committee Stage and earlier.  I do not feel it is necessary to go through the main provisions of the Bill; they are well known to the House and, arising from the debate on the various issues, they are now known to the public also.  We will be making lead-in time available to the trade to allow it to implement the Bill.</P>
      <P>I again assure the House that business travel will not come under the terms of the Bill, the regulations being drawn up by the Director of Consumer Affairs will ensure that.  The concern about bed and breakfast accommodation will not be met by the provisions of the Bill except where packages are offered, which is the case in only a small minority of bed and breakfasts.  I am quite satisfied also that the prices of holidays will not be adversely affected by the terms of the Bill.  This is an important Bill from the point of view of consumer protection.  I again thank the Deputies for their support for the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for his positive response to our suggestions on Committee Stage.  It is heartening that he listened to us and took our suggestions on board.  I am disappointed, however, with a number of aspects of the Bill and perhaps the Minister of State might address those when he is concluding the debate.</P>
      <P>I made the point on Committee Stage that there should be a waiting period of three months following enactment of the Bill before the Act comes into force rather than having it come into force immediately or leaving it open-ended. Also, will the Minister consider amending the definition of a package, which I do not believe he has done?  There must not be any doubt that business travel is excluded from the provisions of the Bill. The Minister will recall that we were concerned on Second Stage that a business trip to London for a few days would be regarded as a package if more than one or two items were involved. Many newspapers carry advertisements for airline companies which offer the flight, hotel accommodation, a car and other frills as a complete package.  That would seem to make an ordinary trip to London on business for two days a package holiday.  That is unreasonable. We should not interfere with business travel because businesses are well able to look after their own interests in regard to their business travel arrangements. They do not require the protection of legislation such as this which is designed, primarily, for the ordinary traveller.  Perhaps the Minister will explain how that is dealt with in the Bill, if at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We also made the point that this legislation should not apply to brochures already in circulation.  I recall the Minister saying he would address that because the same brochures could not be constantly reproduced, as a means of getting around the Act, and that there would have to be some cutoff point.  We believe this legislation should not apply to brochures already in <Col N="838" /> circulation because, like all good legislation, it should not be retrospective. People should know that when the Bill comes into law, it is from then on they must deal with it rather than be concerned about brochures already in circulation.</P>
    <P>We already discussed the question of the liability of retailers for information contained in a brochure.  Again, I thank the Minister for the amendment in this regard but I continue to believe that small travel agencies will find it difficult to make this work.  I foresee a lot of necessary litigation because of that particular section.</P>
    <P>The section about which I was most concerned and on which I dealt with at length on Committee Stage involved the question of insurance.  The Bill imposes requirements of minimum liability insurance cover.  I note the Minister's statement that this Bill will not push up prices but I believe it will increase insurance costs and introduce a culture of litigation to holiday travel, the likes of which we have never seen before. The Bill will also push up the cost of package holidays.  I gave an example of an Irish holidaymaker who buys a package holiday to the Bahamas from an Irish tour operator.  If he contracts food poisoning while on holiday he then has to sue the hotel in the Bahamas for compensation, which would be difficult.</P>
    <P>My main concern about this Bill is its effect on the cost of holidays and the effect it will have on small travel agencies who will find it impossible to get insurance cover.  The owner of a small travel agency told me that he expected his insurance premium to increase by at least 40 to 50 per cent.</P>

      <P>I dealt with the insurance industry for five years as a Minister and I know a little about it.  I know that when the possibility of suing a travel agent is put into legislation, people will avail of it.  They will sue travel agents for every problem that arises. If an insurance broker for a travel agent is renewing the premium, the first thing he will say to that travel agent is that, because of all the new risks to which the travel agent is exposed, the insurance premium must be increased.  That is not irresponsible; it is commercial logic.</P>

      <P>I said on Committee Stage that the experience in Germany and the UK was that insurance costs to small travel agencies increased by 40 per cent when the legislation came into effect.  I put that to the Minister on Committee Stage.  He did not say then it was irresponsible but I presume he checked it out in the meantime and he has now concluded that it had that effect in the UK and in Germany.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>It did not have the effect of a 40 per cent increase.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is my information. If the Minister has contrary information I would welcome hearing it today.  When I put that suggestion to the Minister on Committee Stage, I presume he had an opportunity to clarify it. The Minister has more resources available to him than I do to check these matters.  The British and Dutch experience has shown that insurance costs increased by 40 per cent in three years. It is not irresponsible of me to bring to the attention of the Minister international evidence, which he should have, before he imposes additional insurance burdens on travel agents.  The Minister admitted on Committee Stage that there would be an increase in <Col N="840" /> prices.  He assumed, therefore, that costs would increase.  Are we quibbling only about the amount?  If that is the case, I will not argue about it.  I am merely indicating what happened in other regimes.</P>
      <P>When the directive came into effect in Germany, dissatisfied holiday makers took their case to court.  I mentioned earlier cases where a travel agent was sued, for example, because the holiday was rained out and where a holiday maker fell off a camel in Tunisia.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>My point is that it leads to litigation.  I came across a case where a holiday maker who suffered what he called pyschological stress due to the athmophere prevailing in a particular city he visited took the travel agent to court.</P>
      <P>I welcome the general thrust of the Bill but I stand over information that the directive's effect has been to rocket insurance costs for small travel agents when introduced in Britain, Holland and Germany.  It is likely to do the same here in the coming years as people engage in litigation.  It will result in a great deal of litigation in the travel industry.  It will increase insurance costs. I was the Minister for Tourism when this directive was issued in Europe and perhaps at that stage I should have been more vigilant.</P>

      <P>Very often when a directive does not take effect for a few years we slavishly agree to it because it offers more protection for the consumer but years later when we come to discuss the fine print in the House we find that we are stuck with impositions that are fine for a developed economy but not necessarily totally appropriate to our stage of development.  Implementing this directive may affect insurance costs and thereby increase litigation but I hope that will not be the case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The concluding comments of my colleague in the Fianna Fáil Party are rather extraordinary for a Member who supports the Bill.  He seems to be making arguments against bringing in the provisions of this Bill, losing sight of the fact that it is being introduced to protect the consumer who badly needs the level of protection proposed in it.  One can be sure that if the liabilities of the organisers and retailers of package holidays increase as a result of the Bill they will have to take out extra insurance cover and will pass on the cost of the insurance to the consumer. The consumer will pay for the protection and there has not been an outcry from consumers against the opportunity to have this protection afforded to them under statute which is being applied equally throughout the European Union.  That is to be greatly welcomed.</P>
      <P>I raised a point during the course of the Committee Stage debate on youth educational and cultural tours asking that only those tours organised on a non-commercial basis be excluded from some of the requirements.  However, if people are organising educational and cultural tours for the purpose of making a profit I see no reason that exemption should apply to them.  I note that the Minister has not introduced an amendment in response to my suggestion and that section 3 stands.  Section 3 (2) states:</P>
      <P>For the purpose of subsection (1), a person shall not be regarded as organising packages occasionally unless that person is a member of a class specified in regulations made by the Minister under this subsection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister seemed to imply in his concluding remarks that he will treat some organisers such as scout camps, school or parish outings as exceptions &mdash; I take it they will be specified in the regulations &mdash; but why would he not consider those who organised tours abroad, on a non-commercial basis, for educational and cultural purposes?  The <Col N="842" /> scout camps and school and parish outings to which he refers seem to be trips to Knock on a Sunday evening or a school trip to Dublin in the spring time &mdash; and we often have many such trips to this House &mdash; and seem to be limited to domestic travel.</P>
    <P>The Minister has not met the point I made and I would have thought that as they are organised on a non-commercial basis the exemptions could be extended to the valuable youth exchange, particularly when there is an emphasis in the European Union on cultural interchange so that young people experience the different traditions and cultures of other countries.  That would lead to a wider understanding, better co-operation and a more mature approach in member states ensuring that we would never revert to the horror of the 1940s when many nations were at savage war against each other.  Will the Minister refer to this point?</P>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal with the last point first.  Youth and educational exchanges involving foreign travel have been covered by legislation since 1982 and it is illegal for anybody to go through a body other than a legal organiser. We do not propose to change that in any sense but I have indicated the types of internal tours, such as tours to Knock and so on, that will not be included.  Occasional tours organised on a non-commercial basis, scout camps and school and parish outings will not be included under the terms of the Bill and will be exempted when I come to make regulations under this Bill.  Foreign travel of any kind is covered by the 1982 Act and should remain covered.  It would be very wrong to bring in an amendment that would remove cover from a very vulnerable section of the community, young people travelling abroad who need that protection.  I intend to allow a lead in period of about three months to allow all brochures to be removed and replaced by new brochures. Some sections of the Bill can be brought in earlier.  I have checked with the Commission and business travel <Col N="843" /> cannot be specifically excluded but I am happy that the Director of Consumer Affairs will be drawing up guidelines describing holiday travel so that the vast majority of business travel will be excluded.</P>
      <P>The main point raised by Deputy Brennan in his concluding remarks was the question of insurance. If we have extra protection we need extra cover and there is a cost involved but I am satisfied that because of the competitive nature of the business this will lead to minimal increases in costs.  There is the possibility of increased litigation arising from the additional cover but that is what the cover is for.  We are transferring an EU directive which was negotiated by the then Minister, Deputy Seamus Brennan, into Irish law and part of that directive is to give extra protection to the consumer.  I praise Deputy Brennan for negotiating that directive and it is now my job to transfer it into Irish law.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity to make a statement to the House not least because serious and untrue allegations were made by a Deputy this morning to the effect that I deliberately withheld certain information when <Col N="845" /> replying yesterday to a question from Deputy O'Donnell about correspondence between a Belfast solicitor and the Office of the Attorney General.  As Deputies are aware, this question related to the delay in the Attorney General's office in dealing with correspondence seeking compensation for victims in the Father Brendan Smyth case.</P>
      <P>Two main issues arise.  First, since last February, I have been conducting inquiries into the seven-month delay in the handling of extradition warrants relating to Father Brendan Smyth and, more recently, these inquiries have been extended to include the subsequent and separate delay relating to the correspondence between the Belfast solicitors and the Attorney General.  Second, a separate issue has arisen as to why the current holder of the post of Attorney General, Mr. Dermot Gleeson S.C., is unable to advise me and the Government on certain limited aspects of this case.</P>
      <P>Before I go further, let me emphasise to the House the range of matters with which the Attorney General is free to deal.  He is free to deal with the Father Smyth file should that arise; any claim for compensation arising out of that case and any correspondence relating to such claims.  The fact that such correspondence was not dealt with is the subject of my inquiries but the failure to do so is unconnected with any conflict of interest on the part of the Attorney General.  His advice to the individual in the Attorney General's office did not relate to this correspondence.  The conflict of interest is confined solely to Mr. Gleeson not being free to be involved in any review of a particular official's performance in relation to the earlier delay in dealing with the Smyth file.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot sufficiently emphasise the importance of fair proceedings being scrupulously adhered to in carrying out the inquiries I am conducting.  They are not yet complete and while most of the relevant information has been collected it would be wrong of me to draw any conclusions, make any inferences or <Col N="846" /> pass any judgment on these facts until the relevant persons have had a full opportunity to review them.  When the inquiries are completed I will, as already promised, fully inform the Oireachtas of all relevant details of the entire matter.</P>
    <P>I have been proceeding and will continue to do so in the measured way that I believe the right of individuals to fair procedures necessitates.  That measured way involves a series of steps which were specifically recommended in the independent legal advice I sought and received.  The first of those steps was revoking the delegation of powers under the Civil Service Regulation Act, 1956 from the Taoiseach to the Attorney General.  I signed the relevant order last night as indicated in my statement which was released about 9.30 p.m.  I am now proceeding, in the measured way I remain convinced is essential, to take the further steps legally recommended to me.</P>
    <P>The second issue that arises relates to the position of the Attorney General.  I have had an opportunity now to read the report of our proceedings yesterday and I am satisfied that I was not asked, either directly or indirectly, about the role of the present Attorney General in offering advice in any action that might be taken on foot of delay in his office on the Father Smyth case prior to this appointment or why it was necessary for me, as I told the House, to retain independent legal advisers.  It is my clear understanding that under the normal procedures of the House I am obliged to give facts in reply to questions asked &mdash; no more and no less.</P>

      <P>The documentary evidence available in my Department will verify that.  Accordingly, when I returned from Áras an Uachtaráin last night, I formally revoked the powers delegated in 1957 to the Attorney General under the Civil Service Regulation Act, 1956, so that I could take personal charge of completing inquiries into the handling of the Fr. Brendan Smyth case, and the delays in dealing with the correspondence arising from it, in the Attorney General's office.  This was a step I had decided to take some days previously&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The facts are as follows. When I invited Mr. Dermot Gleeson, SC, to take the post of Attorney General, he indicated that, while he was still in private practice, one official of the office of the Attorney General had consulted him informally on his position in regard to matters which arose out of the handling of the Fr. Brendan Smyth case.  Mr. Gleeson indicated to me that if the question of reviewing the performance of the relevant official in respect of these specified matters arose he would not be able to take part in any such review.  I accepted that and resolved that, if necessary, the matter would be dealt with independently.</P>
      <P>I selected Mr. Gleeson for appointment to the post of Attorney General because I believe, and continue to believe, that he was the best qualified person for the position.  The fact that he might be conflicted in a number of matters, including that involving an official of his office, was fully taken into account by me at the time.  I informed both the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Social Welfare about the matter at that time.</P>

      <P>As I was saying, the fact that he might be conflicted in a number of matters, including that involving an official of his office, was fully taken into account by me at the time and I so informed the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Minister for Social Welfare at the time of the formation of the Government.  It is inevitable that some conflict will arise in respect of any barrister appointed Attorney General who has had an active private practice.</P>
      <P>It is of the first importance to understand that the Attorney General's conflict of interest related not to the Brendan Smyth file <i>per se</i> but merely to one associated aspect; namely, any review of the performance during a specified period of a particular official who had dealt with it.  He is not, for example, conflicted from advising on matters arising after his appointment as Attorney General. Neither is he compromised or disabled in any way on that account from dealing with the claim on behalf of the victims.  The circumstances which prevented him from doing so are part of my inquiry.  Those circumstances do not include any conflict of interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is not a large country.  There is <Col N="851" /> only a small range of barristers from whom it would be appropriate to select the Attorney General.  Everyone within that range will have potential conflicts in relation to matters which will arise when he or she becomes the State's legal adviser.  Some may question whether in these circumstances I should have asked Mr. Gleeson to act as Attorney General.  I believe that I should.  He is one of the leading people at the Irish Bar, if not the most distinguished and, while important, the matter in which he had provided advice to an officer of the Attorney General's office was far from being a major issue in terms of the overall day to day running of the office.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I felt &mdash; I stand over my judgment &mdash; that if action had to be taken on that matter it could quite easily be dealt with separately, as it will be. Statutory provision already exists for the matter to be dealt with by the Taoiseach of the day.  This is done by making the revocation order that was made last night.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It might be contended that it is unusual for a politician to have to deal with a personnel matter of this nature. That is not the case.  All major decisions about personnel in the public service are made by Ministers ultimately. Ministers or officials acting on their behalf conduct inquiries and are responsible for making decisions either in conjunction with their Government colleagues or, in certain circumstances, acting alone.  Under the Ministers and Secretaries Acts and other associated legislation, Ministers are ultimately responsible for this type of issue and I am the Minister responsible in this case. In dealing with this matter, I will be following well established precedence and procedures.  I will be taking legal advice from eminent independent counsel, and indeed I had already begun the process of taking such advice as far back as last <Col N="852" /> February.  On the substance of the matter raised by Deputy O'Donnell's question yesterday, I am unable at this point to give the House any further information relating to the matter of substance involved in the inquiries I have instituted about delays in the office of the Attorney General in dealing with aspects of the Fr. Smyth case as to do so would risk infringing the entitlement to fair procedure of the person or persons concerned.  It might also compromise my ability to take the action, if any, considered appropriate when the inquiries have been concluded.</P>
    <P>On the separate matter relating to the position of the Attorney General, I did not make information on that issue available in the House yesterday for the simple reason that I was not asked for it.</P>

      <P>I wish to quote from the evidence given by the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs to the subcommittee on 17 January last on his recollection of the events of Tuesday, 15 November 1994.  He said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that the Taoiseach's report to the Dáil was far from adequate.  For example, it ignored the fact that the Attorney General in his report to Government endorsed the <Col N="853" /> view that the handling of the case was reasonable.  It excused the Attorney General for not knowing personally about the file while saying that in his own office all sensitive and important matters are brought to his immediate attention.</P>
    <P>The previous Government fell on the issue of a delay of seven months in the Attorney General's office in processing the Brendan Smyth file.  This issue deals with a six months delay, a six months crisis.  The Government and the Taoiseach failed to act on a letter directly relating to the Fr. Brendan Smyth case over a period of five months in office. The previous Government was brought down on the basis of not giving full information to this House.  The Taoiseach came into this House yesterday and said he had information but he would not give it to Members.  The Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the Leader of Democratic Left recited like a mantra that the beef tribunal would not have been necessary if questions were fully and explicitly answered in this House. Yesterday the Taoiseach refused to answer questions about facts which were relevant to this case.  He answered them when confronted by a journalist last night.  His defence was, as it seems to be always, that he is accountable when journalists catch him.  His quote last night was: &ldquo;I was not asked that question directly&rdquo; shows how much of a u-turn the Taoiseach has made in the past five months and how much this Government thinks of transparency, accountability and openness.</P>
    <P>Far from operating as if behind a pane of glass he has pulled down not only the curtains but the steel shutters. The events of last November were among the most traumatic we have witnessed in this House.  Having been involved at the heart of these controversial events I have little relish to see a replay of them here again today.  What is at issue is whether the Taoiseach misled the Dáil in not giving a full and open account of the situation in the Attorney General's office when questions were <Col N="854" /> asked of him by Members of the Opposition. The point at issue yesterday was the failure of the Attorney General's office to reply to a letter it had received. I asked yesterday when the Attorney General first saw the letter of 14 November. By relating the two points we quite satisfactorily intertwined them and it was open to the Taoiseach to answer them.  There are two points: the failure to answer the letter and when the Attorney General saw the letter. Both questions were fair and related. For the Taoiseach to say now that they were not linked will not hold up.</P>
    <P>The Attorney General was appointed by the Taoiseach as a constitutional law officer of the State.  His function is to be the legal adviser to the Taoiseach and to the Cabinet.  At the time of his appointment the Attorney General's position was compromised in all these matters because he could not advise the Taoiseach on them: in plain language he could not perform the duties to which he had been appointed.  That was totally unfair to him.  This is not the only issue on which he could not advise the Government as we know.  From the first day this placed the Attorney General in a totally invidious position.  He could not fully exercise his constitutional function. It was negated by the compromising position he revealed to the Taoiseach. In addition, the Taoiseach had to revoke some of the constitutional powers further decreasing his constitutional authority and take those authorities on to himself.  As well as being Taoiseach and in charge of multiple inquiries into a whole basket of leaks and failures he will now head an investigation into the Attorney General's office.</P>
    <P>It was totally unsatisfactory for the Taoiseach to say on the national airwaves this morning that the reason he did not give us a full account in the House yesterday was that he was not asked the right question.  The implication of this is horrendous for any Taoiseach.  He is implying that if we do not ask the right question he will feel free to conceal any information he deems proper from this House.  How on <Col N="855" /> earth are we on the Opposition benches to know on a daily basis what the right question is to elicit information in the public interest?</P>
    <P>Yesterday we had the spectacle of a new type of punishment being meted out to an errant Minister.  It was called serious demotion.  I described it as a half-way-house approach, a new category of decision-making by the Taoiseach. Now we have a totally new category of questions created by the Taoiseach: these are &ldquo;the right questions&rdquo; which we must ask if he is to tell us the unvarnished truth about that matter. That is a disgraceful way for the Taoiseach to treat the House particularly coming from someone who always said that accountability to this House is foremost to the political interest.  It is particularly disgraceful from one who has always prided himself in the positive attitude to the affairs of the House and it certainly reverses everything he ever said inside and outside the House.</P>
    <P>I would like to know how the Taoiseach thought the Attorney General would deal with the resolution of the problems within the Attorney General's office if he was hamstrung from the start.  Will the Taoiseach tell the House why the Attorney General did not consider it right and proper during the deliberations of the sub-committee of the Select Committee on Legislation and Security to tell the members of that committee that he already had a legal relationship with one of the people involved in the Fr. Brendan Smyth case?  Is it that the Taoiseach did not think it relevant?  Is it that the Taoiseach did not think it important?  Is it that the Taoiseach, in spite of all the turmoil before Christmas, did not understand it was absolutely vital to be totally upfront about every aspect of the affairs?  How did the Attorney General answer questions and give explanations to the sub-committee when he was dealing with the file on the one hand and on the other hand he could not deal with the file?  If <Col N="856" /> he had difficulty in answering the questions or giving more information would he not at least say he had a legal difficulty with the file?</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach admitted this morning on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; more than he did in the House yesterday and said that since February he was dealing with the letter himself.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to ask some of the questions which I think are vitally important.  I want to know how the Taoiseach shared all the information on this matter with his Cabinet colleagues before the Attorney General was appointed?  I want to know if they voiced any objections, if they raised any queries, if they laid down any timescale for the resolution of the difficulties in the Office of the Attorney General and if they were given any assurance by the Taoiseach in regard to them?  Did the Taoiseach share all this information with his Cabinet colleagues?  Did he obtain their approval before or after the appointment of the new Attorney General? Did the Taoiseach obtain approval from the Cabinet to consult an external firm of solicitors; a most unusual and questionable step, but it may be covered by the 1956 Act?  Has the Taoiseach taken any practical steps to resolve these issues over recent months?  So far as this side of the House is concerned the Taoiseach has been less than fair and less than honest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach appointed the constitutional law officer of the State, his function being to give legal advice to the Government.  Now he has to revoke some of those powers.  The legal advice of the Attorney General is not available to the Government on the very issue <Col N="857" /> that brought this Government to office. It is incredible that the Taoiseach could make such an arrangement and not say at any time that that was important to the committee of inquiry, to the public and to this House.  Yesterday he was waiting for Deputy O'Donnell or some other Deputy to ask the question when he would have been able to give us the answer.  He gave every kind of answer. He side-tracked, weaved this way and that and looked more uncomfortable than he had for a long time.  The reason he was uncomfortable was that he knew he was misleading the House.</P>

The two issues were related and intertwined. All examinations this morning, both legal and otherwise, found they were intertwined.

The Taoiseach knew the Attorney General could not deal with the file.  At the same time he did not keep up with the facts and he let that letter lie with no reply.

      <P>It strikes me that this high-spending Government is economical with only one thing &mdash; the truth.  The Taoiseach's efforts this morning to defend his concealment from the House yesterday of relevant information puts me in mind of the line which refers to the well measured truth that tells the blacker lie.  He said that he was not asked &ldquo;the right question&rdquo;.  I need only refer to Question No. 2 on yesterday's Order Paper in the course of which Deputy O'Donnell asked if the contents of the letter of 14 November last were passed on to the new Attorney General. I have looked at the reply, and at the replies to a large number of supplementaries, but that information was never given.  Had the Taoiseach attempted to reply to that he would have had to give the information that was forced out of him last night.  His excuse this morning, on the radio and here in the House, that he was not asked the right question and, therefore, did not give the information but would have given it otherwise, was a pathetic attempt to cover up yesterday's disgraceful episode.  It is reminiscent of what went on in the past, about which the present Taoiseach was extremely critical.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In May 1995, we are having a rerun of some of the things that happened in this House in November 1994.  It is not true that the appropriate question was not asked, nor is it true that the statement that was finally made last night at about 10 o'clock would have been made anyway.  The reason that statement was made last night was that at 6 o'clock the <Col N="860" /><i>Irish Independent</i> wrote a letter to the Taoiseach informing him that they knew certain facts and proposed to print them this morning if the Taoiseach denied them.  The Taoiseach then felt he had to make a virtue out of necessity and issued a statement confirming what the newspaper in question already knew. How can it be said that that is openness? Let us remember the phrase the Taoiseach used in December on his election, that his Government would operate with such transparency that it would be as if it did everything behind a clear pane of glass.</P>
    <P>The deception and the concealment that went on here yesterday is appalling, but it is not the only instance of deception or concealment.  There are other instances that are equally serious, and my feeling is that there are further factors we do not yet know about that will soon come to light.  One factor of deception and concealment that greatly concerns me is that I, in common with 12 other Members of this House, was a member of the Sub-committee on Security and Legislation that sought to hold an inquiry into the circumstances in which the former Government fell in November 1994.  On 21 and 22 December last, Mr. Mathew Russell from the Attorney General's office appeared before the committee.  We were given advice from the Attorney General and subjected to a decision by him in regard to the evidence Mr. Russell might or might not give.</P>
    <P>We were refused files from the Attorney General's office that had been in the possession of Mr. Russell on which Mr. Russell had written various things from time to time, and Mr. Russell proclaimed, in the course of his evidence to that committee, that he had been advised by the Attorney General not to answer certain questions, particularly questions relating to the evidence grounding the application for the extradition of Fr. Smyth.  That committee did not know that Mr. Russell was the Attorney General's own client and that there was a lawyer-client relationship between the Attorney General and Mr. <Col N="861" /> Russell who was giving evidence.  To have concealed that from the committee, and to have concealed it with the knowledge of the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the Minister for Social Welfare, is disgraceful.  All three knew on 21 and 22 December that this deception of the committee was going on.</P>
    <P>It was highly improper for that man to give evidence in those circumstances, availing of and hiding behind the advice of the Attorney General when he was the Attorney General's own personal client relating to that specific matter.  It was not that he had gone to Mr. Gleeson for advice about a claim for damages because he was knocked down by a bus.  He went for advice on the topic of how he handled the Fr. Berndan Smyth affair, the very matter about which he was giving evidence to a committee of this House.  The Attorney General should have disqualified himself from seeking to give any advice in relation to that, but he did not.  On 24 January last, the Leader of my party, Deputy Harney, asked a question about the conflict of interest in the present Attorney General's position because of his previous involvement with a wide range of clients who were in conflict with the State in one way or another.  She claimed there was a conflict of interest but was repeatediy assured by the Taoiseach that there was none and that other people would be employed to advise Ministers if the necessity arose.</P>
    <P>How is this Government to operate in such circumstances?  If there were to be advice from somebody else in the event of a conflict of interest, why was that not forthcoming in respect of the advice to Mr. Russell regarding his evidence to the committee?  How will the present Attorney General deal with a claim against the State for £200 million by clients of his for whom he has acted in that matter?  How will he deal with the question of the fines of £120 million being imposed by the European Commission on this State when most of those fines were run up by former clients of his and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry claims that <Col N="862" /> he wants to be reimbursed by those who were responsible for them?  How will he deal with the civil proceedings which have to be taken to disqualify from holding directorships in the State those who were involved in the enormous tax fraud referred to in the report of the beef tribunal when those people are his own clients?  How will he advise the Taoiseach, the Minister for Enterprise and Employment and the Director of Public Prosecutions in respect of their duties relating to that matter?  This is entirely unacceptable.</P>
    <P>Will the Taoiseach who made a grave error of judgment in appointing Mr. Gleeson in the first place even though he is a very competent man &mdash; this has nothing to do with his competence, it is purely about his involvement in the concealment of all these matters &mdash; compound his original error of judgment by making a further error in retaining Mr. Gleeson as Attorney General in these circumstances?</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has fallen back on what Deputy Ahern rightly described as his mantra of openness, accountability and so on but if he is so intent on answering questions and being open why did he on Monday last, as he admitted this morning, instruct officials to transfer Deputy O'Donnell's question to the Minister for Justice?</P>

      <P>There is no need to spell it out: this is about openness, transparency, accountability and trust.  What we have witnessed today without any question are double standards and political hypocrisy on a breathtaking scale. The Taoiseach said the reason he did not answer a supplementary question was it was not put to him.  When in Opposition he dragged the former Taoiseach, Deputy Reynolds, through the mire both inside and outside the House for precisely the same reason.  The Taoiseach has a duty to tell the people whether he told them the truth.  It would appear that political pragmatism of the worst kind has replaced principle, that concealment has replaced openness and secrecy has replaced transparency.  This matter would not have come into the public domain were it not that the Taoiseach realised the matter was going to come out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy O'Malley said, the Attorney General was requested to appear before the Select Committee on <Col N="864" /> Legislation and Security inquiring into the circumstances surrounding the collapse of the last Government but did not do so.  That committee was not advised that there was a privileged relationship between the Attorney General and Mr. Matt Russell who was handling the Fr. Brendan Smyth file. There can be no doubt but that, at best, the Taoiseach has concealed and, at worst, misled not just the House but also the people.</P>
    <P>We have had enough silence from the Tánaiste, Deputy Spring, and the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa.  The trumpeteers of transparency, openness and accountability have a bounden duty to say whether they are satisfied with the activities of the Taoiseach and to tell the people whether they believe the Taoiseach to be open, accountable, transparent and trustworthy.  If the Tánaiste and the Minister for Social Welfare fail to do this it will be a damning political indictment of both of them in the light of what they said while in Opposition.</P>
    <P>If the Taoiseach wanted to be open, transparent and accountable he could have told this House precisely what he told it today and the people last night. There was no reason for him not to other than that he deliberately did not want to do so for certain political reasons which are all too apparent to everybody both inside and outside the House.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that Mr. Harry Whelehan should not have been appointed as President of the High Court because of the delay in the Fr. Brendan Smyth case even though it transpired that he did not know of the <Col N="865" /> existence of the case.  In those circumstances everybody both inside and outside the House is entitled to ask where the Tánaiste stands on this issue.  Does he believe, for example, that if the present Attorney General was responsible for the six months delay in the office in replying to important correspondence he is still fit to be Attorney General?  The people are entitled to an answer to that crucial question and if the Taoiseach and the Minister for Social Welfare will not give it, the Tánaiste should.</P>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach, for example, consider that the six months delay in dealing with the letters from solicitors acting on behalf of the victims of child sex abuse is acceptable and, if the Attorney General is responsible for advising the Government on the matter, is he satisfied with the manner in which the Attorney General advised him?</P>
      <P>There are very serious questions which have to be answered.  If the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the Minister for Social Welfare do not answer the people directly there is only one honourable course open to them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>My primary motivation in tabling the questions to both the Minister for Justice and the Taoiseach subsequently yesterday was to help the victims.  That may seem to be a modest motivation given all that has followed but I have become increasingly aware, from correspondence and contacts with the victims &mdash; they contacted Deputy Harney and me &mdash; that after all they have been through there was a deafening silence from the Government in relation to their legitimate correspondence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I tabled a question to the Minister for Justice, really just to activate some speed or courtesy in relation to this claim.  Whatever about the legalities of that claim, I was concerned that correspondence had not been replied to, not only in relation to this claim &mdash; anything could have been contained in that letter which was sent on 14 November <Col N="866" /> 1994.  For example, it could have contained further evidence from the victims on the matters being investigated, further evidence in relation to other allegations against the priest concerned. I received a minimalist reply to my question from the Minister for Justice, now on the record.  She referred me to the fact that her Department had had no active involvement in this matter, that the Attorney General's office had advised her that the Chief State Solicitor had replied to such correspondence, thus implying a denial of responsibility.</P>
    <P>I became suspicious when I learned that that reply was sent on 9 May, having been prompted by my parliamentary question originally tabled for oral reply but, as it transpired, tabled for written reply on 11 May 1995.  The House will readily appreciate that I wondered if it could possibly be that the malaise of delay, the rock on which the previous Government had perished, was alive and well in the Attorney General's office.  This led me to table the appropriate question seeking factual information from the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>Having been delighted that my question to the Taoiseach had made its way to the Order Paper, the House will readily appreciate my surprise at receiving an indication from the General Office that there had been an intention to redirect that question to the Minister for Justice at midday the previous day. What had changed?  I will tell the House what had changed &mdash; I think the Taoiseach had got wind of the fact that the <i>Irish Independent</i> knew a lot more than I knew about this matter.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach said this morning I had not asked the appropriate question yesterday. I would have had to be Mr. Brian Dowling to have put that question because I did not know about the conflict. I wonder who did know about this chronic conflict of interest which in effect disabled or prohibited the Attorney General from dealing, in the public interest, with anything relating to a review of that person's activity in the Attorney General's office.  There were two persons involved, one superior to <Col N="867" /> the other, in effect in a lawyer/client relationship.  When I heard last evening that the Taoiseach had revoked the powers of the Attorney General I wondered why he had not revoked them immediately on learning of a conflict of interest in the Attorney General's capacity to deal with a review of that official's duties because, when the Attorney General was appointed, a committee of this House was engaged in inquiring into how the relevant warrants were dealt with.  In the course of the examination of the Select Committee on Legislation and Security into the events surrounding the delay in dealing with the relevant warrants and related matters, who was acting in the public interest?  Since the Attorney General has a dual role, who was looking after the public interest during all that time? We have now heard there was a conflict of interest at that stage.</P>
    <P>The fact that the Executive fails to answer questions posed in this House will be the undoing of democracy.  Have we not learned from the experiences of the beef tribunal, the Masri scandal, the Fr. Brendan Smyth marks I and II scandals? We are now back to where we began.  Will we ever learn that the only vehicle available to Members of this House to hold the Executive to account is by way of questions here?  If questions are evaded, ducked or dived, as they were yesterday, we might as well abolish this House, because it will be the undoing of democracy.  I will keep my remaining questions until later.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I should say that there were matters yesterday, and there are matters today, upon which I cannot answer questions.  There are other matters, about which I answered questions yesterday, and there are yet other matters which concern questions I was not <Col N="868" /> asked yesterday to which I can give answers and could have given answers to yesterday had I been asked.</P>
      <P>First, let me say what are the matters about which I cannot answer questions today.  They are any questions touching on the culpability of individuals in regard to not dealing with the correspondence referred to in Deputy O'Donnell's question.  Were I to give any information as to who dealt with that correspondence I would be prejuding decisions I have to take in regard to culpability for the fact that that correspondence was not dealt with.  Let me reiterate what I said yesterday: I regard the fact that that correspondence was not dealt with as most serious.  If a person addresses correspondence of that kind, particularly if they have been victims of a serious crime, I believe they are entitled to a prompt reply.  That right to a prompt reply applies whether or not they have a legal case.  Out of consideration for the trauma to which they have been subjected, at the very least they are entitled to a prompt reply. They did not receive that prompt reply. That was wrong and is a matter that is being investigated.  Decisions as to culpability or otherwise, and decisions flowing from those decisions as to what is to happen to individuals or otherwise, are ones that I will have to take in due course.</P>
      <P>I cannot be drawn in any detail into the matters concerning culpability, nor can I be drawn into replying to questions. For example, the questions were put to me repeatedly yesterday &mdash; did the present Attorney General see that correspondence?  When did he see it? Did he know it had not been replied to? I cannot answer those questions because&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The question was raised about the role of the Attorney General, Mr. Dermot Gleeson, in regard to the committee of the House that considered the matter.  The Attorney General was involved in processing the information that was in his office, information with which he had not dealt as Attorney General.  He simply processed the information and passed it on to the committee.  It was necessary on grounds which were disclosed to the committee for him to exclude certain documents from those presented to the committee.  Those documents which were not presented to the committee were, however, separately disclosed to the legal advisers to the committee.  The legal advisers were, <Col N="872" /> I understand, Mr. Niall Fennelly SC and Mr. Gerard Durcan, and they saw all the documents so that they could be assured that no information was excluded from that made available to the committee other than for the following three valid reasons.</P>
      <P>First &mdash; Deputy O'Donnell will probably agree with this reason for exclusion &mdash; the necessity to preserve the anonymity of the names of the victims.  It would not have been proper for the names which were on the file to have been made available to the committee and become a matter of public debate. The Attorney General excluded that information but he provided the names to the independent counsel for the committee who verified that these exclusions were correct on that ground. Second, there was a requirement to preserve the confidentiality of certain communications between the Irish and British Attorney General's offices on the grounds that such exclusion is important to the extradition process as a whole.  Certain information was excluded on that basis, but in order that this would not be seen to be done for any purpose of concealment, that information from correspondence between the Attorney General's offices in question was also made avilable to the independent counsel for the committee who verified that the exclusion was justified.</P>

      <P>There is a problem in that Members keep interrupting me and then complain that I do not complete my sentence.  Third, there was the question of the entitlement of Fr. Smyth to a fair trial in respect of any further proceedings that might occur.  It was not possible for that sort of information, which would be prejudicial to such a trial, to have been disclosed.  That exclusion was also verified by the independent counsel for the committee.</P>
      <P>Deputies asked about the disclosure to the committee by the Attorney General of the fact that he had advised the official in question.  The only role of the present Attorney General in servicing the committee within its terms of reference related to what happened in the Attorney General's office prior to his taking office.  The Committee's terms of reference did not extend to anything that happened subsequent to his appointment.</P>

      <P>He complied with all requests made to him for information. The only requests made to the Attorney General for information related to documents that needed to be supplied. All documents sought were supplied. The committee asked him to attend to debate his decision on one matter, namely, the exclusion of certain documents. He indicated to the Committee that he had made a decision on that matter &mdash; I already indicated in response to questions by Deputy O'Donnell that those decisions were verified by the independent counsel for the committee &mdash; and on that basis he <Col N="874" /> did not see any ground for appearing before it.</P>
      <P>The question of the Attorney General having advised the official involved was not relevant to the terms of reference of the committee.  It was not a matter which he was obliged to disclose and it was not relevant to the report of the committee.  It was relevant only to the issue I am now considering, that is the question of disciplinary action in regard to the official in question.  That is a matter that must be dealt with by due process with fair procedure, and that is being done.</P>

      <P>The letter was the subject matter of the question by Deputy O'Donnell on the delay.  If the Taoiseach did not see that letter &mdash; and he has confirmed that the procedures relating to that file were followed in that all letters were shown to the Attorney General &mdash; can I presume the answer to the question is that the letter was received in the Attorney General's office, the Attorney General was consulted by Mr. Russell about it and there is some dispute as to whether the conversation which took place between Mr. Russell and Mr. Gleeson was a private one before the formation of this Government or was subsequent to its formation?  Is that the difficulty?  The Taoiseach cannot have it both ways. The Attorney General was invited to come before the committee of inquiry, but did not do that.  The committee sought information from him, but he did not give all the information.  In response to parliamentary questions tabled requesting information from the <Col N="876" /> Attorney General about compromising cases the Taoiseach mentioned the beef tribunal, but not this case.  There was an agreement that all important matters relating to this issue would be passed to the Attorney General.  If the Taoiseach was not made aware of that letter, is it the case that the Attorney General had the file and because he was ham-fisted in dealing with it he could not make the information available?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The advice of the Attorney General in regard to not giving certain information related to the three matters to which I adverted earlier in response to Deputy O'Donnell. Three categories of information were excluded from the information provided to the committee.  They related to the anonymity of victims, the confidentiality of communications between the two Attorneys General offices and the entitlement to a fair trial for Fr. Smyth in any future proceedings.</P>
      <P>It is important to draw a distinction between the two delays.  Although I would not regard this as a major issue, I would like to deal with it as it has been raised by Deputy Ahern.  The first delay related to a delay in the processing of an extradition warrant during which time a particular individual was at large.  The second delay related to a failure to acknowledge or reply to an item of correspondence making a claim against the State for money and compensation.  The individual who had committed the offences was at that stage not at large but in custody.  The view of the Attorney General's office and the Chief State Solicitor's office is that although the claim was validly made there is no legal basis for it.  I do not defend failure to reply to this correspondence, and I have made it clear already that I regard it as most serious, so serious that I have taken the step of revoking the delegation order regarding personnel matters I have made to the Attorney General's office so that I can deal with it.  I will deal with it and will report fully to the House when I have dealt with it.  I will not at that stage conceal any information from the House.</P>

Does he accept that there is a world of difference between prejudging a matter and failing to deal adequately here with factual information subject to the right of anyone to contradict or explain it?  We are not asking the Taoiseach to prejudge the matter. Does he accept that the caveat he introduced to answering questions today substantially prevents him from doing so?  Does that not drive a coach and four through parliamentary democracy? Does he agree he could answer the questions posed on this matter without interfering with due process?  Will he not accept that due process has been interpreted by the courts as requiring a <Col N="881" /> balance between the rights of alleged wrongdoers and the rights of the public and victims to receive the benefit of fair procedures?  Who acted as guardian of the public interest during the investigation into these matters carried out by the Select Committee on Legislation and Security?

      <P>Deputy O'Donnell is correct in that there is a conflict between me preserving my right to deal fairly and in a fashion of due process with this matter and my obligation to give the House all relevant information in response to questions.  There is no doubt that by deciding at this point not to give certain information I am diminishing the right to information of Members.  A balance must be struck in this regard and I believe I have struck the correct one because in this instance it is more important to protect the right of individuals to due process than to provide information to this House given that that information, as I have already stated, will be provided by me in full to the House in due course.  The House will not get the information today but it <Col N="882" /> will in due course.  If the rights of the individual in question were prejudiced today, that could never be put right.

      <P>In matters relating to the general disposal of the Fr. Smyth file, compensation claims and other matters relating to child abuse victims and the general efficiency of the Attorney General's office, the person responsible for protecting the public interest was &mdash; and remains &mdash; Mr. Dermot Gleeson SC, Attorney General. The Taoiseach is the guardian of the public interest in the matter of disciplinary action that might be taken against the individual who, prior to Mr. Gleeson becoming Attorney General, dealt with the Fr. Smyth file during the time his extradition was sought.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the public interest, as soon as the evidence of the select committee given responsibility to investigate the matter was made available in February, I immediately took steps to get independent legal advice on how I should assess the evidence presented to the committee relating to the individuals in question. I received such legal advice formally some time later &mdash; I do not have the dates with me but they can all be provided if the House needs them &mdash; through an independent solicitor in private practice, not the Chief State Solicitor's Office because it is subordinate to the Attorney General's Office, who <Col N="885" /> in turn went to a senior and distinguished member of the Bar who never had any dealings with any of the parties in this case.  I obtained from that Senior Counsel a detailed assessment of the evidence disclosed in regard to the delay in the extradition case, not in regard to the correspondence, which is a separate issue.  Consultations were held with the barrister in question and the opinion was assessed.</P>
    <P>About two weeks ago &mdash; I am not sure of the date although I believe it was subsequent to Deputy O'Donnell's question &mdash; I raised three specific queries of a legal kind in regard to the opinion I had received from this independent counsel with a view to satisfying myself as to the action I should take.  At all stages I had certain action in consideration, although I had not made any decision as to what precise action I would take.  Then the further development occurred, namely, the disclosure, as a result of Deputy O'Donnell's question, of the fact that certain related correspondence, which was received in the Attorney General's office subsequent to the change of Government in one case, had not been dealt with.</P>
    <P>I decided I would have to consider those two matters together and I have had arrangements made to have further consultations with the independent counsel concerned in this matter.  I understand these consultations took place over recent days but there will not be a full formal consultations until tomorrow.  I was advised all along that if I was contemplating taking action on the matter, the first step I would need to take, in view of the facts we know about the position of the present Attorney General, would be the revocation of the delegation in regard to personnel matters from the Taoiseach to him.  That step, towards which I was already working for the reasons I just explained, was taken by me last night.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">

      <P>Will the Taoiseach not agree with me that to try to make a distinction, in a schizophrenic manner, <Col N="886" /> between the role of the Attorney General in dealing with the substance of the Brendan Smyth matter and dealing with an official in a personnel matter is unjustifiable in the present circumstances? The distinction seeks to say that, on one level, the Attorney General could deal with some aspects of the Brendan Smyth matter &mdash; the file for which remains open &mdash; but that personnel issues were matters for the Taoiseach. Will the Taoiseach not accept that we are talking about two human beings, one a superior of the other, and that it would be impossible in practice &mdash; as it turns out, it has been impossible &mdash; for the two roles to be distinctly divided as suggested by the Taoiseach?  I accept the Taoiseach is trying to balance, in terms of due process, the rights of various individuals but is it not true that in taking this action today, he has taken action which gives precedence to the rights of alleged wrongdoers and which does not give any parity of esteem to the rights of the victims?  This is a problem which runs right through the criminal justice system but it should not happen in this House, even allowing for the rights of due process.  Will the Taoiseach agree that due process must always be balanced between the rights of the victims of crime and those of wrongdoers?</P>

I will not take a decision on this matter one moment sooner than I believe is right, regardless of the amount of pressure put on me in this House by parties opposite for whatever good, or not so good, reasons.  I want to make that absolutely clear to everybody on the Government and Opposition benches.  I do not mind how much pressure is put on me; I will not be hurried into making a decision <Col N="887" /> without due process in this case.  I hope that is understood.</P>

In every walk of life people will find themselves, almost on a daily basis, in situations where there is a conflict of interest or where they have to balance two conflicting rights. Nobody is better qualified to understand that distinction than the Attorney General.  Most Members would also be very well qualified to make the distinction between advising in regard to the rights of an individual in a specific case and dealing with all the other generality of issues.</P>

      <P>My understanding is that, except in the case we are dealing with, with which I am dealing separately, the procedures were put in place and dealt with.  I very much appreciate that procedures were instituted for dealing with these files by the previous Attorney General, Mr. Eoghan Fitzsimons under the last Government. After these matters had come to light but as promptly as possible, Mr. Eoghan Fitzsimons put in place procedures in the Attorney General's office for dealing with these cases.  My understanding is that with the exception possibly &mdash; I have to be careful what I say &mdash; of this particular case, those procedures were applied and are being applied fully. Indeed I responded to questions yesterday from Deputy O'Dea about the general issue of improved information technology and correspondence tracking in the Attorney General's office which will show that substantial resources are being put into this area.  I believe this is important from the point of view and perspective of victims of crime who may correspond with the Office of the Attorney General and they are entitled to a prompt reply whether they have a claim or not.

The letter could well have been sent to the DPP with a view to prosecution if it had to do with other allegations.  We could not ask questions and there would be no accountability.

      <P>The buck stops with me and I have no problem with that. Deputy O'Donnell also raised the question of the letter containing other information. The correspondence received in November and in January contained a statement that if it was not replied to, legal proceedings would be instituted within seven days.  It was a threat of legal proceedings demanding compensation &mdash; that was all.  The legal proceedings have not subsequently been taken, although it was stated they would be taken if there was no response within seven days.  This is germane to this issue.</P>
      <P>Many solicitors' offices would be aware that letters threatening legal proceedings are not dealt with until the seven days have expired and one has assessed whether there is any intention to proceed.  If action is not taken at that stage there might be no further correspondence.</P>

      <P>I have answered all of the Deputy's questions several times.  I am not sure if Deputy O'Rourke was in the House at the time but I will answer them again.  First, I do not approve of the six month's delay.  As to whether the Attorney General was compromised in dealing with proceedings in regard to an official whom he might have advised previously on questions about the way in which that official dealt with the Fr. Smyth file during the period of seven months when no extradition took place, the answer is yes, he is compromised.</P>
      <P>It was because he is compromised that last February I took the step dealing with the matter separately by seeking independent legal advice.  I believe, as did the Attorney General, that he is compromised and could not deal with that case.  As I explained, there are a number of other cases and I am sorry Deputy O'Malley did not ask any questions as I want to come back to some of the points he raised in that regard.  The Attorney General is compromised in this case.</P>
      <P>The third question, which is a repeat of the second, was whether I believe it is impossible for him to deal professionally with the official whom he advised in this potential disciplinary matter concerning the extradition file.  It is impossible for him to do so for the reasons I have already given.  That is why I, under statute, have taken on the responsibility of dealing with that as the appropriate Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked if it was not impossible for the Attorney General to deal with the generality of the Smyth file because of his previous private representational role as regards official A. I want a direct answer.  If the Taoiseach must make such massive efforts to disentangle the Attorney General from dealing with various files, why did he appoint him in the first place?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have answered this question several times.  In my original contribution I listed the aspects of the <Col N="898" /> case which the Attorney General has no problem dealing with.  One of the matters which I said he has no problem dealing with is the generality of the Smyth file because he is not conflicted as regards the generality of the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>He must be compromised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>He is only conflicted in regard to the possibility of disciplinary proceedings because of the actions or the lack of actions of an official.  He drew that matter to my attention at the time of his appointment and I promptly made separate arrangements to deal with that.</P>
      <P>It is only fair to the Attorney General that I refer to comments by Deputy O'Malley.  He cited a question from Deputy Harney and said that I repeatedly assured her there was no conflict of interest in regard to the Attorney General. I recall a question put by Deputy McDowell rather than Deputy Harney &mdash; I am not absolutely sure of this &mdash; about cases in general where the Attorney General might have acted previously for others against the State while in private practice.  I explained to whichever Deputy it was &mdash; I speak from memory, I do not have the record available to me, which I believe Deputy O'Malley has &mdash; that separate procedures were put in place immediately by the incoming Attorney General for dealing with those sorts of cases.  In other words, the file at a routine level would be dealt with by officials in the Attorney General's office without reference to the Attorney General.  If the advice of a barrister at the level of the Attorney General was required, it would be sought independently and without any reference to the Attorney General from independent counsel practising at the Bar.  That procedure is being followed in five or six cases where this situation arises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley asked how the Government would deal with the £200 million Goodman claim on the State, how the Attorney General would deal <Col N="899" /> with the EU fines and with civil proceedings. In any matter where the position of somebody who was a previous client of the Attorney General in private practice comes in conflict with the position of the State, the Attorney General from the outset made a formal decision that he would exclude himself from acting for the State in those cases, as is normal at the Bar.  It is not possible for a barrister, whether acting for the State or not, to act at different times in respect of the same matter for different sides in case.  Therefore, separate arrangements are being made for representing the State in all these cases, including those to which Deputy O'Malley referred.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I focus on the device which the Taoiseach is using to deny information to the House, that is, fair procedure.  I ask him what the term &ldquo;fair procedure&rdquo; or &ldquo;due process&rdquo; means in this context.  It usually implies that there are proceedings in motion or in contemplation against an individual.  If that is not the position, then the only transparent thing is the inadequacy of the Taoiseach's explanations for denying information to this House.</P>
      <P>As regards the committee of inquiry of which I was a member, one of the terms of reference of that committee was to inquire into the reason for the seven months delay in the Attorney General's office.  It has transpired that the Attorney General, Mr. Gleeson, who was involved with the committee, had a lawyer-client relationship with a witness whose evidence was vital to the findings and deliberations of that committee. Why did the Taoiseach or the Attorney General not tell us that in advance?  That matter has not been answered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the independent legal person who, the Taoiseach said, has stepped into the position of the Attorney General in relation to inquiries into this matter, has the appointment of that person been agreed by his Cabinet colleagues?  Does that independent <Col N="900" /> legal adviser have access to Cabinet meetings in the same way as the Attorney General?  Does he have access to State papers?  Who is he?</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Dea asked if proceedings are being taken as regards the delays in dealing with these two matters.  At this stage, no.  As I must make the decision, I must provide for the possibility that proceedings might be taken by ensuring that in everything I do at this stage, due process is followed. I draw the Deputy's attention to a case concerning an official in which Deputy O'Malley was involved as a Minister and which subsequently became the subject of a court proceeding.  It was clear from the judgment that adherence to due process is important in such cases.  I make no criticism of the actions taken by Deputy O'Malley.  However, I must take account of the findings of the court in that case as regards anything I might find myself having to contemplate. I can give Deputy O'Dea more details of the case in question if he wishes, but I am sure he is familiar with the O'Reilly case.  That is one of the <Col N="901" /> reasons I must be careful as regards due process because a decision taken by Deputy O'Malley as Minister was contested.</P>

      <P>As regards the lawyer-client relationship not being disclosed to the committee, that did not arise under the terms of reference of the committee.  The only function of the present Attorney General as regards that committee, whose terms of reference only related to specific events leading to the fall of the previous Government, was to provide documents.  I have dealt exhaustively with the way he handled that.  He was requested to appear before the committee to explain why he had not provided particular documents.</P>

      <P>As I explained to the House, any documents he excluded were checked with the independent counsel to the committee who were allowed to see the documents so that they could satisfy themselves as to the validity of the decisions taken by the Attorney General.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The third question relates to the independent legal advice I sought.  I made that decision because I did not see any need to engage in wide consultations on this matter as all I was doing was seeking independent legal advice.  I will make decisions or, if consultations are required with the Cabinet, those will take place at the appropriate time when a decision is ready for the Cabinet to consider.

He claimed he did not tell Deputy Harney on 25 January that there was no conflict of interest.  Column 69 of the Official Report of that date states:</P>
      <P>Miss Harney: Did the Taoiseach discuss the conflict of interest that arises with the Attorney General before his appointment?</P>

One of them relates to EU Commission fines of over £100 million pounds being imposed on Ireland, which the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry says he will legally recover from those involved. How will the Taoiseach deal with a situation where, apparently, an application has now been made to Ministers to have certain people disqualified as directors under the Companies Acts where they are fired?</P>

      <P>In response to a question from Deputy O'Dea, the independent legal advice I am seeking is from Dr. Mary Redmond's solicitor, Mr. Peter Kelly, SC and Mr. Patrick Usher. In the advice they gave to me, they specifically drew attention to the problems with regard to due process and the court's decision in the matter of the O'Reilly case, which Deputy O'Malley has now referred to.  It would appear that in the case of this resignation, there were questions as to whether due process had been followed.  In the case that I am now dealing with, I must take account of the finding of the court in that matter.  I have no criticism either of the Secretary of the Department at the time or of Deputy O'Malley with regard to what they did.  That is not the point. The point is that I must take account of what happened in the court case subsequently, and the judicial decision in that matter, and what was said about due process.  This is one of the reasons why, with legal advice from the people <Col N="907" /> I have mentioned, I have adopted the approach I am taking.</P>
      <P>I will not blame or seek to blame my legal advisers or any legal advice I take for any decisions I make.  Any decisions I have made in the House as to questions I have answered and questions I have declined to answer are my decisions as Taoiseach, and I stand over them.  I am qualified, by virtue of my office to make those decisions, and I am also lucky enough to have a legal qualification. However, even if I did not have such a qualification, anybody who is fit enough to be elected to this office is well fitted to make the type of judgments which I am making.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Malley appears to specialise in trying to find ways of accusing people of misleading the House.  It seems to be one of the long standing interests in his political career.  He tries to pretend I misled the House in speaking to Deputy Harney.  That is not the case.  A conflict of interest did not arise in this case or in the other cases referred to, precisely because, as I have explained, Dermot Gleeson, as Attorney General, had made alternative arrangements, with my agreement, to deal with any of these cases.  The attempt by Deputy O'Malley to imply that I was misleading the House&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Furthermore, he again attempted to accuse me of having misled the House this morning in regard to an allegation he made that I had directed that a question be taken by another Minister. He then quoted what I said this morning from the record of the House as if this, somehow or other, proved his case.  If he reads the quotation again he will find that it does not.  If I correctly recollect his quotation of my words, I said that officials of my Department, with my knowledge, inquired as to the appropriateness of transferring the <Col N="908" /> question.  It was an inquiry as to the appropriateness of a specific course of action before a decision was taken.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I issued invitations on Friday last to <Col N="911" /> the leaders of all the relevant political parties in Northern Ireland to participate in bilateral talks with the Irish Government.  The parties concerned are the Ulster Unionist Party, the SDLP, the Democratic Unionist Party, Sinn Féin, the Alliance Party, the Ulster Democratic Party and the Progressive Unionist Party.</P>
    <P>I sincerely hope that there will be a positive response from all parties to my invitation.  I appeal, in particular, to the two main Unionist parties and to the loyalist representatives to consider carefully the basis on which the Government proposes these talks will take place.</P>
    <P>First, the agenda will be a fully open one.  I have been careful not to define or predetermine the agenda for any of the bilateral talks.  In a sincerely meant effort to build trust and goodwill, I have proposed in my invitations that the first bilateral meeting with each party should perhaps be devoted predominantly to a discussion on the policies, views and concerns of that party.</P>
    <P>Second, my invitations to the Northern Ireland parties are intended to build on the present unique opportunity to shape a durable political settlement based on an informed understanding of what is needed to accommodate honourably the Nationalist and Unionist traditions on this island.  That is the overwhelming desire of all people, North and South.  In the search for agreement, I want to be sure that the Irish Government's role will be as constructive and productive as possible. Thus, the bilateral talks are intended to help us and the Northern Ireland parties through gaining a first-hand and fully up-to-date knowledge of our respective positions.</P>
    <P>Third, I have not set a timeframe for responses to my invitations.  It is important to afford each party any necessary time and space to consider carefully its position.  I would hope that everyone will respect that, since some parties may wish to undertake an internal consultative process.  At the same time, I would naturally wish to <Col N="912" /> have definitive replies as soon as possible so that mutually convenient arrangements could be set in train for the commencement of bilateral talks.</P>
    <P>Finally, these bilateral talks are intended to contribute to the process of healing and reconciliation.  I know that there are genuine concerns and fears on all sides and that there are enormous legacies of hurt and mistrust to be overcome. However, the priceless gift of peace is now challenging everyone, particularly political leaders, to address these issues in a determined, but understanding, way.  My invitations to the Northern Ireland parties are part of wider efforts to assist this process.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the fact that the Taoiseach issued the invitations last Friday.  Three weeks ago he told me he was about to issue them.  After visiting the North I found out he had not done so.  Last Wednesday he told me he would not issue the invitations for some time, yet he issued them on Friday. What happened between Wednesday and Friday to bring about this change in tactics?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As I explained to the House, I have been engaging in informal contact with the parties to ascertain when would be the best time to issue the invitations in order to get the maximum number of acceptances.  I did not reach any firm conclusion from these contacts. After taking some advice, I decided last Friday that I could find myself in the position of postponing the issuing of the invitations indefinitely.  There is nothing significant about the timing one way or the other.  I acted on the decision I made on Friday.  The Deputy's questions are helpful in this matter.  If they remind me of issues like this they perform a useful function.  I will not say that the Deputy's questions did not have anything to do with this.  Opposition questions have an effect on what the Government does as indeed they ought.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not making an issue of this but I was taken aback by <Col N="913" /> the change in position.  The Taoiseach was right to do what he did because, as I stated a week ago, if he continued to wait we would never issue the invitations. Fianna Fáil wishes the talks process well.  Strand II which deals with the involvement of the Irish Government could be the key to moving the process forward.  Issues such as the decommissioning of arms, prisoners and so on under Strand I could prove difficult particularly as we are coming into the marching season.  I support Strand II even if some people reject it.  The British Government does not appear to have a strategy on Strand I.  In his attempt to move Strand II forward will the Taoiseach urge the British Government to put forward a framework for the talks?  At a meeting I had recently with Sinn Féin and the smaller loyalist parties, I was told that when they questioned the British Government about where the process is leading, there was no reply.  The Taoiseach could usefully try to show that there is a clear agenda and that his efforts are a path leading somewhere.  Our party chairman met Unionists last week and they said the same thing.  It would be useful if the Taoiseach had a coherent policy to put before them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a long and interesting question.  It is not the case that the British Government did not put forward proposals on Strand I.  On the day the Joint Framework Document drawn up by the Irish and British Governments was published the British Government published a document which was exclusively concerned with Strand I.  It referred to frameworks and sought to get discussions going with the parties in Northern Ireland on Strand I matters.  However, it did not get very far.  It issued invitations to these discussions on 14 April but to date the number of discussions which has taken place is limited.  I am not sure what the Deputy or his informants are driving at when they say they want more information from the British Government <Col N="914" /> about the process as distinct from the proposals in their framework document.</P>
      <P>If there was something identifiable which the British Government could usefully be doing in Strand I but which it is not doing I would be willing to urge them to do so within the context of the Anglo-Irish Agreement with the aid and assistance of the Tánaiste.  It is important to bear in mind that Strand I of the process is internal to Northern Ireland and the Irish Government has not involved itself in it.  One of the <i>quid pro quos</i> for our involvement in Strand II is that we have not got involved in Strand I.  There are limits, therefore, to what I can do.  It is a matter for the British Government and the parties in Northern Ireland to drive that part of the process forward.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, we should understand the limits of what we can do in Strand II.  We cannot come to any easy solution in Strand II unless there is a parallel arrangement in Strand I.  There has to be a body within Northern Ireland to which the Strand II arrangements can relate and that body can only emerge from Strand I.  I hope I have answered the Deputy's questions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for his reply.  I am aware that he cannot do anything under Strand I.  The point being made by people on both sides of the divide is that the British Government is using the process in which they are engaged to move very slowly.  It is no secret that the British Government is making it known through its sources that this could be a very long process. In order to ensure participation by all parties in Strand II and to generate support for the Taoiseach's efforts to ensure success, there should be a more coherent plan on how to move matters forward.  Already the smaller Unionist parties and Sinn Féin&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I understand the Deputy's concern but if either Government tries to be too prescriptive and says this is the way certain things will be done, etc. it will give the parties an excuse to say &ldquo;we do not agree with that and, therefore, we will not talk&rdquo;.  In the final analysis much of the work in finding a settlement will have to be done by the parties in Northern Ireland.  There are many things which the parties in Northern Ireland must do for themselves and which cannot be done for them by the British or Irish Governments. This is why I particularly welcomed the initial talks between the Unionists and the SDLP; this represented a major breakthrough.  Those parties have not spoken to one another at a formal level for many years.  This was ludicrous given that people in countries as far away as America and Europe were talking with other people with whom they might not necessarily agree about what should be done in Northern Ireland.  Yet the main parties representing the two communities in Northern Ireland were not engaged in formal discussions.  I understand that <Col N="916" /> they are now having very fruitful discussions.</P>
      <P>I would not get involved in all of the criticisms voiced about this matter over the weekend, but insufficient attention has been paid to the significance of the talks between the Unionists and the SDLP and, perhaps, undue significance has been attached to discussions with other parties.  This undue significance may not necessarily be helpful to those other parties in dealing with certain difficult issues as it puts them under pressure to come up with answers every second day, something they cannot do. It would be more appropriate if we paid more attention to and elevated the significance of the talks which are taking place between the Unionists and the SDLP.  These are the most important talks now taking place and they may create a climate in which the tremendous efforts being made by the Governments will come to fruition.  Without the building of a solid middle ground in Northern Ireland between people of moderate opinion on both sides it will be very difficult to put the solution together.  We have to bring the people at either end of the spectrum along with us but we cannot ignore the need to build a solid middle ground.</P>

The important factor is not the basis on which the talks are taking place, the framework within which they are taking place, the parameters of the discussion, the shape of the agenda or any of the artificial procedural and semantical issues which are usually given enormous significance in discussions; rather it is that the discussions take place, which I hope will be achieved reasonably soon.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. G. Mitchell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume that the Deputy is referring to the results of &ldquo;Monthly Surveys of European Opinion (January-March 1995)&rdquo; which were published by the EU Commission in April.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Commission publication indicated that 65 per cent of Irish people do not consider themselves to be well informed on European Union matters as compared with an average for the EU as a whole of 59 per cent.  The figures quoted in the Commission report equate exactly with the finding in this regard in the report of the Task Force <Col N="919" /> on Communicating Europe which I launched in February last.</P>
    <P>I am concerned at the low level of knowledge in Ireland of EU affairs which these surveys have pinpointed. The report of the Task Force on Communicating Europe set out a comprehensive series of recommendations to address this issue.  When I launched the report in February last I set out the following priority areas for action on foot of the report: (1) the production of user-friendly information on European programmes and funding; (2) the introduction of a European awareness programme in the second level school transition year; (3) the establishment of a new public access information point as part of the planned re-arrangement of the European Commission Office space in Dublin; (4) a major programme to support audio-visual production of European issues; and (5) advising people of their right to petition the European Parliament on anything in regard to European Union policy and programmes of concern to them.</P>
    <P>I have established a new task force focused on implementation of these priorities and of other measures deemed appropriate to further the objective of raising awareness of European issues in Ireland.  The task force includes representatives of the Dublin offices of the European Commission and European Parliament and I will be liaising closely with both offices in implementing the objective of raising European awareness in Ireland.</P>
    <P>It is my intention to advance as a matter of urgency action on the five priority areas I have referred to and on other appropriate initiatives.  My overall objective can be simply stated &mdash; I want the Irish people as a whole to be better informed on European issues and I want to ensure that accessible and user-friendly information on the European Union is available to any Irish citizen who requires it.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister agree that it is important that new information <Col N="920" /> coming from Europe &mdash; information which is vital to the interests of many business people and those involved with the social services &mdash; be available in local communities?  What progress is being made under the programme, <i>A Government of Renewal,</i> in regard to citizens' information supply?  Under the programme there is an arrangement whereby the NSSB and the Director of Consumer Affairs will overhaul the system to provide local information.  Will information on European affairs be linked to that development?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The task force which I chair recently considered how we might use outlets of this kind.  I will certainly try to tie it in with the necessity for making information available, particularly on a regional basis.  This matter is under active consideration.  In the 35 disadvantaged areas which I have designated in my role as Minister of State with responsibility for local development, I have already teased out with some of the companies the possibility of pilot schemes where we may be able to make available, through the partnership companies, information in relation to Europe to communities in greatest need.

      <P>During the course of the last European election and in my dealings with Brussels at Council of Ministers meetings I found that citizens are alienated by the language, style and format of directives.

      <P>There is more than a grain of truth in what the Deputy has said.  The task force report shows that 55 per cent of people believe the Government has a responsibility to make more information available but most people get their information from the media.  The reports they are getting in relation to Europe emanate mainly from Brussels.  Certainly many people regard Brussels as foreign.  I hope to change that to some extent but I cannot do it all on my own.  It has been easy to be good Europeans when we have received such a high level of transfer.  It is important that we get across the message that Europe is about peace as well as prosperity.  I will be seeking to get across the message of Europe in every way I can.</P>

Under its terms of reference I do not think it can go as far as the Deputy would wish.

I always found it frustrating at the Council of Social Affairs Ministers that a set position was outlined in a file showing the position the officials had reached on a particular point before I came to do my business.  I always decided what approach I would take. Deputy McDowell's suggestion would help to break down the mystique of Brussels.  The Minister from Denmark goes to the Council of Ministers with the mandate from the Danish parliament to state what they think of a forthcoming directive before it is approved.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Finance</askee>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Coveney)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government's programme, <i>A Government of Renewal</i>, provides that &ldquo;over the period of this programme it is intended that the growth of current supply services spending will be constrained to a maximum of 6 per cent, in nominal terms in 1995, and to an average annual rate of 2 per cent in real terms over the following two years of the programme.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, in answer to the Deputy's question, this Government has already placed a cap on public spending on the basis outlined in its programme.  The Government is committed to a policy of maintaining firm control over the public finances and adherence to the strict limits on the growth of public expenditure <Col N="925" /> which it has set for itself is the cornerstone of that policy.</P>
    <P>Capping spending will not, in itself, lead to an improvement in the quality of public services.  That requires the better use of resources.  Recognising this, the Government's programme also states that the Government is committed to reform of public expenditure that would lead to greater efficiencies, better quality of services, value for money, and improved morale in the public service. To give effect to this commitment, a programme of public service reform has been initiated and is being implemented across the public service.</P>
    <P>In tandem with this programme of reform, a strategic management initiative is being implemented in all Government Departments with the aim of improving the contribution which the public service can make to national development, especially through improved competitiveness, to provide a high standard of service to the public and to make the best use of resources. Therefore, I can assure the Deputy that the issue of the quality of public services is being fully addressed through the public service reform programme and the strategic management initiative.</P>

I can think of no better person to be involved in the area of public spending to which this question refers.  Although, as Minister for Defence and the Marine, he made a speech about this, I hope he will be in a position to curb the excesses of more senior Ministers in the Government.  Is he aware of the comments of the Governor of the Central Bank on the recent publication of the Central Bank report about the dangers of increasing the levels of public spending and his statement that we can only hope to achieve economic growth if we have control of public spending?</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I propose to take Questions Nos. 9 and 37 together.</P>
      <P>The net income for an employed married man, with a non-working spouse and four children, earning gross incomes at £1,000 intervals between £8,000 and £16,000 per annum is given in a tabular form and is being circulated to Deputies.  This table also sets out the additions to and deductions from gross income in arriving at levels of net income.</P>
      <P>The married man described would be better off in work at any level of earnings from employment when his earnings and family income supplement are taken into account.  It is estimated that an unemployed married man with four children would have a net income of £7,829 per annum when account is taken of all allowances, including secondary benefits, medical card, and the costs of local authority differential rent and work-seeking.  When this is compared with the information in the table it is clear that at all gross incomes between £8,000 and £16,000 this man is better off in work rather than on unemployment benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Improving the incentive to work is an important policy objective.  In his budget speech the Minister for Finance referred to the proposal in the Government's policy agreement to move towards a basic income for children.  This will involve moving from the current general <Col N="928" /> reliance on child dependant allowances and the existing family income supplement and towards a child benefit supplement.  This policy was reflected in the budget which, while leaving the rates of child dependant allowances and family income supplement unchanged, put more money directly into the pockets of low income families through the income tax and PRSI systems.  In addition, the significant increase in child benefit of £7 per child per month will be worth a further £336 a year to this family. These changes represent a real improvement in the income of all working families with children.</P>
    <P>The Government recognises the considerable complexities involved in adjusting the tax and welfare systems to improve the operation of the labour market.  It has set up a working group of experts in the tax and social welfare area to look at these issues with a view to developing a strategic approach to the closer integration of the tax and social welfare systems.  The Government has also asked the group to develop proposals for an income related child benefit supplement and to complete its final report by the end of 1995.  An interim report was made to the Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare in December 1993 while research on basic income commissioned by the group was published by the ESRI in September 1994.  The Government is awaiting the group's final report which it expects to receive towards the end of 1995.</P>

    <P>Notes on Table:</P>
    <P>1.  The main factors contributing to the apparent decline in net income as gross income increases are the withdrawal rate of family income supplement (60 per cent) and the operation of marginal relief for income tax (involving 40 per cent tax rate).</P>
    <P>2.  It is essential in interpreting this table that the mechanism for reviewing Family Income Supplement (FIS) is understood.  FIS is renewable on a 12 monthly basis.  When awarded it will not be reduced/withdrawn until the end of the period regardless of any upward movements in pay.  Therefore, gross income from employment can increase significantly during the course of a year while any adjustment of FIS will not occur until after the end of the year.  The expert working group has pointed out in its interim report that FIS withdrawal does not generally occur at the same time as a gross pay increase.</P>
    <P>3.  The number of people who potentially lose disposable income as gross pay increases are small. In so far as FIS and marginal relief income tax are the main elements of the trap, the number of people affected by the trap is essentially a function of the numbers who both receive FIS and pay tax.  The numbers of people both paying tax and receiving FIS is of the order of 1,500 to 2,000.  The OECD has also concluded that this situation potentially &ldquo;applied only to a very small proportion of the employee workforce (0.75 per cent)&rdquo;.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I am coming to that.  It means nothing unless one compares it with what the unemployed man is getting.  Perhaps the Deputy could give me scope because I am not used to this &mdash; I was asking the Department of Finance questions for six years but I never got a chance to answer them.</P>
      <P>Where a person is earning between £8,000 and £16,000 the figures are: £9,365, £9,687, £9,854, £9,838, £9,711. £9,024, £9,468, £9,912 and £10,356.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that a married man with a wife and four children, living in a local authority house, when family income supplement, differential rent, the value of a health card and the cost of getting to work are taken into account, is significantly worse off on gross earnings of £14,000 than on £10,000?  If he has gross income of £14,000 per annum his net disposable income is £9,720 whereas if he has gross income of £10,000 his net disposable income is £9,854.  Therefore he is more than £100 worse off for earning £4,000 more per year.  The simple fact is that in the Irish system a person is worse off on an income of £14,000 than on £10,000.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> As has been pointed out by the Deputy and <Col N="931" /> many others in the House, there are anomalies.  The Minister has provided some of the figures.  It has been known for some time that there are anomalies and much of the debate has centred on the person with an income of £8,000 and the person on unemployment assistance. As the Deputy correctly indicated, as one moves up the income scale there are anomalies which will have to be addressed.  During the period when the Deputy's party was in Government there was an undue concentration on the marginal rates of tax.  While the rates of tax were reduced the anomalies were allowed to remain.  It is the policy of this Government to target low income earners so that there will be a better incentive to work.  This was not achieved by concentrating on reducing the marginal rates of tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that reducing the marginal rates of tax is not the only issue but very few people would vote to put the clock back.  When the Progressive Democrats and Fianna Fáil formed a coalition Government the standard rate of tax was 35 per cent. With PRSI, the first rate at which workers paid tax was 42 per cent while top rates were well over 60 per cent.  It now transpires that if an employee earning £10,000 was offered and extra £4,000 by his employer &mdash; I accept that this is highly unlikely &mdash; he would be £120 worse off.  When employer's PRSI is taken into account the figure would be almost £4,500.  Surely the Government is not going to ask a task force to study this problem.  When is it going to be recognised that we cannot hammer those at the lower end of the earning spectrum who cannot look after themselves and when are we going to introduce real tax reform for those in this category?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The anomaly arises because the value of the family income supplement is reduced as the value of earned income increases. That is the net point; there are other <Col N="932" /> factors but they are of a minor nature. While the family income supplement has been effective in restoring the incentive to work for those on low pay, as one moves up the pay scale the value of the family income supplement is reduced. This allowance is not payable where a person has earned income in excess of £12,000.  The solution lies in the text of the answer provided by the Minister's Department.  If one was to move from family income supplement to basic income for children and if one was to target children, as happened in the budget, the amount of family income attributable to child benefit would be even, regardless of whether one was unemployed or at work.  This would be a more effective mechanism for supplementing income than family income supplement.  That is the direction the Government intends to take.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister that operating through the channel of an income for children is probably the right way to deal with any of these problems, but no one should cod themselves that a basic income is a global answer to the problem.  The ERSI report to which the Minister referred clearly indicated that a basic income for adults as opposed to children would involve a tax rate of over 60 per cent, possibly nearer to 70 per cent.  This would destroy employment completely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I am not referring to the general concept of a basic income.  A basic income for children would probably be a more effective supplement for family income than the family income supplement.  The Government intends to move in that direction.  There is a wider issue.  The available resources should be targeted at low income earners.  If we are talking about providing incentives in the economy there is a choice in where we spend money in terms of tax relief.  So far as the Minister and the Government are concerned, priority will be given to the lower paid.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept that the increase in public spending this year will be close to 10 per cent as the Deputy has suggested.  The increase in gross non-capital supply services expenditure will be 6.9 per cent.  This figure is provided for in the Revised Estimates for the Public Services which were recently published and includes the additional provision of £140 million towards the cost of meeting the entitlements of Irish women under the EU equal treatment directive.  If these once-off exceptional payments were excluded, the increase in current supply services is 5.6 per cent which is within the 6 per cent limit imposed by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The increase of 6.9 per cent this year compares very favourably with the level of increase in gross current spending experienced over the past five years, including in particular the years 1991 and 1992 when the Deputy's party was <Col N="934" /> in Government, when gross current spending increased by 10 per cent on average over those two years.</P>
    <P>The Government's figures on public spending have been presented and published in a fully transparent manner and in precisely the same format as in previous years.  There has been no attempt to conceal the true position or to resort to creative accounting in order to meet the demanding targets we have set for ourselves.  We have clearly indicated the position on spending at all times and I reaffirm our commitment to ensure that current supply spending is kept to the limits we have set for ourselves in the programme.  <i>A Government of Renewal.</i></P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mc Creevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Why did the Department of Finance on previous occasions use net estimates and, in further calculations, gross estimates?  Does the Minister of State agree that, if we exclude once-off payments and special increases such as equality payments and ignore the effect of the tax amnesty, the real increase in Government spending in 1995 over 1994 will be at least 10 per cent, if not somewhat higher?</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughCoveney" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not agree with that and I have explained why.  On the question of the gross and net figures, my information is that it is quite transparent. The Department favours the gross figure because introducing the Appropriations-in-Aid to reach the net figure often can mask increases and an examination of the gross figure is more demonstrative of the real increases.  As the Minister for Finance said in the course of his Budget Statement, that is the methodology that is being used but, if one wants to apply it to the net, obviously one will get a different set of figures but in neither case would one get 10 per cent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Minister of State that any comparison of the 1995 figures over those for 1994, excluding the factors I mentioned, will demonstrate an increase of expenditure of <Col N="935" /> slightly above 10 per cent, using just the basic figures or ordinary mathematics.</P>
      <P>On the matter of transparency in national accounts there is a further question on the Order Paper today.  If we are to continue to increase levels of expenditure, as will be the case this year, into 1966, it will restrict economic activity and slow down growth.  Will the Minister accept that we should learn some lessons from the past, demonstrating that the maintenance of these levels of public expenditure do nothing for the long term sustainability of our economy?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> The Government has given a commitment to commission a professional study on the funding of local government with a view of publishing a White Paper on the subject and seeking to develop the maximum degree of consensus.  In its policy statement, <i>A Government of Renewal</i>, the Government stated that the future of the residential property tax will be considered in the context of this study.</P>
      <P>My colleague, Deputy Howlin, the Minister for the Environment, who will be commissioning the professional study, has obtained proposals from interested bodies to undertake the study.  It is expected that it will commence in the near future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that that review will not be completed by the summer since we are almost at the end of this parliamentary session.  Would the Minister agree that it is most unhelpful to local authorities, facing into consideration of the 1996 estimates in the autumn, that members of the Government are sending out different signals to them with regard to their future?  On the basis of what he said in his reply, is it the intention of the Government that service charges will remain until such time as the study to which he has referred is completed?</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I am not aware of any different signals being sent to local authorities.  My colleague, the Minister for the Environment, has responsibility for local authorities in accordance with Government policy. The programme, <i>A Government of Renewal</i>, set out clearly what we will do in this context.  That is now being put into place, the relevant Minister having been in touch with interested bodies.  It is expected that the professional study will begin very shortly.  No other decision has been taken in respect of <Col N="937" /> any local or national tax within the context of that study.  Whenever one commissions experts to examine the effectiveness of any form of taxation one must await their report before taking any such decisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously, the Minister was not listening to his colleagues in the Labour Party at the recent Labour Party conference at which all sorts of suggestions were put forward.  Is he aware that £55 million is the estimated amount raised by local authorities to fund many projects at local government level?  Furthermore, would he agree it would not be possible for the Department of Finance to find that funding and that, on that basis, it will be the policy of this Government, until such time as the review of amalgamation or otherwise of the residential property tax and local service charges has been completed and the Department of Finance that such charges remain, and that funding of £55 million-plus will be provided by local authorities using their own resources?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The Deputy will readily appreciate that if and when any tax is dropped, always there will be a commensurate reduction in the amount of money available for expenditure.  Unless expenditure is lowered at the same time as the tax is abolished, it must be funded in some other way.  The Minister for the Environment is about to commission a professional study which will investigate all relevant matters.  Any Members who have served on local authorities will be aware that this is a very vexed political issue, one of great controversy, but it is the intention of the Minister for the Environment to publish a White Paper to ascertain what degree of consensus can be found among the different parties serving both here and on local authorities. Certainly, a significant amount of money is raised by way of local charges.  I do not have information to authenticate the Deputy's figure but I can accept it.  For example, the residential property tax raised £14 million in <Col N="938" /> 1994 and even though this year's Finance Bill will reduce that yield by approximately £4 million, £10 million in addition to what the Deputy suggested is a significant amount of money.</P>

It is important that the Minister confirm that that is the intention of the Government.</P>

      <P>The White Paper on Education entitled, <i>Charting our Education Future</i>, was published following consideration and approval by the Government.  The Minister for Finance participated in that process which would, of course, have included consideration of the cost implications of the White Paper.</P>
      <P>I could not confirm the cumulative cost to the year 2000 of implementation of the White Paper policy proposals and provision for pensions referred to by the Deputy.  As the Deputy will appreciate, the cost of education measures is determined to a large extent by pay costs, which in turn reflect numbers employed in the sector and pay rates at any given time.  It would not be useful or appropriate to comment on what these cost elements might be to the year 2000.</P>
      <P>As indicated in the White Paper, the Government will aim to provide the resources for the development needs identified in the White Paper, within the framework of the budgetary parameters set out in the Government of renewal policy document, including the acceptance of the Maastricht Treaty convergence conditions.  The amount which can be made available in any given year will have to be decided by the Government in the context of its financial position and its other public expenditure priorities at that time.  In this context the Government will have the opportunity to consider any potential for reallocating resources within the education sector in the light of demographic changes.</P>

In that context will the Minister say whether the Department of Finance conducted an estimate of the cost implications of the policy proposals, which are now Government policy, for the period between now and the year 2000?  Why was not one word in the 225 pages of the first edition of this benighted document devoted to the subject of how much it would cost?  Will the Minister say &mdash; a simple yes or no will suffice &mdash; whether the Department attempted to evaluate the cost implications? If so, will he indicate the cost implications in the White Paper?  If the Department did not attempt such an evaluation, will the Minister explain the reason for not doing so?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>

For instance, as indicated in the White Paper, the report of the steering committee on the future development of higher education is not available and the issue of early retirement has not been concluded.  The impact of demographic change on the cost of education is difficult to assess at this stage.  Accordingly, I am not prepared to elaborate further apart from saying that any cost arising from implementation of the White Paper proposals will be met within the constraints of the Government's budgetary parameters and the Maastricht Treaty convergence conditions.

      <P>Proposals for the financial restructuring of commercial semi-State companies are considered, in the first instance, by the Minister directly concerned and by his Department.  The proposals are subjected to appropriate commercial, economic and social analysis with the assistance of appropriate professional expertise by the Department concerned.</P>
      <P>The conclusions reached following that process are then submitted to the Department of Finance for consideration. The end result of this process is that a total review of the State bodies' operations will have been carried out and any investment proposals will be considered in the light of that review.</P>
      <P>As regards the companies mentioned. I refer the Deputy to the statements made in the House by relevant Ministers.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister of State agree that it is proposed by the Government, subject to EU approval, to invest an extra £50 million in Irish Steel?  Will he also agree that it is anticipated that TEAM Aer Lingus will incur losses in the next four years which will require an investment of £60 million in that firm?</P>

      <P>Regarding Irish Steel, as the Deputy is aware the circumstances of that company have been dealt with in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am asking for confirmation of the proposed £50 million investment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughCoveney" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the figure.  The implementation of the Irish Steel viability plan, which had been based on a report of Simpson Xavier Consultants, began in September 1994.  The plan includes a request for an investment of £50 million comprising £40 million in equity and £10 million in loan guarantees. Under the rules of the European Coal and Steel Community a national government may not subsidise a steel company which is unable to achieve long term viability.  In considering applications for State aid to the steel industry the European Commission applied the criterion that the recipient should achieve viability within a three year timeframe.  The Commission is presently examining the Irish Steel plan and has appointed its consultants.  It is anticipated that it will be some months before the Commission and the Council of Ministers finally decide on the application. The Government and Irish Steel accepted a recommendation of the Simpson Xavier report that in tandem with this reorganisation the company should attempt to attract a strategic partner.  Negotiations are taking place with a number of potential investors. Securing a partner would be likely to improve the prospect of obtaining EU approval for the company's viability plan.  If a strategic partner is secured, that partner would be expected to contribute to the investment programme, details of which would be a matter for negotiation.  The Government has retained the Investment Bank of Ireland to assist in assessing the proposals from prospective investors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding TEAM Aer Lingus, the State has already invested £125 million in the Aer Lingus group as part of the restructuring plan approved by the <Col N="947" /> Government.  The final tranche of £50 million will be paid over in December subject to the approval of the EU Commission. That final £50 million was paid in 1994 into the special account provided under section 16 of the Air Companies (Amendment) Act, 1993 and, therefore, it does not impact on the 1995 budget.  In his statement of 17 May, the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, Deputy Lowry, outlined the measures proposed in the five year business plan for TEAM submitted by the chairman of Aer Lingus.  The proposals do not envisage State investment in the company, but do envisage the Aer Lingus group providing in excess of £60 million in interest free loans to TEAM.</P>

      <P>I wish the Minister of State well in his new role.  He referred to the criteria applied to semi-State companies, two in particular.  Does he know if it continues to be the policy of the Department of Finance that semi-State companies, particularly groups such as Aer Lingus and Telecom Éireann, should dispose of as many of their subsidiaries as possible?  Regarding the attempts of the Department of Finance to reduce substantial debts, particularly in Telecom Éireann, is it its view that cash should be raised by the disposal of subsidiary companies and is it pushing for that?  I appreciate that is something he may not be able to answer today given that it is his first day dealing with questions relating to that Department, but if he has a view on this matter, I would be interested in hearing it.</P>

      <P>The latter part of the question on whether the Department has expertise charged with evaluating such investments is valid.  The <Col N="948" /> Minister mentioned that the Department used outside investment companies. Having regard to the multi-million pound projects and the semi-State sector being so valuable, is it not time that the Department employed experts to evaluate projects rather than employing outside expertise at a heavy cost to the taxpayer?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughCoveney" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>Within the Department of Finance there is a high degree of expertise capable of evaluating projects, but I do not consider that a good argument against occasionally bringing in experts with proven ability in specific areas, particularly that of finding an international strategic partner for Irish Steel.  That type of expertise would hardly be appropriate in the Department as it might not be needed often and, in the overall context, it would cost more to employ such people to be available to deal with an occasional task.  It makes sense to use outside experts in such cases.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>

Will he ask his colleague, the Minister for Finance, to work out some rationale as to why some jobs are hammered out of existence to subsidise others which seem to be in a privileged area with no better prospects for viability?</P>

I know something more about the position in Irish Steel than TEAM Aer Lingus.  Regarding Irish Steel it is not a question of the Government saying will we invest £50 million or nothing.  The problem for a Government in dealing with such a matter is that it involves £50 million, £40 million, £35 million or some other horrendous figure to do something else.  It is not simply a matter of giving £50 million to Irish Steel and nothing to Sunbeam.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Treacy tabled an amendment on Committee Stage suggesting that a limit of £25,000 should be placed on the fee in question, but I did not agree with that.  The amendment he has tabled on Report Stage suggests that the fee should be increased to £50,000. Since Committee Stage the task force appointed by the Minister has published its report.  On Committee Stage I asked him why he was proceeding with the Bill in advance of a report from a task force carrying out a comprehensive review of the minerals industry.  I now concede that in its report the task force has welcomed the introduction of the Bill and, on that basis, I withdraw any criticism I made on earlier Stages of this Bill about the Minister introducing what I termed a &ldquo;single issue&rdquo; Bill.  The task force confirmed there was a legal urgency to proceed with such a Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The task force recommended that there should be a limit on the amount of application fees and the industry suggested it should be £25,000.  My objections to this proposal on Committee Stage did not relate to the amount of the fee, but to the fact that the State could incur substantial expense in carrying out its legal obligations to study all aspects of a mining application, including the stringent environmental requirements applied by the State.  Substantial expenditure could be incurred in the case of proposed complicated mining developments and placing a limit on the fee in legislation would not, in all cases, afford the State an opportunity to recoup expense it would not be obliged to incur were it not considering an application for a mining licence.  I recognise the concern of the industry that in the <Col N="1027" /> absence of a limit in this regard, the Department and those whom it seeks to advice it could become involved in extremely extravagant, elaborate and, in the view of some people, unnecessary investigations, reports and studies involving major costs which it would then believe it had the automatic right to recoup by way of fees.  The Minister must strike a balance between ensuring the industry is not ripped off by careless action on the part of the Department and the obligation on the State to recoup the expenditure it necessarily incurs in carrying out its investigations.</P>
    <P>With the political events that have occurred since I received the voluminous report of the task force, unfortunately I have not had an opportunity to study it in detail.  Will we have an opportunity in the near future either to discuss its content by way of special debate or will the Minister take immediate action to give effect to its principal recommendations? Will the Minister indicate his intentions in that regard?  Also, will he indicate the reaction of the Department and Government to those recommendations?</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that the mineral industry has great potential for wealth and job creation.  It can prove to be of great benefit in the development of our economy and should require the maximum support of the State.  I hope that is the Government's intention.  Its commitment can best be judged by the policy it seeks to follow in this area.  If there was a clear indication of an intention to implement the main recommendations of the task force on the minerals industry, one could reasonably hope that action will be taken in the short term rather than the long term.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I was told and I can only go by what I am told.</P>
      <P>I want to reinforce the case I made for this amendment on Committee Stage.  I concur with most of what Deputy Molloy said.  I have had the experience, as he has had, of serving in the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications, which had responsibility for mineral matters.  In my time at the Department, that was my responsibility.  I realise there is frus-tration in the industry and in this regard I welcome the report of the National Minerals Policy Review Group.  The group must be thanked for the contribution it has made.  It scanned the report, which comprises 131 pages, and I am impressed with it.  I would like to study it in more detail and, like Deputy Molloy, I hope we will have an opportunity in the coming months to have a detailed debate on the report here in the House.</P>
      <P>From my political knowledge of the past 13 years, I know that when a Bill such as this is passed, it is unlikely that a new Bill will be brought forward dealing with the minerals development area. This is an opportunity for the Minister and the House to ensure that this Bill, which will be an incentive to the industry, is made available to it.  We are a small nation but we have large mineral resources which can make a major contribution to our economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From my knowledge, nationally and internationally, I would say that our handling of minerals affairs, and our management of mines and mine sites in particular, is equally good as in other parts of the world.  That does not necessarily mean it is good enough and I hope that, as a result of the report of the <Col N="1029" /> review group, this Bill and the professionalism of the people involved in mining, will ensure in the future &mdash; as Arcon will show in Galmoy &mdash; that we have the highest professional standards. There is a unity of purpose in that regard and people are more environmentally conscious now.</P>
    <P>The Department has a responsibility for the management of our national mineral resources and for the promotion of their development.  It cannot expect the industry to carry the risks of that development and of exploiting those resources while being charged exorbitant fees which may be an impediment to the development of our mineral resources.</P>
    <P>Many small exploration companies, professional geologists and others obtain licences to carry out research here.  They undertake some development and eventually conclude that an opportunity exists for further development provided risks are taken, cash raised and planning permission obtained.  If we were to put further impediments in the way of those companies and individuals, we might lose some of the opportunities for international investment in mining development in Ireland.  These people act as honest brokers.  They do not have the necessary resources and they must look to the international world.  Ministers may be sensitive to pressure from organisations or from within their own parties.  They may have a particular ethos to which they want to aspire. There may be changes in Government during a period where applications are before the Department for a decision.  A new Minister, conscious of a particular situation, may decide to have additional consultants employed to re-examine an application that may already have been examined by other consultants.</P>
    <P>If we allow this to happen, we will not make any progress in the development of minerals here.  We must make it clear to those involved in the mining industry, the financial institutions and the people concerned with protecting our environment that this is the way forward. <Col N="1030" /> This report will be seen as a bible in this regard.  People who intend to take risks should know exactly what they will be required to spend.  The exploration and mining division of the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications should be the one-stop-shop where people can go for information in regard to fees, etc.</P>
    <P>While the Minister's colleague was very negative in her attitude on Committee Stage &mdash; and she was entitled to adopt that attitude &mdash; I have since changed my amendment by increasing the fees by 100 per cent.  This amendment will be sustained into the future until another new Bill is published.  We must send a positive signal to the industry in this regard and I ask the Minister to accept this amendment in the interests of mining development in Ireland.</P>

      <P>The Minister is committed to giving urgent and careful attention to the 52 recommendations in the report and would therefore welcome comments as quickly as possible.  The Minister's intention is to seek Government decisions on these recommendations as soon as that consultative process has been completed.

    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and I ask that I be allowed to reply now to the points made by both Deputy Molloy and Deputy <Col N="1032" /> Treacy, who tabled the amendment.  I see it as highly desirable that when that consultative process is completed &mdash; and I do not expect that to happen in a fortnight &mdash; there would be a debate in the House, to be agreed by the Whips, on the report.</P>
      <P>The amendment tabled by Deputy Treacy calls for a doubling of his original proposal of £25,000 to a £50,000 cap on fees.  The higher cap proposed goes some way towards recognising that mine development projects vary considerably in nature, size and complexity and that large complex mine development projects would require considerably more examination by the Minister than small projects.  The amendment proposes an arbitary cap on application fees and, therefore, is not acceptable.  It is desirable to have a system of fees &mdash; and I will deal with that when we come to the other amendments &mdash; which would be more transparent.  People are entitled to know exactly the amount of fee payable. I do not accept &mdash; I am sure the two Deputies with their experience in the Department would agree with me &mdash; that officials dealing with mining matters have an irresponsible attitude and look for costly reports that are not required.  In the Department they do a good, well trimmed job on behalf of the industry and will continue to do so.  That point should be made on their behalf.</P>
      <P>As I think the Deputy will find my proposals acceptable I ask him to withdraw his amendment.  I am sorry the Deputy cannot get the details until we have dealt with his proposal.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 5, line 9, to delete &ldquo;with the concurrence of the Minister for Finance, determine&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;with the consent of the Minister for Finance, prescribe by regulations&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 2 and 3 are closely related.  Their purpose is to reform the arrangements which applied heretofore on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis by requiring that, when the Bill is enacted, application fees for certain mining facilities must be prescribed by ministerial regulations which regulations could be annulled by the Dáil or Seanad if either House so decided.  Thus the new statutory arrangements would meet the minerals industry demands for certainty and transparency as regards such fees for the future.</P>
      <P>There was considerable discussion on Second Stage and Committee Stage about section 5 of the Bill, particularly regarding the level of application fees. Members of the House and the minerals industry accept the principle of charging application fees for State mining facilities. It is proper that developers should be required to pay a fee towards the cost of the examination by the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications of mine development proposals so as to clear the way to permitting project to proceed on a sound basis as quickly as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications reiterated on Second Stage his commitment to keep such application fees as low as possible consistent with carrying out a thorough examination of each application as the Minerals Development Acts require him to do.  The proposed regulations <Col N="1036" /> provide a transparent mechanism for keeping application fees under review and revising them quickly if required. As both the Minister and Minister of State, Deputy Doyle, explained, a standard application fee cannot be applied to all mining projects.  Mining projects vary considerably in nature, size, financial commitment, environmental effects and planning implications.  The necessary examination of mine development proposals by the Minister must reflect these differences.  For example, major base metal projects present far more complex issues for consideration than small industrial mineral projects.</P>
    <P>For that reason I cannot accept Deputy Treacy's latest suggestion that a limit of £50,000 should apply in every case.  However, following the debate in the House and in the Select Committee on Enterprise and Economic Strategy the Minister has given detailed consideration, in consultation with the Minister for Finance to the level of fees. He proposes in regulations to be made under section 5 of the Bill after it becomes law to specify application fees for State mining leases or licences as follows: matalliferous minerals such as zinc and lead £15,000 plus 10p per annual tonne of the design capacity of the mine; the greater of the £15,000 or 50 per cent of the total fee will be payable on application and the balance within six months of application.  Other minerals such as gypsum, calcite, dolomitic limestone and so on the fee will be payable on application &mdash; £5,000 if the design capacity is less than 100,000 tonnes per annum and £10,000 in other cases.  The Minister believes that these proposals meet the concerns expressed in the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that we did not have that information before the vote was taken on my amendment as it would have facilitated the debate.  The Minister is proposing a fee of £15,000 for metalliferous minerals and 10p per annual tonne of mine capacity over a period of time.  While there is merit in setting the fees, the Minister needs to <Col N="1037" /> clarify whether the consultancy fees incurred by the Department in having an application evaluated or re-evaluated will be chargeable to the applicants.  The fees seem reasonable but I would like the Minister to give an assurance that we will have an opportunity to debate the regulations when they come before the House.  Given the volume of legislation with which we have to deal and the demands on Members, particularly those in Opposition, we may not have an opportunity to debate the regulations. A general and detailed debate on the regulations would help to clarify matters.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposed new subsection (4) states:</P>
      <P>Where under regulations made under this section a fee is payable in respect of any application, the application shall not be considered or decided, as the case may be, by the Minister unless the Minister is in receipt of the fee or the appropriate part thereof, as the case may be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This seems to indicate that the fees will have to be paid before the Department considers an application.  This means that the fee would have to be lodged in the Department before any work commenced on the application.  The Bill refers to an application for a licence, a lease, an undertaking or the carrying out of an undertaking.  The activities for which a licence may be approved are covered under this legislation and earlier minerals legislation.  The Minister seems to be adopting a new approach by requiring the applicant to put the money up front before the Department considers the application.  In many cases applications can be under consideration for a long time.  For example, an application for a lease or mining licence <Col N="1038" /> could be under consideration for many years.</P>
    <P>On the fees outlined by the Minister, I feel there is something missing.  I understood from our earlier discussions that the Department was seeking to ensure that the costs it incurred in dealing with an expensive application for a mining licence could be recouped.  If it becomes involved in an expensive environmental impact study and has to have assessments carried out then the costs could amount to much more than £15,000.  It is a pity that we are dealing with this matter on Report Stage where members are allowed to speak only once.  However, if the Minister can give me a reasonable explanation that will be satisfactory.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>We have calculated the amount and the costs will level out.  For example, the fee for a mine with an annual capacity of one million tonnes will be £100,000 plus £15,000.  I hope I have dealt with the point made by Deputy Molloy.  It is transparent that a company will immediately know the exact fee it has to pay &mdash; it will know the capacity of the mine and that there is a fixed fee of £15,000 plus 10p per annual tonne.  There was merit in Deputy Treacy's amendment but there was a lack of transparency, something we are required to have.  This matter <Col N="1039" /> was debated earlier today and I do not intend to go into details now.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Justice, Deputy Nora Owen, has asked me to say she regrets that, because of other very urgent commitments, she is unable to take this Bill today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a short but very important Bill which was introduced to deal with problems that have resulted from two judgments of the Central Criminal Court in connection with an incest case <Col N="1042" /> dealt with by that court.  The Bill has been extensively amended in its passage through the Seanad.  It now contains provisions which go further than the original proposals and additional provisions which amend and strengthen the Punishment of Incest Act, 1908, have been included.</P>
    <P>The basic purpose of the Bill is to protect the interests of children who have been abused.  I understand that the Private Members' Bills introduced in both Houses &mdash; in this House by Deputy O'Donoghue &mdash; would not, in themselves, have been sufficient to achieve that purpose.  The amendments that have been made to this Bill take account of those Private Members' Bills and I am confident that the text of the Bill as approved by the Seanad will meet with the approval of this House.</P>
    <P>The effect of the judgments of the Central Criminal Court to which I referred is that information relating to the hearing of a prosecution for an incest offence cannot be disclosed.  The result is that a health board social worker, for example, concerned for the welfare of a child incest victim, could not be told whether the child's offending father had received a sentence for incest.  In fact, the social worker could not even be told that there had been an incest prosecution.  This situation is manifestly damaging to the interests of victims and potential victims of child sexual abuse.  I know I speak for all Members when I say that it must be remedied without delay.  The Bill provides this remedy.</P>
    <P>For the avoidance of any doubt, I should say that in commenting on the adverse effects of these judgments &mdash; something which I must do, in my statement &mdash; I am not to be taken to imply any criticism of the judge who made the decisions.  He dealt fully and carefully with the logic of the relevant statute.  It is evident from his judgments that he was most unhappy with the conclusions he felt obliged to reach.  The problem here is one for the Legislature, not the courts.</P>
    <P>This Bill deals with the major issues <Col N="1043" /> raised by the judgments.  This is essential if we are to ensure the protection of victims or potential victims of incest. While to a limited extent this Bill goes beyond what is strictly necessary to deal with the effects of these judgments, the House will appreciate that further issues arise in this area which are not affected by these judgments.  It is vital, before we proceed to legislate on those matters, that we receive the opinions of others, including, in particular, those with expertise in the area of child sexual offending.  To facilitate the necessary consultation process, the Minister will publish a consultation paper on the issues involved as quickly as possible after the Bill is enacted.  I will return to the consultation paper in my statement.</P>
    <P>Before I proceed to describe the provisions of the Bill, it would be useful, by way of background, for me to clarify what is involved in the offence of incest and to outline the details of the relevant Central Criminal Court judgments.</P>
    <P>Incest is an offence which was created by the Punishment of Incest Act, 1908. Under section 1 of that Act, it is an offence for a male person to have sexual intercourse with a person who is, to his knowledge, his grand-daughter, daughter, sister or mother.  Section 2 of the 1908 Act is the counterpart of section 1 and it provides that the offence is also committed by a female who, with consent and full knowledge of the family relationship involved, has intercourse with her grandfather, father, brother or son.  Consent is not a defence to a charge of incest.  In that sense it is an absolute offence which is committed when intercourse takes place.  It should also be noted that where two adults within the same family engage in consensual intercourse, both the man and the woman are liable to prosecution.</P>
    <P>Incest is, of course, one of the charges that is frequently brought where a child has been sexually abused by a very close relative.  One of the reasons for this is that, as I mentioned, it is an absolute offence in so far as the male participant is concerned and, accordingly, an <Col N="1044" /> absence of consent does not have to be proved.  As the House will be aware, non-consensual intercourse constitutes rape and frequently both rape and incest are jointly charged.  Similarly, if a girl victim is under age the perpetrator may be prosecuted, in addition to incest, for the offence of unlawful carnal knowledge of a girl under 15 or 17, as the case may be, under section 1 or section 2 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1935.</P>
    <P>As I indicated, this Bill arises directly out of judgments from the Central Criminal Court in an incest case.  On 1 February 1995, the court held that section 5 of the Punishment of Incest Act, 1908, continues to have full force and effect.  That section provides that &ldquo;all proceedings under this Act are to be held in camera&rdquo;.  The important words in this context are &ldquo;in camera&rdquo; because the court went on to rule that they must be taken to mean that all such proceedings must be held, to quote the court, &ldquo;in total privacy and secrecy with the admission of no persons, other than the immediate parties, including the press ... with the community at large not being entitled to know even of the happening of the case, let alone any sentence which might be imposed&rdquo;.  A further judgment was delivered by the Central Criminal Court on 17 February, 1995 in connection with the same case, in which the court ruled that it was precluded by section 5 of the 1908 Act from disclosing whether the accused had been sentenced.  This was in response to an approach from the Eastern Health Board which had sought the relevant information because it was concerned for the health and safety of the children of the accused man.</P>
    <P>In this particular case the accused had been charged with two counts of rape and two of incest.  He pleaded guilty to the incest charges and the rape charges were not proceeded with.  The application of section 5 of the 1908 Act only arose in relation to the passing of sentence for the incest offences.  In the light of its interpretation of section 5, the <Col N="1045" /> court determined that it had no discretion but to decide that sentencing should take place in the absence of interested parties &mdash; as distinct from immediate parties &mdash; the Press and the general public.</P>
    <P>The significance of the Central Criminal Court rulings lies in the way in which the court interpreted the words &ldquo;in camera&rdquo; in the 1908 Act.  As far as the Department of Justice is aware, this is the first occasion that section 5 has been taken to have such a restrictive meaning.  Up to now the practice in the Circuit Court, where cases in which the sole charge is incest are tried, has been to exclude the public but to permit the Press to attend and to report on the proceedings subject to certain restrictions. Where incest has been joined with other charges triable in the Central Criminal Court under the rape Acts, the practice has been to apply the provisions of those Acts which allow the general public to be excluded but the case to be reported by the Press in accordance with a number of important conditions, for example, protection of the identity of the victim.</P>
    <P>I should also mention that it would not appear to have been open to the State &mdash; or any other party &mdash; to appeal the Central Criminal Court rulings directly to the Supreme Court.  The only way in which the Supreme Court could be asked to rule on those issues would be by way of separate legal proceedings which would have to be initiated in the High Court and it would inevitably take some time before the matter reached the Supreme Court.</P>
    <P>The Minister has received representations from various parties with an interest in the protection of children who have expressed very strong concerns to her about the effects of the judgments of the Central Criminal Court.  Both of us share those concerns and, in particular, I believe that we should not tolerate a situation, which arose in the case in question, in which information vital to the interests of a child should be denied to a caring <Col N="1046" /> agency such as a health board.  Furthermore, we are convinced of the need to keep the public aware and vigilant of the fact that child sex abuse is actually occurring and that it is a crime of the most serious kind.  We fully recognise that the holding of incest cases in total secrecy could have the result of gradually pushing the subject under the carpet. No right-thinking person wants that.</P>
    <P>It is also clear that the judgments have given rise to anxiety among the Members of the Oireachtas.  This was particularly evidenced by the Private Members' Bills introduced by Deputy John O'Donoghue and Senator Cathy Honan.  As I have already mentioned the main aspects of the Private Members' Bills have been incorporated in the Minister's Bill by way of amendments made in the Seanad.  The overall result is that the Bill will restore the position whereby the media will be able to carry reports of incest prosecutions.</P>
    <P>I am conscious of the fact that the Bill is only concerned with incest proceedings. This is the case because the Minister is anxious to ensure, as a matter of urgency, that social workers and other parties concerned with the protection of children, who need to have essential information concerning prosecutions, will be able to get that information. That is clearly the crucial point.</P>
    <P>The Minister has not, however, lost sight of the fact that there is a need to consider the general question of the reporting of cases involving sexual offences.  This is something she intends to do because she is aware, as most public representatives who deal day in day out with members of the public will also be aware, that the nature of newspaper reporting on child sexual abuse cases is a subject on which many people have views.  It is right, in a democracy, that we provide room for debate on matters of this kind.  It is absolutely vital &mdash; and I know the Minister wants to stress this &mdash; that we acknowledge the enormous contribution made by the media in bringing the problem of child sexual abuse out from under the carpet and <Col N="1047" /> keeping it before our eyes.  Far too many children have been the victims of secrecy and silence.</P>
    <P>The Minister has decided to raise the question of what reporting and related arrangements should operate in respect of certain sexual offences where consent may or may not be an issue.  These include the following: unlawful carnal knowledge of a girl under 15 or 17; sexual intercourse of buggery with a mentally impaired person; buggery of a person under 17; and gross indecency with a male under 17.  She also intends to ascertain whether there is support for having specific restrictive reporting etc. in relation to the offence of sexual assault which, while it is provided for in the Rape Acts, is not subject to the same requirements as rape offences in that regard.</P>
    <P>Deputies may query the need for including various matters in a discussion paper rather than proceeding now to legislate on those matters.  The Minister has decided on the former course, not out of any reluctance on her part to act but simply in recognition of the wisdom of seeking the views of individuals and organisations with recognised expertise on such matters before she acts.  In addition, to do so in this particular Bill might cause a delay in dealing with the very important issue of lack of protection of incest victims.  What she is proposing in this Bill is to ensure that if a similar case arises again in our courts the victim will be protected.</P>
    <P>On the need for consultation on the other questions, the Minister has asked me to say that she will not be concentrating on legal expertise alone.  She is particularly concerned to ensure that she has the benefit of the insight of individuals and organisations who have expertise in dealing with the problems of sexual offending generally, and a special understanding of the plight and the real needs of its victims.  I urge that Deputies accept the good sense of proceedings with the benefit of insight rather than on the basis of the sometimes obvious answer which is not <Col N="1048" /> necessarily the right or complete one. The Minister does not, of course, envisage that the process of consultation should be allowed to drag on indefinitely. The preparation of her consultation paper is already under way and her plan is to publish it very quickly after this Bill is enacted, with a tight timetable for the receipt of responses and a firm commitment and determination on her part to bring before the Oireachtas with minimum delay, such further proposals for law reform as may be required in this area.</P>
    <P>I will listen carefully to what Deputies will say during the debate on the need for further changes to the law relating to sexual offending.  Deputies can be assured that any proposals they may put forward will be brought to the Minister's attention.</P>
    <P>I would now like to turn to the provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 1 states that in the Bill the Punishment of Incest Act, 1908 is referred to as &ldquo;the Act of 1908&rdquo;.  This is merely a technical provision which has been included for drafting purposes and it does not require any special explanation.</P>
    <P>Section 2 goes to the heart of the Bill and is modelled on provisions in the rape Acts.  It provides in subsection (1) that, where a person is being dealt with in any court proceedings under the 1908 Punishment of Incest Act, the judge or the court, as the case may be, shall exclude from the court during the hearing all persons except officers of the court, persons directly concerned in the proceedings, bona fide representatives of the press and such other persons, if any, as the judge or the court may, in their discretion, permit to remain.  Subsection (2) also requires that any verdict or decision in an incest prosecution and the sentence, if any, shall be announced in public.  At present section 5 of the 1908 Act requires that all proceedings under the Act be held in camera and the recent Central Criminal Court judgments mean that, not alone must the public and the press be excluded <Col N="1049" /> from such proceedings, but the fact that they are taking place and the outcome cannot be disclosed even to a caring agency such as a health board with a specific interest in the welfare of an incest victim.</P>
    <P>The general effect of section 2 is to retain the exclusion of the general public from incest proceedings.  Deputies will appreciate that this is necessary to protect the identity of an incest victim and the family involved.</P>
    <P>The section also proposes, however, that the press would be entitled to attend incest hearings and to publish reports of the proceedings subject to certain restrictions provided for in section 3 which I will discuss shortly. The Minister and I believe that the members of the press have a vital role to play in highlighting the problem of sexual abuse and it would be appropriate that they should be in a position to inform the public of the facts that have given rise to an incest prosecution provided that appropriate measures are in place to safeguard the identity of the parties in the case.</P>
    <P>Section 2 also allows a court to permit a relative or a friend to accompany an incest victim who is required to give evidence in proceedings under the 1908 Act.  We are all aware of the very difficult situation victims face in court and I have no doubt that there is a need to ensure that a person who has been a victim of incest, particularly a child, is entitled to the support of a person they can trust when they are present in court. In the debate in the other House, a number of Senators stressed the need to make provision in the Bill to enable an incest victim to be accompanied in court.  Deputies will also be aware that the type of arrangements proposed for incest cases in that regard in the Bill has operated very successfully in assisting rape victims under the rape Acts.</P>
    <P>Before I conclude on section 2, I draw the attention of this House to the fact that subsection (2) obliges a court to announce any verdict, decision or sentence in a case under the 1908 incest Act <Col N="1050" /> in public.  Such a provision will guarantee, for example, that a health board or social worker can ascertain the outcome of an incest prosecution.  It will also ensure that the general public is aware of what is happening in relation to the outcome of prosecutions.</P>
    <P>Section 3 is concerned with protecting the anonymity of persons involved in incest cases.  Under the section, it will become a criminal offence for a person to broadcast or publish any material which could identify an incest victim or a person charged with incest.</P>
    <P>Section 3 (1) provides that after a person is charged with an offence under the 1908 Act, no matter likely to lead members of the general public to identify that person as a person charged or to identify any other person in relation to whom the offence is alleged to have been committed shall be published in a written publication available to the public or broadcast.  A similar prohibition is contained in the rape Acts.  In view of the very close family relationship that will always exist between the parties in an incest case the anonymity of the accused will not be lifted at any stage. To that extent what is proposed represents a departure from the rape Acts which permit the name of a convicted rapist to be disclosed after a conviction has been obtained.  Deputies will appreciate, however, that there are compelling reasons for adopting a different approach in relation to proceedings taken under the Punishment of Incest Act, 1908, and that every effort must be made to protect the identity of the victim and the family involved.  That is the sole reason we have departed from what is provided for in the rape Acts.</P>
    <P>In the rape Acts the victim of an offence is referred to as the &ldquo;complainant&rdquo;. I understand that that term would not necessarily be appropriate to incest and, accordingly an alternative wording has been included in section 3 which achieves the same result.</P>
    <P>Section 3 (2) states that if any matter is published or broadcast in contravention of subsection (1) the following <Col N="1051" /> persons shall be guilty of an offence: (a) in the case of matter published in a newspaper or periodical publication, the proprietor, the editor and the publisher thereof; (b) in the case of matter published in any other written publication, the publisher thereof, and (c) in the case of matter broadcast, any person who transmits or provides the programme in which the broadcast is made and any person who performs functions in relation to the programme corresponding to those of the editor of a newspaper.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will appreciate, the prohibition on the publication or broadcast of material caught by section 3 extends to a proprietor and an editor involved in such publication or broadcast.  This is also the position under the equivalent provisions in the rape Acts.  Some people might argue that it would be sufficient for the person who discloses the relevant information to be charged. However, it has become the practice in the case of this type of offence that proprietors and editors should be held responsible for the actions of others who operate under their authority.  In that regard there is no evidence that the inclusion of such a provision in the rape Acts has given rise to any difficulty in relation to the operation of those Acts.</P>
    <P>Section 3 (3) contains two savings in relation to the section.  Paragraph (a) provides that the section shall not prevent the publication or brodcasting of a report of legal proceedings other than proceedings under the 1908 Act. For example, the section will not restrict the reporting of a prosecution for perjury committed at an incest trial.  Paragraph (b)  preserves the effect of restrictions on the publication etc., of certain matters which are contained in other statues.  It provides that the section shall not affect any other prohibition or restriction on the publication or broadcasting of any matter.</P>
    <P>Section 3 (4) defines the terms &ldquo;broadcast&rdquo; and &ldquo;written publication&rdquo; for the purposes of the section.</P>
    <P>I come now to section 4 which relates <Col N="1052" /> to offences under section 3.  Subsection (1) makes provision for the penalties that will apply in respect of a section 3 offence.  Subsection (2) deals with the liability of an individual where an offence has been committed by a corporate body.  Both these subsections are in standard form.</P>
    <P>Subsection (3) provides for a defence to a charge brought under the section where the person charged can prove that he or she was not aware, did not suspect, or had no reason to suspect that the material published or broadcast was material which could not be disclosed. Such a defence is also permitted in the rape Acts.  The reason for its inclusion is to prevent an injustice where, for example, a disclosure is made inadvertently. It does not, however, offer a defendant an easy means of escaping liability because, to come within the scope of the defence, the person must prove that in the particular circumstances he or she is entitled to be relieved of criminal responsibility.  It will not be sufficient for the person to say that he or she did not know that they were not entitled to disclose the material in question.  The court will have to be satisfied that that was the case.</P>
    <P>Section 5 amends the Punishment of Incest Act, 1908, in a number of respects.  It reflects the thinking behind a set of amendments tabled by the Independent Group of Senators in the Seanad.  While the Minister was not in a position to accept those amendments, for technical reasons, she undertook to amend the Bill to meet the concerns raised by the Senators in their amendments.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (a) has two purposes.  First, it establishes that the maximum penalty for an offence under section 1 (1) of the 1908 incest Act will be life imprisonment. Deputies may recall that under the Criminal Justice Act, 1993, that penalty was increased to imprisonment for 20 years.  Previously the maximum period of imprisonment to which a person could be sentenced for the offence was seven years.  While the Minister accepted that the change made by the <Col N="1053" /> 1993 Act was very significant she was also conscious of the fact that a life sentence can be imposed for other very serious sexual offences such as rape and aggravated sexual assault.  To ensure that we are consistent in our approach to the way in which sexual offenders are dealt with the Minister agreed it would be appropriate for a court to have the power to sentence the perpetrator of an incest offence to a term of life imprisonment. This has been provided for in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The second element of section 5 (a) is that it proposes that an offence under section 1 of the 1908 Act will be designated as a felony rather than as a misdemeanour as at present.  The significance of this change is that it will serve to indicate that the offence is particularly serious and will also ensure that a person who is suspected of that offence can be arrested immediately.  It will not be necessary for the Garda to obtain a warrant before they can carry out an arrest in these cases.</P>
    <P>Section 5 (b) proposes the deletion of section 1 (3) of the 1908 Act which provides that if any male person attempts to commit the offence of incest he shall be liable at the discretion of the court to be imprisoned for any time not exceeding two years with or without hard labour.  In this context I should mention that section 1 (3) was not amended by the 1993 Criminal Justice Act.</P>
    <P>In the Seanad a number of Senators expressed the very strong view that, given the seriousness of the offence of attempted incest, the penalty provided for that offence in the 1908 Act was totally inadequate.  The Minister shared that concern.  Accordingly, she arranged for the inclusion of paragraph (b) in section 5 of the repeal of section 1 (3) of the 1908 Act, thereby ensuring that the penalty for attempted incest will be the same as that for the main incest offence.  No further amendment of the 1908 Act is required to secure that result.  It will be achieved because it is a general part of our criminal law that an <Col N="1054" /> attempt to commit a crime can be punished in exactly the same way as the full crime unless, as in the case of the 1908 Act at present, a separate penalty is provided for in respect of the attempted offence.</P>
    <P>Section 6 of the Bill proposes the repeal of section 5 of the 1908 Incest Act.  The section in the 1908 Act states that all proceedings under that Act shall be held in camera.  Deputies will appreciate that, in order to give effect to sections 2, 3 and 4 of the Bill, it will be necessary to repeal section 5 of the original Act.  In that sense section 6 is essentially technical and does not deal with any new substantive issues.</P>
    <P>Section 7 simply provides for the short title of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I have dealt in some detail with the provisions of the Bill and, in particular, I have outlined the way in which it tackles the problems that have emerged following the rulings of the Central Criminal Court to the effect that section 5 of the 1908 Act requires that incest proceedings must take place in total secrecy. I know that the Minister will consider what Deputies have to say about the Bill with an open mind.  For obvious reasons she is anxious to have this legislation enacted as quickly as possible. She hopes it will prove to be the case that most, if not all, of their concerns will have been met in the approach she took in making very substantial changes to the text in the light of amendments tabled in the Seanad.</P>
    <P>I would ask Deputies to be mindful, however, of the approach the Minister has taken to the Bill &mdash; that is to deal with the immediate problems now and to address other issues in the context of the consultation paper.  Until this legislation is enacted the effect of the Central Criminal Court judgments will remain in force.  I know all Deputies will accept that it is necessary to remedy that position with the measures contained in this Bill as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>The Minister accepts, of course, that the more general issues require attention in the context of the arrangements that should operate in relation to the <Col N="1055" /> reporting of sexual offences.  These matters will be addressed in the discussion paper which the Minister will present to interested parties as quickly as possible. I know that she would be more than willing to consider any specific proposals Deputies might have regarding what might be included in the discussion paper.</P>
    <P>I believe there is widespread general support for this Bill.  I hope and expect that support will be shared by the Members of this House.  In the circumstances I am happy to commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>When I first viewed the Bill, as published by the Minister for Justice, I was in full agreement with her intention &mdash; that the effect of the two judgments delivered by Mr. Justice Carney in the Central Criminal Court on 1 February and 17 February 1995 must be addressed.  Those decisions undoubtedly were correct.  Mr. Justice Carney correctly stated that an alteration of the law should result from legislation rather than from a court decision.  No Member of this House would wish to see a continuation of the circumstances in which no information whatsoever may be given in relation to incest proceedings.  I agree that amendment of the law is not only desirable but absolutely essential.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where I initially joined issue with the Minister was regarding the manner in which she had sought to implement the necessary changes because it was clear to most people that what was needed was a simple amendment which would extend the reporting provisions of the Criminal Law (Rape) (Amendment) Act, 1990 to incest proceedings.  Rather than initially introducing legislation of that nature, the Minister compiled what I can only describe as a piece of legislative bric-a-brac that had all the appearance of being held together by chewing gum and string.  The Bill, as introduced, was all but unintelligible and, if passed, undoubtedly would have given rise to more problems than it sought to solve. <Col N="1056" /> Sections 2 and 3 of the Bill were all but incomprehensible.  Section 2 (1) stated:</P>
    <P>(1) Subject to section 3 of this Act, notwithstanding section 5 of the Act of 1908, in any proceedings under that Act, the verdict or decision, and the sentence (if any), concerned shall be announced in public but anything likely to lead members of the public to identify a person involved in the proceedings shall not be otherwise published.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>Has Deputy O'Donoghue difficulty in understanding that?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 2 (2) stated:</P>
      <P>(2) Nothing in the said section 5 shall be construed as prohibiting the publication of reports of proceedings under the Act of 1908 that do not identify, or include anything likely to lead members of the public to identify, a person involved in the proceedings and do not include information that the judge or the court has directed should not be made public.</P>
      <P>That was difficult enough to comprehend but section 3 (1) <i>(a)</i> and <i>(b)</i> beat it by a short head.  It stated:</P>
      <P>(1) Where the same proceedings relate or, at any time, related to both an offence under the Act of 1908 and an offence referred to in section 10 of the Act of 1990&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) section 6 (inserted by the Act of 1990) of the Criminal Law (Rape) Act, 1981, shall apply to the proceedings as if the first-mentioned offence was an offence referred to in the said section 10, and</P>
      <P>(b) section 5 of the Act of 1908 shall not apply to those proceedings.</P>
      <P>Section 3 (2) stated:</P>
      <P>In this section &ldquo;the Act of 1990&rdquo; means the Criminal Law (Rape) (Amendment) Act, 1990.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1057" /> I am glad that was clarified because that is about the only portion of that Bill I could comprehend when I first read it.  I think everybody will agree that that amounted to verbiage of an unprecedented scale.  I do not know who was responsible for it but, without any shred of doubt, it was a rainbow of complexity which failed abysmally to achieve its objective, which was simply the publication of details of the evidence and of the sentence imposed in the circumstances of the case.  Therefore, for obvious reasons, I welcome the Minister's decision to amend the Bill she introduced in the Seanad by the insertion of the principal sections of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Bill, 1995 published by Fianna Fáil in the wake of the High Court judgments.</P>
    <P>In this respect I note that the substantive measures reproduced in this Bill, the former one having been withdrawn, are the substantive provisions of the Fianna Fáil Bill.  For example, section 2 of the Bill before the House essentially reflects virtually all the wording, with a very minor amendment, of section 3 of the Fianna Fáil Bill and section 3 of this Bill reflects virtually every sentence of section 4 of the Fianna Fáil Bill, with additions.  I welcome that because at least the Minister has achieved the objective she set out to achieve by taking on board the very sensible provisions in the Fianna Fáil Bill.</P>
    <P>I applaud the Minister's decision to put the interests of incest victims to the fore by introducing the measures best suited to solving the problem, even if they did come from Fianna Fáil.  I sincerely hope this is a precedent and that in future positive measures put forward by Fianna Fáil, whether they relate to bail, the proceeds of crime or any other matter, will be dealt with in the spirit in which these suggestions were taken on board.</P>
    <P>It is a good day for democracy when the Minister for Justice listens and learns from informed parliamentary debate.  I am very glad she did that in the Seanad because it is a sign that she <Col N="1058" /> may be maturing in terms of her attitude to Fianna Fáil legislation.  In the final analysis we are all here to serve the public and to pass the best legislation for the public, and irrespective of the source of that legislation it is incumbent on the Government to accept legislation that is constitutionally sound and in the interests of the general public.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;one of which was introduced by Deputy Shatter relating to judicial separation.  The problem has at all stages been clear.  As a result of Mr. Justice Carney's rulings of 1 February and 17 February 1995 no information can be disclosed about incest cases.  This development is obviously unsatisfactory as it deprives caring agencies of the information necessary to tackle an extremely serious crime.  In this respect I welcome the amendment at section 5 of this Bill whereby the judge will be given discretion to sentence a person to a life term for a crime of this kind.  I also welcome the fact that the crime is no longer to be a misdemeanour but felony.</P>
      <P>The reason no information can be given at present relates to the wording of section 5 of the Punishment of Incest Act, 1908.  This is a reflection in many ways of the fact that many of these crimes were swept under the carpet for a very long time.  The fact that the legislation we are speaking about dates back to 1908 is reflective of the fact that there was a need to, at the very least, modernise section 5 of that Act in the last 87 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 1908 Act requires that &ldquo;All proceedings under this Act are to be held <i>in camera</i>&rdquo;.  Mr. Justice Carney ruled that this meant the proceedings must be held &ldquo;in total privacy and secrecy, with <Col N="1059" /> the admission of no persons other than the immediate parties, including the press, with the community at large not being entitled to know even of the happening of the case let alone any sentence which might be imposed&rdquo;.  What is clearly required is that the law be amended to permit the exclusion of members of the public from court but to permit members of the press to be present to report the case.</P>
    <P>In the past the House considered precisely the same difficulty with the crime of rape.  We resolved that difficulty in a clear and understandable way by means of section 6 of the Criminal Law (Rape) Act, 1981.  That Act provided for the anonymity of complainant and accused. An application of those provisions to the crime of incest would obviously solve the problem.  I again commend the Minister for acknowledging the deficiencies in her legislation and amending it accordingly.</P>
    <P>When Fianna Fáil published the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Bill, 1995, we were keeping the promise we made at the outset of this administration. We promised that, where legislation was necessary and introduced by the Government, we would support it and where it was necessary and not introduced by the Government we would introduce it.  We have done this with the Proceeds of Crime Bill, the Criminal Law (Bail) Bill and the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Bill which was designed to give adequate protection to the victims of incest and to ensure that appropriate information is available in the public domain.  The amendments introduced by the Minister, Deputy Owen, arising from the Fianna Fáil legislation will ensure this will happen.</P>
    <P>I particularly welcome the decision of the Minister to repeal section 5 of the Punishment of Incest Act, 1908, as it is of dubious constitutional validity.  The Constitution requires that justice be administered in public.  Article 34.1º of the Constitution provides that justice: &ldquo;save in such special and limited cases <Col N="1060" /> as may be prescribed by law, shall be administered in public&rdquo; but section 5 of the 1908 Act prohibits that.  There is no doubt there are circumstances in which the public good requires the exclusion of members of the public from a court &mdash; for example, in rape cases.  The question whether bona fide representatives of the press may also be excluded is a different matter.  This results in justice being administered in secrecy, which is in direct violation of the Constitution of 1937.</P>
    <P>It was virtually inevitable, having regard to the publicity this matter has attracted since Mr. Justice Carney's ruling, that there would have been a constitutional challenge to the validity of section 5 of the 1908 Act.  If that happened section 5 would have been found to be inconsistent with the Constitution and the amendments the Minister is seeking to introduce in this Bill would have fallen with it, leaving the victims of incest without protection as to their identities.  The Minister has, in the amended manner in which the Bill has been presented to the House, taken heed of the warnings about the probable unconstitutionality of section 5 of the 1908 Act.</P>
    <P>Mr. Justice Carney, in a thinly veiled reference to the probable unconstitutionality of the section, said he was satisfied he had the power to deal with the matter but that it was preferable for the Legislature to do so.  Professor Casey in his work on the Constitution voiced a similar but more direct criticism. The reality is that no reputable constitutional lawyer has voiced the opinion that section 5 of the Act is constitutional and it would have been a very unstable foundation stone for amending legislation.  The measure before the House will afford the same protection to victims of incest as is afforded to victims of rape, and that is wholly appropriate.</P>
    <P>The Minister has travelled a great deal of the road to meet our concerns about this legislation.  I warmly welcome her actions and commend the spirit in which she adopted the Fianna Fáil <Col N="1061" /> measure.  I hope she will not consider that I am trespassing too much on her generosity when I invite her to go a few steps further and afford the same protection to the victims of the crime of unlawful carnal knowledge.  At present due to an inexplicable legislative lacuna there is not a prohibition on publishing the name of a victim of unlawful carnal knowledge.  As simple an amendment as that tabled by Fianna Fáil in its Bill and supported by the Minister would add unlawful carnal knowledge to the category of rape offences.</P>
    <P>In view of the generosity the Minister showed in accepting the substantive provisions of the Fianna Fáil Bill, I will assist her further by reading our proposed amendment to the Bill.  It states:</P>
    <P>Subsection (1) of the Criminal Law Rape Act, 1981, as inserted by section 12 of the Criminal Law Rape (Amendment) Act, 1990, is hereby amended by the addition of the offences of unlawful carnal knowledge of a girl under the age of 15 years contrary to section 1 of the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 1935, the offence of unlawful carnal knowledge of a girl over the age of 15 years and under the age of 17 years contrary to section 2 of the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 1935 and an attempt to commit either offence to the list of rape offences set out in that section.</P>
    <P>The reason I ask the Minister for Justice and the Minister of State to accept this amendment is that under current law it appears there is no restriction on the publication of the identity of a victim of unlawful carnal knowledge.  I am sure everybody in this House would agree that position should not continue.  To my knowledge the Irish media have not ever printed the name or address of a victim and I commend them for that, but some individual may decide to do so in the future.  It is the duty of this House to close that legislative loophole to ensure that the victim of that horrendous, heinous offence of incest or unlawful carnal knowledge should not <Col N="1062" /> be named.  That is why I ask the Minister to amend the Bill to ensure that victims of unlawful carnal knowledge will have the same protection as victims in other cases of sexual offences.  As unlawful carnal knowledge applies to girls under 15 years of age and those over the age of 15 years and under the age of 17 years, a victim's name or address should not be printed as that would be devastating for the young girl and bad and all as the offence is, that would mar her for life.  Our amendment should be accepted.  I am surprised it was not taken on board as all the provisions in the Fianna Fáil Bill have more or less been taken on board by the Minister, particularly those regarding the substantive provisions in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Having gone through the complex language in the original Bill, it appears that while details of the conviction and sentence could have been published details of the evidence could not have been published.  If I am right the person in the Department of Justice who drafted the original Bill got it very badly wrong.  I am surprised at that.  I am well aware that perhaps the best drafts people in Ireland, if not in western Europe, are employed in the Department of Justice.  That is why I am at a complete loss to understand why the Minister for Justice hardly ever produces any legislation.  Any legislation she has produced in this House in recent times was either brought forward from the previous administration or was the seeds sown by the previous Administration. To his credit, the Minister of State, Deputy Currie promised to introduce a juvenile justice Bill and I do not doubt his good faith in that respect. However, I am deeply concerned that there appears to be an element of what I can only describe as legislative constipation in the Department of Justice at present.  I ask the Minister to alleviate this situation.</P>
    <P>I warmly welcome the spirit in which the Minister supported the Fianna Fáil measure and I urge her and the Minister of State to accept it.  Maybe it is significant that the Minister for Justice <Col N="1063" /> accepted the Bill I published in the Seanad but when I publish Bills and introduce them here the Minister does not accept them.  Perhaps if in future Fianna Fáil published all its Bills under the name of a Senator the Minister for Justice would accept them in the Seanad and that would save us a great deal of difficulty.</P>

      <P>This Bill provides an opportunity to debate an issue which depressingly has become a frequent source of controversy in the press due to a number of high profile cases.  This week we had cause to deal with matters of incest.  It is appropriate we should have the opportunity to consider the tragedy of child abuse, particularly incest.  It is only beginning to be written and spoken about.  Not so long ago the word &ldquo;incest&rdquo; was rarely used either inside or outside this House.  It was spoken of quietly by professionals, including doctors, and sometimes tragically the only way evidence of incest was displayed was in the form of a newborn baby.  We must accept incest is a story of the powerlessness of a child and it usually begins in childhood.  It is about the abuse of a relationship based on power over vulnerable children who have no capacity to chose or to know the sort of activity in which they are involved.  It often involves coercion, threats, betrayals of fundamental trust and, in many cases, distortion of subsequent relationships for the remainder of the victim's life.  Incest is an evil crime.  We do not know its true rate here, but studies abroad confirm that children <Col N="1064" /> are most at risk behind the closed doors of their homes and that most child abuse is perpetrated by fathers or brothers, men related to the victim who carry out acts of gross indecency frequently too difficult to contemplate.  The details of the west of Ireland case shocked everybody and the judge in the case said his sleep was disturbed.</P>
      <P>It is vital that we receive details of incest cases because the more we hear of such activities the freer victims will be to make disclosures.  It will also enable responsible adults to make critical interventions to protect them. While child abuse is discussed much more openly than it was ten or 15 years ago, we are only beginning to acknowledge the truth of the matter and we are still loath to discard the illusion that the family is the ultimate safe haven and guarantor of security, morality and happiness for children.  In the vast majority of cases a family based, or not based, on marriage is the best place to care for children but, as evident from recent cases, it can also be the most dangerous place if it is headed up by a child abuser. As well as protecting the family in our Constitution, it is time we considered the rights of born, as distinct from unborn, children in our Constitution, as recommended in the report of the Kilkenny incest case.  The unborn child is already protected in the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the past decade or so there has been a reluctance to make critical interventions to protect children when the alleged abuse was taking place within the confines of a family.  We have not yet managed to put in place even minimum standards of protection to enable responsible adults and health care professionals to make that critical intervention to champion the rights of children over the rights of the family, where appropriate.  It is evident from case studies on incest and child abuse that many of the families in which such abuse takes place are physically and socially isolated from the local community. In most cases the abusing parent is the guardian of that isolation, ensuring that the children are kept at <Col N="1065" /> one remove from society and at a distance from anyone who might come to their aid.  Many such families are disfunctional in the internal sense of the word as well as in a wider social sense. The family in the Kilkenny case was disfunctional and isolated and the report on that case stated the saddest feature was that the mother was either enmeshed or incapable of protecting the child.  This was also a feature of the Kelly Fitzgerald case &mdash; a case of neglect &mdash; which involved totally enmeshed and complicated relationships.  In many cases that main person who could be relied on in the case of child abuse &mdash; the mother &mdash; is so down-trodden or enmeshed as to be incapable of making interventions to protect the child.  Such a case gave rise to the Kilkenny incest inquiry.  The victim in that case disclosed abuse she had suffered and reported to various social services, general practitioners and so on on more than 100 separate occasions, but nothing was done to bring her abuser to justice, even after she gave birth to a child, the father of whom was her father.  She slipped through a range of nets until the important intervention by a Garda who followed up the case.  A person also took the trouble to follow up the West of Ireland case and eventually the matter was brought to prosecution.</P>
    <P>The Kilkenny report was published in 1993, but I am disappointed with the pace of progress on its recommendations. This was supposed to be the report to end all reports.  It set out a range of legislative, procedural and institutional measures which would improve reporting and co-ordination between the various disciplines.  It is regrettable that reporting is still not mandatory.  There has not been accountability in the case involving Kelly Fitzgerald who died or in the west of Ireland case where an internal inquiry is proposed.  Health service professionals cannot objectively analyse and be truly accountable to the Minister for the performance of the health board.  While the report on the Kilkenny incest case laid out all the facts, nobody was made <Col N="1066" /> accountable for what happened or for the failure to follow up her reports to the authorities.</P>
    <P>Another recommendation of the report on the Kilkenny case was that more refuges should be set up to provide a place of solace and hiding for girls who escape from their abusers.  The Minister may correct me if I am wrong, but I believe there are still more refuges in the North than there are in the South. The recommendation that reporting should be mandatory has not been followed up, the Minister introduced guidelines only recently.  Such procedures would be Exchequer neutral. Surely a procedure for mandatory reporting can be put in place without bleating from those who claim it would require resources.  A range of procedures can be put in place that do not require resources.  I accept that the hiring of social workers would require additional resources, but no amount of resources can compensate for lack of efficiency and accountability, and failure to co-ordinate follow-up action.</P>
    <P>Those procedures do not incur a cost. Social workers must stop being defensive. We are all interested in the same goal, the protection of children.  If the Minister delegates statutory authority to the health boards to care for children there should be accountability to this House and to the Minister for the satisfactory performance of those duties. The deficiencies revealed in the report on the Kilkenny case were so chronic that I believed the report would motivate everybody to carry out a root and branch reform of the structures, but that has not happened.</P>
    <P>The social services are often criticised when we hear about cases such as the one in the area of the North Western Health Board.  Social workers say they do not have the legal ability to intervene in these cases.  Their excuses may be valid because certain sections of the Child Care Act are not yet in place and they do not have the legal power to demand to see a child they suspect is being abused.  They also do not have the power to put in place supervision orders <Col N="1067" /> and I accept that.  The Child Care Act was passed in this House after much detailed work in 1991 but, four years later, only 17 of its sections have been passed into law.  I raised this matter with the Minister but it is the responsibility of successive Governments to enact the remaining sections.  Budgets are about choices but it appears that resources are only made available in a reactive way to deal with a problem arising from a scandal involving child abuse.  However, there is not any sustained commitment to putting children first in terms of providing resources to deal with this area. This Government is making a whole range of public expenditure choices but they could have been made in favour of implementing all the sections of the Child Care Act.</P>
    <P>This Bill was presented by the Minister on 1 March and introduced in the Seanad on 14 March.  Coincidentally, that was the date of the judgment on the appeal of Mr. Z, the man found guilty of the defilement of the girl at the centre of the X case.  It was the conclusion of a long saga which caused a constitutional crisis and resulted in great tragedy for the girl concerned.  The case began with the State championing and protecting the constitutional rights of an unborn child and ended, two years later, with a perversion of justice as it applied to the born child, Miss X.  I do not believe the public will ever accept that a sentence of four years' imprisonment was justified in that case.  This man had sexual intercourse with a 12 year old girl.  He impregnated her, attempted to point the finger of blame at an innocent youth and only entered a guilty plea at the door of the court.</P>
    <P>On 11 May I questioned the Minister in relation to that case and the activities of prosecuting counsel in defending the appeal sentence.  The Minister told me she would be bringing forward proposals in that regard in due course. However, at the time of the judgment on the appeal, promises were made of judicial training, reviews of sentencing procedures and the Minister of State in <Col N="1068" /> the Department at the time, Deputy Burton, gave a commitment to examine the possibility of changing the role of the prosecuting counsel in defending the sentence.  However, all the hype dies down when the papers no longer write about the case.  This also raises the question of the role of the DPP in prosecutions.</P>
    <P>No proposals have been made for the introduction of measures that would promote consistency and transparency of sentencing.  There have not been any firm proposals for the separate legal representation in court of victims of sexual abuse.  I try to obtain statistics from the Taoiseach each week during Question Time on the percentage of validated allegations of sexual abuse being dealt with by the DPP's office and I am told those figures are being compiled for me.  The judge in the case to which I have referred pointed out the need to change the law in this whole area.  While this legislation is reactive, it is also very necessary.</P>
    <P>The Bill was minimalist when it was first presented to the Seanad.  I accept the legislation was necessary following Mr. Justice Carney's judgment.  He had identified an anomaly which had to be eliminated as a matter of urgency but other issues which needed to be remedied were not included in the Bill. However, the Bill is much improved and great credit is due to the Minister and the opposition Senators for their constructive work in changing it.</P>
    <P>I do not understand how the Minister could have presented a Bill which contained a measure excluding bona fides members of the press from the court in incest cases.  Incest and child abuse are not private matters, they are not matters of family law.  Incest is a heinous crime and it is vital, in terms of justice for victims, that it is a matter of public record. The effect of the Bill in its original form would have been that in a case where a person was convicted of incest, the sentence would have been announced in public but social workers, lawyers, other members of the public or other judges would have been unable to establish the <Col N="1069" /> sort of behaviour that led to that sentence. It may have fostered an unhealthy climate of secrecy, which is usually at the core of incest.</P>
    <P>I do not understand how the Minister could have presented a Bill to the Oireachtas which would have denied victims of incest the comfort and reassurance of a friend, doctor or counsellor to accompany them to the hearing. As a result of amendments put down by Senators Honan and Mulcahy, those anomalies have been eliminated. The Minister has amended the Bill to allow bona fides members of the press attend the trial.  The judge is also permitted, at his discretion, to allow other persons to remain in the court with the victim.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the Minister's willingness to take on board some of the suggestions made to her, other glaring omissions in the Bill, which were highlighted in the Seanad, will have to be addressed on Committee Stage.  One of the anomalies is partly due to the continued failure to reform and consolidate the law in relation to child abuse cases. Sections 1 and 2 of the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 1935, criminalises the unlawful carnal knowledge of young girls.  This offence which should be renamed &ldquo;child abuse&rdquo;, was central to the X case.  The 1935 Act is completely separate from the various other statutes dealing with rape and other sexual offences because the many detailed provisions contained in the Criminal Law (Rape) Acts of 1981 and 1990, which regulate the trial of rape and sexual offences, do not apply to prosecutions for defilement of young girls, even though these sections are regularly used in the prosecution of child abuse cases.</P>
    <P>The most disturbing consequence of this oversight is that where men who are charged with defiling underage girls under the 1935 Act are brought to trial, their victims have no guarantee of anonymity such as that extended to the victims of rape and sexual assault under section 7 of the Criminal Law (Rape) Act, 1981.  This was pointed out by Senator Honan in the Seanad during the <Col N="1070" /> debate on the Bill and amendments were tabled by her which would have eliminated this loophole.  The Minister declined to accept the amendments and indicated it was her intention to review this area.  I am not sure whether this review is under way or if the Minister intends to bring forward a consolidating statute of the sort required which would encompass all the law in relation to sexual offences.  There is not any promise in the legislative programme to do so.</P>
    <P>In the absence of firm proposals from the Minister I will table similar amendments to Senator Honan. Another point raised in the Seanad and which we will raise is that under sections 3, 4 and 5 of the Criminal Law (Rape) Act, 1981, counsel on behalf of the defence is prohibited from questioning the victim on her previous sexual experience.  The Rape Crisis Centre and others who have dealt with victims of sexual crimes have repeatedly pointed out that questioning rape and other assaults victims on their sexual history is demeaning and painful for them and is usually utterly irrelevant to the issues before the court.  In effect it places the victim on trial and this is why the reforms of the 1981 Act were so necessary.</P>
    <P>Senator Honan's amendments were designed to ensure the victims of incest would be protected from such intrusive and irrelevant questioning on their previous sexual history.  In the course of the debate in the Seanad the Minister said that Senator Honan's proposals in this regard would not be accepted in any form.  She stated:</P>
    <P>Sections 3, 4 and 5 of the 1981 Act are concerned in particular with restrictions that apply to questions with a person other than the accused. This is a mechanism to stop the accused from using the fact that a victim may have had intercourse with others as a means of showing that consent was not lacking in his case. This is not relevant to the offence of incest in the case of a girl under 15, <Col N="1071" /> accordingly there is no point in applying sections 3, 4 and 5 to that offence.</P>
    <P>She went on to say that the application of sections 3, 4 and 5 to the crime of incest would lead to a situation where somebody accused of incest with a girl under 15 years could say that she consented. I do not see the logic of that argument.  As the Minister correctly pointed out, consent is no defence to a charge of incest.  The imposition of restrictions on the kinds of questions that can be asked of an incest victim would not affect that fact in the slightest.</P>
    <P>The Minister appears to be saying that the only purpose of the restrictions imposed on questioning by the 1981 Act was to ensure that the accused could not construct an argument to the effect that the victim was a woman of easy virtue, that she had consented to intercourse with others and therefore could be presumed to have consented to intercourse with the accused.  The Minister is not painting the full picture.  She is correct in stating that the introduction into evidence of a victim's past sexual history was often used in the past to support an argument that the victim consented.  She has, however, failed to take into account the fact that the introduction of this type of evidence was very frequently used more as a general mudslinging device; if the defence counsel could convince the jury that the victim was sexually promiscuous it could also be persuaded that she was a liar and her evidence was worthless, in other words it went to the root of her character.  The evidence of her past sexual history would be used to undermine her credibility as a witness and not only to support the defence of consent.  It is not only about consent but also about raising questions in the mind of the jurors about the type of person who is alleging incest.</P>
    <P>In addition, the fact that rape victims knew their sexual history was likely to be placed before the court in as sordid a light as counsel could manage was a <Col N="1072" /> powerful disincentive to go into court. Before the 1981 Act I imagine that many sexual offenders were not charged because of the reluctance of their victims to put themselves on trial in this way.  In the context of incest there is no legal bar whatsoever on counsel on behalf of the accused introducing evidence of the victim's past sexual history with other people, not as the Minister suggests in order to establish consent but to establish that the victim was an unreliable witness.  In addition the Minister has failed to give any consideration to the fact that while consent is not a defence to a charge of incest, it may be of crucial importance to the accused when it comes to sentencing.</P>
    <P>If the Minister had given this issue a moment's reflection she would have known that a person convicted of incest is likely to receive a much reduced sentence where he successfully argues that the incestuous act was consensual and non-violent in nature and he may well escape custodial sentence altogether. This is particularly true of cases where the accused successfully alleges that the girl or woman involved was the instigator of sexual activity, which is classic in child abuse methodology.  Paedophiles think that children enjoy the sexual act and that is part of their perversion. I do not think that issue was considered by the Minister.  It may be in the accused person's interest to make all sorts of allegations about the victim to the court to the effect that she was sexually promiscuous and consented to the act of incest.  It may also be in his interest to argue that she had been sexually active with other members of the same family.  The more dirt he can throw at the victim the better off he will be in the long run, even if he is convicted because it might impact on the sentence.  If he can establish consent he may get off lightly; if he can establish that the victim was sexually active he may get off altogether, since the victim's evidence may not be considered a sufficiently reliable basis for conviction.</P>
    <P>For this reason I urge the Minister to reconsider her position on this issue. <Col N="1073" /> Her principal objection to Senator Honan's proposal, that it would allow consent to operate as a defence, simply does not hold water.  The application of sections 3, 4 and 5 to the trial of incest offences would in no way affect the legal liability for incest but would do much to make the trial of those offences less of an ordeal for the victims.  I think everybody would agree that we must do everything we can to assist and support victims of incest and to encourage them to bring their abuser to justice.  We will be bringing forward amendments on Committee Stage designed to apply the same protections to incest victims as apply to rape victims.  I hope the Minister will be receptive to them.</P>
    <P>The case in the media this week is ample evidence of the need not only to deal, as required by the court decision, in a reactive way to sexual offences against children and women inside and outside the family but that most child abuse takes place within the family. Women and children are much more at risk behind their own front door than anywhere else.  I appeal to the Minister of State, in his role as Minister with responsibility for all aspects of child care, to inject some sort of urgency into the requirements to enact into law the remaining sections of the Child Care Act, 1991.</P>

      <P>I pay tribute to the Minister for Justice.  Deputy Owen, for bringing in this Bill so quickly after the judgments were given.  I am sorry Deputy O'Donoghue had some difficulty understanding the original Bill but I think it is quite clear.  I congratulate Senator Honan and Deputy O'Donoghue on the work they did on this issue.  It is good that amendments were accepted and I congratulate the Minister for doing so in the Seanad.  After all we are here to discuss, to seek the best <Col N="1074" /> solution in any given circumstances. Surely what we want to do is to get this Bill right so that at the end of the day victims of incest and child sexual abuse get the best possible protection from the law.</P>
      <P>The Minister is introducing a good Bill which covers incest, how it is dealt with in the courts, how it is reported and the supports we should give to its victims. I am sure the case where sentence was handed down yesterday is very much in the minds of the public and Members speaking today.  The judge said that his sleep was disturbed having listened to the details of the case.  I do not think anyone would be surprised about that.  It gives a mild indication of how the lives of the children, the victims in that situation, were disturbed.  If it is difficult for the judge to listen to the details in court how much more difficult was it to live with that kind of abuse in one's own home over many years?  It was extremely disturbing and damaging for the children involved.  That is why it is important to work out the best legislative framework in which to address these issues.</P>
      <P>A judge in the Central Criminal Court gave two judgments on how incest cases could be reported and dealt with in the courts.  The Minister introduced this Bill quickly to deal with the implications arising from those judgments which meant that professionals trying to work with and protect families could not intervene in a way which would be helpful to children as a result of the provisions in the 1908 Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill puts down strong markers on our attitude towards sexual crimes against children, particularly incest, the seriousness with which the crime is viewed, the way the victims of sexual abuse should be dealt with and protected within the criminal justice system. It outlines the opportunities for the media to bring these crimes to the attention of the public and its responsibilities <Col N="1075" /> in this area.  It defines the type of sentencing that should apply and the language we should use when describing the crime of incest.</P>
    <P>This has been a silent area in Irish life as indeed it has in other countries.  It is now coming to public attention and I hope this debate will encourage children and their families in this situation to do something and trust our system of justice. Victims of child sexual abuse and women who were raped did not find the courts a friendly place.  As a result many sexual crimes are unreported.  Victims may feel they will be further abused by bringing cases to court.  By that I mean they would be further exposed and traumatised. I welcome the attempts which have been made to deal with that in recent years.  Confidence in the courts is growing among women and child victims but there is a long way to go.</P>
    <P>Many comments were made about the way we treat children in society. There is a great deal of work to be done but we must not exaggerate.  The Government is committed to implementing the provisions of the Child Care Act by 1996.  The Minister of State is bringing together the work of the three Departments most intimately involved with children's rights.  We are putting the resources in place.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister for bringing in the Bill.  There was an excellent debate in the Seanad and it is clear there is a strong will among legislators to ensure that the victims of child sexual abuse are dealt with in the best possible way in the courts and an insistence that society opens its eyes to what has happened to children over a long period. Until relatively recently children in families and institutions suffered from child sexual abuse and there were no protective mechanisms either at legislative, social or emotional level to help them. We closed our eyes and ears and did not hear the voices of the children.  We did not have the understanding or sensitivity to do something about the position in which children found themselves. <Col N="1076" /> We may have heard about it but we refused to act.</P>
    <P>The stay safe programme is excellent and I urge the Minister for Education to find out why some schools do not implement it.  Schools should ensure that children have access to the programme. Even though we live in a more open age, very often children do not have the language or skills to describe what is happening to them when they are abused.  The stay safe programme provides them with that.</P>
    <P>Huge demands have been made on the health service as a result of child sexual abuse.  When examining the case histories of people who present themselves at adult psychiatric hospitals with eating disorders, depression and alcoholism it often comes to light that they were abused.  If we are to tackle the problem seriously we must do so at a legislative, community, educational and health level.</P>
    <P>We are not a child centred society. We talk about a family centred society but it has often been at the expense of children.  I am glad the Minister for Health announced that there will be an inquiry into the case reported in the North Western Health Board area.  I welcome the commitment given by the Minister of State, Deputy Currie, to place children on the agenda of the Intergovernmental Conference next year and ensure that they are mentioned in the Maastricht Treaty when it is reviewed.  The North-South dimension is important.</P>
    <P>As regards intervention, social workers have not had the legislative and constitutional back-up to intervene in families and we must address that issue.  The same debate is emerging on the divorce issue &mdash; the rights of families versus the rights of children.  If we support families we must look at how we support individual members of those families. We must look carefully at what is best for families and individual children.  It is not simple.  Parenting continues even in a case of divorce and we often forget that.  Child sexual abuse is part of the price we have paid for idealisation of <Col N="1077" /> the family.  It is important to examine that because it impacts on professionals working in the area and on families.</P>
    <P>The Bill deals with a number of important issues.  It allows for ongoing media reporting of these crimes and that is important.  The secrecy which surrounded child sexual abuse in the past was not helpful.  In the discussion paper which the Minister proposes to introduce we must examine the position of children in our culture and the best way in which cases of sexual abuse against women and children can be reported.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for professionals to intervene.  They can be told the results of court cases and that is important.  The Minister has made clear that, in a case of incest, consent is not a defence.  In that sense it is an absolute offence which is committed once intercourse takes place.  That is relevant.  With the increasing sexualising of young children in society we can see how it leads to inappropriate sexual contact and sexual exposure of young children.</P>
    <P>It is very important that this issue is clearly understood in the context of consent. There is no excuse or defence for not taking action in this area as sexual abusers may project on children a sexuality which is not part of their make-up. I think it was Judge McGuinness who said it was very important to have more family law cases reported in public so that the public is better informed and will know exactly what is going on in society.  The same applies in this case.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's statement that issues in regard to other sexual offences will be dealt with in the discussion paper, which she intends to produce very quickly.  I urge her to bring forward this paper as quickly as possible so that these issues can be dealt with.  I welcome the provision under which victims will be able to bring a friend or supporter into court with them.  This is particularly important as a young child who may not have the full support of other members of her family &mdash; there may be violent disagreement within the family about the decision to bring the <Col N="1078" /> case to the attention of the police and the court &mdash; can feel incredibly isolated.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision which will ensure that the identity of the victim is protected.  Young children can be further traumatised if their identity is made known and the protections in this area are very important.  The media has adopted a responsible attitude to this issue and I hope this continues.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Fitzgerald for sharing her time with me. Recent incest cases have revealed a large number of cesspits in our society. As Deputy O'Donnell said, only God knows the full extent of the problem. However, this is not only an Irish problem, it is a huge international problem.</P>
      <P>I do not understand this appalling crime and I will go to my grave without understanding how a parent can abuse his young child.  My remedy for dealing with people who commit sexual abuse is fairly well known and deeply appreciated by the man on the street, if not by my colleagues in Leinster House.  Deterrents of this nature are needed to ensure that the punishment fits the crime. Unfortunately, the bleeding hearts and do-gooders in our society have helped to dismantle the sentencing system.  This is why we now find ourselves in the appalling position of having too much law and no order.</P>
      <P>Having said that, I support the Bill. My initial reaction was that I should not support it, that beasts who commit crimes of this nature should be exposed. However, on reflection I agree that children, the unfortunate victims, should be protected.  Deputy O'Donnell laid the blame for these crimes at the door of men.  While this is true in 95 per cent of cases I know of a case involving a young grandmother who it is believed to be pregnant by her 15 year old grandson. While it is not confined to one gender, men are responsible for the overwhelming number of incest cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Obviously the Bill is intended to make courts more victim friendly and to remove the Victorian type adversarial court room conditions which can be <Col N="1079" /> very frightening for young children.  It will also ensure anonymity not only for children but for adults in the plethora of cases now coming to light.  It cannot be easy for an adult with a family to give evidence in court in a case involving sexual abuse.  These provisions should be welcomed by everyone, including Deputy O'Dea, who has more experience of court proceedings than I have.</P>
    <P>I do not regard members of the media as social crusaders; I regard them as people who exploit sad events in our society for profit and increased sales.  In recent years we have read the graphic and lurid descriptions given by the media of cases involving unfortunate young children.  They do this to titillate the public.  It is a sad reflection on our society that there are people in the market for titillation of that nature. Members of the media are not red branch knights fulfilling a social duty; rather they are trying to fill their coffers and to increase sales by giving lurid descriptions of perverted sexual acts.  I would welcome any curtailment in the descriptions given of these cases.  We live in a very small society where very little is sacred, whether it takes place in the office of the chairman of Bord Gáis or in the public sector.  People know who is involved in sexual abuse cases and what is happening.  While I have my doubt about the ability of victims to remain anonymous I welcome the attempts being made by the Minister to ensure anonymity for unfortunate and helpless young children who have been raped or defiled.</P>
    <P>I wish to express my abhorrence at the inadequate sentence handed down to the guilty person in the X case.  A sentence of four years was not sending out any message of deterrent to anybody else who is engaged or has any thoughts of engaging in crimes of defilement against their children or anyone else's children.  That gentleman should have got what is given in the southern States of America, chemical castration. That removes the problem for the person and leaves society safer.  I hope that <Col N="1080" /> method of treatment will some day be introduced here for those who need it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>The decision by Mr. Justice Carney on 1 February 1995 was to the effect that the Punishment of Incest Act, 1908, obliged him to hear a criminal trial for incest behind closed doors. This decision was a timely warning that failure to periodically review and update the law will often result in anomalies that fly in the face of common sense.  The decision was, in effect, that the 1908 Act obliged a judge to deal with incest trials in circumstances of secrecy which we usually associate with espionage trials in the United Kingdom. He arrived at his decision by a strict interpretation of the law which would, if correct &mdash; I have no reason to believe it was not correct &mdash; raise the most serious doubts about the constitutionality of the 1908 Act.  In view of the decision by the Supreme Court in the case of Re R. Ltd. 1989 the principle of openness was a touchstone in the administration of justice in Ireland.  The principle is often stated thus: not only must justice be done but it must also be seen to be done.  Legal support for criminal trials to be heard in camera cannot readily be found in the law reports here or elsewhere. From that point of view I welcome the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is only right and proper that incest trials should be publicised.  It is a heinous offence.  We would prefer if it was not happening or, at least, happening on the scale which is now evident.  In view of the fact that it is a reality of modern Irish society it is better that we know the extent of the problem so as to enable us to face up to it squarely as a society.  In any event, the decision would have given rise to grave anomalies in the law because the term &ldquo;incest&rdquo; in the 1908 Act is narrowly defined.  That meant that the decision would not apply to other types of child abuse which could still be tried openly.  Incest is defined in the 1908 Act as carnal knowledge by a male with a female &ldquo;whom he knows to be his grand-daughter, daughter, sister or mother&rdquo;.  Therefore, <Col N="1081" /> carnal knowledge of a female who does not fall within any of those categories or carnal knowledge between a male and another male under age would not be covered by the Carney decision.  Deputy O'Donoghue read into the record an amendment he proposes to table on Committee Stage.  I draw the attention of the Minister of State to that proposal and I urge him earnestly to prevail on the Minister to accept it.  I welcome the Bill but it is seriously lacking in a number of areas, this area being the principle one.</P>
    <P>The victims of rape and now of incest will be guaranteed anonymity in law. There is no such guarantee for the victims of unlawful carnal knowledge, that is consensual sex between a man and a girl under the age of 17 &mdash; there are two different categories, up to the age of 15 and between 15 and 17.  The name and the address of the victim in the X case could have been publicised in the media had the media chosen to act in such an irresponsible way.  That is wrong and it is a serious lacuna in the law.  If the victims of rape and incest are to have their anonymity guaranteed by law I cannot see any reason the victims of unlawful carnal knowledge &mdash; girls under the age of 17 &mdash; are not similarly protected.  Perhaps it was an oversight in the redrafting of the legislation.  I urge the Government to take this on board.</P>
    <P>As I indicated on a number of occasions I am not in favour of censorship but in relation to what Deputy McGahon said I ask the media to exercise a modicum of self restraint in its reporting of this type of case.  There is widespread revulsion in the community at the detailing in the media of the most salacious and perverted detail of some sex cases, particularly those involving children.  It is neither necessary nor desirable that such cases be reported in terms which dwell and, in many cases, concentrate on the most revolting details.  Only a minority of the media here deserve these strictures but to that minority I send this message: please restrain yourself.</P>
    <P>There has been a staggering increase <Col N="1082" /> in reported child abuse in recent years. Mr. Martin Hynes of the South Eastern Health Board, whose report was carried in all the newspapers, said that the number of reported cases in the South Eastern Health Board area had increased from 251 in 1992 to 624 last year. Society has been slow to respond to the reality of child sexual abuse partly because it was unaware of its existence and partly because it chose to ignore it. Also there was the factor that child victims were unwilling to speak out for a whole miscellany of reasons.  The Kilkenny incest case, and the subsequent publication of the excellent McGuinness report, helped to change this.  I agree with Deputy O'Donnell who said that progress on the McGuinness report into the Kilkenny incest case has not been as rapid as we would wish.  I say to the Minister of State, who is deeply involved in this area, and I wish him luck in his work, that it is noticeable to me and to a number of professionals in the field with whom I have spoken, that progress &mdash; I am not blaming the Minister of State exclusively &mdash; on the implementation of the report has slowed down somewhat recently.  That is a matter of great concern.</P>
    <P>The Garda and the health boards have different roles in combating child sexual abuse.  It is imperative that they co-operate fully and properly co-ordinate their work in this regard.  The Minister for Health recently announced new procedures under which the Garda and social workers will inform each other of suspected cases of child abuse and will agree on a strategy for the investigation. I welcome those guidelines which will be a help but they are only beginning. Difficulties will arise in their implementation if the present pressure of work on social workers is not eased.  All the evidence, unfortunately, points to the opposite being the case.</P>
    <P>At the recent conference of the public sector union, IMPACT, it was announced that the 200 social workers in Dublin are refusing to deal with any <Col N="1083" /> new referrals because they are so overworked. It has been suggested &mdash; I have no reason to doubt this &mdash; that this, in effect, means there will be 100 cases of children who may be the subject of abuse who will not have their cases examined.  Surely, in view of what we know, and in view of all that has happened, this is unacceptable.</P>
    <P>Much social work in this area has taken on a fire brigade aspect.  Any increase in notifications places great strains on limited resources.  Social work can be extremely difficult, unpleasant and dispiriting.  We have been told that over the next 12 months that section of the Child Care Act which enables courts to order that families be placed under the supervision of social workers will be implemented.  This will mean that the health boards could be faced with an explosion in the demands being made on their limited resources.</P>
    <P>Some of the worst child abuse tragedies arose because social workers were over stretched to do their job properly. Resources must be assigned &mdash; this is the responsibility of Government &mdash; to this area as a priority from areas where the need is less urgent.  More specialist social workers will have to be recruited and the whole area of social work will have to be reorganised radically, particularly in the Eastern Health Board region where it is in a considerable state of disarray.  Other health board areas where this problem is growing, including my own, have lessons to learn from the mistakes and the difficulties created by the non-assignment of proper resources to the Eastern Health Board area.</P>
    <P>It must also be of concern that only nine people have availed of the treatment programme for sex offenders in Arbour Hill costing £250,000.  When it is borne in mind that one in every ten prisoners is a sex offender, it is staggering to contemplate the extent of the problem and the potential cost of any realistic rehabilitative treatment.</P>
    <P>Any legislation in this area must focus to some extent on the plight of the victim. Criminal law, particularly in this <Col N="1084" /> area, seems to have no place for victims. They are used only as witnesses and have no say over how an event which has shattered their lives is to be dealt with by the Criminal Court.  Most child abuse cases only proceed where there is a guilty plea.  In theory, but only in theory, this saves the victim from having to give evidence, but he or she may still have to do so at deposition stage.  This is what happened in the X case.</P>
    <P>A charter for victims which has been consistently promised by the Minister for Justice will, if introduced, have to deal with how victims are interviewed, the right of victims to information about their case, the right to be briefed fully and in good time by prosecuting counsel, the right to express their views through victim impact reports rather than just relying on professionals, and the right to legal assistance.</P>
    <P>I have often been asked what legal right a victim has to sue where the impact of abuse does not become evident until later in life, particularly where the abuser is a person of means. It is a matter of regret for me to have to say my research has led me to the conclusion that I cannot tell a person who discovers later in life that he or she has been the victim of sexual abuse as a child, that he or she has a cause of action in tort.  It seems bizarre that somebody who is injured in a road accident or who walks into a pothole has a definite cause of action in tort, the right to bring a case to establish negligence before the courts.  The least that need be said about the defendant, if the plaintiff can establish it, is that he acted negligently or carelessly, but where somebody suffers more than the usual road accident victim would suffer, where somebody has been the victim of sustained and systematic child sexual abuse done deliberately, we cannot tell them that they have a definite cause of action.  Apparently the Government is waiting for somebody to risk bringing a case to court to establish whether there is such a cause of action.  The matter should be resolved by statute, and I ask the Minister of State to give victims of <Col N="1085" /> this type of heinous crime a definite cause of action.</P>
    <P>Even if they have a definite cause of action, there is another barrier.  The extent of the damage done to victims of child sexual abuse will not become evident until later in life, and usually the person will have no means of bringing a case.  Again it seems bizarre that under an amendment to the Statute of Limitations in 1991, somebody who is the victim of negligence can bring an action within three years from the date on which it first became apparent that there was negligence &mdash; the limitation period is extended &mdash; but even if the victim of child sexual abuse has a definite cause of action in tort, the Statute of Limitations will usually debar the person from bringing an action because in analogous cases proceedings have to be brought within six years.  This should also be sorted out by statute if we are serious about protecting victims.</P>
    <P>I have outlined a number of areas where victims of all types of crime will have to be assisted, particularly victims of the type of crime under discussion who are especially vulnerable.  That could be done easily by statute, and most of the reforms I have in mind are Exchequer neutral.  These are serious matters which I ask the Minister and the Government to take on board.  I ask the Minister of State also to prevail on his colleague, the Minister for Justice, to accept the amendment that Deputy O'Donoghue read into the record.  It makes no sense that the victim of rape and, when this legislation is passed, the victim of incest, will be guaranteed anonymity in law, but the victim of unlawful carnal knowledge, a crime committed against a girl under the age of 17, will have no such guarantee.  I commend the media on not taking advantage of this lacuna in the law to report the names and addresses of victims in the past.  However, there is no guarantee for the future.  The only guarantee we can have is to have it written into the legislation, and that can be <Col N="1086" /> done simply by accepting the amendment. This measure would also be Exchequer neutral.</P>
    <P>There are a number of other areas where the Bill can be improved.  This has been examined from the point of view of the victim, and we will table appropriate amendments on Committee Stage.  The Minister of State said earlier that the Minister for Justice will approach this matter with an open mind and be amenable to reasonable amendments. I take him at his word and I hope the Minister will act accordingly because, although we welcome the Bill, which is necessary and fills a gap in the law which was exposed by a High Court decision on 1 February and again on 17 February, we can take the opportunity on Committee Stage to bring about a number of other improvements in the law in this regard, particularly from the point of view of the victims.  I have every reason to believe the Minister of State meant what he said and we will hold him and the Minister for Justice to that on Committee Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this legislation. It is only the third piece of legislation specifically related to children introduced in my 14 years in this House, the other two major legislative measures being the Status of Children Bill and the Child Care Bill.  That statistic speaks for itself when compared with the annual appearance of financial and social welfare measures and other criminal measures.  It is not surprising, therefore, that many Deputies have used the opportunity of broadening the debate beyond the confines of this legislation which is fairly specific but touches an a range of other important issues relating to children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is an emergency measure to deal with a crisis that arose in our courts.  It homes in on the secrecy which surrounds this horrific crime against children.  In this case we have a welcome modification of the blanket ban on the reporting of incest cases and this is broadly supported throughout the House.  The provision was amended in <Col N="1087" /> the Seanad to allow other welcome reforms, such as the right to an accompanying person, an increased level of sentencing, a redefinition of the nature of the crime and the consequent right to immediate arrest which may be of immense value to people at risk.</P>
    <P>The importance of the reporting of these cases by the media has been commented on by all speakers to date.  It is clear there is such a need and it will be an important element in attracting attention to these issues and developing services and legislative responses.  In the case of children, the courts, as in so many of other areas, have been leading the way highlighting needs and nudging the politicians to change the law.  We need to pay maximum attention to these crimes.  It would have been intolerable if the secrecy which already often surrounds the relationship with a child within the family, was to be compounded by the restrictions on reporting in certain cases as a result of recent decisions.  It is therefore important that this reform is introduced.</P>
    <P>As Deputy McGahon and others said, we are only coming to terms with this problem and he is right that it is as great in other countries.  There was a view that somehow we were different, that these things did not happen in holy Catholic Ireland.  It is a major change for us to come to terms with just how cruel our families have been to children and how the image and the reality were often poles apart.  Perhaps this level of publicity is more needed here until we come to terms with this painful reality and make the necessary changes.  We have not done enough in providing resources to ensure that our services and laws are adequate.  While we will never eliminate the problem, we have to try to control it and help those who have been hurt and damaged.  We will also have to come to terms with the fact that many abusers were themselves abused. We need a broad range of measures, including this legislation.</P>
    <P>A number of my colleagues raised the question of whether we should know the <Col N="1088" /> details of these cases.  At this stage it is important that we should.  As Deputy McGahon said, many of us could not imagine that vulnerable and powerless children from under the age of one year have been subjected to extroardinary horrors, torture and humiliation.  We have a long way to go.  The public reporting of these cases is an important element in ensuring that the issues remain to the fore until they are properly dealt with and proper structures are put in place.</P>
    <P>The Minister and the Minister of State indicated that the issues of incest and sexual abuse will be dealt with in a more general review which will arise from a discussion paper which will be published shortly.  Psychologists working with abused children have raised with me the issue of the custody rights of fathers who may have abused their children and are still abusing them.  Perhaps because it has not moved into the area of being proved in court those are inadequate means to protect the children concerned.  It is ironic that the forces of the State will act against a woman who flouts a custody order which she believes to be taking a child out of her jurisdiction in an attempt to protect it. It is an area in which it is difficult to balance rights but it will come up in discussions with organisations such as CARE and others working in this area. I intend to contact such organisations to ensure they make a full submission.</P>
    <P>I listened with interest to Deputy O'Donoghue's contribution.  It is a pity he wasted much of his time congratulating himself and his colleagues.  As this issue is debated infrequently it would have been better if he had suggested various reforms.  The debate in the Seanad proved useful in that the Minister conceded some important amendments. All those involved deserve to be congratulated.  Despite this much remains to be done.</P>
    <P>Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, raised a number of issues of concern to me while Deputy O'Donnell raised the question of refuges and their inadequacy.  Inadequate provision has been made for care <Col N="1089" /> services and that issue is vitally important.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGahon returned to his favourite response of chemical castration. Given the gory details of some cases, including some cases in the west, where children, boys and girls, as young as two years of age have been abused this would not solve the problem; the matter is not as simple as that.  As well as introducing strong laws to prevent crime we need to break the cycle of abuse.  That is the reason the organisations working in this area must be adequately funded.  If they are not in a position to introduce adequate intervention programmes to cater for nine to 11 year olds there is no doubt that 45 per cent will treat others in the way they have been treated because they know no better.</P>
    <P>Children in our society live in a twilight zone.  We provide them with secrecy in some cases to protect them but at times that secrecy becomes a trap. Behind the closed doors of the family home they often experience the horrors that Deputy McGahon cannot imagine. Incest is one of the crimes against children occurring frequently in too many Irish homes but it is not the only crime committed.  In the past year at least three Irish children have died as a result of injuries inflicted by parents while horrific cases involving physical and sexual abuse have been heard before the courts in the past few months.</P>
    <P>Last autumn the Law Reform Commission in its report <i>Non Fatal Offences Against the Person</i> made a number of recommendations in relation to children among a wide range of proposed reforms covering areas as diverse but not unrelated as torture, harassment and other issues arising from the Convention on Human Rights.  Until we award children the same constitutional rights as adults to bodily integrity, as political leaders we are sending confused messages to children and those who cater for them that children are lesser beings with lesser rights.</P>
    <P>It is intersting to note that studies on abusing persons show that parents in <Col N="1090" /> particular see childen as their property with no rights of their own.  There is much in the Constitution which encourages this idea.</P>
    <P>The Law Reform Commission commenced its consideration of the issue with a comment on the right to bodily integrity for all our citizens.  It means that no mutilation of the body or any of its members may be carried out on any citizen under the authority of the law except for the good of the whole body and that no process which may be dangerous can be imposed by an Act of the Oireachtas.  However, in the case of children this general right is restricted. The commission stated that nothing in this part shall be construed to take away or affect the right of any parent, teacher or other person having the lawful control or charge of the child or young person to administer punishment to such child or young person.  Children are the only group in society to whom we say that it is okay to inflict physical punishment on them.  This is a flaw in the law and the Constitution.</P>
    <P>The Law Reform Commission studied other jurisdictions.  Many countries but not all have moved or are moving to eliminate the concept that parents have the right to physically punish their children.  The Law Reform Commission went on to recommend that we should have a specific offence of endangering children in one's care, as applies in other countries.  We should adopt that recommendation and implement it rapidly. It may be of interest to Members to know that, in theory, whipping is still allowed under our laws and that the punishment of apprentices and sailors is still considered appropriate.</P>

      <P>With no disrespect to the Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare, Deputy Durkan, I am disappointed that the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry is not present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's handling of this issue demonstrates that he is confronted by a problem with which he is unable to deal satisfactorily, that, clearly, the Government is dominated by urban-based parties, in particular by Labour and Democratic Left.  It appears to be open to those two parties to find the requisite <Col N="1092" /> funds for given projects under their ministerial control, and direct them in a manner favouring urban funding to the detriment of agricultural funding overall. It appears that within the Cabinet, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry has failed to secure agreement that agriculture be placed at the top of the Government's agenda.  Clearly it is not in terms of its overall objectives or within the overall finances being provided within the terms of general Government fiscal policy.</P>
    <P>It was also clear from an independent review of the previous operational programme that control of farm pollution and the development of environmental issues within the context of farming were seen as absolute priorities.  The final sentence of that review said: &ldquo;It indicated, however, that substantial investment was still needed in this area and that more targeting was necessary to attract small farmers into this scheme.&rdquo;  I believe that to be a fact, the operational programme also provided for an expected 30,000 farmers' participation in that scheme.</P>
    <P>Yesterday evening and in previous references to this, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry asked the Opposition what he could do, accompanied by a wringing of hands, maintaining that he does not have any options.  He has options, two of which I will outline.  One is that the bulge in terms of funding over the duration of the operational programme between now and 1999 will occur in the years 1996 and 1997; the greatest anticipated expenditure is encapsulated into those two years.  Therefore, the Minister will have to bring forward some of that funding over the following 18 months to ensure that this programme is completed within a reasonable timescale to deal with the applications already submitted to his Department.  It is within his Departmental Vote to provide the money in consultation with the Minister for Finance to adopt that approach.</P>
    <P>Given that the rural environment protection scheme is crucial to the control of farm pollution &mdash; 40 per cent of those <Col N="1093" /> farmers wanting to draw down funds under the REPS scheme are unable to do so unless they have already implemented the provisions of the control of farm pollution scheme &mdash; if the take-up of the REPS scheme appears to be low, I suggest that the Minister divert some of the funds available to the REPS scheme to the control of farm pollution scheme.  He must strike a balance between the two, because one is conditional on the other, and he requested suggestions in that regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1965" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I was shocked and amazed to learn that the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry has suspended the control of farm pollution scheme on 27 April last and decided that no further applications for the control of farm pollution would be accepted by his Department until further notice. I was also surprised that formal approval of existing applications ceased on that date.</P>
      <P>The farmers of my constituency of South Kerry are bitterly disappointed with this decision of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry.  In County Kerry alone 658 farmers applied to participate in that scheme up to 27 April with only 211 certificates of approval having been issued.  Last evening the Minister blamed the Operational Programme for Agriculture, Rural Development and Forestry, approved by the Commission in December 1994, in respect of which an allocation of £195 million was made available in Structural Funds for the period between 1994 and 1999, stating that 50 per cent only had been earmarked for the control of farm pollution scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am convinced &mdash; I have said on a number of occasions since 27 April &mdash; that the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry has a duty to farmers, particularly to the small to mediumsized farmers, to put a proposal to fund this scheme at the Cabinet table.  We know it is all about money.  The Minister must always act and be seen to act for the betterment of our farmers and find <Col N="1094" /> the requisite funding by some means or other.  His predecessors found the necessary funds to resolve major problems within the Department and I call on the present Minister to do likewise.  I know that 18,600 applications were received for participation in this scheme up to 27 April, of which 6,000 only had been approved, leaving 12,600 applicants without approval.</P>
    <P>In addition, the business community is bitterly disappointed with the Minister's failure to resolve the matter.  All Members will be aware that construction activities on farms always provides employment and creates jobs for the suppliers of materials and equipment for that purpose.  Thousands of jobs are being lost as a result of the Minister's inaction to put a proposal to the Cabinet and his colleague, the Minister for Finance, to provide the requisite funding to enable this scheme to be continued. The control of farm pollution and its attendant job creation should not be suspended until such time as additional funding is made available under the review of the Community Support Framework, which would not be undertaken by the Commission until the latter half of next year.  The necessary finance should be obtained by Government at the earliest possible opportunity and the suspension of the scheme rescinded.</P>
    <P>Thousands of farmers have made arrangements with lending agencies, with the ACC, their own banks and other financial institutions to back the State grant in its bid to assist in the control of farm pollution.  Farmers, and the financial institutions, do not know where they stand.  The financial institutions are most concerned, being unable to postpone granting a loan to individual farmers indefinitely, which places additional pressure on those institutions.</P>
    <P>There is no point in saying to farmers that all applications received will be approved and that conditional certificates of approval will be issued.  That is no use to farmers or their lending agencies, including banks, who support <Col N="1095" /> them.  There is no point either in the Minister saying that the grants will be paid in 1996, 1997, 1998 or 1999.</P>
    <P>It is obvious to many farmers, and I am convinced, that the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry and Government have very little interest in helping the farming community in their anti-pollution drive recommended by the Minister for the Environment and local authorities.  I am now more convinced than ever that agriculture has a very low priority on the agenda of this rainbow Coalition Government.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to support this timely Fianna Fáil motion, which is of vital importance to our agricultural industry as it focuses on an issue of enormous concern throughout rural areas.</P>
      <P>The development of agriculture and control of farm pollution at source have received a major setback resulting from the decision of the Minister and his Government.  The seriousness of the matter in County Kerry was clearly demonstrated in the figures the Minister gave the House last evening.  For example, in County Kerry there were 658 applications for participation in the control of farm pollution scheme, only 211 of which were approved with 64 applications under the REPS scheme, of which 50 only were approved.</P>
      <P>It is most disappointing and totally unacceptable that only 8.2 per cent of applications received under the control of farmyard pollution scheme since 1 September have been approved.  To compound this position the Minister suspended the scheme, stating that formal approval of existing applications will cease for the time being.  I would point out to the Minister the gravity of the problem for the farming community in County Kerry arising from the Minister's untimely decision to suspend the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The vast majority of farmers want to control and eliminate, where possible, farm waste that contributes to pollution. That is sensible from the point of view <Col N="1096" /> of farmers as well as environmentally and financially.  The scheme is not a handout for farmers; it provides essential assistance towards large-scale expenditure.  The majority of farmers cannot develop the essential pollution control facilities without financial support and a large number of farmers may be forced out of farming as a result of pollution problems.</P>
    <P>The farming community in Kerry wants to tackle pollution problems.  This is necessary to develop our tourism potential.  It is essential that farmers who want to invest heavily in on-farm facilities be given financial assistance under this scheme.  Apart from the need to develop on-farm facilities, such work generates substantial employment and practically all the input is sourced locally.</P>

      <P>I support the motion on farmyard pollution.  Farming is still the backbone of our economy.  We have a quality agricultural product, produced in the main by natural means, and a green image.  Therefore, our farmers can expect premium prices for their product. It is important that we retain our good image of an environmentally friendly agricultural nation.  Farmers are willing to play their part in this regard, but doubts arise about the commitment of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry.  More than 18,000 applications were made under this scheme, 6,000 of which were approved, 3,000 of them in the priority category and a few under section 12 notices.  What has happened the remaining 9,000 or more applications?  They have been left in limbo.  Even some of the priority applications may have to wait until 1997 for payment.  The problem of pollution impinges upon the Departments of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, the Environment, Tourism and Trade and Enterprise and Employment.  We put down this motion to illustrate the importance of this scheme not alone to the farming community but to other sectors.</P>

      <Col N="1097" /> The Minister says that to date he has received £100 million under this programme and he estimates that the scheme will require £140 million to £160 million.

I suggest that all the money has gone to the left, to Democratic Left, and we know what they think of agriculture &mdash; not a lot.</P>

      <P>I fully support the prevention of pollution at source rather than allowing it to occur and then having the expense of cleaning up and possibly facing litigation.  We must bear in mind that 60 per cent to 80 per cent of wells and bore holes are polluted each year.  That is a great indictment of us.  Let us take fish kills as an indication of the extent of pollution.  In 1987, the first year <Col N="1098" /> statistics were compiled, there were 122 fish kills whereas in 1994 that figure was reduced to 31.  That is a great improvement, but we still have some distance to go.  In 1987 the agricultural sector was responsible for 85 of the 122 fish kills while last year it was responsible for only ten fish kills.  That is indicative of the approach of farmers to pollution.  In the last seven years they have put tremendous effort, hard work and money into eliminating pollution.</P>
      <P>Since September 1994, 18,500 people have applied for this scheme.  One may wonder why there was such a huge uptake of this scheme when its predecessor was not as successful.  There are a few reasons for this.  First, the grants available under the previous scheme were smaller and, second, the conditions for entry to this scheme were relaxed, making it possible for non-farmers with land to apply.  Those people are entitled to assistance in controlling pollution, but one would question the advisability of that considering it is at the expense of the full-time farmer who has no other source of income.</P>
      <P>Part of the problem with the shortage of money stems from the famous meeting in Edinburgh when we were told we would get £8.7 billion.  That figure was later reduced to £7.8 billion, then to £7 billion and eventually it was reduced to about £6.3 billion.  That was part of the reason for the suspension of the CFP scheme.</P>

That created a dam which has now burst and unfortunately farmers are the losers.  People who participated in the REPS do not have a facility to stem pollution.  There is a great danger that funding for the REPs scheme is liable to be taken back by the EU unless the Government ensures it is used in conjunction with farm pollution control.  The Minister must answer a number of questions tonight.  Will he pay interest on the delayed payments after conditional approval has been given?  Will he confirm that two years must elapse before the farm pollution scheme and farm improvement programme are resurrected?  Is he prepared to increase the organic farming fund of £1 million over five years which is nothing short of derisory?</P>

Why have only approximately 6,500 been given certificates of approval to build those slatted houses and thereby draw down a 60 per cent grant?  Why have the other 12,000 applicants not received certificates of approval?  The simple answer is that there is no money in the scheme and that is tragic.</P>

      <P>When the ground work was done on the planning of the <Col N="1101" /> Structural Funds for the period 1994-99 somebody made an alarming mistake. We know that decision was not arrived at in a day, a week or a year.  The former Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Walsh, must have known that the likely draw down on a control of pollution scheme for 60 per cent grants would be great by any standards. The REPS scheme was in place when the previous Government introduced a control of pollution scheme shortly before it left office.  Details of the REPS scheme were known at that time and should have been considered in conjunction with this scheme.  Nobody need tell me that the REPS scheme was thought up afterwards.  The two schemes operate in tandem and the previous Government knew that.</P>
      <P>That is the background to the scheme and no amount of bickering or whinging from the Opposition will change the reasons grant aid had to be suspended. A Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry who allows worthless certificates of approval to be issued to farmers and then cons and bankrupts them when they claim back their money, should not be in this House.  That is why the present Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry had to intervene.  We inherited the problem, we did not create it and I put forward a number of proposals to resolve it.  It is in the national interest that the 12,000 or 13,000 farmers concerned who are in limbo be helped.  There is no point in the Opposition saying that £30 million to £60 million can be found in one fell swoop next week and that everybody can proceed with their works.  Deputy Hugh Byrne knows that sort of talk is nonsense. There must be another approach.</P>

      <P>We will have to consider the capital allowances for new buildings and I believe many farmers could fund such works through taxation. There has been a major upward swing in the graph in the cost of buildings.  Some people are raking in the money as a result of the increase in the price of sheds, concrete and other materials.  I hope this debate will introduce some reality.  Farmers are paying £2,000 to £3,000 more for a slatted house than last year.  Why has that been allowed to happen? This point may not go down well with the technical people, but the type of ironwork that must go into the foundations of some of the small slatted houses reminds me of the bunkers used by the Germans during the war.  We want good durable farm buildings, but I wonder if we have gone overboard regarding specifications.</P>
      <P>There are many other points I wish to make, but I do not want to impinge on my colleagues time.  Having regard to the other subheads and the 1996 review, we will have to ensure more money from Brussels for that scheme.  I am sure all farmers will be looked after at the end of the day.</P>

      <P>If one did not know the facts behind this motion, from listening to the contributions of the Opposition speakers one would think that in this instance the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Yates, had a choice and made his decision without a reason to do so.  That is not the case.  One would also believe that the Minister caused the suspension of the scheme.  They and I know that is not the case.  Listening to those contributions, one would be led to believe that the Minister did not have the interest of Irish agriculture at heart, but nothing could be further from the truth. The Opposition should accept that the <Col N="1103" /> Minister has shown tremendous character and courage in facing the harsh reality of having to tell farmers that there is not sufficient funding for the scheme to approve the thousands of applications submitted to farm development offices.</P>
      <P>The Minister was not the cause of the problem.  It resulted from a shortage of funding because of inadequate negotiations carried out by the former Government.  The Minister inherited that problem and has confronted it.  Seldom have we had a Minister who has shown such interest in agriculture, who looks upon farmers as human beings, who launched a charter of rights for farmers, ensures that farmers get their premiums on time and seeks to provide dignified facilities to farmers when they need help or information.  I believe this is a short term setback for this scheme because I trust the capability and determination of the Minister to secure additional funding through renegotiation. I have no doubt that the Opposition parties will have to bite back their words when the Minister returns home following further negotiations having secured additional funding for this scheme.</P>
      <P>We are all dissatisfied, none of us takes joy in the difficult decision the Minister was forced to take, but I do not consider it a final decision.  He had to make a courageous decision and he took the correct course of action.  He did not cod the farmers or mislead them into believing that because their application forms had been submitted they would be approved.  He told them the truth and this is a welcome change in the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry.  I am confident this will only be a short term setback.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this important debate and I do so as one who recognises the central role of agriculture in <Col N="1104" /> our economy.  Like my colleague, Deputy Foxe, who is also a former agricultural consultant, in the mid-1980s I advised farmers in the midlands that it was paramount, for the sake of their holdings and the many lakes and inland waterways in the area, that they should pursue plans that would assist in the control and elimination of farm pollution. It was a great source of satisfaction to me that many farmers embarked on such plans and, with the assistance of Teagasc, the local authority and the fishery board, significant progress was achieved.  I applaud the efforts of farmers who responded positively to the measures proposed in that regard.</P>
      <P>Apart from the environmental and aesthetic features which such pollution control measures played during that period and which were pivotal to overall farm management activity, as a person who worked in this area, I have no doubt that the availability of capital allowances in the form of a significant element of depreciation played a central role in allowing many farmers fund necessary pollution control facilities. Money which would otherwise have been used on tax payments and so on was reinvested to fund such works.  The 50 per cent relief that was available until April 1993 for investment in grant approved pollution control facilities has been whittled down to approximately 15 per cent.  As sufficient funds are not available to meet the number of applications under the control of farmyard pollution scheme, that matter could be examined with a view to obtaining additional funding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcomed the introduction of this scheme last September as it focused particularly on the needs of small farmers and was in line with the recommendations of the independent evaluation of the previous scheme.  The current scheme aims to control farm pollution by providing grant-aid for various activities such as farm holdings, farmyards and storage facilties for fodder and agricultural wastes, including silage effluent, slurry, waste water, roof run-off and <Col N="1105" /> dairy washing and disposal equipment. Subject to an overall investment ceiling of £22,500 grants of up to 60 per cent were available to farmers with small and medium-sized holdings, in other words, to farmers producing up to 32,000 gallons of milk per annum or with less than 80 livestock units.  The former Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry should have realised the attractiveness of the scheme to farmers, it was a victim of its own success.  He made a major error is not recognising that.  Enterprises of 80 livestock units or less were also grant-aided in respect of farm roadways, water supplies to fields, shelters, screening beds for farmers participating in the farm improvement programme for the control of farmyard pollution and the REPS.</P>
    <P>I am not surprised at the unprecedented demand from farmers for grant-aid under the control of farmyard pollution scheme.  Structural funding for the 1994-99 period was insufficient.  As a qualified agricultural economist I believe the total amount required under the farm investment section would be approximately £270 million.  I was a back bench member of the previous Government, but I accept it was at best naive and at worst inept in its calculations of the likely funding required to finance investment under the programme. The former Minister should have heeded warning signals when the national plan allowed for an allocation of £245 million, but only £195 million was provided.  He should have realised a shortfall of approximaely £60 million would cause major problems.  This was apparent in 1994 and does not come as a surprise now.  One does not need to be a graduate in economics or accountancy to realise that the funding was insufficient.</P>
    <P>There is no benefit to be gained from apportioning blame, but if blame is to be apportioned it should rest with the previous Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry who should have realised this scheme would be attractive to farmers and anticipated the likely uptake. He failed miserably to secure adequate <Col N="1106" /> funding and it fell short by approximately £60 million.</P>
    <P>When the scheme was suspended on 27 April 1995 a total of 18,600 applications had been received.  I have no doubt that such a level of demand was generated by the fact that many of the participants in the REPS require pollution control works to be carried out under this scheme and were under pressure in this regard from local authorities, fishery boards and so on.</P>

      <P>The previous CFP scheme was suspended in April 1992.  A total of 9,000 farmers can proceed with pollution control works, 6,000 have been granted full approval and 3,000 conditional approval.  I understand further conditional approval will be given to farmers on a monthly basis in order of receipt prior to 31 December 1994.  As only 50 per cent of applications received to date will be facilitated under the scheme, we should bring forward funding under the Structural Funds to ensure the necessary finance is available. It is obvious that a case for addiitonal funding under the review of the Community Support Framework to be carried out by the Commission next year should secure the support of the Commission.  The system which applied to the previous scheme, whereby the total allocation was made available for utilisation by the Department, was more desirable than the annual allocations in vogue under the current scheme.  The Minister should endeavour to obtain that concession also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Approximately 180 applications have been received from farmers in County Westmeath under the REPS, a large number of whom must have pollution control works carried out within 12 months.  An application under REPS which would involve pollution control works could not proceed.  The suspension of the control of farmyard pollution schemes will impact on farmers applying <Col N="1107" /> for the REPS.  The position is that farmers get their first year's payment due on the REPS at an early stage but they do not get their second payment until all pollution control works have been carried out within the 12 months' guideline. I urge the Minister to pursue with the Commission the issue of the relaxation of the 12 months' time stipulation in regard to carrying out works.</P>
    <P>I hope that the promised review of the scheme in September will result in positive news for farmers who have to carry out necessary environmental and modernisation works.  I am also conscious of the substantial level of investment in farms which has a positive knock-on effect for employment, particularly in rural areas.  In County Westmeath, approximately 500 applications have been received up to the date of the suspension of the scheme, with approximately 48 obtaining full approval.</P>
    <P>I wish to return to the point I made in relation to the restoration of capital allowances of 50 per cent of the cost for grant approved pollution control facilities. This would help to soften the blow of the suspension of the current scheme and facilitate the continuity of investment by releasing funds to farmers to help finance necessary on-farm investment measures which are vital for a modern, environmentally friendly, agricultural industry.</P>

Our Fianna Fáil colleagues in the House know all about EU funding and its vagaries given that they mislaid over £2 billion of it on their way from Edinburgh via Brussels, to Dublin.</P>

      <P>The other more important issue is the way the EU funds are allocated at national and European level.  I want to say to the restless Fianna Fáil Deputies on my left that I endorse the principle behind the control of farmyard pollution scheme.  There is no doubt that its recent suspension caused severe problems for farmers wishing to avail of the REPS.  In this regard, I welcome the Minister's announcement on 17 May that applications from farmers who had already received the first year's REPS payment will be processed.  The two schemes are clearly linked and to fund one without funding the other would simply amount to throwing good money after bad.</P>
      <P>The motion put down by the Fianna Fáil Deputies deplores the mismanagement of the on-farm investment schemes.  Undoubtedly, there has been mismanagement but, as is the case with other European funding it orginated with the previous Administration.  A total of £195 million of Structural Funds was allocated to the on-farm investment section of the Operational Programme for Agriculture, Rural Development and Forestry for the period 1994-99. Approximately half that amount was earmarked for the CFPS.  However, under the national plan, the total amount allocated to on-farm investment schemes would have been approximately £245 million but that was before the plan was subjected to radical surgery in the wake of the shrinking billions, which Fianna Fáil lost from the swag bag to which I referred earlier.</P>

      <P>This year it is estimated that over £700 million of European taxpayers money will flow into the pockets of Irish farmers and that figure is set to rise next year.  Farmers claimed an average of £3,292 in respect of the silly setaside scheme last year.  Some of Fianna Fáil's friends, the ranchers, received lottery style payouts amounting to in excess of £70,000 for allowing land to remain unused.</P>

      <P>We are all familiar with the similar payouts received in respect of headage payments.  These schemes militate in favour of the large farmer. Set-aside and headage payments work on a simple principle &mdash; the more you have the more you get.  PAYE workers watched in bemusement while farmers got more grants and paid fewer taxes than the rest of the population.  In 1989, the average farmer's tax bill was 27.7 <Col N="1110" /> per cent of that of a PAYE worker.  In 1993, it was just 21.6 per cent and the proportion is declining.  Between 1989 and 1993 the average tax bill of a PAYE worker increased by £63 per week.  The average tax bill of a farmer&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Like other schemes, farm subsidies are paid for by the taxpayer and some taxpayers, such as the PAYE sector, pay a great deal more than others.</P>
      <P>The EU budget is finite.  Unless Europe's politicians bite the bullet and undertake a fundamental reform of the CAP, curbing some of its more absurd aspects, there will be a decreasing amount of money to pay for the necessary schemes such as the REPS and the CFPS, in addition to other vital spending.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is interesting to note that a discussion document was prepared for the European Commission last year which identified many of the problems inherent in the Common Agricultural Policy.  It recommended a review of the policy which would effectively return control of a large part of agricultural policy making to national governments. The report was extremely controversial, as Members are aware, and did not agree with all its recommendations, but its authors had the courage to identify the problem and suggest solutions.  At a time when record levels of unemployment and exclusion are being experienced throughout Europe, there is a clear need to divert increased funding to depressed urban and industrial centres to reverse industrial decline and create employment.  I particularly welcome the URBAN programme, which was promoted by Democratic Left's MEP, Des <Col N="1111" /> Geraghty, in the European Parliament&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The pressures on the EU budget are constantly increasing and are likely to increase further as the enlargement process continues.  Unless we control the amount being eaten by the CAP and ensure that agricultural funding is targeted at the areas of greatest need, we will be unable to focus resources on the need to reverse urban and industrial decline.  The control of farmyard pollution scheme and associated environmental programmes are vital if we are to protect our greatest resource &mdash; a clean environment and a green brand image for our agricultural produce. They form an essential part of the work provided for under the Structural Funds and should not be confused with the Common Agricultural Policy and its madhatter excesses.</P>
      <P>Europe's governments must take a hard look at the totality of the CAP and they will be forced to make some difficult decisions during the coming decade.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to add my voice to that of various Members who have expressed great anger and apprehension about the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry's decision to suspend the control of farmyard pollution grant scheme.  The decision to suspend this scheme comes in the wake of the decision to discontinue grant aid under <Col N="1112" /> the farm improvement programme.  The control of farmyard pollution grant scheme and the farm improvement programme were a tremendous source of support to the farming sector in implementing investment programmes on individual farms.  Given the cost of putting slurry handling facilities in place, the grant aid available under the scheme was absolutely essential to help fund that investment on the farm.  I do not disagree with the Department's technical specifications required to avail of grant aid but this has added very considerably to the cost of constructing the slurry tanks and farm buildings.  I do not know whether it would be possible to modify the specifications in the wake of the decision that has been taken and I am sure this would have to be raised with the respective planning authorities.</P>
      <P>The unit cost of constructing slurry handling facilities on small and medium sized farms is much higher than on larger holdings, with economies of scale being relevant.  The cubic metre cost of larger tanks decreases with the size of the structure involved, consequently the Minister's decision has much more serious implications for small and medium sized farmers.  Taken in conjunction with the lower repayment capacity on small and medium sized farms, it effectively compounds the plight of our smaller producers.  The Minister should take due cognisance of that in attempts to establish priorities under the scheme.  The various FDS offices have submitted applications to the Department but the Minister in replying to a recent supplementary question effectively ruled out the possibility of considering applications from those who have not met the deadline.</P>
      <P>Another issue I wish to raise with the Minister of State, who is representing the Minister, is the implications for the implementation of the dairy hygiene regulations if individual farmers are not in a position to meet deadlines because of the non-availabilty of grant aid and the huge capital costs involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It bears repeating in the context of this debate that there are two areas in <Col N="1113" /> the agricultural industry where capital investment is urgently needed, slurry storage and handling facilities and handling and storage facilities for the potato industry.  I know from my experience there is tremendous interest in that scheme but I am not sure that the grants provision under the OPRD is sufficient to meet it.  It would be a great pity if the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry effectively allowed investment decisions to stagnate in those two areas because of problems with the availability of grant aid.  There is an urgent ongoing need for investment in those two areas.  It may be necessary in the short term to prioritise but it is important to take account of the areas that need most urgent attention and ensure that the categories that have not the capacity to raise the finance are able to do so as soon as possible.  I repeat the point I made in regard to the deadline for the implementation of the dairy hygiene regulations and ask the Minister to deal with it.  Will there be changes in the dairy hygiene regulations to cater for individual farmers who may not be able to meet the deadline?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I am concerned at the impact on the environment in County Clare of the suspension of the control of farmyard pollution scheme.  An examination of the number of approvals compared with the number of applications received in the county is very revealing and clearly requires an explanation and remedial action.  For example, there is a 20 per cent approval rate in County Clare as against the national average of 33 per cent.  In some counties there is an approval rate of 50 per cent but in Clare <Col N="1114" /> only 245 of 1,190 applications have been approved.  The Minister must address the imbalance in the rate of approval. Why should farmers in County Clare suffer because the level of staffing is lower than that in other countries or because of other constraints on staff? The Minister must ensure an even level of approvals so that no area becomes a black spot.  I believe that can be done if the Minister has the will to address it.</P>
    <P>The position in County Clare on 12 May under the rural environment protection scheme was not as bad, with 94 out of 177 applications approved, 55 per cent compared to the national average of 68 per cent.  Because of the interdependency between the control of farmyard pollution scheme and the rural environmental protection scheme it is vital that a system be devised to complete and streamline approvals in the areas where they overlap.</P>
    <P>The figures for the dairy hygiene scheme mentioned by Deputy Kirk are far more worrying as only 12 out of 264 applicants in County Clare have been approved, less than 5 per cent compared with the national average of 26 per cent, more than five times the rate of approval in County Clare.  This scheme has not been suspended.  The works required under it are not in any real sense optional and many more farmers will find that they will be required to avail of the scheme.  The applicants under the schemes must not be starved of funds as their counterparts for grant aid under the CFP scheme have been. In setting out a strategy for payment to farmers who have applied under the control of farmyard pollution scheme but have not yet been approved for grant aid, the Minister shows no understanding of the financial reality for most farmers, particularly in the western counties, who cannot possibly carry the extra burden of borrowings if payments under the scheme are to be deferred as he outlined on Question Time last week.  My understanding is that the average maximum grant would be of the order of £13,500 but the cost of housing and allied development would run to <Col N="1115" /> between £30,000 and £40,000 and sometimes more.  There is no possibility of small farmers being able to fund the balance while carrying the level of grant aid in borrowings for as long as three or four years.</P>
    <P>Many farmers depended on qualifying under REPS for extra finance to pay the balance of costs incurred on works carried out under the CFP scheme. Even if approved, they stand to lose both because they are unlikely to be in a position to bear the extra cost.  I ask the Minister to introduce a scheme under which the State would finance the cost of the grants in the short term and subsequently recoup it from European funds.  That would enable farmers to undertake the works required, the environment would benefit and no one would lose out unduly.</P>
    <P>Many farmers did not apply for the scheme and are now worried in case local authorities or the Environmental Protection Agency hold them responsible for polluting water or other resources.  Some method must be devised to grant aid these farmers.</P>

Ceann de na rudaí is measa atá ag baint le scéimeanna talmhaíochta ná go gcuirtear tús leo agus ansin sul a mbíonn deireadh leis an scéim cuirtear deireadh le glacadh le hiarratais.  Is é an toradh a bheidh leis sin ná an cineál rud a tharla san Aontas Sóibhéideach maidir le cúrsaí bídh.  Sé sin go raibh dóthain bídh le fáil ach nuair a chuala daoine go raibh bia ar an margadh chuaigh gach duine ag an ollmhargadh ar fhaitíos go mbeadh sé imithe nuair a thocfaidís ann. Tharla an rud céanna anois maidir le scéimeanna talmhaíochta.  De bharr an rud a tharla sa chás seo nuair a fhógrófar scéim talmhaíochta níos mó tuigfidh daoine go gcaithfidh siad dul agus tarraingt an scéim sin ar an bpointe nó go mbeidh an contúirt ann nach mbeidh tada fágtha nuair a thiocfaidh siad san leis an obair a dhéanamh.  Ní hé sin <Col N="1116" /> bealach ar bith scéim a rith.  Ba cheart don Aire dul i gcomhairle leis an Aire Leasa Shóisialaigh.  Bhí mé ag rá leis níos túisce inniu go mba cheart dó labhairt leis an Aire Proinsias De Rossa maidir le cúrsaí scrúdú maoine ar fheirmeoirí. Ba chóir dó labhairt leis an Aire céanna freisin chun chomhairle a fháil uaidh chun teacht ar airgead nuair a bhíonn sé ag teastáil agus nuair a bhíonn gá leis.  Bhí an tAire Leasa Shóisialaigh, agus Dia go deo leis, in ann teacht ar na milliúin punt nuair a bhí gá leis le híocaíocht a dhéanamh. Molaim don Aire Talmhaíochta dul anonn agus labhairt leis an Aire Shóisialaigh, comhairle a ghlacadh uaidh agus teacht aníos leis an airgead le íocaíochtaí a chur ar fáil do na feirmeoirí seo.</P>
      <P>Mar a bhíomar ag rá níos tuisce inniu, i gCoiste Dála, tá casadh aisteach sa scéal seo sa chaoi is go mbaineann sé le feirmeoirí slébhe.  Ní raibh na feirmeoirí sléibhe in ann cur isteach ar REPS schemes go dtíle gairid mar go raibh éiginnteacht ag baint leo go mór-mhór maidir le scrúdu maoine i dtaobh airgead on REPS.  Ar an ábhar sin ní raibh na pleananna tarraingte aníos acu.  Ní raibh na pleananna tarraingte aníos acu faoin farmyard pollution ach oiread.  Ar an ábhar sin anois ní bheidh siad in ann páirt a ghlacadh sa REPS scheme mar ní bheidh de acmhainn acu anois tabhairt faoi cosaint a dhénamh ar thruailliú feirme.  Mar sin, uair amháin eile tá dochar as cuimse déanta don dream is lú de na feirmeoirí, is iad sin na feirmeoirí atá ag maireachtáil ar na cnoic. Caithfidh mé a rá go gcuireann sin as dom go mór.</P>

    <P>Mar eolas don Aire i láthair na huaire níl ach 139 duine ceaptha le haghaidh an Scéim REPS i gContae na Gaillimhe. De réir an eolais atá agamsa níl ach fíor bheag díobh sin taobh thiar den Choirb. Ní féidir leo anois a bheith páirteach sa REPS mar ní féidir leo íoc as na costais leis an truailliú a chosaint.  Bhí go leor de na feirmeoirí sléibhe a chaithfeadh sheds le haghaidh caorach a choinneáil taobh istigh sa Gheimhreadh, a dtógáil da mbeidís ag baint buntáiste ar bith as an Scéim REPS.  Níl sin acu anois.

    <P>Tá fhios agam gur phléamar seo tráthnóna ach is aisteach mar atá rudaí ag casadh sa Teach seo agus tá an ceann seo filleadh go trom ar an Aire.  Molaimse dó mar sin dul ar ais go dtí an Aire Leasa Shóisialaigh agus dhá rud a iarraidh air &mdash; a dheimhniú dó nach dtógfar airgead a íocfar le feirmeoiri as an Scéim REPS, nach dtógfar sin san áireamh nuair a bheidh scrúdú maoine á dhéanamh.  Uimhir a dó, comhairle a ghlacadh uaidh maidir le cén bealach chun airgead a fháil le n-íoc as an scéim seo.  Más rud é nach bhfaighfear airgead le leanacht leis an scéim seo ar feadh na cúig bliana is dóigh liomsa go mbeidh dochar thar chuimse déanta do thionscal na feirmeoireachta agus muinín feirmeoirí. Ba chóir go mbeidh deontais le fáil nuair a theastaíonn uatha súd an obair a dhéanamh seachas go gcaithfidh gach duine dul an chéad lá agus tarraingt as an deontas.</P>
    <P>Tá go leor rudaí go bhféadfainn a rá agus gur mhaith liom a rá ach caithfidh mé mo chuid ama a roinnt.  Caithfidh mé seo a rá leat, a Aire.  Tá sé de ghradam agus de cháil ort gur tú an chéad Aire riamh nach raibh airgead le fáil le haghaidh aon chineál shed feirme is cuma cé chomh riachtanach is a bheadh sé.

When we were preparing the Book of Estimates the Government which was about to come into office roared and raved that we should not do so.  We extracted ourselves from Government and, lo and behold, this Government prepared the Book of Estimates.  The Minister for Finance did not have the commitment, the Taoiseach did not have the capacity and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry did not have the ability to deliver sufficient resources to underpin a national development plan for agriculture and ensure that one of the most adventurous, important and positive programmes ever put forward, the CFP, would be properly funded in 1995 and beyond.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry is one of the most important and biggest spending Departments.

    <P>The suspension of the control of farm pollution scheme is nothing short of a disgrace and proves beyond doubt that the Government has no interest in the farming community or the wider environment.

        <i>(Wexford):</i> Local authorities are very strict on pollution control. Will a farmer who is summonsed by the local authority be able to tell the county manager that the Minister told him that his application was provisionally approved but he would not get the money until 1997 and he wants the court case deferred until that time?  If a farmer borrows money will the Minister underwrite the interest payments until 1997?  Given his record in Government, there is very little chance of the Minister doing this.  Small farmers will be unable to borrow money to control pollution. Like the Government and the farm organisations, bank managers do not want to know about small farmers.</P>
      <P>The Minister must fight at the Cabinet table for increased funding.  It is not good enough for him to say that this is the amount Fianna Fáil negotiated. When he was in Opposition Deputy Yates had all the answers to the financial problems of the then Government.</P>

      <P>The decision to suspend the control of farm pollution scheme is a disgrace.  As recently as two or three weeks ago the Minister launched an ambitious programme for the development of the food industry.  The perception is that we have a clean and green environment.  Yet the Minister is now telling farmers that the Government is no longer interested in the environment and they will not get any funding to control pollution.  The Minister is abandoning farmers who want to invest money in pollution control.  He will have to adopt a tough stance at the Cabinet table so that the left wing Ministers do not take all the money out of the kitty.  If the Minister does this he will have done a good job for farmers who are very important to the economy.  To date the Minister has failed in regard to farm pollution control and he has let down farmers.</P>

I wish to remind him that his party did more to undermine the negotiating position of the then Government than anybody else.  It consistently derided the efforts of the then Taoiseach and Ministers who were trying to secure the best possible deal for this country.

His party played no small part in ensuring that we got a reduced allocation from the European Commission.  The chickens are now coming home to roost.</P>
      <P>I was very interested in the comments made by Deputy Eric Byrne who has an extensive knowledge of agricultural matters coming as he does from Dublin South Central.  He said that Fianna Fáil had introduced numerous schemes so as to benefit its rich rancher friends.  If Deputy Byrne does some study on rich ranchers he will find that they support Fine Gael, not Fianna Fáil which is supported by small farmers.  I am sure the Deputy's constituents in Dublin South Central will be interested to learn that he is supporting a party which supports the big ranchers whom he has so roundly condemned.</P>

    <P>The Government in its programme <i>A Government of Renewal</i>, states: &ldquo;The quality of many of our important lakes and rivers continues to deteriorate because of pollution from agricultural waste.  We are committed to tackling all sources of pollution of these important national resources&rdquo;.  In spite of this statement the Minister has decided to suspend the control of farm pollution scheme.  The Government's policy on the environment is schizophrenic.  The <Col N="1123" /> Minister for the Environment, Deputy Howlin, and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry are playing a kind of good cop, bad cop game.</P>

      <P>The Government has no concept of the impact of its policies on the environment.  It has put the environment in one little compartment, devoted two or three pages to this issue in the programme for Government and is pursuing policies which are completely anti-environment.  The Government seems to be committed to spending billions of pounds on end technology, so to speak, yet it cannot find £60 million to prevent pollution. This means that billions of pounds will be wasted in cleaning up a mess which could be prevented.  As a result farmers who are committed to maintaining a clean environment will suffer the consequences of pollution, which the Minister will be responsible for creating.  If we have fine weather during the summer there will be further incidents like the ones at Lough Sheelin, Lough Derg and Ballycroy.  I ask the Minister to secure the necessary funding to put this scheme back on the rails.</P>

Unless the control of farm pollution scheme is retained a sum of £250 million in REPS will be lost over the next five years.  Farmers will not be able to finance the pollution control measures required under the scheme without grant assistance.  The suspension of this scheme will create major problems in rural areas.  If this important work is not undertaken the Government will have to accept responsibility for the consequent destruction of the environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The annual target for farmers joining the REPS scheme is 9,000.  What is the Minister's plan to achieve it?  What proportion of funds will the Minister bring forward from 1998 and 1999 to 1997 for <Col N="1124" /> the control of farm pollution scheme? From where will the Minister get the funding for the 1998 and 1999 schemes? Is it a coincidence when the present parties are in Government that the farmers are always in trouble with farm grants? Some eight to ten years ago the Government, made up of two of the parties now in Government, introduced a scheme, applications for which were forwarded to farmers and subsequently returned, inspections were carried out but they were never paid.  Is it a coincidence that the same is happening again?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate Deputy Hugh Byrne on his initiative in putting this very important motion before the House.  The number of speakers who have contributed is ample testimony to the interest and the need to ensure this scheme is put back on the rails as soon as possible.  In the short time available to me I want to open the debate a little further.  I see this scheme as an integral part of how we manage our natural environment.  I was extremely disappointed to hear contributions from the Government side which tried to isolate the control of farm pollution scheme as if the only beneficiaries are the farming community.</P>
      <P>Any person who takes even a cursory glance at the problems affecting our environment will know this scheme is interwoven with fishing interests and the supply of good quality water to our villages, towns and cities.  Unless we have an effective means of controlling pollution from all sources including agriculture we are only paying lip service to a true interest in the environment. What would be the point in having an operational programme for fisheries, inland fisheries and the various other schemes now being put in place on foot of an effort by the previous Government to secure Structural Funds for a wide range of activities?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am extremely disappointed that the Minister, Deputy Yates, would attempt to play politics with this circumstance. I understand there are times when the Minister will be short of money.  I know <Col N="1125" /> from my experience in Government that emergencies arise and there will not be sufficient funds, as happened in the case of Aer Lingus.  We did not envisage the large scale problems that emerged there but once we discovered them we sought to find the resources to help the national airlines to survive.  The same could be said about Irish Steel.  This year for equality payments £260 million was found&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>That was not Structural Funds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;on foot of a court decision and many people will benefit from it.  It was not an anticipated result but it was one for which the Government found the resources.  In circumstances where this scheme has been eminently successful why was it suspended? I am surprised at the Minister, Deputy Yates, suggesting he has to suspend the scheme because of its success.  It was successful because as we begin to learn more about our natural environment and understand what pollution can do to our lakes, rivers and water supplies, farmers realise they have an obligation to use their own resources first.  Because of the expense involved successive Governments know they must help. However, the scheme was underfunded and the scale of the problem was not anticipated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a new era in politics.  The Minister with responsibility, instead of trying to solve the problem, decided the best thing to do was to say the problem was caused by the previous Minister.  That is ignoring the reality.  Due to the success of the scheme the farmers who participated and the Minister know that the reason a farmer would make that investment with his own funds first is because there is a problem and he wants to solve it.  We are transferring the problem to the future.  Some day we may have the resources to support them but in the meantime lethal effluent is pouring into drains, rivers and lakes destroying fish life, possibly damaging water supplies and taking from the green image and <Col N="1126" /> our campaign to present Ireland as a green country, one that protects its natural environment.  This enhances the prospect not only for agricultural production and our massive exports to the European continent and beyond but for a whole range of other activities in tourism, fishing and so on.  I do not wish to dwell on the details but Members know what I am saying.</P>
    <P>In circumstances where Governments find themselves in this difficulty it is usual to get around the table and try to find a solution.  I ask the Minister not to be childish by saying somebody else did not provide sufficient funds.  Do not try to pass the buck.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy knows the way the Structural Funds work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister needs to be at that table asking the other Minister in a green network &mdash; which I established and which, I understand, is being followed up by this Government &mdash; to integrate the particular Departments intrinscally involved in protecting the environment.  The Minister must make a strong case not only in the context of what the scheme does for farming but in the context of its essential character in how Ireland presents itself and protect the natural environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have enacted legislation requiring cleaner technologies, water, air, waste management and so on and imposing significant penalties.  That is the way it should be.  It makes a mockery of a Legislature if the type of legisaltion is enacted in the knowledge that if a problem arises it will not be overcome.  The Minister will try to scramble out of it by pretending someone else could have done something different.  Many people struggling to survive will face prosecutions. While Deputy Eric Byrne can laugh at the farming community and can point the finger, people who understand rural Ireland know that more people are leaving agriculture than any other profession or business.  If agriculture is as good and as profitable a business to be in why are so many leaving?  Those who <Col N="1127" /> are struggling most at this time &mdash; those frightened by debts, banks, the ACC and rising interest rates &mdash; are unable to find the resources to deal with this problem.</P>
    <P>The Minister should stop crying about the past and find solutions.  I am not interested in his PR machine or in how <Col N="1128" /> he silences the farming organisations.  I am interested in the natural environment. If the Minister can obtain the resources that other Ministers did and protect the environment, he will have done a service to the farming community.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for allowing me to raise this matter and the Minister of State for coming in to reply.</P>
      <P>St. Francis senior national school was built in 1980 when the Priorswood and Clonshaugh area was developing.  Prior to 1980 there were approximately 500 owner-occupied homes in the area.  In the early 1980s Dublin Corporation built two estates in the area, Moatview and Fairfield, comprising about 600 houses in total.  It also developed a small group housing scheme for the travelling community at Cara Park and a halting site at Belcamp Lane.</P>
      <P>The number of children on the roll at St. Francis senior national school at present is fewer than half the number on the roll in the early 1980s.  There are a number of apparent reasons for this. First, a large number of children in the area now attend post-primary level. Second, 11 per cent of children attending the school are from the travelling community at Cara Park and Belcamp Lane.  Third, there has been an increasing trend for children leaving the junior school to go to a senior national school outside the area.  This compounds the problem for the senior national school as it is usually the brighter children who leave.</P>
      <P>There is also a high level of unemployment in the local authority estates with the consequent disadvantage and deprivation.  As in many other similar areas of Dublin city and throughout the country there is a serious and growing drug addiction problem.</P>
      <P>Recently the principal at St. Francis senior national school carried out a special Sigma T mathematics test for the third and fifth classes.  The results of this test showed that over 50 per cent of the children were below the cut off point for children in need of remedial help.  They also demonstrated that over 17 per cent were seen to be in acute need of remedial help.</P>
      <P>At present the remedial teachers allocated to the St. Francis senior national school can only cater for remedial English pupils.  One of these teachers provides instruction in remedial reading and literacy in fourth, fifth and sixth classes while the second remedial teacher who is shared with the junior school provides instruction in remedial reading and literacy in third class.</P>
      <P>Because of the special factors pertaining to this school it may not qualify under the standard criteria used by the Department of Education in determining whether a school is entitled to a second remedial teacher and, therefore, I ask the Minister to treat it as a special case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Allen) Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Allen)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Allen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank <Col N="1131" /> Deputy Seán Kenny for having raised this matter in the House and am pleased to inform him that a second special teacher for travellers was recently sanctioned for St. Francis senior national school.</P>
      <P>As indicated to the House in the past, remedial education at primary level is a matter in the first instance for ordinary class teachers.  Therefore, the majority of pupils with remedial needs would be helped within the scope of the normal teaching service.</P>
      <P>However, it is acknowledged that remedial teachers constitute the main additional resource for addressing the problem of under achievement in primary schools.</P>
      <P>Substantial additional resources have been allocated to this area in recent years.  In 1994, an additional 100 remedial teachers were appointed to primary schools when 350 schools with approximately 34,000 pupils benefited from this allocation.  This brought the total number of remedial teachers in place to 1,133.  Of the 3,209 ordinary national schools throughout the country, approximately 2,061 now have the services of a remedial teacher, either full-time or on a shared basis.</P>
      <P>My colleague, the Minister for Education, recently announced her intention to appoint an additional 55 remedial teachers in the current year. Decisions in relation to the allocation of these posts will be made shortly following the collection and analysis of information from schools by the Department's primary inspectorate.  The posts will then be allocated on the basis of priority of need, as indicated by the information collected.</P>
      <P>Of the 408 ordinary national schools in County Dublin, 378 now have the services of a remedial teacher, either on a full-time or shared basis.  This includes 20 schools allocated a remedial service in the current school year as part of the recent distribution of posts.  This means that 97 per cent of pupils attending ordinary national schools in County Dublin currently enjoy a remedial service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1132" /> I can assure the Deputy that the needs of St. Francis senior national school, Priorswood, will be considered in the context of the allocation of remedial posts in 1995.</P>

      <P>As Ireland will preside over the Intergovernmental Conference in 1996 it will afford us an ideal opportunity, as we have done in the past, to voice the concerns of small nations on the matter of East Timor. The people who set up the East Timor Support Group, comprised of unemployed persons in the Dublin area, are to be commended on having brought this matter to our attention yet again in such a tangible manner.  Although our people are concerned about East Timor, it is a matter warranting the attention of the European Union just as much as, say, Martinique or Guadeloupe.  It is the belief of the United Nations that Portugal should be the administering authority in East Timor.  Yet, the behaviour of Indonesia in East Timor has been met simply by a series of nods and winks without any action being taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Approximately 200,000 East Timorese people have been killed for no known reason by the Indonesian Government, yet we stand by.  In reply to a parliamentary question I tabled in the House a few weeks ago, I ascertained that our trade with East Timor had increased enormously, from an approximate £16.5 million in 1989 to approximately £42.5 million in 1993. When we investigate how change was wrought in other parts of the world where there were serious breaches of human rights, we discover that we sought sanctions, which were the main reason for the huge changes that have taken place, for example, in South Africa.  Indeed our people are very proud of the various actions they took in regard to South Africa.  We could be equally proud if we brought about the cessation of the genocide in East Timor by the Indonesian Government.  At the <Col N="1133" /> same time, member states of the European Union, for example, France, still supply helicopters to Indonesia for use in East Timor.  England has a huge trade in arms with the Indonesian Government and Australia has an appalling record, well documented, in collaborating with the Indonesian Government in relation to East Timor.  I understand the Australians are about to give something of the order of £100 million in arms to the Indonesian Government to maintain the status quo in East Timor.</P>
    <P>Our people and Government cannot allow the circumstances in East Timor to continue, all in the interests of oil rather than the development of a country, akin to the position in Kuwait before the Gulf War, which is frightening. If East Timor did not have such vast quantities of oil off its coastline, the Australian Government would not be as supportive as they are of the Indonesian Government.  They know what is taking place in East Timor, as many of its citizens &mdash; and multi-national companies &mdash; are located there.</P>
    <P>We must take a stand on this matter because our trade with East Timor is enormous and growing.  While it may not be economically beneficial for us to take a stand against the Indonesian, French, English or Australian Governments, we must do so.  We must not participate in any agreements with these countries, we must state that what they are doing is wrong and take a lead from the people who brought this matter to our attention so tangibly in recent months.</P>
    <P>I implore the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and his Minister of State, Deputy Gay Mitchell, to raise these issues, thereby giving solace not only to our people but to those of East Timor, doing what we have done over many generations, being the voice of nations without one.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Lynch for raising the important subject of East Timor and <Col N="1134" /> giving the House an opportunity to consider it.  She also raised the role Ireland can play during its Presidency of the European Union.  Deputies will be aware that Ireland follows closely the situation in East Timor, on which the Tánaiste delivered a detailed speech in the Seanad on 8 March 1995.  The Government will continue to follow developments in East Timor closely in the lead up to and during our Presidency of the European Union in the second half of 1996.</P>
      <P>An important feature of Ireland's period as President of the European Council of Ministers will be relations between the European Union and the Association of South East Asian Nations &mdash; ASEAN &mdash; consisting of six countries: Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand. Vietnam will become the seventh member state of ASEAN in July of this year.</P>
      <P>Representatives of the six ASEAN Embassies visited Dublin earlier this week and met the Tánaiste and myself. One of the objectives of the meeting was to look forward to the series of EU-ASEAN ministerial meetings which will take place in the second half of 1996. One of the members of the visiting delegation was the Indonesian Ambassador and the Tánaiste took the opportunity to raise with him public concern in this country at the position in East Timor.</P>
      <P>Let me describe briefly for the information of this House the meetings which will take place between the European Union and ASEAN.  The Foreign Ministers of ASEAN hold an annual meeting, usually in late July.  Following that session, meetings take place between the European Union and ASEAN Ministers and Ireland will represent the European Union as Presidency at each of these meetings.</P>
      <P>The most important EU-ASEAN meeting will take place in Singapore at Foreign Minister level, probably in September when Ireland and Singapore will act as co-chairmen of the meeting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These meetings will provide an <Col N="1135" /> opportunity for high level contacts between the European Union, under the Irish Presidency, and ASEAN.  The Essen European Council of last December agreed that respect for human rights and similar principles constitute essential elements in the relations between the EU and third countries, including the ASEAN countries.</P>
    <P>At the previous Foreign Ministers' meeting in Karlsruhe in Germany in September 1994, the European Union and ASEAN Ministers issued a joint declaration and included the following section on human rights:</P>
    <P>The Ministers emphasised their common commitment to the promotion of and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms on the basis of the Charter of the United Nations, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action. They expressed their strong support for the successful implementation of the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action.</P>
    <P>The Vienna Declaration, which was adopted on 25 June 1993, to which all the ASEAN countries including Indonesia subscribe, includes the following keynote statement: &ldquo;while the significance of national and regional particularities and various historical, cultural and religious background must be borne in mind, it is the duty of States regardless of their political, economic and cultural systems, to promote and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms&rdquo;.  These statements will demonstrate to Deputies the importance which is attached to the issue of human rights in the discussions between the EU and ASEAN Ministers.  The Joint Declaration which emerges from those discussions has to be agreed by both sides.  However, the meeting provides the opportunity for specific cases, in particular that of East Timor, to be raised with the ASEAN countries.  The <Col N="1136" /> Indonesian Government is fully aware of the international concerns that exist as regards the situation in East Timor, and, in particular, of Ireland's continuing concern.</P>
    <P>Ireland will continue to follow developments with regard to East Timor in preparation for its Presidency in the EU.  Particular importance should be attached to the statement issued by the Chairman of the UN Commission on Human Rights, which met in Geneva from January until March this year.  The chairman's statement recorded Indonesia's undertaking to invite the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights to visit East Timor this year and to report to the next session of the Commission on Human Rights.  Indonesia also undertook to invite the Special Rapporteur on the Question of Torture and the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention to visit East Timor when it is necessary for them to do so in order to fulfil their duties.</P>
    <P>Ireland will remain in close contact with Portugal on this issue and follows the bilateral talks on East Timor which Portugal and Indonesia hold at Foreign Minister level under the auspices of the UN Secretary-General.  The next meeting of the Foreign Ministers is to take place on 8 July.</P>
    <P>Indonesia's implementation of its undertakings and developments in East Timor will be carefully taken into account by Ireland and its EU partners in deciding on the best course of action to take.</P>

Tá an obair sin ag dul ar aghaidh ó shin go sásúil agus creidim go mbeidh an obair críochnaithe ag deireadh na bliana seo.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Inis Oírr tá muintir an oileáin ag iarraidh go dtógfaí fánán nua taobh leis an gcé nua atá á tágáil agus a bheidh <Col N="1137" /> críochnaithe ag deireadh na bliana.  Bhí gá mór leis na céibheanna seo ar an dá oileán ionas nach mbeadh ar na hoileánaigh a thuilleadh dul amach ar churrachaí chun earraí a iompar isteach ón mbád farantóireachta.  Nuair a bheidh na céibheanna tógtha beidh na báid farantóireachta in ann teacht i dtír ag na céibheanna agus ní bheidh cruatan ar na hoileánaigh arís.  Is maith an rud é go mbeidh an áis seo ar fáil go luath ach chun foscadh a thabhairt do na bádóirí agus do na hiascairí ar an oileán tá gá le fánán a thógáil.  Tá iarratas curtha isteach go dtí An Roinn Ealaíon, Cultúir agus Gaeltachta ag muintir an oileáin. Níl scéal faighte acu fos an bhfuil an Roinn sásta cabhair a thabhairt chun an fánán seo thógáil.  Is é an chéad rud atá ag teastáil ná suirbhé chun meastachán ceart a fháil ar an gcostas a bheadh i gceist.  Creidtear nach gcosnódh an suirbhé sin ach cúpla míle punt. Ar ndóigh chosnódh an fánán féin suas le céad míle punt b'fhéidir.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom a chur ina luí ar an Aire go bhfuil seo fíor-thábhachtach. Muna dtógfar an fánán ní bheidh ach leath den obair déanta ag an Rialtas ar son na n-oileánach.  Tá mé cinnte go mbeidh an tAire fábharach don iarratas seo mar fhear ón Dáilcheantar céanna. Tá súil agam go mbeidh sé in ann a fhógairt anseo anocht go bhfuil sé fábharach agus go mbeidh sé ag tabhairt cead don suirbhé seo dul chun cinn, go gcuirfear an tairgead ar fáil agus sa deireadh go rachfar ar aghaidh ag tógáil an fhánáin ionas go mbeidh an áis sin ar fáil do na hoileánaigh.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Inquiry into Health Boards.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for allowing me to raise this matter.  Arising from what occurred yesterday, and the newspaper reports of the events that took place, I do not believe that a three member internal review group, chaired by a former health board official, composed of health board employees is an appropriate group to conduct an inquiry into the events that occurred in this matter in the late 1970s and throughout the 1980s. Those events resulted in the Central Criminal Court sentencing a man yesterday to a total of 238 years in prison for 26 representative counts, an extraordinary sentence unmatched in the history of the State.  After a four-day hearing that man admitted the commission of crimes of rape, buggery and indecent assault on his three children.  As the judge ordered that the sentences run concurrently the maximum period of imprisonment that man will serve is 12 years and possibly with good behaviour as little as nine years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The case disclosed a litany of barbaric physical and sexual violence that began in 1976 and continued until 1993. Despite the fact that the convicted man's son was taken into care in 1983 no criminal prosecution followed the making of a care order.  From information now publicly available, it seems that despite concerns about the man's two daughters, the child care professionals of the health board concerned essentially washed their hands of this family in 1984 due to difficulties experienced in dealing with the parents.  We <Col N="1140" /> are told that at case conferences in 1983 attended by the family's general practitioner, medical staff, social workers and on one occasion by a garda, the general conclusion was that enough evidence was not available to take the children into care.  That has been explained in newspaper reports on the basis that the professionals involved believed the culture of the time in terms of child abuse awareness was not in their favour. That is entirely untrue.</P>
    <P>During the 1981-82 period two cases were publicised in this country in which children died as a result of parental abuse and assault.  In 1982 as Fine Gael spokesperson on law reform I highlighted those cases in this House, the inadequacies in our child care system exposed by them and the need for appropriate action to be taken to protect children at risk.  It seems that at the very time the then Minister for Health, Deputy Woods, was giving assurances to this House that such action had been taken the children who were the tragic victims of that house of horrors in the west over which their father ruled were being subjected daily to appalling abuse and degradation.  The man's two daughters continued to be abused for a further decade.</P>
    <P>Speeches are frequently made in this House about our concern for children.  I am concerned that the legal regime in place today is little different from that operating in 1982.  Much of the new protection which should be afforded to children remains locked into a legal twilight zone, not yet having been brought into force.  I have been given assurances by a succession of Ministers for Health over a 15-year period that appropriate action has been or is being taken.  Even today as this most recent reported case is discussed in this House children are being physically and sexually abused behind closed doors.  How many will continue to be abused in the weeks ahead?  How many more children will fall victim not only to parental abuse but to health board failures and anachronistic laws?</P>
    <P>There should be a totally independent inquiry into the conduct of the health <Col N="1141" /> board in the area in which those three children were subjected to 17 years of sexual and physical assault.  The findings and recommendations of such an inquiry should be fully published.  Such an inquiry should state the reason care orders were not sought and obtained in respect of all three children at an early stage and, in particular, it should clarify whether guidelines published by the Department of Health in the early 1980s were fully and properly followed by the health board concerned.  The independent inquiry should also extend to the Garda who should report fully on the reason a prosecution was not brought earlier than the present one, particularly after the son was taken into care in 1983.  That is not something which appears to be within the remit of the current internal review group.  We must ensure that not only the legislation, but adequate social work personnel are in place to provide the maximum possible protection for all children at risk of such abuse.</P>
    <P>I have been a Member of this House for more than 15 years.  During all those years I have been raising a succession of tragic cases in which children have been physically and sexually assaulted and some where children have died at the hands of their parents.  I am personally sick and tired of ministerial genuflections of concern and promises of action. While a full inquiry into the background of this case is required, it should not be seen as some type of political placebo. What the vulnerable children of this State need is political action, not political rhetoric or expressions of sympathy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Currie) Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Currie)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Currie)</NameTxt>
      <P>I was absolutely horrified by the evidence of the dreadful sexual and physical abuse suffered by the three victims in the case referred to by the Deputy.  Last night's television interviews with two of the victims were extremely harrowing and heart-rending.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is appalling that they were subjected to such brutal and terrifying abuse over such a prolonged period. The litany of assaults and ill-treatment <Col N="1142" /> they had to endure during their childhool has shamed and angered all of us. Our fervent wish is that in time they will be able to put their horrendous experiences behind them.</P>
    <P>I am advised that, in order to protect the anonymity of the victims, the health board area in which the family lived cannot be identified nor is the health board at liberty to make any comment on the case.  However, I am in a position to confirm that the chief executive officer of the health board concerned has appointed an independent group to carry out a review of the board's involvement in the case.</P>
    <P>This review group is headed by Mr. Michael Bruton a management consultant from Dublin.  The other members of the group are Dr. Sheila Ryan a programme manager from the North Eastern Health Board, and Mr. Paul Harrison a head social worker in the Eastern Health Board.</P>
    <P>The terms of reference of the group are: to review the board's involvement in the case and to assess the board's response in the context of both the level of service and the practices that pertained at the time and those that exist today; and to make recommendations to the chief executive officer to ensure that in any such case the board's response is effective.</P>
    <P>The board's chief executive officer will make a full report to the Minister for Health when the review is completed within the next few weeks.</P>
    <P>I hope the Deputy will understand that, pending receipt of this report, it would be inappropriate for me to make any further statement on the case.</P>
    <P>I would, however, like to assure the Deputy of the serious determination of the Government to take all necessary measures to protect children, in so far as is humanly possible, from all forms of abuse and neglect.  We will be pressing ahead with arrangements for the full implementation of the Child Care Act, which is central to our overall strategy in this area.  Yesterday's revelations have reinforced my resolve to ensure that this legislation is fully operational <Col N="1143" /> within the shortest possible timeframe. In particular, it is my firm intention that those key provisions of the Act which will greatly strengthen the powers of the health boards, the Garda and the courts to intervene on behalf of children who are in need of care and protection will be brought into force before the end of the year.</P>
    <P>This is a firm Government commitment and as the Minister of State responsible for its implementation.  I underline and emphasise it.  Whatever about the past, I can assure the Deputy, the House and more importantly the community outside, that this is no mere <Col N="1144" /> genuflection of ministerial concern. However sick and tired the Deputy is, he can rest assured his sickness and concern is matched by mine.</P>
    <P>The process of coming to terms with the reality of child abuse in our midst has been a painful one.  At the same time, there can be no doubt about the deep felt concern of the community in general that this frightening problem be confronted head on and that the necessary services and supports be put in place to protect vulnerable children. The Government will not be found wanting in this regard.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.20 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 25 May 1995.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The aim of the Pilot Renewal Scheme for Traditional Seaside Resorts, as announced in the budget, is to renew and update the tourist amenities and facilities in certain traditional seaside resorts which have lost out in recent <Col N="951" /> years to the growth in package holidays to sun destinations.  This was the main consideration for the selection of areas for this scheme.  While the original list of areas to be included in this scheme was confined to eight traditional resorts I decided, following a large number of representations, to designate in the Finance Bill, seven additional resorts which are also in need of renewal.  These extra areas, while giving a more even spread of designated areas around the coast are also largely targeted at the traditional seaside resort areas.</P>
    <P>While I can understand the desire of many towns to be included in the scheme, it is not possible to accommodate all demands.  I believe the existing 15 locations represent a fair spread and balance.  Given that the scheme is a pilot scheme in nature it will always be possible on an ongoing basis to review the list of designated resorts towns in the light of experience gained from its operation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>The introduction of a voluntary early retirement scheme in 1987 was part of a package of corrective measures introduced at that time to stabilise the public finances.  These measures coincided with a widespread public and political consensus on the need to significantly reduce the level of public indebtedness which could only be achieved by reducing overall levels of public spending.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The voluntary early retirement scheme was generally available in the years 1987 to end 1988.  In 1989 and 1990 voluntary redundancy was offered in specific areas where a surplus of staff had been identified or where further significant reductions in numbers were <Col N="952" /> required to meet overall expenditure targets.  Approximately 10,000 availed of the scheme at a cost of just over £127 million.  This scheme was part of a general policy aimed at reducing public service pay costs and, combined with the effects of natural wastage and restrictions on recruitment, resulted in a significant reduction in overall public service numbers.</P>
    <P>While the package of corrective measures introduced from 1987 onwards had some harsh and unwelcome effects on the provision of public services, including health services, these measures did result in a major improvement in public finances.  As a result, it has been possible over recent years to improve the levels of services available to the general public while, at the same time, taking full account of wider budgetary constraints and meeting the criteria for budgetary convergence laid down in the Masstricht Treaty.</P>
    <P>Improved staffing levels across the public service since 1990 also reflects the implementation of commitments in the <i>Programme for National Recovery, Programme for Economic and Social Progress and Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> programmes as agreed by Government and all of the social partners.</P>
    <P>During 1995 it is anticipated that public service numbers will increase by approximately 3,600.  The bulk of this increase will occur in the health and education sectors &mdash; services provided in these areas are, by their nature, very labour intensive and, as a result, these areas bore the brunt of the cutbacks during the 1987 to 1990 period when overall employment in these sectors fell by almost seven-and-a-half thousand.</P>
    <P>During 1995 employment across the health services is expected to increase by approximately 2,300.  In particular, acute hospital services and childcare services throughout the country will benefit considerably as a result. Additional staffing will also be put in place to improve the level of support available to such groups as the elderly, and people with a physical or mental <Col N="953" /> handicap in our community.  Services to meet the needs of persons suffering from AIDS will also be upgraded.  In addition, the implementation of EU health-related directives, dental services improvements and measures to relieve general service pressures will take place during 1995.</P>
    <P>Education numbers will increase by approximately 1,000 reflecting increased enrolments at second-level and third-level and additional remedial posts and disadvantaged posts at second level and childcare assistance in the primary sector. Retention of approximately 400 posts at first level to reduce pupil/teacher ratios is also provided for in 1995.</P>

    <P>The Minister for Finance has asked Departments responsible for the various Community Support Framework operational programmes to examine the possibilities for such refocusing.

      <P>The Revenue Commissioners normally insist on the submission by companies of accounts carrying whatever certification from accountants may be required by company law.  If new legislation exempts small companies from the requirement to provide a practising accountant's report, opinion or certificate, the Revenue Commissioners will not, of course, insist on such endorsement on accounts submitted by those companies for tax purposes.  They will however continue to expect small companies to keep proper books and records as required by tax law so that the annual returns of taxable profits are correct.  These returns will of course remain within the scope of Revenue's audit and compliance programmes.</P>

      <Quest>the reason he has chosen gross current supply service spending as opposed to net current supply services spending as the measure of public spending in the 1995 budget; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[9426/95]</QRef>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy indicates, gross non-capital supply services expenditure was used in the 1995 budget to measure the increase in public spending for the purpose of the Government's commitment to restrict current spending growth to 6 per cent in 1995.  Gross current spending was used as it provides a more accurate and realistic measure of what the Government actually spends and is a more appropriate and valid basis on which effective overall control on public expenditure may be exercised.</P>
      <P>In the annual Appropriation Act, which is the statutory authority for expenditure on supply services, the Dáil approves, first, the net amount needed for each service and, second, the amount of cash receipts, known as appropriations-in-aid, which may be spent on the service.  These two amounts taken together make up the gross amount of each Vote.</P>
      <P>A gross measure of public spending is a better measure of total Government spending.  Net spending reflects receipts which partially fund spending.  These include the receipts of Government Departments by way of charges for services and certain EU transfers.  A modest increase in net spending may mask significant increases in overall spending if there are compensating increases in Departmental receipts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The use of gross supply services spending as a measure of public spending is not a new concept.  The annual Book of Estimates has traditionally provided details of departmental expenditure on a gross as well as a net basis. While the amounts voted by the Dáil, and provided for in the Appropriation Act, are net amounts, Government accounting has always been on a gross basis, that is, receipts are not set off against payments.  Part II of each Vote sets out the gross provision sought by <Col N="956" /> subhead.  The subheads of a Vote are the headings under which the Department is required to account for expenditure and determine the items in the Appropriation Account.  This gross approach &ldquo;facilitates the financial control of the Dáil and enables the Department of Finance to exercise control of expenditure&rdquo;, to quote my Department's outline of Public Financial Procedures, published in 1990.</P>
    <P>The recently published 1995 Revised Estimates Volume presents the details of departmental expenditure in precisely the same format as in previous years.  This Government has not introduced any new practice but has continued to adhere to long-standing practice in relation to the presentation of the details of Government spending in the Estimates.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Coveney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 22, 23, 49 and 51 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the concerns of exporters trading with the UK about the situation in the foreign exchange markets. As the House is aware, the Minister for Finance has met representatives of IBEC to discuss this situation and the IBEC representatives expressed their concerns about the impact of currency market developments on the competitiveness of those sectors which are in competition with UK-based producers. The Minister has asked his officials to maintain close contact with IBEC on these issues and this is being done.</P>
      <P>The Government is of course conscious of the potential benefits of the development of the peace process for the economy of the Border counties.  In addition to increased investment in North-South programmes, such as INTERREG and the provision of EU assistance under the peace process, the prospect of peace and political stability arising from the peace process should greatly enhance the climate for business, both in Ireland generally and particularly in the Border counties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the concerns of exporters to Britain and Northern Ireland about the impact of our higher exchange rate against sterling are appreciated, it is necessary to put recent developments in a proper perspective.  Over recent years the Irish economy has achieved very strong economic growth and increased employment against a background of low inflation, a balance-of-payments surplus and firm control of the public finances.  This greatly-improved growth and employment performance has been <Col N="958" /> achieved at a time of significant appreciation of the the Irish pound against sterling.</P>
    <P>I should also point out that while undoubtedly the Irish pound has appreciated recently against sterling, that appreciation has essentially been produced by the markets themselves and should be providing offsetting benefits for some firms, in terms of lower import costs.  In addition, the Irish pound has depreciated against the Deutsche Mark and other ERM currencies, a factor which should generally be of advantage to exporters to EU member states other than the UK, while its value against the US dollar has remained within the range of normal experience.  Overall, that is on a trade-weighted basis, the Irish pound's value has not in fact changed much because of the recent currency fluctuations.</P>
    <P>As regards the relationship between the Irish pound and sterling, I should explain that it is essentially market forces which determine the value of the Irish pound against sterling.  It is not possible to guarantee a fixed exchange rate against sterling or any other currency in circumstances where exchange rates are determined by market forces. Even if it were possible it would mean the Irish pound's value would be determined by that of sterling even in circumstances where the value was declining with inflationary effect or required increases in interest rates to sustain it. As the Deputy will be aware, the UK implemented three half per cent increases in interest rates over the period August 1994 to February 1995 while Irish rates were not raised until March 1995, and then only twice.  Such a fixed link would also, of course, run contrary to the policies pursued by successive Irish Governments since Ireland joined the European Monetary System in 1979.</P>
    <P>The Government has of course a role in ensuring that the economic environment is conductive to economic activity, including exporting.  In this context, I would point out that a stable exchange rate, flowing from our recent participation in the zone of stability <Col N="959" /> which the ERM represents, has helped to underpin the policy approach within which low inflation has been achieved in recent years.  This low inflation is central to our longer-term strategy, based on moderate wage developments and continuing improvement in the public finances, to strengthen our employment performance.</P>
    <P>The Government has no plans to provide special assistance for exporters affected by the recent currency fluctuations. It is primarily a matter for Irish exporters themselves, as it is for exporters in other countries, to cope with the economic environment in which they find themselves.  This includes coping with currency fluctuations on and when they arise.</P>
    <P>I should, however, point out that the 1995 budget contained improvements in income tax and employer and employee PRSI which were, in part, specifically aimed at helping indigenous firms with markets in the UK.  The improvements in income tax and employee PRSI will underpin the moderate wage developments enshrined in the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i>.  The increase in the income threshold below which the lower, 9 per cent rate of employee PRSI applies will support some 170,000 existing jobs and will help to reduce labour costs in employment-intensive sectors which are particularly dependent on the UK market.  The income tax improvement in the 1995 budget will cost the Exchequer some £111 million in 1995 while the PRSI concessions in the budget will cost some £93 million.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>As indicated by the Deputy, the budget day projection for current Exchequer expenditure amounted to £11,852 million, comprising (a) a Central Fund Services provision of £2,987 million and (b) a net Non-Capital Supply Services provision of £8,865 million.</P>
      <P>Actual current expenditure during the first quarter of 1995 totalled £2,771 million, or 23 per cent of the annual budget provision. This was £190 million lower than the equivalent issues for the first three months of 1994, which amounted to £2,961 million.  As explained in the press statement issued with the returns, this year's first-quarter expenditure returns reflected favourable timing factors.  The underlying level of expenditure to date is seen as supportive of the budget targets.</P>
      <P>The Revised Estimates Volume published on 11 May made provision for the expenditure measures which I announced in my Financial Statement on 8 February, and also for measures which were either not decided or whose cost was not known at budget time.  In the light of the revised volume, the principal adjustments to budget expectations for the Exchequer issues to non-capital supply services (NCSS) are as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="962" /> an additional allocation to Social Welfare of £140 million, bringing the total provision for equal treatment payments in 1995 to £200 million; estimating adjustments to other 1995 NCSS allocations amounting to a net overall reduction of £13 million; and in the light of the more precise data now available on the 1994 supply spending outturn reflected in the revised volume, the carry-over of departmental balances available to the Exchequer in 1995 is now put at £16 million more than projected on budget day.</P>
    <P>Taking these factors into account, the 1995 Exchequer net NCSS provision consistent with the Revised Estimates Volume is thus £111 million higher then anticipated on 8 February last.  It is considered that the budget day projection for Central Fund Services remains a valid and prudent estimate of the end-year outturn.  Accordingly, the revised post-budget projection for current Exchequer expenditure is £11,963 million.</P>
    <P>It is not practicable at this relatively early stage to assess the extent to which spending liabilities additional to those provided for in the Revised Estimates Volume will fall to be met in the course of 1995, or indeed to identify the potential for expenditure savings which may emerge during the current year.</P>

      <P>The introduction of divorce could lead to additional costs principally in the areas of social welfare, taxation and the courts.  The scale of these costs would depend on two factors: the numbers obtaining divorces, and the amendments to the existing codes of law in these areas to accommodate divorced persons.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Social Welfare will shortly bring before the Oireachtas the Government's proposals for providing for the social welfare entitlements of divorced persons.  The principle on which this legislation will be based is that nobody will lose social welfare entitlements as a result of the introduction of divorce.  The studies carried out indicate the costs involved are not likely to be significant.  The House will have the opportunity to fully debate these proposals, and their costs, when the legislation is introduced.</P>

      <P>The agreement to which the Deputy refers was entered into between the Minister for Finance, the Central Bank and Allied Irish Banks plc.  It could not be unilaterally set aside by any of the parties.</P>
      <P>The 1992 agreement was concluded following a Government decision that AIB should contribute further to the cost of the administration of Icarom plc, formerly the Insurance Corporation of Ireland, because the funding arrangements which were put in place when ICI was placed under High Court administration in 1985 had proved inadequate. The agreement provided for AIB to make an annual contribution of £8.8 million to Icarom for a period of 20 years.  This contribution was in addition to the annual contribution from AIB of £5.5 million over 15 years which was provided for under the funding arrangements agreed in 1985.  Pursuant to the 1992 agreement the Exchequer also made an interest-free loan of £32 million to the administrator of Icarom.</P>
      <P>On 1 February 1994 my predecessor informed the Dáil that the funding provided for the administrator should have the effect of meeting all of the outstanding liabilities foreseen, including the repayment of the £100 million Exchequer loan advanced under the 1985 agreement and the £32 million interest-free Exchequer loan advanced under the 1992 agreement.  This continues to be the case.</P>

      <P>A sum of 325,000 ECUs, £260,000, has been secured from the European Union for humanitarian aid for those affected by flooding earlier this year.

    <P>The Government has decided in principle to make additional funds available for the relief of the particularly severe and prolonged hardship arising from the unique situation in south Galway.  I will be drafting proposals for this Government funded humanitarian relief package in consultation with the Minister for Finance on the basis of the information gathered by the Irish Red Cross Society and of the assessment of the condition of the most seriously affected houses which is currently being carried out by <Col N="968" /> the Office of Public Works.  The submission from the South Galway Flood Victims Action Committee will be taken fully into account in formulating the proposals for a further humanitarian relief package for the area for consideration by the Government.</P>

      <P>The constitutional and statutory provisions on which the Oireachtas levies taxation and appropriates amounts for financing public services are cash-based and, consequently, reports to the Dáil on receipts and expenditure must also be cash-based.  However, a joint Department of Finance-Comptroller and Auditor General working group made recommendations last year that certain features of accrual accounting should be introduced in order to supplement the cash-based information contained in the Appropriation Accounts, that is, in the annual accounts of Government Departments which are presented to the Dáil and examined by the Committee of Public Accounts.  The group's recommendations were considered and accepted by the committee and they are being implemented, starting with the 1994 accounts.  It is intended to make further enhancements in the accruals information contained in the Appropriation Accounts in subsequent years. Conventional accrual accounting would not provide the House with sufficient information on cash receipts and appropriations to meet legal requirements but I accept that a certain amount of supplementary information of an accruals nature would be useful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the working group reported, the Strategic Management Initiative has <Col N="969" /> been launched and, in that context, further consideration is being given to financial management systems in Government Departments.  This process is ongoing.  In addition, a pilot project on accrual accounting is under way, with the assistance of a commercial accountancy firm, in the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications.  It is expected that the results of this project will be available early in 1996.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>The amounts of income tax paid on farming profits, and their percentage of all income tax receipts, from 1990 to 1994 are estimated as follows: £45 million in 1990, or 1.6 per cent of all income tax receipts, £36 million in 1991 or 1.2 per cent of all income tax receipts, £48 million in 1992 or 1.5 per cent of all income tax receipts, £55 million in 1993 or 1.6 per cent of all income tax receipts, and £66.5 million in 1994 or 1.8 per cent of all income tax receipts.</P>
      <P>These figures do not include any yields in 1993 and 1994 under the 1993 tax amnesty.  Also excluded from the calculations are tax receipts from deposit interest retention tax because it is not possible to apportion that tax between particular classes of taxpayers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These figures reflect the tax take in respect of farming profits.  They do not include PAYE tax paid on employment income earned by farmers or their spouses.  Such tax is included in the overall collection of PAYE and is not distinguishable until after the income tax returns submitted by farmers have been analysed.  An analysis of the returns for the income tax year 1991-92, <Col N="970" /> the latest available, indicates that some £43 million in tax was paid by farmers, including trader-farmers, or their spouses, under the PAYE system for that year.</P>
    <P>The reduction in income tax yield on farming profits in 1991 is mainly attributable to a fall in farm incomes in two years in succession, 1990 and 1991.  A recovery in farm profits only became evident in 1992.  The income tax yield of £36 million in 1991 also reflected a fall of approximately £5 million due to the deferral of the balances of 1990-91 tax from 1991 to 1992 as a transitional effect of introducing the current year basis of assessment for self-employed persons in 1990.  This amount was included in the yield of £48 million in 1992.</P>
    <P>Random audits on farmers have produced a yield of just over £101,000 in respect of 42 completed audits initiated in 1992 when the random audit programme began.  No new random cases were selected in 1993 for audit due to concentration of resources on work related to the tax amnesty and major restructuring of the audit programme.  I am informed that in the 1994 audit plan about 2 per cent of audit cases were selected randomly.  The results of the 1994 programme are at present being analysed.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the random audit programme is to demonstrate the risk of audit to every self-assessing taxpayer and the Revenue Commissioners consider that the current selection procedure serves this purpose well and is a useful element in the overall audit programme.</P>
    <P>In common with other self-employed taxpayers, farmers are subject to the various compliance and audit arrangements which apply under the self-assessment system.  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the evidence currently available from self-employed audits indicates that the compliance levels of farmers are comparable to those of other self-employed taxpayers.</P>

    <P>While the increase in costs between 1994 and 1995 for the period in question is just under 14 per cent the bulk of this increase is due to increases in the cost of paper rather than to a growth in the quantity of printing.  Labour cost increases would also account for a relatively small percentage increase.</P>
    <P>Since January 1990 responsibility for funding for printing has been transferred to individual Departments.  At that time standing instructions were issued to all Departments to ensure the most stringent economies in printing costs and a reminder to this effect was issued again by the Minister for Finance in March of this year.</P>

      <P>The VAT treatment of charities is, in fact, a direct consequence of European Union VAT law.  The sixth VAT Directive, to which Irish law must conform, provides that most charitable activities are exempt from VAT: this means that bodies engaged in such activities do not charge VAT on the services that they provide but, as a necessary corollary, they are not entitled to recover the tax borne on the goods and services which they purchase in the course of these activities.

      <P>As I indicated in the debate on the Committee and Report Stages of the Finance Bill, I do not consider Balbriggan to be a suitable area to be included in the pilot renewal scheme for traditional seaside resorts.  As regards the inclusion of the town in the urban renewal scheme this is primarily a matter for the Minister for the Environment.</P>
      <P>While I do not consider that any useful purpose would be served by meeting with Balbriggan Chamber of Commerce and Town Commissioners at this time I would be prepared to look at any submissions which they would wish to forward to me.</P>

      <Quest>if the Government will provide appropriate funding for the European Union's peace initiative programme in view of President Santer's statement in Belfast on 11 April 1995, that the Irish and British Governments' matching funds for the financing of the implementing programme should be an additional 100 per cent</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I will quote from what President Santer said at the Belfast Conference in referring to the additionality aspect.</P>
      <P>In plain language the European Union funds are 100 per cent additional; the United Kingdom and Irish matching funds should be 100 per cent additional as well.  The European Union has put fresh money into the peace process; we expect Ken Clarke and Ruarí Quinn to do the same, we are sure they will.</P>
      <P>The Commission guidelines for the initiative provide that the European Community will finance up to 75 per cent of the cost of measures under the initiative.  The balance of the cost will come from Exchequer and other national sources.</P>
      <P>The Government has already given a commitment that Structural Fund aid under the initiative for a special support programme for peace and reconciliation in Northern Ireland and the Border counties will be additional to Structural Fund spending in the Border counties under the Community Support Framework for 1994 to 1999 and other Community initiatives.  The national contribution to the programme will also be additional.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister for Finance stated in the Dáil on 25 April last, now that all the operational programmes under the Community Support Framework have been approved by the European Commission and the programmes under the various Community initiatives are either approved or at an advanced stage. <Col N="976" /> Departments are compiling details of forecast expenditure under these programmes in each of the eight regions. When compiled these forecasts will provide the baseline data by reference to which the additionality of the expenditure under the peace initiative can be demonstrated over the period of the programme.</P>
    <P>In drawing up the operational programme full regard will be had to ensuring the optimum degree of complementarity and integration with the Community Support Framework operational programmes and relevant Community initiatives, in addition to the range of activities carried out under the International Fund for Ireland.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the overall economic and fiscal impact of the type of tax-switching envisaged, I would refer the Deputy to the replies to his previous parliamentary <Col N="978" /> questions on related topics, on 1 December 1993, columns 1164-1165 and 25 January 1995, columns 148-150 of the Official Report.  As pointed out on that occasion, the policy agreement, <i>A Government of Renewal</i>, states that, in the context of protecting the environment, the Government will contribute to the preparation of a pan-European taxation policy on carbon and fossil fuel inputs.  While the benefits of shifting taxation from labour can be endorsed in principle, we would need to be assured about the full implications of additional taxation on energy products. While the former would reduce the direct cost of employment, additional tax on non-renewable resources would inevitably cause an increase in inflation. If, in turn, this were to lead to demands for higher wages in compensation, the benefits of reduced labour taxes could be quickly offset.  In addition, unilateral action by either Ireland or the European Union as a whole in this area could very likely result in some industries moving to locations which would not be as concerned about the environment, leading to loss of employment here. This potential effect would need to be borne in mind in examining the overall effect on employment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>The statistical information requested by the Deputy is set out in the following table.</P>
      <P>The gain to the Exchequer from confining the listed reliefs to the standard rate of 27 per cent is estimated to be of the order of £430 million.  In arriving at this estimate the exemption limits and associated marginal relief have been estimated at their present levels.  This estimate is tentative and is subject to a margin of error.</P>
      <P>The estimate of yield does not include any yield from confining medical insurance relief to the standard rate as provision has already been made in the 1994 Finance Act for this change to take effect on a phased basis from 6 April, 1995.</P>
      <P>The question of introducing a tax credit system has been considered over the years.  In looking at possible options in the area of taxation it is important that there should be no confusion between the underlying policy considerations, such as equity, progressivity or efficiency, and the essentially administrative issue of how best to realise these in practical terms.  Tax credits simply represent an alternative means of pursuing goals which could equally be advanced within the framework of the present allowance system.  The choice between a credits system and an allowance system therefore should rest on considerations of simplicity from the standpoint of taxpayers and the administration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the question of substituting tax credits for allowances, it should be recognised that it would significantly increase the progressivity of the tax system in the absence of other changes. <Col N="980" /> The tax system is already quite progressive. Moreover, it would bring about circumstances in which a greater proportion of taxpayers would be liable at the higher rate.  I do not believe that this would be generally seen as an improvement in the tax system.  It would certainly run counter to the view that economic and employment objectives are likely to be best served by keeping marginal tax rates as low as possible.</P>

      <P>State bodies were of course established over the years because it was felt that the various functions assigned to them were more appropriately administered and executed by organisations operating <Col N="982" /> outside the Civil Service, but answerable to the relevant Minister concerned. The degree of accountability of those bodies to the Dáil is ultimately determined by the Dáil itself through the legislation which underpins their existence.</P>
      <P>In the case of each State body, the relevant Minister and his officials have responsibility for overseeing the policies and performance of each body.  In turn, the board of each State body is charged by the Minister with ensuring that these policies are carried out.  Ministers are answerable to the Oireachtas for the substantive affairs of bodies under their aegis, excluding matters of day-to-day operations and administration.  The normal method of inquiry is the very medium we are using now &mdash; the parliamentary question.</P>
      <P>There are a number of mechanisms which limit the autonomy of State companies. These range from statutory limits on and ministerial approval of borrowing, to appointment of directors, approval of capital expenditure, establishment of acquisition of subsidiaries and submission of annual and interim reports and accounts.</P>
      <P>The Exchequer-sourced income of non-commercial State companies being largely voted, is subject to the approval of Dáil Éireann.  The accounts of these companies are examined by the Comptroller and Auditor General and may be examined by the Committee of Public Accounts of this House. Additionally the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Commercial State-sponsored Bodies provides the means of examining the activities of State bodies.</P>
      <P>I would not agree that the semi-State companies have too much autonomy. As regards additional accountability to Dáil Éireann, if the Deputy has specific proposals to put forward in this regard, I will be glad to consider them.</P>

      <P>Information is not available on the amount of money invested by Irish residents in offshore funds.  However, under the system of self-assessment, a taxpayer in receipt of income from offshore funds which is chargeable to tax is obliged to declare such income in his or her return of income.

    <P>Additional reporting requirements are being introduced in this year's Finance Bill for investments in offshore funds other than UCITS, which are already subject to such requirements. Section 41 of the Bill, as passed by the Dáil, provides that Irish residents who invest in these offshore funds, and persons who act as intermediaries for Irish <Col N="985" /> residents in the making of such investments, will be obliged to furnish information to the Revenue Commissioners in relation to: the full name and address of the Irish resident investor or intermediary, the tax reference number of the Irish resident investor, the full name and address of the fund with which the investment was opened, the date on which the investment was opened, and the amount of such investment.  Similar reporting arrangements already apply in relation to foreign bank accounts, foreign UCITS and life assurance investment policies taken out with overseas life companies.</P>

      <P>The EU Commission has recently made a proposal for a European Parliament and Council Decision adopting an action programme for Community customs to be known as the &ldquo;Customs 2000 Programme&rdquo;.  The Commission proposes that the programme will run for the five years from 1 January 1996 to 31 December 2000.  The proposal will, of course, require Parliament and Council approval before it can be implemented. Technical discussion of the draft has commenced in the Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners has already played a major role in the development of the proposed programme. It chaired a seminar which it organised jointly with the Commission in Dublin Castle in October 1993, at which the role of customs in the Single Market era and the strategic direction which EU customs services should follow for the future were discussed by senior customs officials from all the member states, including the three countries which have since acceded to membership.  Following those discussions, the commissioners prepared a <Col N="986" /> draft strategy statement which they presented to the heads of the EU customs services at a meeting in December 1993.  The heads approved the statement which sets down an agreed basis for maximising the contribution of the customs services in the EU, in co-operation with the Commission.  The Commission's present proposals are in large measure a formalising of that strategy statement in the proposed Parliament and Council decision.</P>
    <P>The primary objectives of the programme proposed by the Commission are to ensure that customs controls and procedures are implemented in an effective and equivalent way at every point of the EU's external frontier, to encourage and support initiatives for improving the efficiency of customs services, to enhance training given to customs, and to strengthen links between customs and traders.</P>
    <P>With these objectives in mind, the Commission has proposed various specific measures, including: the use of teams of customs officials to monitor how EU customs law is being implemented in the member states, so as to promote best practice throughout the EU and to identify any desirable changes needed in EU law; consultation with trade interests to ensure that their requirements are being met by customs procedures; development of an anti-fraud policy, to include improvements in gathering and using intelligence, and so on; development of improved customs working methods such as use of risk analysis techniques for selecting goods for check, use of audit as a control tool, simplified customs procedures and greater computerisation; increased training for customs officals and the promotion of common training courses on EU customs procedures.</P>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners will participate fully in the programme to be approved by Parliament and the Council in order to ensure that our customs service uses best practice for the benefit of the business community and all those affected by customs rules and procedures, as well as ensuring that our <Col N="987" /> controls at the EU external frontier are as effective as possible to combat drugs smuggling and other illegal imports. Following the agreement reached by the heads of customs, the commissioners have already taken a number of initiatives by adopting new working methods such as those I have referred to earlier; by participating in a pilot project set up by the Commission involving the use of teams of customs officials to monitor the implementation of customs law and promote best practice; by promoting the use of simplified customs procedures for traders; by setting up a Customs Consultative Committee with trade interests, which has received a general welcome and has already resulted in a number of useful simplifications for the trade.</P>

      <P>The question of seeking to have Structural Funds, unspent in 1994, redirected to Ireland does not arise.  These funds are not available for reallocation. Underspends of funds allocated to member states for 1994 have been automatically carried forward, under agreed budgetary procedures, to 1995 and subsequent years to be spent by the member states, in line with allocations already agreed with the Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the Structural Fund regulations, a mid-term review of the operation of the funds will take place.  Under this review, the commission is required to prepare a report on the operation of the funds not later than 31 December 1996.  This will identify any serious <Col N="988" /> underspends and delays in progress in implementing Community Support Frameworks in member states.  This mid-term review may provide the first real opportunity to seek additional assistance from Structural Funds.  The Government will continue to monitor progress in this regard, and, if the opportunity arises, it will seek to secure for Ireland the maximum share of any additional resources which might become available as a result of the mid-term review.</P>

      <P>Following the completion of the EU Single Market in January 1993 customs declarations, the traditional source of almost all trade <Col N="989" /> statistics, are no longer required for most movements of goods within the EU.  A new EU-wide system for collecting intra-EU trade statistics, Intrastat, was introduced on 1 January 1993. This Intrastat survey is conducted by the Revenue Commissioners, while estimation, data analysis and publication is the responsibility of the Central Statistics Office.  Trade with non-EU countries continues to be based on customs documents.</P>
      <P>Prior to 1993, trade statistics were far more timely than most other economic statistics because traders had to complete customs documentation in order to ensure the speedy movement of goods, and this documentation provided the basis for compiling the trade statistics. The new Intrastat data collection system for EU trade has lost this advantage, and is subject to the non-response and timeliness difficulties normally encountered in direct statistical inquiries. This is a problem which is common to all EU member states.</P>
      <P>Throughout 1992, the CSO ensured that the many users of trade statistics were fully forewarned of the inevitability that timeliness would be adversely affected at least for some time after the introduction of the new system.</P>
      <P>The delays experienced in the production of the monthly statistics in 1993 were particularly severe, with an average lag of over 30 weeks.  A joint SCO-Revenue review group examined the new survey system after the first full year of its operation and made recommendations to improve the timeliness. As a result, an improvement of over six weeks has been achieved in the first half of this year and a further improvement of this order is anticipated before the end of the year.  Further improvements in timeliness will be dependent on trader response.  Currently it takes about four months to achieve a response covering 90 per cent of the value of trade, which is the minimum required to produce reliable results.</P>
      <P>The provisional results for December 1994 and for the year 1994 will be published in the second half of next month.</P>

      <P>There are no plans at this time to move to a system of two Finance Bills each year.  The proposal for two Finance Bills emanated from the Institute of Taxation as a means of allowing more considered consultation on proposed taxation measures, especially on technical and detailed, but nonetheless important, proposals in the Bill.</P>
      <P>I have no problem with wider consultation. To this end, I have agreed to meet the institute each year prior to the Bill.  While such consultation is desirable, taxation proposals have to be given effect to expeditiously each year. Two Finance Bills may militate against this and prolong discussion and debate on what many may regard as necessary or welcome changes in tax law.  It is surely desirable and in the interest of taxpayers to give effect to such changes as soon as possible each year and within a reasonable period from the budget.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government remain firmly committed to the fiscal policy parameters set out in our policy Programme, <i>A Government of Renewal</i>.  Briefly, these envisage strict adherence to Maastricht's fiscal convergence criteria &mdash; i.e., that the annual general Government <Col N="991" /> deficit should be no more than 3 per cent of GDP, and that the Gross Debt/GDP ratio will continue to decline satisfactorily towards 60 per cent.  In that context, we undertook to maintain the EBR prudently below 3 per cent of GNP, and to restrict the growth of current supply spending to a maximum of 6 per cent in nominal terms in 1995 and to an average annual rate of 2 per cent in real terms over the following two years of the Programme.</P>
      <P>These undertakings were fully accommodated in the budget which I introduced on 8 February last.  The 1995 EBR is set at 2.4 per cent of GNP; the general Government aggregates are well within the Maastricht limits; and the gross current supply service spending provision made in the 1995 budget represented an increase of 5.8 per cent over the 1994 outturn.  It is not possible at this early stage to make a firm judgment on the prospective outturn for 1995 or the fiscal outlook for 1996 and 1997.  However, the budgetary indicators over the year to date are broadly supportive of the budget projections.</P>
      <P>Since the budget, the Government has decided to provide an additional £140 million towards the payment of the entitlements of women under the EU Equal Treatment Directive; £60 million had already been provided for this in the budget, bringing the total payments this year to £200 million.  The additional allocation of £140 million plus some other more minor expenditure changes have been reflected in the recently published &ldquo;Revised Estimates for the Public Services&rdquo;.  The effect of these changes is that the increase in gross non-capital supply services expenditure in 1995 is now 6.9 per cent as compared with 5.8 per cent provided for in the budget.  If the £140 million is excluded from the figures then the increase in gross current spending is 5.6 per cent, actually below the increase on budget day and well within the Government's 6 per cent limit this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The equal treatment liabilities arise directly from the deferral of payments <Col N="992" /> which have been determined by the court as properly due in earlier years. They are a legal obligation which was not created by any act of this Government. Meeting these exceptional liabilities does not indicate any weakening of the Government's resolve to contain public spending and to adhere strictly to the fiscal policy parameters set out in our programme.</P>

All of these licences have been taken up thus improving the availability of wheelchair accessible taxis without any cost to the Exchequer.  Furthermore, the considerable relief available to qualifying individuals under the Disabled Drivers and Passengers Scheme represent a more targeted approach to assisting the mobility of disabled persons.</P>

      <P>Deposit Interest Retention Tax (DIRT) is deductible at source on deposit interest savings accounts and is chargeable at 15 per cent of interest paid on special savings accounts and 27 per cent of interest paid on ordinary deposit accounts.  DIRT satisfies an individual's full liability to income tax in respect of such interest.</P>
      <P>Certain categories such as companies, pension funds, registered charities and non-resident persons may, on completion of the appropriate declaration, receive such interest without deduction of tax.  There is also provision for the repayment of DIRT to individuals who are not liable or fully liable to income tax, where the individual or his/her spouse is over 65 years of age, or is permanently incapacitated by reason of mental or physical infirmity from maintaining himself or herself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In terms of administration and collection, DIRT is an efficient and effective tax which currently yields over £100 million annually.  From an equity viewpoint, it is appropriate that interest income is taxable just as other income is <Col N="997" /> taxable and I am not aware of any major public concern regarding this tax. Consequently, I have no plans to abolish it.</P>

      <P>The Treaty on European Union sets out a timetable for movement to the third stage of Economic and Monetary Union and a single currency.  Briefly, if a majority of member states meet the conditions, the third stage can begin in 1997; if a date for the start of the third stage has not been set by end-1997, the third stage will begin in 1999.</P>
      <P>The focus of activity among member states at present is on meeting the Treaty conditions &mdash; which relate to Government deficit, debt, inflation etc. &mdash; for moving to Economic and Monetary Union.  The excessive deficit procedure set out in the Treaty, which is designed to increase economic convergence among the member states, was implemented in 1994 for the first time: only two member states, Ireland and Luxembourg, were found not to have an excessive deficit.  Ireland continues to meet the Treaty criteria in 1995.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards technical preparations for the introduction of the single currency, the Deputy will be aware of the interim report of the Maas Group and a final report by this group should be finalised soon.  The European Commission is also preparing a Green Paper on the practical implications of the introduction of a single currency and this should be ready shortly.  The Mint Directors of the member states are examining issues in relation to the design and production of coins of a single currency.  The European Monetary Institute, which was established in 1994, is also undertaking a considerable amount of preparatory <Col N="998" /> work in conjuction with member state Central Banks.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 88, 89 and 102 together.</P>

    <P>The administration of tenant purchase schemes in their area, including the processing of individual applications, is a matter for each local authority. Consequently particulars relating <Col N="1005" /> to the handling of individual applications are not available in my Department.</P>
    <P>The Annual Housing Statistics Bulletins for 1993 and 1994 (copies of which are available in the Oireachtas Library) provide information, based on returns from local authorities, on activity in each county and county borough under the 1993 tenant purchase scheme.  Full information about the number of houses purchased under all previous tenant purchase schemes, or the numbers of applications refused, is not available in the Department.  However, details of the number of dwellings sold annually by local authorities in the years 1970 to 1994 are given in the Annual Housing Statistics Bulletins.  Some details for earlier years are given in the Department's Annual Reports for those years. A new tenant purchase scheme which provides for increased discounts and the option of purchase under shared ownership arrangements was announced in the policy document &ldquo;Social Housing &mdash; the Way Ahead&rdquo; which was launched on 2 May 1995.  Detailed information on the new scheme were sent to local authorities on 18 May 1995.  They were requested to notify each tenant, who has made application to purchase under the 1993 scheme but who has not concluded purchase of the house, that the application now qualifies for consideration under the new scheme and to advise the tenant of the reduced purchase price of the house and the shared ownership option.  Authorities were also requested to invite other eligible tenants to make application to purchase under the new scheme and to facilitate the completion of transactions to purchase as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>Shannon Development has been allocated £200,000 for capital purposes in 1995.  These funds will be used by Shannon to upgrade and develop a number of tourist facilities in the Shannon region.  Most of the money will be spent on improving Bunratty Castle and Folk Park.  A number of smaller infrastructural projects will also be improved, for example, additional services at the Cliffs of Moher will be provided.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, the Government decided in 1986 to allow detailed price control to lapse.  This has been the policy of successive Governments since then, with increasing emphasis being placed on the promotion of competition throughout the economy and the encouragement of consumer awareness of prices including those of imported products.  Consistent with this policy, I do not monitor prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The &ldquo;Policy Agreement for Government&rdquo; provides for the strengthening of <Col N="1019" /> competition law by giving the Competition Authority powers of enforcement and enabling the courts to impose fines on those found to be engaging in unfair competition.  It is my intention to proceed urgently with these proposals and to establish a list of areas where competitive forces might operate more effectively.</P>

      <P>Following acceptance of the Irish Steel restructuring plan in September 1994, the company submitted a three year viability plan.  Under this plan, the company sought a capital injection of £50 million over a three year period made up of a £40 million equity and £10 million Government guaranteed loans.  As any decision in relation to the provision of finance to Irish Steel is subject to the approval of the European Commission and the unanimous approval of the Council, the matter was referred to the European Commission for examination in the first instance.  The Commission is still examining the application and has not taken a position on it.  When the Commission has concluded its examination, the matter will be referred to the Council and is unlikely to be decided before the next Council of Industry Ministers meeting in November.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has simultaneously decided to pursue the sale of shares in and control of Irish Steel, as it is recognised by the company and the Government that this is important to secure the long term future of the company.  The <Col N="1020" /> process is currently being pursued and in the event that a successful sale is agreed the level of State investment currently being sought by the company will be reviewed.</P>
    <P>Given the current uncertainty in relation to the level of State investment required and the future ownership of the company it is too early to make any statement on the rate of return anticipated from any loan or equity investment. In addition, the rate of return on any equity injection is dependent on conditions in the steel industry and the performance of the company.</P>

      <P>My Department has included provisions in the 1995 Estimates of sums to cover capital expenditure for two semi-State bodies viz. Teagasc and Bord Bia.</P>
      <P>1.  Teagasc</P>
      <P>An Exchequer grant of £500,000 has been provided in the 1995 Estimates for capital works to enable Teagasc to draw down EU Structural Funds.  The details of the range of research activities to be co-financed by the EU have yet to be clarified with the EU Commission.</P>
      <P>2.  Bord Bia</P>
      <P>An Exchequer grant of £150,000 is provided in the 1995 Estimates for office furniture and equipment.  Bord Bia will decide on the distribution of this allocation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 1995 Estimates provide for the payment of grant-in-aid of £6.7 million to the Irish Horseracing Authority and £3 million to Bord na gCon for the <Col N="1021" /> development of their respective industries. It is a matter for these bodies to decide on the allocation of these funds though it is likely that some of these funds will be used for capital purposes.</P>
    <P>The shares in the Irish National Stud Company Ltd. are held by the Minister for Finance.  It is anticipated that a further £500,000 worth of shares will be purchased before the end of the year as a capital injection for the acquisition of stallions.  In the medium term it is expected that this investment will help to return the stud to profitability.</P>
    <P>The grant-in-aid for general expenses out of the Department's Vote to An Bord Glas for 1995 is £1,575,000.  No provision has been made for capital expenditure.</P>
    <P>No provision has been made in 1995 for the granting of loans to semi-State bodies coming under my control.</P>
    <P>The details of both capital and current expenditure by semi-State bodies under the aegis of my Department are kept under close review by my Department to ensure that expenditure is deployed in a prudent and effective way.  However, given the range of expenditure which impacts on the operations of the semi-State bodies, it is not possible to quantify a return as requested by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>An application was received in January 1995 from the person concerned seeking licensing permission under the Foreshore and the Fisheries Acts to engage in the cultivation of oysters on trestles.</P>
      <P>Applications for licences to engage in shellfish farming are subject to evaluation by the Aquaculture Licence Vetting Committee, a multidisciplinary advisory body, which brings together relevant expertise from within the Department of the Marine and from the Central Fisheries Board.  Applications are assessed from all technical, scientific and other relevant perspectives to determine the suitability of proposals. This evaluation process is further informed by a public consultation process.</P>
      <P>The application raised by the Deputy is being progressed through this assessment/evaluation process.  The application proceeded to the public notice stage on 17 May last when notice of the development proposals was published in <i>The Kerryman</i> newspaper. Interested parties have 21 days from the date of publication in which to submit objections or representations in respect of the application.  All comments lodged on foot of this public notice process are rigorously assessed by the Department and inform the ultimate decision making process on licensing applications.  I would like to assure the Deputy that every effort is being made to process this application as expeditiously as possible.</P>
