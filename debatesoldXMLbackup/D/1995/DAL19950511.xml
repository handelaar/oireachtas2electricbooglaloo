      <P>It is proposed to take Items Nos. 4, 9, 10, 11 and 12. It is also proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that No. 4 shall be decided without debate and any division demanded thereon shall be taken forthwith.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the status of amendments to the Finance Bill, particularly those to section 153? Normally at this stage of the Finance Bill we know where we stand on amendments. Will the Taoiseach clarify the position and state whether he agrees with what Government backbenchers said yesterday that accountants and lawyers cannot be trusted?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Finance Bill is now in Committee and I understand that section 153 will be reached today. The Minister will take careful note of the points made on all sides. In light of the discussion he will be able to come forward with amendments and it is valuable that in framing such amendments <Col N="1482" /> he will be able to take the views expressed in the committee into account.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will make inquiries about that. I would be prejudiced in favour of giving any amount of time necessary subject to the constraints of parliamentary and statutory requirements.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the conflicting reports in the newspapers this morning as to the current position of section 153 of the Finance Bill, does the Taoiseach agree it would be wiser to scrap the section, ask the Minister to go back to the drawing board and bring forward appropriate proposals to deal with tax evaders?</P>

I asked if there was any role for Deputies who are not members of the committee and how we could effect changes to legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. E. Byrne Mr. E. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand Fianna Fáil Members are keenly interested in contributing to this debate. Before the debate adjourned last week I expressed concern that the arts plan seemed to put arbitrary concepts of excellence over the concept of access to the arts. It is interesting to note that last weekend's conference in Cork entitled The Regional Development of the Arts in Ireland examined this question in some detail. If the Minister has not read it already, he will find it interesting.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately for many people access to the arts, partly because of the costs involved, can prove difficult. The locations of artistic events are often concentrated in capital cities. Admittance charges and access costs to the venue for major cultural events can be expensive. I argue that access to the arts must be at the lowest possible level. We use the popular term in Europe called &ldquo;subsidiarity&rdquo;. Subsidiarity in the area of the arts must be put into practice. Undoubtedly we made some advances, for example, there are 21 regional art officers compared with one in 1985. The art plan places a welcome emphasis in regionalisation, which need not mean decentralisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I referred to the difficulty for people wishing to attend an artistic event held in the capital city and the costs involved. Regionalisation does not mean dissecting what is available in Dublin but instead two regional bases of the performing arts could be moved. Those of us who represent the capital city are <Col N="1492" /> aware that Dublin has been hard hit by decentralisation which has sucked jobs out of the capital has not provided better services to other areas.</P>
    <P>Under no circumstances should the Arts Council be moved out of Dublin. I would welcome an assurance from the Minister that no such move is being contemplated. Nevertheless there are still inequities in resourcing between different regions and within them. Even if our major urban centres continue to receive the lion's share of the funding &mdash; all the indications are that this will be the case &mdash; disadvantaged communities in these centres will continue to exist at the artistic margins. Until we draw those communities into the centre of artistic activity and democratise the practice of art we will continue to have restricted access.</P>
    <P>Despite the reservations and the assurances sought from the Minister about the location of the Arts Council the arts plan is largely a good one and it is backed by a singularly committed Minister. Unfortunately the best plans fall down on implementation. We are all aware of marvellous programmes and plans in every sphere of life, which are all wonderful documents in their own right, but the test of the steel of these documents is the commitment to implementation. I am sure the Minister will adopt a hands on approach in the implementation of the plan and ensure that each stage of its implementation involves local communities as well as the professionals.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of art is communication at the highest level between human beings and artistic and cultural activity should be part of everyday living. In recent years there has been a flourishing of the arts. People of all classes and creeds have become involved. Art has been brought out into the suburbs and into the heart of our communities, all have become involved and this is as it should be. The creativity and buoyancy demonstrates that our society and our culture are in a healthy frame of mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1493" /> The birth of this State was based on a cultural revival. Since then the Irish people generally have a full appreciation of the arts. Today we discuss how we can develop the arts. The Arts Plan 1995-1997, prepared by the Arts Council, is most welcome because it generates discussion and outlines where we need to go in the future. It is welcome also because it brings about a planned approach to the development of the arts. There is no doubt that in times past the development of the arts generally was done on an <i>ad hoc</i> and piecemeal basis. We need more planning to ensure the arts continue to play a central role in ordinary everyday life.</P>
    <P>There have been dynamic changes in contemporary Ireland, as the report states, and a growing sophistication in society generally. This is reflected in the arts. The report goes on to mention how our arts infrastructure has developed. It refers to the establishment of new theatres, arts centres and arts festivals generally. We have had the establishment of the Irish Museum of Modern Art, the National Concert Hall and many other cultural centres of excellence, all most welcome.</P>
    <P>Following the line pursued by Deputy Eric Byrne we need to ensure that art is for everyone, that it is brought out into the communities and that it becomes a part of everyday life for all our citizens. The key role will be played by the local authorities.</P>
    <P>Dublin Corporation publishes its own Dublin arts report. There was a general revival and an increase in awareness of our culture and heritage following the millennium celebrations in 1988. This was built on in 1991 with many initiatives when Dublin was European City of Culture. Buildings were restored and floodlit and positive support was given to the arts in the city. An arts officer was appointed and I understand other local authorities also appointed such an officer. Dublin Corporation introduced the very successful artist in residence <Col N="1494" /> scheme which involved making trained professional people from the various disciplines available to train, advise and generally encourage people to become involved in the arts.</P>
    <P>Our libraries have played an important role in developing the arts. They are situated in the centre of our communities and organise many events. I have been impressed on many occasions when I visited Coolock library to see the range of activities, cultural and artistic, taking place there and to see how people who have had no association with the arts in the past are becoming actively involved and their personalities transformed as a result. That is most welcome. If the Minister were to do only one thing to encourage the arts it should be to give the libraries every facility and support because that is how we will get arts to the people.</P>
    <P>The year 1997 will mark the centenary of the publication of the world famous gothic horror novel <i>Dracula</i> written by Bram Stoker who was born at 15 The Crescent, Clontarf. A number of suggestions have been advanced as to how we should commemorate this very important anniversary. Bram Stoker wrote 11 novels and a myriad of shorter fiction and non-fiction works and made a huge contribution to the promotion of drama in Ireland. Nevertheless, he has never been truly honoured here. His masterpiece, <i>Dracula</i>, has enjoyed huge sales throughout the world. Stoker's influence on the film world is almost incalculable. To date almost 700 films have been based on the novel <i>Dracula</i>&mdash; the whole world is Stoker's audience. There are Dracula and Stoker clubs, societies, museums and collections of memorabilia throughout the world. A number of commemorative events are being planned in Romania, including a world Dracula congress &mdash; they are obviously pursuing the Transylvania connection. An Post is also planning to issue a commemorative stamp. I make the parochial point that we should honour that centenary and I am sure the <Col N="1495" /> Minister has some ideas for commemorating that world famous novelist.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>How would it be if I went to Transylvania?</P>
      <P>On the role of the Office of Public Works, with which my party Leader dealt in his speech, I have the highest respect for the experience, professionalism and sensitivity of that concern. Its officials have done magnificent work here in recent years and have transformed our heritage by their restoration work. I regret that the Office of Public Works seems to be under attack from an elite group in Ireland today, and that brings me to the role of interpretative centres. I will put my cards on the table and say that I believe in their role in interpreting our heritage and in their secondary role of promoting tourism. I supported the Mullaghmore, Luggala and Boyne Valley interpretative centres. I recognise that there are people who do not support the concept of interpretative centres. However, I see many of the famous landmarks here as being accessible only to an elite, educated people associated with unversities and natives from other countries who choose to settle here. We need to have much wider participation by ordinary people and we must enable them to learn about our heritage landmarks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The decision on the interpretative centres was a mistake and a waste of public money. I have no doubt that many local people are extremely concerned about that because of the consequences for tourism and employment potential. I condemn the elitist approach to our heritage. Our culture and our heritage should be accessible to everybody, and interpretative centres are the way to do that. There are a number of successful interpretative centres in the country. I am familiar with the one in Dunquin in west Kerry and I understand there is another very successful one at the Céide Fields in <Col N="1496" /> County Mayo. It may be that <i>The Irish Times</i> was too late in discovering that work on these centres had commenced and was not in a position to organise a coherent campaign objecting to them. Unfortunately, some interpretative centres did come to the notice of <i>The Irish Times</i> sooner rather than later. We need to encourage the building of interpretative centres because it is a mistake to have people roaming around major centres of cultural interest with no concept of what they are seeing. People need to be guided and to hear explanations of what they are viewing.</P>
    <P>The Temple Bar area was dealt with in detail in the report. Again, I may strike a note of bitterness here. I believe totally in the Temple Bar project but people are beginning to criticise it and generally run it down. This project was in preparation for many years but the political decisions were taken between 1989 and 1991. I wish to pay tribute in particular to Temple Bar Properties and the managing director of that organisation, Laura McGahey. Were it not for her the Temple Bar project would never have seen the light of day. She passionately believed in bringing about a centre of excellence and of cultural activity in the Temple Bar area. She lobbied the corporation, the Lord Mayor, the Taoiseach and various Ministers and was successful in having political action taken. Legislation was passed to ensure that the Temple Bar project proceeded. Many groups campaign for the introduction of legislation, without success, but in this case when the Government was lobbied legislation was introduced within a matter of months.</P>
    <P>If it had not been for the efforts of Nora McGahey and the fact that enlightened political decisions were made at the time Temple Bar would still be the location of a bus station and would never have been the successful centre of arts and culture it is today. However, it is now being attacked by the begrudgers who argue that we have lost our way. If one does anything in this country one will be criticised; if we had <Col N="1497" /> listened to all the objectors at the beginning nothing would have been done. I pay tribute to all those involved in providing the new facilities in Temple Bar. If there are legitimate complaints about the way the scheme is being operated they should be examined but blind negativity should not be tolerated. I hope that today's political leaders will not fall into that trap.</P>
    <P>I wish to raise the issue of place names. There is growing concern that Irish place names are not being used in private and local authority residential developments, that English place names are being used. Aulden Grange, Clare Hall and Swords Manor in my constituency are not of Irish origin, they would be associated more with Tudor England. We need to address this problem seriously. It is possibly a matter for the Department of the Environment to ensure that the local authorities play an active role but I suggest that the Folklore Commission and the Place Names Commission also have a major role to play in this regard. I hope that a mechanism can be put in place to allow this to happen.</P>
    <P>I received a note from a constituent in which the situation in Galway is outlined. In Galway when planning permission is sought contact is made with the planners and when the builder becomes involved he is approached by the committee which usually provides a list of ten names from which the builder can make his choice. The unused names are entered into a data bank which can be offered to another person building in the area. The list of names is usually sanctioned in advance by An Post and the corporation representative or by a meeting of the corporation. This system seems to be working effectively in Galway. It is crucial that a mechanism is put in place to ensure that Irish place names continue to be used.</P>
    <P>I wish to raise the issue of education which is dealt with in the arts report. It is a matter of great regret that school children, at primary and secondary level, are not familiar with the culture <Col N="1498" /> and heritage of their own locality. Perhaps the Minister for Education will tell me if this is changing but it seems that school children will not be taught anything about the places and centres of artistic interest in their locality. On our way to Leinster House every day we pass many unique features about which we know nothing. There is a need to increase the level of awareness of our culture, to ensure that the first interest in the arts in general is shown at parish level and that interest is fostered in local heritage and historical features. The schools have a major role to play in this regard.</P>
    <P>The report states that there should be a big celebration and a review in the year 2000 to see how the plan is being implemented and where we should go from there. That would be a welcome move.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. S. Ryan Mr. S. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have this opportunity to make a small contribution to the debate on the arts plan 1995-97. I compliment the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Higgins, for initiating this important plan and securing the support of the Government to publish it, and the hundreds of organisations and individuals who took the time to make a submission. The positive media and public response to date vindicates the Minister's decision and the stance taken by the Government in establishing a special Ministry for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht with a Minister at the Cabinet table.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The findings of the report show that the arts, in their broadest sense, are seen in a positive way by the public. Attendances at arts events jumped from 60 per cent in 1981 to 78 per cent in 1994. Nearly 90 per cent of the population agree that arts activities help to attract tourists to our shores. The findings also show that the public are aware of the potential of the arts sector to create additional employment. It should be noted that at present 21,500 are employed directly in this sector. On the <Col N="1499" /> basis of this report it has the potential to create further growth.</P>
    <P>These are some of the statistics which outline the potential of the arts. They also confirm the view which has existed for some time that the arts need to be put on a more sound footing in terms of a defined strategy and structure, coordinated approach and adequate funding.</P>
    <P>The local authorities have a pivotal role to play in the development of the arts throughout the country. I was flabbergasted to read that at the time of the preparation of the plan 12 local authorities had still to appoint an arts officer. This is unacceptable. Who is responsible for this? I hope the answer is not local public representatives. If any county manager is standing in the way of the development of the arts these tactics should be highlighted and the people concerned removed from office as soon as possible. That is an indication of how strongly I feel about this issue.</P>
    <P>This brings me back to the fundamental question of the funding of local authorities. During the years this has been a political hot potato. It must be addressed, particularly if we intend to finance the development of the arts in the respective local authorities. I accept that funding will be made available by the Arts Council as a result of this plan but matching funding will also be required.</P>
    <P>I am pleased the Minister for the Environment has set up a commission to report on local authority funding. I appeal to all interested groups &mdash; everybody is involved to some extent in the services provided by local authorities &mdash; to make a submission on this important issue. Given that all of us in this House, particularly Deputies with a dual mandate, are clearly aware of the under-funding of local government, it is vital to take this issue seriously. I appeal to the Opposition not to play party politics with this matter because there is too much at stake.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1500" /> I wish to refer to the arts as they relate to young people. During the period of the plan the Arts Council proposes to more than double spending on education of young people and children, from 6 per cent to 15 per cent. This is one of the most positive features of the plan and must be commended, particularly as more than 45 per cent of the population is under 25. In my local authority area of Fingal, 32 per cent of the population are under 15 years of age. This is a startling and challenging statistic. To a certain extent I share the view that the Arts Council has not acknowledged or responded adequately to the needs of the greater Dublin area, particularly the three new council areas of Fingal, South Dublin and Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown where almost 570,000 people live.</P>
    <P>It should be noted that one-third of the country's population live in the greater Dublin area. The people in this area are still endeavouring to come to terms with the implications of the crazy planning decisions taken in the 1970s, which resulted in some people being moved from the inner city to green field environments in County Dublin, areas with no infrastructure, no shops or schools and above all no jobs. Thousands of young people have been brought up in an environment of unemployment with a lack of recreational facilities. In such circumstances can anyone blame people for believing that arts and culture are the prerogative of a certain social class? It is very difficult for arts officers and community activists to push the concept of culture and that daunting challenge must be addressed. I acknowledge, however, that great progress has been made in this area.</P>
    <P>The plan confirms that the Arts Council will continue to co-operate with FÁS to maximise the potential of their considerable investment in the arts sector through the development of pilot arts training projects, in-service training and work experience in the arts. The arts squads which were originally operated under the social employment <Col N="1501" /> scheme &mdash; and recently under the community employment scheme &mdash; are of immense benefit in terms of arts awareness within the community. The squads endeavour to promote and develop an awareness of the arts among community groups, youth clubs, drama groups, schools and people with disabilities, through workshops, classes, guidance and support in many artistic disciplines. This concept has been very successful to date for the community as well as artists who enhance their future employment prospects by building on their skill base. Many people in the community are brought into contact with arts for the first time in this way.</P>
    <P>In the proposed partnership arrangements there should be much closer liaison between the Arts Council, FÁS and the various sponsors such as local authorities. It is vital to explore ways in which similar programmes can overcome the structured limitations of the community employment scheme, contribute to long term community arts development and secure employment for artists. I am very concerned at the difficulties experienced in recruitment and the extension of the community employment scheme, the cornerstone of the arts squad programme. The summer period is critical for local communities and the arts squads. Plans are put in place and preparations made for festivals, community projects and other activities and if these have to be cancelled there will be much bitterness and disappointment in communities, many of which are areas of disadvantage. Will the Minister intervene to ensure none of these schemes is put at risk as a consequence of lack of funding?</P>
    <P>I am pleased the Arts Council in its three year plan proposes to redefine and broaden its involvement in music of all kinds. I welcome the increase in allocation for music from £800,000 to £1,800,000 in 1997. I hope this will facilitate consolidation and development of community based bands &mdash; brass, reed, pipe or marching bands &mdash; which are very important to communities and the establishment of new bands, particularly <Col N="1502" /> in the new development areas. In my constituency of Dublin North there is a great tradition in music and some bands have been established for almost 100 years. From ongoing contact with organisations I can identify a number of specific needs such as assistance in training, purchase of instruments and uniforms and availability of venues for rehearsing.</P>
    <P>The replacement of items is very costly &mdash; for example, the cost of a replacement uniform for a pipe band is in the region of £350. This puts an intolerable burden on organisations as well as on parents of the children involved. Funding of such activity has not been available in the past from the national lottery. I ask the Minister to bring these issues to the attention of the Arts Council. I hope decisions on applications for funding will be devolved from the Arts Council to the proposed partnership structures.</P>
    <P>I wish to comment briefly on the recommendations of the Price Water-house report, the efficiency audit group on the Defence Forces, on proposed cutbacks in the Army School of Music and Army bands. At present there are four bands in the Army with approximately 190 full-time musicians. Throughout the years Army bands have been great ambassadors for the Army and have brought music to people in villages and towns. The EAG report recommends that the number of musicians in the Army should be reduced to 40, effectively, one band. Those recommendations are unacceptable and must be rejected by the Government.</P>
    <P>Last year when I was cathaoirleach of Fingal County Council it decided to invite Patrick Mason and the Abbey Players to perform in the local halls throughout that part of the county. The response from the community was encouraging and, hopefully, that type of activity can be developed bringing the theatre and the arts to the people.</P>
    <P>There was a reference to the role of public libraries in the arts programme. I commend what has been achieved to <Col N="1503" /> date in that area in terms of permanent and mobile libraries throughout the country. I hope that money can be made available in the context of this plan to aprove an application for a permanent library service in Skerries which has been on the table for ten years given the size of the area and the need for that facility.</P>
    <P>Regarding the capital programme under the plan, I wish to refer to two projects. The new county council areas around Dublin have not been adequately catered for. I ask the Minister and the Arts Council to consider favourably a grant application for the restoraton of St. Maur's Church in my constituency. Great controversy surrounded that project some years ago, but the local people got together and carried out restoration work. That building could be used as a regional cultural auditorium for the Fingal area, as an arts centre to develop arts in the region and for concerts, recitals, choral evenings and musicals. I hope the Arts Council will consider allocating funding for that facility. A request has been made from Portmarnock community school for financial support for the provision of a theatre to specifically develop the concept of arts and culture in the north Dublin region. I also ask the Minister to consider that request.</P>
    <P>Most of us, as public representatives, will have received a letter from the National Association of Youth Drama, an umbrella body representing a large proportion of organisations, groups and individuals who use drama and theatre as a means of working with young people. That association has asked us to refer to a number of points, to support the overall thrust of the arts plan which is to improve access to and participation in the arts; to continue the process of developing the arts infrastructure at a regional level and to argue that the increase in funding for educating young people is critical. It acknowledges that commitment in the plan and asks us to support the development of the cultural health of the nation. Most of what it <Col N="1504" /> asked us to refer to is contained in the plan and I hope all Deputies will support it. The plan is a great start and the commitments in it must be met. It is all very well to have a fine plan that looks very well on paper, but decisions have to be taken to carry through on the commitments in it.</P>
    <P>People are looking to the Minister and the Government to ensure that the commitments contained in the plan are implemented. The Minister has my confidence in that regard and I look forward to the provision of the plan being implemented.</P>

      <P>I welcome many aspects of this new three years arts plan and I hope it will be successful in the long term. I hope it will generate more interest and that many new projects will be developed as a result. Tourism is an important national revenue earner and this plan and the arts have a major role to play in that area. In the past the arts were deemed to be only for the elite and access to them was limited. The arts are now identified as a major money earner for national revenue and can be a great employer also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I listened to the Minister's opening speech in the Dáil last week, I may have misheard him, but I was surprised to hear him say that the previous Government had neglected the arts. His party was part of that Government and those remarks are not justified. At one stage during the Minister's speech I was going to interrupt to tell him that he should not praise his plan too much because self-praise is no praise. One would think nothing had been done for the arts until the Minister and his Fine Gael partners came into Government. I remember the former Taoiseach, Charles J. Haughey, being bitterly criticised by the then Opposition when he took the initiative to refurbish Government Buildings because of the cost involved. He also introduced tax concessions for writers and artists living and working in Ireland. The Minister has been most unkind to Fianna Fáil, I do not know whether that was intentional, but I am inclined to <Col N="1505" /> think it was although I may be biased being a Fianna Fáil Deputy. That was my interpretation of the Minister's attitude when he gave his address. It was as if all credit was due to him and to nobody else. I do not know whether he purposely decided not to acknolwedge the role played by Fianna Fáil in the arts in the past.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to see the Minister return. No doubt he will hear of my recent comments. I was somewhat disappointed with his opening remarks, when I got the impression no one else here ever did anything for arts until the Minister appeared out of the blue, that arts and the Minister are ascending on a booster rocket to the moon and that Fianna Fáil had not bothered with the arts in the past.</P>

      <P>The Arts Council must adopt a radical approach to arts in general. We do not know how many modifications were made to the original plan which was ready for publication last summer. Means should be devised for displaying individuals' arts and crafts at convenient centres nationwide if possible for purchase. There is insufficient Government encouragement for such endeavours.</P>
      <P>Some European Union regulations now in force prohibit the display of certain goods unless they comply with specified hygiene requirements, something the Minister should investigate since most of our arts and culture is located in rural areas. While I know our towns and cities also have their culture, it is somewhat different and there is a wealth of arts, culture, music and song to be found in rural areas. Libraries and other community centres should be availed of to promote arts activities which would be of enormous benefit to many.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware that theatre generally is experiencing enormous difficulty in promoting various productions, because of <Col N="1506" /> high costs. In addition, RTE does not appear to be interested in commissioning or purchasing more plays for public viewing. I, my wife and family visit the theatre from time to time and we have been privileged to have attended some outstanding live performances, whether at our national theatre or local parish hall. It is heartening to witness full houses while there are so many other competing distractions, such as television. I want to see business people generally take a greater interest in the theatre, local drama and variety shows. I appreciate the generosity of some business people who should receive some tax concessions for supporting cultural activities, particularly in rural areas, thereby encouraging greater investment in artistic activities. While acknowledging the financial support theatre already receives through grant aid another means of encouraging participation in the arts would be to furnish free passes to performances to employees of business people.</P>
    <P>Most young people are enormously interested in music, many in Irish music. Therefore, I welcome the Arts Council's proposal to grant awards to composers and to provide composer apprenticeships. The Government must also encourage students of music through scholarships.</P>
    <P>There is a huge market for the arts beyond Ireland. Since we have excellent accommodation services, we should invite artists from the United Kingdom and the Continent to Ireland, offering them attractive packages and incentives. Many of our people who attend theatre performances and other shows in the United Kingdom are facilitated in so doing, whereas we do not have corresponding facilities. In that respect I should like to see Bord Fáilte and others highlight drama, music and song events and performances here. Much emphasis is being placed on sporting activities, such as golf and other sports, by Bord Fáilte but not sufficient emphasis is being placed on arts. The Minister should put that point forcibly to Bord <Col N="1507" /> Fáilte and provide the necessary financial support.</P>
    <P>Film production is one of the most important aspects of the arts having much potential for employment and export sales. We are doing very well in this sphere at present, with rural regions being fully supported. I welcome the recommendation of the Arts Council to support the Cork and Galway film festivals along with resource centres in Waterford and Galway. There have been many very talented, successful Irish actors and actresses and successful films. Greater emphasis should be placed on this sector in the future. Indeed the Minister is to be complimented on this sphere having assumed greater importance in the latter part of 1994. I wish film production much success for the remainder of 1995 and future years.</P>
    <P>I understand also that the Arts Council is engaging in a review of the activities and operations of various arts centres nationwide, of which there are 14. Arts centres should be extended to disadvantaged areas. The Minister, coming from Galway, will readily appreciate the existence of a wealth of arts, culture and music in rural areas. I hope this plan will not concentrate on a few growth centres, which appears to be the case. I note the Minister has nodded his head negatively which I assume is an indication that the plan will apply throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the agreement reached between the Arts Council and the Combat Poverty Agency to establish working groups to provide greater access to the arts for the 20 to 30 per cent of our population classified as disadvantaged. The Arts Council is seeking £26 million annually up to the end of the century to achieve its goals outlined in this plan. Its allocation amounted to £13.2 million in 1994 and £16.25 million in 1995. I earnestly hope the Government and the Minister will be able to meet the financial requirements of the Arts Council during the operation of this plan.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1508" /> I have been disappointed that there has been no recognition of Gaeltacht Rath Cairn, Contae na Mí &mdash; which could be developed into a major Irish arts centre &mdash; and it appears that the Arts Council and the Minister place no importance on its potential as a venue. Will the Minister take particular note of the need for its development? As many people visit Gaeltacht Rath Cairn each year, the Minister should give serious consideration to providing, at the minimum, a television studio to record interviews and so on for viewing on the proposed Teilifís na Gaeltachta. Many Irish speaking people visit Rath Cairn which is a major promotional centre for our native language. It is crucial that this centre be clearly identified or aligned with Teilifís na Gaeltachta so that interviews held there can be broadcast on that channel.</P>
    <P>While regional development of the arts is welcome rather than the Minister deciding which regions should qualify, he should allow local interests decide whether their respective regions should or should not be chosen and which sector of the arts it seeks to develop. That is another reason for strongly recommending the development of Gaeltacht Rath Cairn, given its enormous interest in the overall development of the arts, warranting positive support.</P>
    <P>There was much disappointment among the arts community generally when the Government in its Estimates decided to grant an increase of 7 per cent only to the Arts Council although granting an overall increase of 20 per cent within the relevant departmental Estimate. I have every confidence the Minister will correct this position and that the necessary funding will be made available to the Arts Council to carry out its programme over the next three years. It is important this matter is clarified sooner rather than later; otherwise, the three year plan could become a farce.</P>
    <P>Meath is an historical and archaeological county and has much to offer people at home and abroad. I am surprised, therefore, it was not mentioned <Col N="1509" /> in the three year arts plan. The county is only a short distance from Dublin city and Belfast. It is adjacent to Dublin ports and airports and should be a material base for arts development. I wish the Boyne Valley Interpretative Centre every success in the future as it is the foundation stone of the future success of tourism in County Meath.</P>
    <P>Meath County Council has initiated proposals for a major tourism plan for County Meath. I want the Minister to note the limited funding that is made available to local authorities, especially in County Meath, to create a better living standard for their people. We in County Meath cannot achieve our targets without proper Government financial support. There are many tourist attractions in the county, such as the Hill of Slane, the Hill of Tara from where the High Kings of Ireland came, Bective Abbey, St. John's Castle in Trim, the ancient sites at Clonard, Old-castle and Nobber, the Cross of Kells and many more. I want the Minister to identify County Meath as a special place of arts, culture and tourism, something he has not done in this report. In placing more emphasis on developing the Battle of the Boyne site we could achieve greater peace and friendship with our neighbours in the North. Those trying to develop that site, half way between Dublin and Belfast, should be given more assistance by the Minister.</P>
    <P>Our art and treasure collections should be exhibited around the country as many people cannot afford to travel to Dublin to view them. This would certainly benefit our young people and the Arts Council shall place more emphasis on this. Consideration should be given to moving the Book of Kells back to its roots and, while I have made requests in this regard, I understand the difficulties and cost involved in preserving the book. However, there are many other objects of art and culture that could be exhibited in rural areas.</P>
    <P>Scurlogstown cultural group in County Meath is an excellent voluntary team of local people who are prepared to give their time freely to produce <Col N="1510" /> pageants showing how people lived here in the past. They take part in St. Patrick's Day parades and so on in their local area. Such groups should be given more support and attention.</P>
    <P>I have studied the work of the Arts Council to date and wish it continued success as it has a major responsibility in making a success of the arts. The Minister should encourage our people, young and old, to identify our art qualities and to achieve their goals. I hope the Minister will then provide the necessary funding for the success of their ideas and projects.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DeclanBree" hpid="Mr. Bree Mr. Bree">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bree</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to participate in this debate on the arts plan. I pay tribute to my colleague, the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Higgins, who, since he was first elected to Dáil Éireann has campaigned for a planned strategic approach to the development of the arts.</P>
      <P>The Minister and the Labour Party made this one of our main priorities when we commenced negotiations following the general election of November 1992 and we were successful in ensuring that a commitment to such a development was included in the Programme for a Partnership Government. That programme stated:</P>
      <P>In order to ensure the fullest development of our cultural life, and to untap the potential that exists in abundance throughout Ireland, the Arts Council will be asked to operate on a co-ordinated 3-yearly plan for funding of the arts. As part of that planning, there will be a requirement for improved co-ordination between capital expenditure (e.g. national lottery) and arrangements for the current funding of arts projects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following his appointment as Ireland's first Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Higgins requested the Arts Council to draw up such a plan. <Col N="1511" /> The commitment of the former partnership Government was further consolidated in the programme, <i>A Government of Renewal,</i> and recognition was given to the many advances in the arts which were made during the Minister's first two year term in the partnership Government. The previous speaker obviously misinterpreted his original submission in this regard.</P>
    <P>The new Programme for Government states:</P>
    <P>The momentum achieved in the cultural sector over the past two years will be continued. It is now accepted that support and encouragement for the contemporary arts and the protection of our natural and built heritage are central issues of social and economic significance.</P>
    <P>The Three Year Plan 1995-97 prepared in consultation between the Arts Council and the Dept of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht will be the basis for a programme of action.</P>
    <P>In essence, the political decision to establish a Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht and the decision to appoint a Minister to speak for the area as a full member of Cabinet recognised the importance of arts, culture and the Gaeltacht and the Irish language and heritage as fundamental parts of our life. Those areas were also recognised as an integral part of the policy strategies necessary to create jobs for Irish people.</P>
    <P>The appointment of a socialist of the calibre of the Minister, Deputy Higgins, as the first Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht has revolutionised his whole approach to this area. His passionate and energetic commitment to the arts, to culture and to Gaelic Ireland is universally recognised and admired.</P>
    <P>When he opened this debate, the Minister clearly emphasised that the arts plan was not formulated in an exclusive, elitist or insular manner. He pointed out that the Arts Council drew from the views of a broad cross section of society and, in that light, the plan can <Col N="1512" /> be viewed as a comprehensive evaluation of the arts and their requirements for now and the future.</P>
    <P>All of us are aware of the widespread public consultation undertaken by the Arts Council and its detailed discussions with the Minister's Department in the preparation of the plan. As a starting point, the Arts Council's initial statement of intent correctly pointed out that everyone has an entitlement to meaningful access to and participation in the arts. I have no doubt that as this plan is implemented over the next three years it will assist in encouraging real participation in the arts in terms of availability and access, with particular reference to young people, children and the disabled. It will also take into account social as well as geographical barriers.</P>
    <P>In preparing the plan the Arts Council, as a starting point, took a broad vision for the arts in Ireland. Through its process of consultation and research the council was in a position to confirm that the arts are regarded positively and are considered important, not simply in isolation but in comparison with other set values with which they are juxtaposed or against which they have to compete for funding. It found that 73 per cent of people agree that arts education is as important as science education and that 66 per cent feel as much importance should be attached to providing arts amenities as is given to providing sports amenities.</P>
    <P>It found that there was an overall increase in attendance at arts events from 60 per cent of the population in 1981 to 78 per cent in 1994. It is important to point out that it also found that 74 per cent feel that the lack of arts education at school is a significant obstacle to developing an interest in the arts. With this type of positive support for the arts among the general public, the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht and the Arts Council were in a position to begin preparing for the drafting of a detailed and realistic arts plan that would embrace the needs of the people and that would seek to <Col N="1513" /> address the many years of neglect of the arts by successive Governments.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the plan suggests an area based approach to the development of the arts, committing the Arts Council to the creation of centres of energy and excellence at local, regional and national level. This approach fits in with the Department's own policy priorities. It will help take account of the organic nature of arts activity and will seek to build on it through strategic partnerships in association with national and local planning agencies.</P>
    <P>The proposed establishment of five strategic centres of population in the plan, which includes Cork, Limerick, Galway, Waterford and my native Sligo, to counterbalance the highly centralised Irish administration system and in pursuit of equity of provision is most welcome.</P>
    <P>The establishment of priority zones, which include County Leitrim in my constituency, is also most welcome. County Leitrim, and the other counties designated as priority zones, have already been identified as areas being in particular need and lacking in provision. While County Leitrim has a thriving local theatre in Carrigallen &mdash; the Corn Mill Theatre &mdash; and an ever growing arts community, there is no doubt but that investment and planning is required in the county for further development. Investment in priority zones will allow for a planned and integrated scheme of new development, arts programmes and the co-ordination and focusing of Arts Council schemes and projects in education and community arts as well as arts form events and programmes available nationally. It will also allow for prioritisation with arts development organisations in each arts form, such as Music Network, CAFE, Poetry Ireland, etc. to focus resources, where possible, on the priority counties.</P>
    <P>The provision of additional arts officers and arts education organisers and the further development of small locally based community arts projects and artists in residence schemes in such <Col N="1514" /> areas will help to address the imbalance. An area based approach to planning is one in which the needs of a given area are addressed by developing integrated policies and services across all sectors. Availing of the cluster of diverse organisations in a given geographical area, it will seek to maximise benefits through a planned co-operative approach, combining elements of bottom-up and top-down activity and open to opportunity in the wider social context.</P>
    <P>Recent research commissioned by the Arts Council strongly supports the case for local arts provision. It is worth noting, for instance, the 54 per cent of the population rarely travel more than 20 miles to an arts event. Local arts weeks figure quite importantly on the scale of attendance at arts activities. A total of 71 per cent of people indicated that they learned about arts events from local press, radio and newsletters, making this by far the most important source of information. When asked to rate priorities for spending on the arts, the public placed their strongest emphasis on the need to support local, amateur and community based activity.</P>
    <P>It should be noted that an area based approach is not new to the Arts Council, which has already directed schemes and programmes at local, county and regional levels. However, it is obvious from the content of the document that during the course of the plan, the council will develop a more deliberate and concerted approach to action in this area with an emphasis on planning in consort with other statutory agencies, based on improved information and research and a particular focus on initiatives which offer appropriate strategic support to the development of local amateur and community based activity.</P>
    <P>It is patently obvious that an area based approach can only be enacted through partnerships with local authorities and other bodies, and through interlinked policies in community arts, arts centres and arts festivals. The fact that the Arts Council has already <Col N="1515" /> requested each local authority to prepare a three year arts development plan, and, indeed, has indicated that it will assist local authorities to produce such a plan, is most welcome. The document clearly points out that formal funding for such partnerships will be negotiated on the basis of the county arts plans, each of which will be expected to provide details on the needs of the arts at county and sub-county levels. The Arts plan anticipates that, where appropriate, the transfer of certain functions, including funds for the funding of festivals and local community arts groups, from the Arts Council to local authorities, will be part of these formal agreements. In addition, the Arts Council will assist those local authorities wishing to support the individual artist.</P>
    <P>Obviously, to trigger arts development, the Arts Council will initially focus on an area based approach in the counties in the priority zone which rightly include counties Leitrim, Roscommon, Longford, Donegal and other counties in the midlands. The development of arts centres, of which there are now 14, will also be important in implementing the plan. The distinguished characteristic of arts centres is that they offer a range of services across a multiplicity of art forms. Such centres can be described as buildings where different art forms coexist, each centre providing a point of access to local, national and international arts; support for the development of art and artists and opportunities for participation and education in the arts.</P>
    <P>Arts centres have developed defining characteristics according to the stage of development they have reached. While all the arts centres have suffered from under-resourcing, each centre has, nevertheless, developed its own individual ethos within this multi-disciplinary framework.</P>
    <P>I am aware the Arts Council has pursued an active policy to develop arts centres around the country to provide such services on a nationwide basis, and while the long established centres such <Col N="1516" /> as the Project in Dublin are very well developed, it will also be recognised that newer arts centres have been established in response to the needs of particular arts constituencies including the Droichead Arts Centre in Drogheda, the West Cork Arts Centre in Skibbereen and, of course, the Model Arts Centre in Sligo. I take this opportunity to pay tribute to those involved in the Sligo centre and, indeed, to support their submission for Structural Funds for the purchase and refurbishment of the building they are currently using, which is the former Model School in Sligo.</P>
    <P>The Model School is the best opportunity that Sligo will ever have of developing a major artistic and cultural centre. When the Arts Centre Committee took it over three years ago, it was deteriorating rapidly. This deterioration has been halted and the redecoration and constant and varied use has shown the potential of the building. Its internal layout makes it ideal for use as an art gallery. It is capable of housing the largest touring exhibitions in addition to being able to show at the one time a number of smaller exhibitions. The floor area of the different rooms make the building very suitable for both large and small literary readings, music recitals, lectures, workshops, etc. In addition, four artists have studio space in the building.</P>
    <P>As part of its ongoing development as a regional arts centre, the Model Arts Centre has also embarked on a series of Outreach programmes with the assistance of the Arts Council. The centre's policy is to show contemporary work in all art forms and to encourage the arts at local level. Its aim is to make the Model Arts Centre a thriving creative nucleus for locals and tourists alike. During the past few years there have been readings in the centre by writers and poets from Ireland and abroad such as Dermot Healy, Evelyn Conlon, Colm Toibín. Brian Leydon, Rita Ann Higgins, Padraig Fiaic, Tom Morgan, Paul Durcan. Nuala Ní Dhomnaill, John Kavanagh, Macdara Woods. Individual musicians and groups from at home and <Col N="1517" /> abroad have performed in the centre and the works of artists and sculptors, including Michael Farrell, Paki Smith, Michael Mulcahy, John Behan, Bill Woodrow, Barrie Cooke and Charlie Tyrrell have been exhibited.</P>
    <P>The Sligo Model Arts Centre is one of the most outstanding of its kind in Ireland. With a vibrant committee and a thriving arts community supporting it, I have every confidence that it will further grow and develop as a flagship of excellence. However, such centres must have security of funding and commitment for fixed periods as their continued reliance on FÁS community employment schemes is unacceptable. Therefore, I welcome the provisions in the Arts Plan for additional funding for the regions. I thank the Arts Council for its continued support for so many projects in my constituency of Sligo-Leitrim. The funding for the Model Arts Centre, the Blue Raincoat Theatre Company, the Sligo Community Arts Festival and many touring exhibitions is very much appreciated. Hardly a week goes by without an exhibition of painting or sculpture opening in Sligo in the Model Arts Centre, the Sligo Arts Gallery, the Taylor Gallery or the Municipal Gallery. The visual arts are appreciated in the north west region.</P>
    <P>Sligo is second to none for traditional music and is the birthplace of many of the greats in that music. Our native music, song and dance is thriving thanks to the magnificent work carried out in the area by Comhaltas Ceoiltoirí Éireann. It is worth noting that Sligo acted as host to Fleadh Cheoil na hÉireann for three successive years in the past decade and no doubt we will see a return of that major cultural festival to Sligo in the not too distant future. We can hardly talk about the development of arts and culture without referring to the local feiseanna. Feis Cheoil and Feis Shligigh are institutions in Sligo and the north west and have helped ensure that generation after generation have grown up with a healthy attitude towards the arts and our heritage.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1518" /> I paid tribute to the Arts Council for its assistance to many groups and individuals in the community but I feel obliged to question some of its actions. The Sligo International Choral Festival commenced in 1988 with ten or 12 choirs participating and with small audiences and minimal prizes. Last year 40 choirs participated in the Sligo International Choral Festival, eight from overseas, and is now recognised as the second largest choral festival in the country. Yet, the Arts Council has consistently refused to assist it with funding whereas it funds a choral festival in the south. I understand that the Arts Council is in the process of changing its policy in that regard, which is welcome. However, I appeal to the Arts Council to review its decision on funding for the Sligo Choral Festival this year to allow grant-aid to be provided for the choral festival this year when Sligo celebrates the 750th anniversary of its founding. Criticism must be levelled at the Arts Council also for its failure to adhere to its commitment to provide grant aid of £175,000 for the refurbishment of the Hawks Well Theatre in Sligo.</P>
    <P>When the major refurbishment and extension project for the Hawks Well Theatre was under threat earlier this year, the Minister, Deputy Higgins, came to the rescue with INTERREG funding of £344,000. I place on record my thanks and the thanks of the people of my constituency to the Minister for his support and assistance in this matter. The INTERREG grant was provided on the basis of other funding agencies putting up separate allocations. The Department of Tourism and Trade, Bord Fáilte, the Regional Tourism Organisation, IFI and the Arts Council were also committed to providing funding. It was with dismay that we in Sligo learned last week that the Arts Council had cut its proposed grant-aid of £175,000 to £100,000. This could well lead to a further delay in construction work commencing on site. I appeal to the Arts Council to reconsider its <Col N="1519" /> decision and stand by its earlier commitment to provide £175,000 for the project.</P>
    <P>The Hawks Well Theatre is the jewel in the crown of the arts community in the north west. In saying that I pay tribute also to all involved in the development of the Factory Performing Space in Sligo, a centre with which the Minister is also familiar. The Arts Council has been more than generous with its ongoing funding of the Hawks Well Theatre over the years. I fully recognise that without the ongoing subsidies from the Arts Council, the theatre could not have survived. It is indeed unfortunate that this recent incident has marred the relationship but, with good will, I am hopeful a resolution will be found.</P>
    <P>I have drifted from the substantive matter but I welcome the plan and pay tribute to all involved in developing it. It marks a significant breakthrough in the way in which the State proposes to address its responsibilities to the promotion of the contemporary arts and I have every confidence that Cabinet members will lend it their full support when it comes before them for consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamLawlor" hpid="Mr. Lawlor Mr. Lawlor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lawlor</NameTxt>
      <P>All members welcome the publication of the Arts Plan 1995-97. This comprehensive document signposts the many challenges and opportunities in the arts sector. The original plan entitled A Vision for Arts, by the then chairman for the Arts Council did not materialise as originally intended and this palan surfaced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am concerned about the identification of areas with specific activities under the overall umbrella of the arts. Will local areas of excellence, as proposed in this plan, not create a great difficulty for areas other than the designated areas which have the potential for excellence? There is the possibility of creating a number of problems as well as endeavouring to foster excellence in various sectors. I believe this measure has the potential to deny areas that are not designated locations of excellence <Col N="1520" /> from developing their expertise in other areas of endeavour. Perhaps the Minister will address this issue when summing up.</P>
    <P>One tends to call on practical experience when discussing subjects such as the Arts Plan. During the past few minutes Members expressed their frustration that groups involved in the arts in there area face a financial crisis. An excellent report, the Dublin Arts report was produced in conjunction with the millennium. It was funded and supported by the local authority and it devised an action plan for what was needed in the greater Dublin area. It is an indictment of those responsible for the arts, the Arts Council and the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht that some of its major recommendations have not been acted on.</P>
    <P>The once off funding from Europe will allow us put infrastructure in place. The report states that the population of County Dublin is nearly one sixth that of the country. If one relates that to investment and support at local authority level and the implementation of a realistic arts programme one will see there is an unequal distribution of resources.</P>
    <P>A protest against the disastrous shortfall in the FÁS scheme is being made in Ballyfermot today. The theory and the reality are vastly different. In 1992 £10.1 million was allocated for the arts and as a result of the Henley studies in the 90s the Ministry which the Minister now holds at Cabinet was identified as a high priority. For several years various Taoisigh held responsibility for the arts but it is now focused in a ministry which the then Government created. We must use wisely the resources being given on a once off basis and not scatter them too thinly. Prague and other European capitals will probably benefit from such resources from here on.</P>
    <P>The Arts Council reviewed the operation of the 14 arts centres. The Project Arts Centre in Dublin set up in 1967 has not been properly funded although it is a cornerstone of endeavour and effort.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1521" /> Existing organisations must be supported. There are many arts, drama, film, music and dance groups. We must encourage the holding of festivals and programmes for young people. We must ensure that the arts are not elitist but are available to everyone. In satellite towns such as Tallaght, Clondalkin, Lucan and Blanchardstown infrastructure and facilities are limited. If the Minister wishes to make a quantum leap forward in that area he must address that aspect.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's announcement regarding the music industry. Given our small population the number of talented people is to be applauded. I welcome the recent appointment of the group to look at the industry.</P>
    <P>We must present the new emerging Ireland in such a way as to make it attractive to tourists coming from North America, from mainland Europe and the UK. We have a wonderful cultural background and we must develop facilities which will make us an attractive location. We look to the Minister to ensure that in the arts plan and more particularly in the capital programme, such facilities will be developed. We will be competing for tourists with the Eastern European countries. I was at the opening of the new facility in Finnstown House Hotel in Lucan by the Minister of State, Deputy Kenny. He stated that four million tourists will visit Ireland this year. The city of Prague will attract in the region of 80 million tourists. The number has grown from 30 million with the collapse of the Berlin wall and it surpasses the number visiting Paris. Czechoslovakia has low cost restaurants and hotel accommodation and that together with the magnificence of the cities, its art and culture makes it extremely attractive to tourists. That is what we will have to compete with.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hilliard raised the matter of the site of the Battle of the Boyne and the potential that exists for providing a major facility there. That would be a major attraction for foreign tourists and <Col N="1522" /> would also be a recognition of our tortured past and the difficulties in the various communities on the island. Those in the North of Ireland would see us as being big enough to recognise the history and importance of the site. The facility could be a cultural centre or an historical one. The Minister might consider setting up a working group with the local authority to bring forward plans and recommendations.</P>
    <P>If millions of pounds were not wasted in other areas which have been well researched something more productive could be done about interpretative centres. At a time of limited resources it is particularly difficult to get such projects off the ground. Deputy de Valera is more familiar with the position in the Burren but the provision of such facilities should not lead to controversy. In Glenveagh Park, Donegal the Office of Public Works without controversy built an excellent interpretative centre in a most sensitive area of that wonderful facility. It is well designed and architecturally acceptable, an excellent example of what could and should have been achieved in the other controversial locations. It is a monument to success and a fine facility in a sensitive amenity area.</P>
    <P>The foundation stones for the development of the arts were laid by the former Taoiseach, Charles Haughey. I cannot help but think that the Minister's role is being overpoliticised and that great expectations are being created. In 1979 at a parliamentary party meeting when the then Minister for Economic Planning and Development, Martin O'Donoghue, was outlining his proposals for a White Paper which would ensure full employment by 1982, the late Deputy Callanan remarked to me that it would be better to first achieve this and then talk about it. Consideration should perhaps be given to less publicity and more practical action.</P>
    <P>Many people were disappointed at the level of funding secured by the Minister and efforts have been made to rectify this. This problem has not been fully addressed and the Minister should <Col N="1523" /> outline the capital investment programme for the arts. As the Arts Council has rightly pointed out, the feasibility of a national capital programme is entirely dependent on the availability of resources from the Government or the EU. It is not sensible that the already hard pressed Arts Council should undertake major capital developments out of its own resources in the absence of special funding. The plan outlines what needs to be achieved but it must be recognised that this is a much more complex matter than the plan suggests. Adequate funding is required to implement the recommendations in the plan.</P>
    <P>While the programme gives a broad outline of the development of the arts in the coming years, it fails to fully address the problems of elitism which are still evident in the wider community. The Arts Council must adopt a radical approach to the development of the arts for the wider community. One could be critical and say that there are too many ministerial fingerprints on the plan. While this is welcome in some respects, it appears that this area has been excessively politicised, if it was the responsibility of a Fianna Fáil Minister there would be howls of criticism. However, we will be constructive and positive in our approach. We do not know how many modifications were made to the plan which the Arts Council believes was ready for publication much earlier. Ideally, the plan should move arts to a new platform on which further progress can be made, and when Fianna Fáil returns to power we will ensure that this is done.</P>
    <P>Central to the success of the three year plan is the willingness of the Government to provide the necessary funding. There is much dissatisfaction at the level of funding provided for theatres. I wish the Minister every success with the plan and I hope he will take more action and reduce the level of publicity, thereby ensuring that the recommendations are implemented and <Col N="1524" /> the difficulties on the financial side fully addressed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. M. Kitt Mr. M. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate. I congratulate the Minister on the publication of this plan and I hope he succeeds in getting the necessary funding for it. I support the points made by Deputy de Valera, the Fianna Fáil spokesperson on Arts and Culture. Deputy Lawlor referred to the role played by the former Taoiseach, Charles Haughey, in the development of the arts. His commitment to the refurbishment of many of our public buildings is very well known. For example, he was responsible for the refurbishment of the Seanad by the Office of Public Works.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer to the role of local authorities in the development of the arts. More emphasis should have been placed in the plan on the role of local authorities in this area. Will the Minister say if a determined effort will be made to encourage local authorities to employ arts officers? As I understand it, the Arts Council provides 50 per cent of the funding for arts officers and in most cases the local authorities make up the balance. However, given the size of the county in Galway the funding is divided between Galway Corporation and Galway County Council, both of which make a 25 per cent contribution. This gives rise to questions about the effectiveness of having one arts officer in the second largest county in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The County Galway Arts Committee supports the many festivals and companies in Galway city. However, to my knowledge Galway Corporation does not make any contribution to events in the county. In other words, there is a flourishing arts scene in Galway city &mdash; for example, the arts and film festivals, the Druid theatre company Macnas and Pléaracha Connemara &mdash; but there is not the same enthusiasm for the arts in east Galway. As a member of the County Galway Arts Committee I <Col N="1525" /> always support the efforts made by Galway County Council and Galway Corporation &mdash; people from all over the county are interested in the events held in Galway city. Funding is normally provided to the Druid theatre company on the basis that it tours Galway county as well as other centres in the western region.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to a three year plan which will include designation for counties such as Offaly, Tipperary, Roscommon and Laois, counties which border north and east Galway. I hope this area will not be forgotten when the other counties are designated. The purists might say we should not be talking about money and that somehow we should get on and do the job but, unfortunately, money must be provided. Yeats spoke about fumbling in the greasy till and Páidin's ha'pence and Biddy's pence in another context. However, we have to get the money.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that for the past three years the Galway arts committee has been able to get sponsorship. I do not know if this happens in other areas. Area awards have been presented in the county and an overall county award was won recently by Pléaracha Connemara, a very fine group. On the question of the arts in Galway, there are nearly two Galways: the Galway city excellence award and in County Galway a pressing need for more help and support from the arts officer.</P>
    <P>When I started to teach, the arts were mentioned in all the training and in-service training courses. Integration was the great buzzword at the time and the arts were always regarded as an excellent way of showing what the education system was all about. I would like to see more emphasis on the arts.</P>
    <P>The new primary school curriculum of 1970 put great emphasis on the arts but it does not appear to be given the same recognition in our education system today. For example, the only western college that has a diploma course in arts, textiles and fine arts is Galway Regional Technical College. <Col N="1526" /> Perhaps a degree course could be provided there and the type of work done by the regional technical college in Letterfrack could also be done in other parts of County Galway. For example, there is a wealth of musical talent in places such as Tuam and New Inn where the Music Matters group, under Mrs. Máire McLoughlin, are doing excellent work but we cannot get the interest of any of the experts in this field. I hope this can be rectified in the coming years. The Minister will be aware that people in the western region are anxious to have a school of music, even though Limerick is designated as the centre of music &mdash; I pay tribute to Michéal Ó Suilleabhan on the great work he is doing in Limerick. Galway has been asking for a school of music for a long time and I hope it can be provided. I would be grateful if the Minister would meet the Galway arts committee when we could discuss many of these matters with him.</P>
    <P>Any young artist who can win a county or a national award will have his confidence boosted and will have something worthwhile to put on his <i>curriculum vitae.</i> We need to promote awards for our artists which, in the past has been done through sponsorship. I hope the Minister can help in other ways. Whenever I write to the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht I receive a reply to the effect that he does not have discretionary funds in his Department and that most of the funding comes from the Arts Council. The only problem is that the Arts Council usually provides funding for the professional bodies and there is little support for amateurs and community groups. If these groups knew where they could get funding it would be a great help. I have known groups who have received funding from the vocational education committees and the county enterprise boards, and that is welcome. Most groups throughout the country consider that the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht should provide some funding. It is interesting to note that the Department of Foreign Affairs <Col N="1527" /> provides funding for cultural and heritage matters. Is it not time that funding was provided by the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht? The funding provided by the Department of Foreign Affairs is given mostly to groups who go on tour to Europe or elsewhere but I have noticed in recent years there is little funding for our traditional musicians and traditional Irish dancers. The cultural and heritage fund should be assigned to the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht. I ask the Minister to make a good fight for it and I will support him in any way I can so that the funding is under the aegis of his Department rather than the Department of Foreign Affairs. The amateurs and community groups are not getting sufficient funding.</P>
    <P>I have felt for a number of years that our national theatre, the Abbey Theatre, should be involved in touring. The Committee of Public Accounts, of which I was a member, visited the Abbey on one occasion and discussed the question of touring. The answer one always gets from the Abbey is that there are no suitable venues. That is nonsense and the Minister knows that. There are excellent venues and many halls have been refurbished beautifully. The town hall in Ballinasloe, which has beautiful tiered seating, comes to mind. Many of the Abbey productions could be done at regional venues. In the past the Abbey Theatre has sent down a one man or a one woman show and have said they were not successful. We must get back to the full national theatre productions as in the past. I ask the Minister to discuss this matter with the Abbey who have had many representations on this issue. They would be well supported if their particular productions were performed in the provinces.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to local radio which has been addressed by the Minister. One of the great achievements of local radio in the arts area has been the specialist programmes on Irish music. The local station, Galway Bay FM, has won at least one award for its programme &ldquo;The <Col N="1528" /> Half-Door&rdquo;, a traditional Irish music programme, presented by Ita O'Kelly. I congratulate it on its achievement and I am pleased with the recognition it received for what it has done for Irish music. It is extraordinary that many of the local stations feature Irish music at the same time but that is how they are programmed. I suppose we cannot tell local radio stations what to do as regards programming. If you listen on you car radio, as I sometimes do, you find, unfortunately, that, Irish music features on all the stations at the same time. One at least, Galway Bay radio station, has been recognised. They should continue to promote Irish music because we do not have as much traditional music on RTE as we should and the local radio stations are doing a good job.</P>
    <P>The arts are alive and well in many parts of the country. That is not to say that all is well. For example, in Galway city and its environs excellent festivals are organised with great commitment by voluntary groups, but in east Galway and the region which now borders on Offaly, Tipperary and Roscommon there is not quite so much success. The Minister should examine the suggestion I made and take up with the local authorities the question of appointing two arts officers in large counties like Galway where arts development is needed in the rural areas.</P>

      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, ba mhaith liom mo bhuíochas a ghabháil leis na Teachtaí Dála go léir a rinne ráitis ar <i>An Phlean Ealaíon 1995-1997.</i> Ba mhór liom a chloisteáil go bhfuil gach taobh den Tí go ginearálta i bhfábhar an Phlean agus tá súil agam go mbeidh mé ábalta é a chur i bhfeidhm sul i bhfad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like from the outset to thank all those who made statements on <i>The Arts Plan 1995-97</i> during the course of contributions made on 6 April last and again today. The opportunity to make such statements represents a historic occasion for the arts in Ireland which <Col N="1529" /> have never before, outside the legislative process, been given such attention by this House since the foundation of the State. I very much welcome the contributions which indicated the wide support there is for the arts. I hope this augurs well for the future of the arts generally. It is clear from the statements made that there is a growing consensus that, apart from being an integral part of our society in their own right, the arts can contribute significantly to the economic and social development of the State. Moreover, as this historic moment on the island of Ireland, where more than ever structures need to be established which will respect different traditions and establish pluralism, the arts can play a seminal role in promoting mutual respect and understanding between two traditions.</P>
    <P>In their statements, Deputies have directed specific questions at me which I will now attempt to answer. I will also set out some facts which, for the sake of the record, it is necessary to make clear. I should like to set the record straight regarding the current level of funding in regard to An Comhairle Ealaíon for 1995 in advance of any consideration by Government of the three year plan. The plan as published has to be considered by Government and I expect that to take place within the month. Deputy Dukes quoted the Estimates volume figure of £14.25 million for An Comhairle Ealaíon in 1995. Deputy Ahern quoted a separate figure of £15 million. Both figures are incorrect, because I was happy to secure an increase of £2 million for An Comhairle in this year's budget, which brings the Estimates figure of £14.2 million to an actual allocation of £16.25 million. I do not want this misconstrued again.</P>
    <P>While the figure of £16.25 million does represent a shortfall from the plan's figure of £19.5 million sought by An Comhairle Ealaíon, I must emphasise that the Government has yet to come to a decision on the plan. I must also point out that the interim minority Fianna Fáil Government proposed to cut the funding of An Comhairle <Col N="1530" /> Ealaíon by more than 12 per cent from its 1994 level &mdash; from £13.2 million in 1994 to £11.6 million in 1995. That could hardly be described as a historic leap forward, more a curious historic leap backwards, and should suggest a salutary caution on Deputies going down the road of where the commitment lies. Our respective records will speak for themselves. We have seen how the figures have been adjusted. The Deputies will be aware that even before Government gives consideration to the plan there has been an increase in the allocation for An Comhairle Ealaíon of £4.65 million from the level proposed by the minority interim Fianna Fáil Government last December.</P>
    <P>Deputy Quill asked about the allocation of the budget of An Comhairle Ealaíon and the proportion being spent in the Dublin area. This does not give a true picture of the situation. Many of the agencies, for example, Music Network, the Association of Artists in Ireland, the Sculpture Society of Ireland and CAFE, Creative Activity for Everyone, which are charged with spending money on the arts, are located in Dublin, but they spend a great deal of their budget in the regions. Taking this factor into account, the imbalance is in no way as exaggerated as Deputy Quill suggests. The very essence of this plan is the formulation of a strategy by An Comhairle Ealaíon to correct the imbalance that exists and provide for a more cohesive, structured and balanced arts infrastructure throughout the country.</P>
    <P>Deputies Flaherty and Eric Byrne raised the important issue of the effect which the arts plan might have on the Dublin region. Deputy Flaherty pointed out that the greater Dublin area, for example, Fingal, Dublin South or Dún Laoghaire/Rathdown, are areas which are in need of their own local arts infrastructure and that this matter should be addressed. Deputy Sean Ryan mentionend this also.</P>
    <P>I wish to repeat the position as outlined in my opening statement on this matter, that the regional policy emphasis in the arts plan will not mean scaling <Col N="1531" /> down of the arts infrastructure in Dublin. This is not necessary. While it is my express intention to upgrade arts activity and infrastructure in the regions, it will not be achieved at the expense of downgrading the infrastructure in our capital city. This is not a strategy for decentralisation, rather it is a policy of positive regionalisation.</P>
    <P>In terms of the regions of Dublin outside its central core which contain the bulk of its arts and cultural infrastructure, I would like to assure Deputy Flaherty that the Arts Council is very conscious of the need within these areas of Dublin. It is working closely with the arts officers of the three Dublin county council regions in developing arts plans for the individual regions in Fingal, South Dublin and Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown. I accept that the concentration of major arts institutions in the capital does not address the needs of those communities who live in areas which are located on the outskirts of the city, and that the arts plan does not include these areas as priority zones. The areas around Dublin and, indeed, Cork need particular attention in their own right and the area based approach outlined in the plan will, as it evolves, focus on these outer urban areas as they become in their turn an absolute priority for attention and for eventual designation as priority zones.</P>
    <P>Deputies &mdash; notably Deputies de Valera and Quill &mdash; expressed concern that the proposed centres of excellence in the plan will be overly exclusive, imposed from the centre, and have no regard for existing infrastructures. I made a genuine effort in my opening statement to allay these fears. I am happy to repeat that the proposal to have a network of centres of excellence is not intended and will not be either elitist or exclusive. The designation of one arts discipline in one town or city will not preclude arts activity flourishing in other disciplines in the same location, nor will it preclude the designated discipline being developed in other <Col N="1532" /> locations. In this regard while I have some sympathy with Deputy Quill's contention that Cork should be a centre of excellence for music it is not the intention of the plan to restrict the excellent musical infrastructure and tradition which already exists in Cork or to hamper its continued development. The plan merely sets out to enhance the overall cultural infrastructure of Cork city by placing a new emphasis on the visual arts which, over time, will complement its rich tradition in the music area and represent, as pointed out today, a further major attraction to Cork as a centre for tourism, artistic expression in its own right and its people.</P>
    <P>I am aware also from the conference on &ldquo;The Regional Development of the Arts in Ireland&rdquo; which I opened in Cork last weekend that disquiet remains about the concept of the centre of excellence but I appeal to all concerned to allow the concept to develop for the three year period of the arts plan after which it should, in the normal course, terminate unless there is a groundswell of opinion in favour of its retention. The plan is not written in stone and should be the subject of comment and discussion.</P>
    <P>Concern has been expressed during the debate, particularly by Deputies Flanagan and Dukes, regarding the selection of priority zones by An Chomhairle Ealaíon. An Chomhairle has taken a pragmatic approach in attempting to balance the relative needs of each county in the development of an appropriate arts infrastructure. It is accepted that there are huge requirements throughout the country but that real progress can be made only through a planned approach.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested there has been a politicisation of my ministry. I want to prepare legislation in this general area, as I have done in the case of monuments, heritage and other areas; put structures in place and devise a plan to make funding for this activity secure beyond not just one year taken with another but beyond one Government <Col N="1533" /> taken with another and one incumbent taken with another. I cannot disqualify myself by virtue of the fact that I had some experience and a commitment to the arts over a number of years.</P>
    <P>An Chomhairle is best placed to determine where the most urgent action is needed to remedy deficiencies and has based its initial selection of nine local authority areas on its view, with which I agree, that the central spine of the country is the weakest in terms of of professional arts infrastructure, a fact recognised in the report <i>The Public and the Arts,</i> a study of behaviour and attitudes carried out in 1994. There is agreement on this matter.</P>
    <P>An Chomhairle intends that this approach will effect a radical change in the arts profile of the priority zones by the end of 1997. Subject to evaluation and review in 1998 it is intended that priority zones at that time will include counties Carlow, Kildare, Louth, Meath and Cavan. A rich account was given today of the resources of County Meath but I encourage the Deputy for that constituency to urge the local authority to appoint an arts officer. Sadly, it is one of the counties which not only does not have an arts officer but which also voted against having one.</P>
    <P>I wish to explain to Deputy Smith that Cavan is also regarded as in serious need of arts infrastructural development but this is part of a phased approach which will help to achieve an overall cohesive infrastructure. This also answers the point made this morning by Deputy Kitt.</P>
    <P>I am confident that, through the joint INTERREG programme for Ireland and Northern Ireland &mdash; some funding from which I am pleased to say is at my disposal &mdash; an opportunity exists for the stimulation of Border activity in the provision of enhanced cultural and arts infrastructural developments. This will assist in the cultural and economic development of the Border counties as a whole, a point made by many Deputies. It is essential to build on the progress achieved under the INTERREG 1 programme. The further <Col N="1534" /> development of well organised heritage and cultural tourism events has the potential to attract substantial overseas interest and investment. I agree wholeheartedly with Deputy Smith that North-South co-operation is of paramount importance, it is significant that the arts plan pays due recognition to this with increased co-operation and involvement between the two arts councils given priority as a key strategic objective.</P>
    <P>Turning to the subject of the Temple Bar area, I welcome Deputies' comments. Deputy Fitzgerald spoke about the importance of the community having access to participate in its development while Deputy Haughey spoke about some of its critics. Temple Bar is important for the entire community, not just for sectional interests or as a tourist spot. I am pleased with developments to date and I am sure the Minister for the Environment will take into account the comments which have been made. I will arrange to have them conveyed to him.</P>
    <P>Deputies de Valera and Killeen expressed concern that this strategic alliance which I have developed with An Chomhairle Ealaíon might be claustrophobic and in some way intrusive of the independent autonomy of An Chomhairle. I am disappointed about this because I have made it perfectly clear that, having agreed the general parameters of this plan with An Chomhairle in our discussions prior to publication, it is not part of my function to determine the funding under the plan for any particular discipline over the coming years or to determine where funding should be directed. The only suggestions that I should interfere with the autonomy of the Arts Council come from arts organisations which want me to overturn decisions of the council &mdash; and from Deputies. I am committed to the concept of autonomy.</P>
    <P>I wish to clarify a point raised about the Abbey Theatre. Under the new arrangements I have put in place for the Abbey, the National Concert Hall and the Irish Museum of Modern Art, the council provides me with detailed and <Col N="1535" /> expert advice on the funding requirements of these institutions and I naturally seek to secure allocations from Government based on this advice. That is the way the system works. I agreed at a meeting with the chair and director of the council the allocations for the National Concert Hall and the Irish Museum of Modern Art. I accepted the recommendation of the council as to the level of funding that should be provided for the Abbey from the allocation for the Arts Council. The point is that the sums were decided on the basis of agreement between the council and me and there was no question of imposition of a decision on my part.</P>
    <P>There is one serious point I want to correct. In his intervention Deputy Ahern referred to the Abbey Theatre and the National Ballroom. The Deputy, unilaterally, reversed a funding decision I had made before I left office and proposed a £500,000 allocation to Dublin Corporation for the purchase of the National Ballroom. This decision was made by Deputy Ahern in the absence of any request, to my Department's knowledge, from Dublin Corporation for such generous assistance &mdash; a point borne out by the fact that the corporation has since purchased the building.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy that the Abbey Theatre will be able to tour this year. A sum of £207,000 has been earmarked for this purpose.</P>
      <P>Deputies raised the need for closer links between my Department and the Departments of Education and the Environment. I agree with Deputy Kitt it is important that teacher training is sensitive to the needs of the arts.</P>
      <P>It is important that local authority arts officers be appointed. It is hard to justify any serious claim from a local authority that it is genuinely interested in the arts if it fails to appoint an arts officer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1536" /> I have taken a detailed note of the many other issues raised. Deputy de Valera raised the question of funding for the Irish Architectural Archive. My Department provides an annual subvention to the Archive, which this year amounts to £50,000. Last year it provided a special grant of £6,000 to fund the computerisation of the Archive in partnership with IBM.</P>
    <P>There was a reference to film production. I am delighted that not only has this been successful but that eight or nine counties have participated in the success of the film industry. These include Donegal &mdash;&ldquo;The Hanging Gale&rdquo; and &ldquo;Secret of Roan Inish&rdquo;&mdash; Cavan-Monaghan where two films were made, Cork, Clare, Carlow, MeathKildare and Wicklow.</P>
    <P>I will listen carefully to the deliberations at conferences similar to that organised in Cork. If other conferences are organised they will be listened to with great care. We will try to do things as much as we can in a sense of partnership. It is not a question of who takes credit for what; I have acknowledged everything that has been done in the past but I have noted serious deficiencies and I am trying to put structures in place. I hope that whoever comes after me in this ministry will spend little time talking about what they may or may not do but will make available facilities and funding and adopt a planned approach so that partnerships will be built up between Departments to ensure that arts and culture, matters of Gaeltacht and Oireacht, will be assured into the future.

  <MainHeading Type="GD" LHead="Interim Report of Task Force on Long-Term" RHead="Unemployment: Statements (Resumed)">
    <Title>Interim Report of Task Force on Long-Term Unemployment: Statements (Resumed).</Title>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>I commend the work to date of the task force on long term unemployment. An examination of its initial report clearly shows that much <Col N="1537" /> thought and effort went into its work. While I do not agree with some of the report's findings and recommendations, it results from the complexity of the issue of long term unemployment and a wide range of possible options must be considered if progress is to be made in significantly reducing the numbers affected.</P>
      <P>I have no hesitation in saying that unemployment represents the main structural failure of modern society. At a time when mankind continues to make vast progress on the technological front, there is an almost equivalent degree of failure to come to terms with the vital need to provide an adequate standard of living for all members of society. This is most evident in the area of employment since work is the main source of income for any individual.</P>
      <P>Unemployment, particularly of an extended duration, is bad enough but unfortunately the financial deprivation that accompanies it drastically reduces the capacity of the individual or family affected to cope with everyday problems. Consequently the unemployed person is increasingly vulnerable to problems such as marriage brakdown, substance abuse and ill health. It cannot be disputed but that concentrated unemployment in a community leads to a decrease in the acceptance of law and order and an increase in crime.</P>
      <P>In attempting to effectively address unemployment it is vitally important to fully recognise the multiple dimensions of the problem. I am pleased to note the task force has placed major emphasis on two requirements. It clearly accepts the need for input from a wide range of agencies and community groups including State organisations, educational and training institutions, employers and community based workers. The second requirement stressed by the task force is the overriding need for effective integration of effort. This is the single greatest challenge facing us as we attempt to come to terms with the enormous challenge posed by increased unemployment levels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1538" /> Despite the major contributions made to date by agencies such as the IDA, educational institutions and FÁS, the level of integration and focus of effort has not been adequate to deal with unemployment. In this regard I have reservations about the report of the task force. Ideally I would like to have seen greater emphasis on documenting the reasons that the substantial and sustained efforts of a variety of State, industrial and local agencies has managed at best only to limit the increase in unemployment. If we are to successfully turn back the tide of unemployment it is vital to clearly document what works and what does not work in the fight against this problem. This is the core of the issue. A co-ordinated approach to unemployment must include major emphasis on first identifying the underlying industrial and economic changes which have caused and continue this problem.</P>
    <P>A number of factors immediately come to mind. We cannot dispute that technological change has led to a rapid increase in the level of industrial productivity. This has been particularly evident in manufacturing enterprises where increased automation on the production line has drastically reduced the need for manpower. The influence of computer technology is increasingly felt in administration-related activites. Not very long ago every major manufacturing and distribution company employed a large number of clerical staff to deal with essential services such as accounts and payroll, but the improved quality and power of modern computer software has resulted in a major reduction in the number of clerical jobs available.</P>
    <P>We must be realistic in evaluating the major impact of technology on the level of job opportunities. While we may from time to time recall the good old days with a degree of nostalgia it is vital we take on board the simple but cruel reality that creating employment for everyone will require an unprecedented level of planning and development. In <Col N="1539" /> order to ensure the various State-sponsored agencies are as effective as possible in this regard, it is vital that we clearly identify what is working and what is failing to work in job creation. Without such fundamental research and analysis it is almost impossible to expect any new approach to be successful. The scale of the problem is too large and the need for success too profound to allow for anything but the most professional and planned renewed assault on the scourge of unemployment.</P>
    <P>I totally agree with the strong emphasis of the report on the need for enhanced training and educational facilities. A succession of reports and studies have clearly indicated the link between long term unemployment and limited educational qualifications. Our problem is partly due to the age structure of our workforce and the lack of access to second level education facilities until 1966. There is no doubt that the newer jobs require specific skills. Even in institutions which require specific training, employers are increasingly likely to use applicants' educational achievements as part of the short-listing process. A lack of formal educational attainment is almost certain to add to the difficulties of the unemployed person in obtaining a worthwhile job.</P>
    <P>On education and training two recommendations in particular are vital. The task force stresses the need for additional education and training facilities bearing in mind the potential of education institutions to participate where possible. Above all else, we must maximise existing facilities and avoid unnecessary duplication. I welcome the emphasis on the need for flexibility and innovation in the development of education and training programmes. In this regard it is crucial that new structures such as the proposed local employment service maintains close links with all potential employers. There is nothing more discouraging for the long term unemployed who fully commit themselves to a difficult course for an extended period than to find their <Col N="1540" /> efforts lead to no increase in employment potential at the end of the day. The sense of let down is particularly marked in cases where it is clear that such a course offered little by way of job opportunity.</P>
    <P>A central recommendation of the task force is to establish a series of local employment services throughout the country. Where possible those are to be set up in association with the various area partnerships. I agree in principle with the concept of a service which helps to co-ordinate the work of various agencies. We are already involved in job creation and associated activities. Similarly, I welcome the provision of a well defined contact agency which is systematically focused on the overall needs of the long term unemployed. I have no fault to find with those excellent goals outlined in the report of the task force.</P>
    <P>I have a problem, however, with the lack of specific detail in the report regarding the manner in which those local employment services will be delivered. While it is acceptable to aspire towards the integration of services and the provision of comprehensive new opportunities for 135,000 people, it is entirely another matter to devise an effective mechanism for achieving such worthwhile objectives. There is much painstaking work to be done prior to specific proposals being brought before us which, if implemented, will have a major impact on the rate of long term unemployment in our society.</P>
    <P>The report highlights a number of other groups who urgently require support to deal with unemployment. They include those unemployed for between six and 12 months, their dependants and young people who fail to gain permanent employment. I represent the area of Cork city which has been particularly affected by unemployment as a result of the closure of major industrial companies such as Ford, Dunlop, Verolme and, more recently, Sunbeam. I have seen at first hand the disastrous consequences of long term unemployment. Those include profound social deprivation and poverty, family tensions resulting in an <Col N="1541" /> increased rate of marital breakdown, a rise in the crime rate and, perhaps, most important, a slow but definite pattern of lower confidence and self-esteem among those affected by long term unemployment.</P>
    <P>We live in an age when much lip-service is paid to the need to develop an inclusive society. I have no doubt but that people who express such wishes are sincere and well meaning. Equally, I am bound to say that it would be a brave person who would talk about such concepts to the man or woman who has not had meaningful employment for a number of years. Ultimately, those most in need in our society judge all politicians on the basis of achievements, not on the basis of aspirations or intentions, and that is only fair and just.</P>
    <P>As we consider the initial report of the task force on long term unemployment we have no choice but to exert every possible ounce of energy on ensuring the quality and effectiveness of any new structures which are given the all important responsibility of addressing the single most important challenge facing Irish society at present. This time there is no room for serious error or misjudgment, we have to get it right. Therefore, my total support for the aspirations and good intentions clearly expressed in this report is conditioned by my reservations on the extent of research and planning which has taken place to ensure the quality of the proposed solutions. I note also the extremely modest nature of the proposed financing of the report's recommendations. A package which seems to represent less than £50 for each long term unemployed person must of necessity be limited in its scope and detail. However, the underlying aspirations cannot be faulted.</P>
    <P>The main focus of the report is clearly on dealing with the specific needs of the unemployed, particularly in terms of education and training. Such an emphasis is proper and welcome. However, there is a parallel requirement to focus on the precise way in which the necessary extra jobs are to be created. While <Col N="1542" /> it can be argued that we already have an established range of agencies to ensure the promotion of job creation, the reality is that the combined efforts of those agencies to date have not been able to stimulate the necessary level of job creation, particularly in terms of indigenous industry. While I would like to compliment agencies such as Forbairt, FÁS and others on their excellent work, I consider one ingredient is missing in our efforts to stimulate local industry, that of providing adequate levels of venture capital and loan provisions to local entrepreneurs.</P>
    <P>Over the years Irish people have proven themselves at the highest levels of international business and trade. Names, like Henry Ford, Tony O'Reilly and Michael Smurfit readily come to mind in that regard. Therefore, there can be no doubt but that our people have the potential to successfully develop job creation enterprises on a large scale. However, our banking culture is by no means geared towards the challenge posed by the urgent need to create new enterprises and to expand existing companies. A general sense of conservatism and self-satisfaction seems to prevail. While there have been welcome indications of change in that regard in recent years the involvement of our banking sector in assisting such enterprises is far too modest. I firmly believe that we need a new generation of leaders among our banking community who have the ability to identify closely with the needs of our new generation of entrepreneurs. Such a link is certain to play a central role in any major growth in employment in Irish society.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have an opportunity to speak on this report. I listened earlier to the concluding remarks of the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Higgins, on his assessment of the contributions to the arts plan and I also heard some of the earlier contributions of Opposition spokespersons. That plan, its contents and objectives are designed to <Col N="1543" /> touch the higher senses and the soul, but these statements on the Interim Report of the Task Force on Long-Term Unemployment are of much greater and immediate significance to many more people throughout the country. Unemployment, particularly long term unemployment, is having a devastating effect not simply on tens of thousands of people but on hundreds of thousands of people including the long term unemployed, their friends, families and communities. Anything we can do to address the problem and, hopefully, to take the appropriate measures to at least commence dealing with it is welcome.</P>
      <P>I commend the Minister for allowing us the opportunity to debate the report and I commend those who prepared it. It was only last September that the task force was set up as a result of the report of the National Economic and Social Forum on measures to end long term unemployment. This response by way of the interim report was produced quickly, it is timely and is worthy of the most serious consideration because unemployment is a serious and difficult problem. The Minister in his Dáil speech on this matter last March referred to comments from a recent EU Commission report which stated that the clear lesson of the past 20 years is that no member state has succeeded in reducing unemployment significantly and keeping it at low level for a sustained period except Luxembourg. The chances of that happening in the future without a significant change in policy or without a radically different set of circumstances are remote. That is significant because it clearly brings home to us that the problem is not simply an Irish one, that it is very much a European and international one. That does not detract from the fact that our problem, with the possible exception of Spain, where the rate of long term unemployment is higher is the worst in Europe. There is no doubt we are at the bottom of the European league when it comes to tackling the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1544" /> We hear favourable comments on the fundamentals of our economy being in good shape, our low rates of interest, inflation rate, high investment, record numbers of jobs being created, the announcement of new factories here and there and increased visits by IDA officials. However, it is very difficult to reconcile such optimistic comments with the fact that almost 300,000 people are unemployed, a huge proportion of whom have been unemployed over the long term. The fact that economic fundamentals are in good order is of little consolation to those who have no income apart from their weekly social welfare cheque.</P>
    <P>Many reports and studies have been undertaken, with many initiatives by successive Governments and Government Departments to tackle this problem, without success, leading to a general feeling of hopelessness and helplessness on the part of those in this position. It is a sad fact that the electorate no longer believe Governments or politicians can solve the problem. With the huge rates of unemployment over the past ten to 15 years even candidates in the last general election might well have expected that the greatest concern expressed would have been about unemployment, accompanied by constant inquiries <i>vis-à-vis</i> job creation. However, there appears to be such apathy and frustration about politicians' ability to respond, that few demands are made of us or questions asked. I hope that people will once again demand that job creation is on top of the agenda, thus stimulating us into action.</P>
    <P>Job creation is and should be a priority of this Government as the resolution of our huge unemployment problem makes other difficulties secondary. Daily, on the Order of Business &mdash; no doubt we will hear more at Question Time later &mdash; there is constant reference to the ever-increasing crime wave, much of which stems from unemployment and social deprivation and cannot be solved through fire brigade action, additional Garda and prison places. If the core problem is to be eliminated its social <Col N="1545" /> implications must be seriously examined. Many health difficulties also stem from the social effects of unemployment and resolution of the unemployment problem will reap benefits for health and improve the general law and order position.</P>
    <P>While we may talk about the costs of job creation and maintaining people at work, there is no greater cost than unemployment and its attendant difficulties. While the cost of overall social welfare payments in 1995 appears to be £2.2 billion, an examination of the taxes foregone through unemployment and so on clearly demonstrates that is not the total cost. When one reflects on what could be done from a social point of view with £2.2 billion, in building roads, schools, hospitals and homes for the elderly, one clearly sees the benefits which would accrue from the resolution of the unemployment problem. I am the first to admit that, whereas it is easy to talk about its resolution, it is much more difficult to achieve.</P>
    <P>I am reminded of a former Taoiseach, Jack Lynch, who said truthfully, honestly and sincerely that if unemployment ever reached the 100,000 mark he would feel duty bound to resign. How things have changed. If any Government within the next decade succeeded in reducing unemployment to the 100,000 mark, it would feel it sufficient justification for re-election. The goal posts and expectations have changed but, sadly, as a Parliament, we have failed to tackle the problem successfully.</P>
    <P>Our long term unemployment problem appears more severe than within any other member state of the European Union. It is a vicious circle; anybody who has been unemployed for 12 months or longer will experience much greater difficulty in being re-employed than someone who has been unemployed for weeks or months only. The statistics in this report indicate that people who have been unemployed for over two years have a 74 per cent chance only of being re-employed, automatically lowering their general morale <Col N="1546" /> and expectations. Most of the long term unemployed appear to be within the 25 to 44 age group. It should come as no surprise to learn that most of them have had relatively low educational and-or training skills and almost half have had no formal education or qualification which makes it almost impossible to apply for a job, never mind being successful. The vicious circle continues so that, whenever the poorly educated or unqualified become unemployed, their chances of ever obtaining another job are minimal.</P>
    <P>The causes of long-term unemployment are of a structural and social nature, not least of which is the educational aspect to which I just referred. In many urban areas long term unemployment has become almost the norm, passing from father to son, mother to daughter, just as in former days a trade or skill passed from one generation to another.</P>
    <P>Nowadays peoples' expectations are so low, a son or daughter whose parents have never worked perceive little future for themselves beyond receipt of their weekly dole cheque and visit to the local employment exchange. That is a sad self-fulfilling prophesy. From a social and educational point of view we must examine the needs of communities affected in such a manner. I hope the proposal in the report to set up a local employment services network targets long term unemployment areas, particularly areas where it passes from one generation to another. The report recommends setting up 12 centres based on partnership groups and two further centres as a first step; these will cater for more than 500,000 people.</P>
    <P>One tends to associate long term unemployment with urban rather than rural areas, but there are exceptions to the norm. The numbers working in agriculture are reducing literally by the month and many people living in rural areas now depend on paid employment for a living. As a result, unemployment has become a major rural problem and in some areas long term unemployment is emerging as a serious social problem. Therefore, while the problem may not <Col N="1547" /> be as serious as in urban areas, the rural aspect of long term unemployment should not be ignored. In that regard, I hope the recently announed Leader projects will, through programmes, training and work experience, offer hope to many in rural areas. Small towns need particular attention. Some 15 years ago, because of a concrete factory employing at times hundreds of people, Buttevant was a thriving town with full employment. When that factory closed the IDA was unsuccessful in finding a replacement and, as a result, the unemployment rate soared. Virtually everybody who worked in well paid local employment in Buttevant ten or 15 years ago is now in retirement or in receipt of social welfare benefit. The town has been literally brought to its knees. Many other towns which traditionally depended on one or two small to medium-sized industries are facing similar difficulties because of the closure of industries. The people employed in the industries were unable to find alternative employment and are now reaching retirement with nothing to look forward to but social welfare benefit and assistance.</P>
    <P>Also, ten to 12 years ago Verolme Cork Dockyard was located in Cobh, employing up to 1,200 people. The dockyard closed and was not replaced by another industry. Those employed in it first became short term unemployed, but the majority of them are now long term unemployed, giving rise to many social problems in the area. The examples of those towns in my area illustrate the problems associated with long term unemployment and the necessity to tackle the problem.</P>
    <P>I concur with the recommendations in the report of community employment. The definition of &ldquo;work&rdquo; must be changed for the 1990s and beyond. The days of 40 hours a week jobs with three weeks holidays in the year is gone. Much greater emphasis must be placed on part-time community and flexible work in order to respond to changing times. Community employment is not <Col N="1548" /> only a valuable source of employment but of social worth in a community. During recent weeks we debated what were referred to as cutbacks in community employment schemes. We recognised that sufficient funding was not available for them and, while the Government provided additional resources, the problem remains. I appeal to the Minister to place community employment at the top of the agenda. Such schemes benefit schools, community associations and development committees and enable worthwhile work to be done. They not only provide work for people who have almost forgotten what it is like to work and introduce new workers to the work-place, but they are also of benefit from a social and community point of view. As they assist in tackling the major problem of long term unemployment, they should be encouraged.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Unemployment is a major problem here and elsewhere in the European Union and, while a great deal of lip service is paid to it, governments have not been successful in resolving it. The report identifies two problems, namely, unemployment and the high percentage of people who are long term unemployed. In regard to generating employment recent budgets have endeavoured to make our economy more competitive and there has been greater co-operation between the social partners. Progress has been made and most workers now recognise that it is not a pay increase that matters, but what one takes home at the end of the week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report deals with the long term unemployed and refers to the sense of hopelessness experienced by people in that position. The nature of work has changed. Many of the traditional jobs have disappeared and people living on a fringe of society do not seem to be able to get into the jobs market. While there is talk about the number of unemployed, employment in this city is at its highest level ever, and I am sure that is the case countrywide. In some of the <Col N="1549" /> suburbs, both adults in the house are in employment and they do not experience any difficulties. In many ways, we have solved one problem and created another. I realise that in many households both people have to work in order to meet financial commitments. However, we have concentrated wealth in certain parts of the city and concentrated poverty in other areas. That does not lead to a solution of the overall problem. I am not suggesting that women should stay at home &mdash; with two female Deputies facing me on the opposite side of the House I would not dare do that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EithneFitzgerald" hpid="Ms E. Fitzgerald Ms E. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms E. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>However, over the past 25 years the position has changed. In my constituency, and many others, there are two jobs per household while in other areas there are no jobs in the household. While it is appropriate that people should work outside the home and be allowed to feel they are making a positive contribution to society, that has created problems in other areas where unemployment levels are high. Perhaps we should have stipulated one job per household; I will not suggest which partner should stay at home, but the wealth of the country must be distributed more fairly.</P>
      <P>We can no longer talk about the fact that there are 135,000 people who are long term unemployed without trying to do something about the problem. It is simply not good enough to say that with the change in birth rates, there will be more jobs available in 30 or 40 years time. The problem is not that simple. It must be urgently addressed because the knock-on effects of long term unemployment are enormous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is much talk recently about crime, which is rampant in several parts of the city. The sense of hopelessness felt by people who are long term unemployed is the cause of them drifting into crime. It is difficult to blame those people. There has always been crime and there has always been a degree of <Col N="1550" /> poverty but people are entitled to their self respect. When people feel they are making a contribution to life, when they are trying to rear their families and hoping that their children will have a bright future, they continue to do the best they can. However, if people lose self respect and if children do not see any purpose in going to school, and if they are growing up in a household where there is no work, it is difficult for them to become motivated in regard to doing homework, etc. They do not see any future ahead of them. All they can see facing them is what has always faced their parents &mdash; unemployment.</P>
    <P>According to the report, one of our major problems is the lack of proper education for the long term unemployed. It states that approximately 48 per cent of the long term unemployed are not sufficiently educated to take up the jobs that are on offer. We must bear in mind that the types of jobs that are now available have changed. Some weeks ago, we debated the report on the future of third level education. That report stated that an analysis was carried out of the number of people in certain areas of Dublin who go on to third level education. That analysis revealed the true picture of the distribution of wealth and poverty in this city. It highlighted certain postal code areas where only a few children leaving school applied for or were accepted into third level colleges.</P>
    <P>In regard to my own constituency, the report recommended that the Finglas-Blanchardstown area be given priority for a new regional technical college. The report was produced by a group of professional experts and I hope the Government will implement its recommendations. There is little point in talking about a problem unless we are prepared to accept the findings of these experts. In Finglas, very few people go on to third level education. The report states that this area of the city is most in need of a regional technical college, and yet the Minister for Education seems to be pushing for a new college <Col N="1551" /> in her own constituency, which I understand is not needed because it is already well catered for in that regard. I believe the art college in Dún Laoghaire is not even full. I hope the Minister will change her plans and implement the recommendations of the report.</P>
    <P>This report contains many good recommendations but I was under the impression that many of them had already been implemented. I thought the former Manpower service, which came under the arm of the new FÁS, has been carrying out many of the functions recommended in this report. I realise there have been difficulties in recent years between Manpower and FÁS &mdash; I think Manpower became the poor relation of the new FÁS and was not given sufficient resources to carry out its function, which I thought was to help people to find employment.</P>
    <P>The Department of Social Welfare seemed to have its patch set up in this area also. It had people working as jobs facilitators or something of that nature. I realise this has been a problem between Departments, regardless of who was in power, and perhaps the solution would be to set up a new body to look after the needs of the long term unemployed. I do not mind who takes on responsibility for this job but I wonder what will be the functions of the manpower section of FÁS in the future. What will the job facilitators in the Department of Social Welfare be doing in the future?</P>
    <P>There is little point, however, in setting up and funding a new body when various other bodies exist to address this problem. There must be co-ordination among all Departments and I hope the Minister sets up the one-stop-shop so that the long term unemployed will not be given the run around by all the various agencies.</P>
    <P>I wish to make some other points which have a local, constituency connection. As I said earlier, certain areas of Dublin seem to be doing very well. Last week, the Government announced the <Col N="1552" /> location of the new science park. This is something in which the local authority in Dublin has taken a great interest over the past number of years. Two years ago, the Dublin Chamber of Commerce, with the assistance of EU funding, hired international consultants to carry out a detailed examination of the possibility of having a science park in Dublin. The report supported the setting up of a science park and suggested that the Chamber of Commerce lobby the Government to have it included in submissions for EC operational funding. It recommended Abbotstown Agricultural College in an area between Finglas and Castleknock as the best site as it is near the IDA Ballycoolen Industrial Estate where there is a number of hi-tech industries, has a history of research on site as it is the State laboratories dealing with meat and food and so on, and is near Dublin City University.</P>
    <P>The site has a lot of good points and it was the first choice recommended by an independent report, yet the Department of Enterprise and Employment made a decision to locate the science park in Dublin South-West, which happens to be the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte's constituency. I am sure it is a good location. I was rather surprised to hear the Minister of State stress last week that one of the main factors in reaching his decision was that it was a private site whereas Abbotstown was owned by the State. The Minister has changed his spots since taking office. Jobs have to be distributed in a fair way and Ministers cannot be seen to be looking after their own area. Even if I am doing that now, I am not a Government Minister. If an independent report recommends a site, a Minister should have a very good reason and should be able to explain why he veered from the site recommended and chose one in his own patch.</P>
    <P>The local employment service will operate in conjunction with area development areas. There are two such places in my constituency, Finglas and Ballymun and they are doing a great deal of good. They are giving the long <Col N="1553" /> term unemployed a direction and a great deal of help. I was amazed by the recently announced new designated development areas. Initially this scheme was designed to give people in areas of high unemployment a leg up and were there to help with specific problems. There have been huge extensions of the development areas and some have been extended so far that they have rendered the scheme useless.</P>
    <P>The Finglas development area has virtually remained the same but with the addition of parts of Cabra and this is probably justified. The Ballymun development area remains the same. However, the Coolock development area on the north side has mushroomed and takes in a huge tracts of mildle class Raheny, right out of Sutton and Marino and Drumcondra. There are houses in the £250,000 bracket in this scheme. In the Ballymun development area there would be 50 per cent unemployment and in the original Coolock development area it was probably the same, where unemployment might have been 5,000 out of 10,000; with the extension it is probably 5,500 unemployed out of 25,000. The emphasis has changed. If it is intended to give a leg up to certain groups by giving them a boost, giving everyone the same boost brings us back to square one.</P>
    <P>According to the report the Department of Enterprise and Employment will spend £6 million, yet all the fuss lately is about the reduction in the numbers on community employment. I believe that everyone on the unemployment register should make a contribution by doing some work and I thought that was the direction we were going in the past couple of years. Politicans on all sides seemed to nail their colours to that mast but now we seem to be backtracking. There was a colossal increase last year in the number on social employment schemes. Why have we backtracked? If the current pressure to boost the numbers succeeds and we get back to 40,000, do we just stay at 40,000 forever more. Last year the numbers parpticipating in community <Col N="1554" /> employment increased from 22,000 to 40,000 and I thought that was going to be the rate of progress in the future. I am a firm believer in that scheme and that is the direction in which we should be going. I am not saying I believe in workfare but I would like to see everyone on the live register doing community work for a certain number of hours per week. The community employment schemes took off in a big way last year, with participants starting to cut verges and do repairs for elderly people in private housing estates. Many new groups were formed last year and were only getting up and running. I want to see the numbers on this scheme brought up to 40,000 but then, we have to retain the momentum. My philosophy is that if you cannot give somebody a 40 hour a week job, 20 hours work is not a bad start with a view to offering people in the group an extra day as an incentive to pull out the stops and show willingness and effort.</P>
    <P>I am very disappointed with the way the community employment schemes have gone. I hope the Department will reverse the decision and keep up the pressure to increase the number on community employment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms F. Fitzgerald Ms F. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms F. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this report on tackling long term unemployment which is based on a report on the same subject by the National Economic and Social Forum. I think we should also debate the more recent report on the jobs potential of the services sector as this is linked with tackling long term unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very pleased with the Government's reaction to both reports. The task force report is based on the forum's work and it is worth nothing the very positive work being done by the forum. In just over two years the forum has produced up to eight reports and action has followed on them. What is needed is action if we are to tackle the very serious problem of long term unemployment. I am glad Deputy Ahern resisted the temptation &mdash; although I think he <Col N="1555" /> flirted with it &mdash; to suggest that the way to tackle long term unemployment was by restricting the job opportunities of women.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I was afraid of the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms F. Fitzgerald Ms F. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms F. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Restricting the job opportunities of one group of people is not the way to tackle unemployment. I note Deputy Ahern's concern for community employment schemes but I would be more impressed by it if his party had not budgeted for only 26,000 places on the schemes. At present there are 40,000 places. There is some difficulty getting extra money to ensure that these schemes develop and I take the Deputy's point that there is scope for them to develop. They are part of the way to tackle long term unemployment and one of the routes we must develop.</P>
      <P>I am pleased the Government has placed tackling the problem of long term unemployment at the centre of its agenda because it has a corrosive effect on individuals, parishes and communities. The recommendations in the reports will help to tackle the problem which is a serious one.</P>
      <P>In the years between 1980 and 1993 the rate of long term unemployment rose from 2.8 per cent of the workforce to 10 per cent or from 35,000 people to 135,000 people. This means that one in 10 of the workforce was without a job for more than a year. A large number of people have not worked for a number of years. The report states that their chance of finding work is slim.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of the registered unemployed in October 1994, 92,000 were unemployed for two years or more and 66,000 for three years or more. Individuals and communities will not recover from long term unemployment without special measures being taken. Even if the economy continues to improve and unemployment levels fall, those who have not worked for some time will find it difficult to get back to the world of work. They will be left outside unless special <Col N="1556" /> attention is paid to them. That is why I welcome the Government's commitment to tackle long term unemployment through this scheme and through the £89 million which has been committed to the partnership areas where there is potential for 8,000 jobs to be created. There are measures in place to help individuals and parishes. The reaction in many communities &mdash; I saw it in my constituency &mdash; to community employment schemes illustrates the extent to which communities have become involved in trying to create jobs by taking on worthwhile projects.</P>
    <P>I was at a meeting in my constituency about a week ago where several people spoke about how the opportunity to be involved in the schemes that were in place gave them hope. We know that the long term unemployed experience a sense of isolation and helplessness in terms of exclusion and marginalisation. We must do everything we can to break that.</P>
    <P>These reports arise out of the work of the economic and social forum which consists of politicians, representatives of employers and trade unions and nonGovernmental organisations and is a rather unique forum. It has been successful in issuing reports with detailed recommendations on how to tackle long term unemployment. The Government decided to accept the central recommendation on long term unemployment and put in place a local employment service to meet the needs of the long term unemployed.</P>
    <P>The way we deal with the problem is critical from the point of view of social cohesion, access to education and training and to the quality of life. It is also critical if we wish to avoid the country being divided into the haves and have nots. What Deputy Ahern said about communities who have and those who have not in the Dublin area is true. We must ensure that we do not have areas where everyone is long term unemployed.</P>
    <P>When we wrote the report we emphasised that long term unemployment needs to be tackled through radical <Col N="1557" /> thinking and policy changes involving a wide-ranging departure from established concepts of work and the introduction of new, non-market based policy initiatives. We said an employment service should be established, there should be training interventions, employment experience made available and direct employment provision through the employment service purchasing temporary placements of up to six months in the public and private sector. An attempt should be made to provide longer duration contract jobs mainly for the long term unemployed and or their adult dependants in the public and voluntary sectors.</P>
    <P>The report emphasises that early intervention in the educational sector should be developed and options developed for children who are identified as being at risk of leaving school without any qualifications. We must target this group as otherwise they will become long term unemployed. We also suggested that priority should be given to the Youth Start Initiative proposed by the European Commission.</P>
    <P>There is much work to be done at public level to ensure that there is awareness of the degree of long term unemployment which exists. It is extremly difficult for long term unemployed people to get back to work. Those who are privileged to have work often do not appreciate how difficult it can be.</P>
    <P>We must think of groups who would benefit from this service and would be considered priority groups &mdash; those registered as unemployed for more than six months; dependent spouses of the unemployed; lone parents and the young unemployed. The task force will report in October 1995 on the progress of the local employment service and on the range of employment options which will be available to the long term unemployed in the light of Government policy on special employment measures set out in the Government programme and the recommendations of the forum.</P>
    <P>When we looked at the issue at the forum and tried to work out the most <Col N="1558" /> significant initiative to help people, it became clear from international research and local experience that the establishment of a high quality employment service was extremely important. We decided we needed to develop a service which would provide counselling, guidance, training, education and job placement for the long term unemployed which would have different modes of delivery at local level. Registration by the unemployed will be voluntary. The service will have autonomy to carry out its functions and it will have a budget.</P>
    <P>We noted that there were many women who are not registered as unemployed but who would like to work outside the home. This group needed special help also. Deputy Ahern spoke about communities where clusters of people are out of work for long periods and where there is severe poverty and disadvantage as a result. The report states that without special measures these communities will not break out the cycle of disadvantage in which they find themselves.</P>
    <P>The local employment service is at the core of this report and we need to discuss its merits. It is worthwhile as a gateway through which unemployed people can gain the training, education, guidance and placement they require. It will also bring together existing services and supports for the unemployed in an integrated, focused and effective way. I hope the unemployed will find that this service is a planned response to their needs as individuals and will lead to their placement either in a job or scheme which will provide the kind of training and education they require. It has been suggested that the service should be developed on a nationwide basis. While I support this suggestion, we have to monitor the operation of the pilot projects, evaluate them at the end of the year and develop them in the best way possible.</P>
    <P>This service is about guidance, training, education and employment supports and will be managed by a local management committee operating <Col N="1559" /> under the area partnership boards. Obviously, links with local employers will be very important and I appeal to employers to take an interest in the service. A very important aspect of the placement service is its relationship with local employers. In other countries similar services have led to an improvement in the economy and the creation of jobs in certain areas. However, disadvantaged areas and the long term unemployed do not gain from these jobs as they have not been prepared or given the necessary training and skills. The way to deal with this is to develop strong links between the type of employment service recommended in the report and local employers. This has already been done in several areas and one can see a very good example in Coolock where the local employment service has developed good relationships with local employers, thereby ensuring that people who use the service are placed in jobs.</P>
    <P>In America the former President Jimmy Carter has taken a special interest in Atlanta and has developed a programme dealing with the problem of long-term unemployment which I believe will be copied by other countries. When he returned to Atlanta after his term as President he was shocked and dismayed at the level of unemployment, standard of living and disadvantage in what was supposed to be a thriving city. This very detailed programme encourages local neighbourhoods to create their own jobs and to link with the employment opportunities created in Atlanta. In Ringsend the local community centre is adopting a similar approach. It has developed the kind of placement service, job opportunities, training and education which will ensure that the long term unemployed will be able to find a way back into employment. This is the way forward.</P>
    <P>Changes are needed in our taxation policy to make it more attractive to create jobs and encourage the development of the services sector. The report on the development of services points <Col N="1560" /> out that there is a huge opportunity for us to create thousands of jobs in the services sector by the year 2000. We are still far behind our European partners in terms of the creation of jobs in the services area and given the right taxation climate and supports for small businesses &mdash; in this respect I welcome the initiative last week by the banks to make it easier for small businesses to obtain loans &mdash; we can, according to the ESRI medium term review for 1994-2000, increase the number of jobs in the services sector to 808,000 by the end of the century and to 880,000 by the year 2005. The projections of the creation of jobs are very positive and if we marry the proposals for tackling long term unemployment in the report of the National Economic and Social Forum &mdash; the Government has built on these in the interim report of the task force &mdash; with the proposals on the creation of jobs in the services sector and a supportive taxation climate then people will be properly trained to take up the jobs which should come on stream in it. The removal of the barriers to the creation of jobs in the services sector and the implementation of the proposals in this area will lead to a positive climate for the creation of jobs. This year the Government allocated £6 million for local training and the educational fund. A time-scale has been set for the implementation of this service and consideration will have to be given next year to the level of funding as the scheme develops.</P>
    <P>Links must also be developed between schools and the local employment service. This applies particularly in areas with high levels of long term unemployment. In the context of tackling the problem of early school leavers, there must be links with the early educational system and between training and schools. In the past we had a very cynical approach to training and many people were put into schemes and given training which were not carefully planned. Thankfully there have been improvements in this area. The training opportunities offered to people must be in tune with their needs and must lead <Col N="1561" /> to jobs or provide qualifications for jobs which are likely to arise in future. It is extremely important to focus on young people between 18-21 years.</P>
    <P>If we want to tackle the problem of long term unemployment then the training provided must be specific and marketable skills taught. It is obvious that effective programmes will return the largest number of people to work. It is also obvious that some people will need long term attention from a local employment service. The links with employers will be of major importance in the development of this service.</P>
    <P>The report suggests that the local employment service should develop a logo. It states:</P>
    <P>While retaining their separate identities as FÁS, social welfare or community-based centres and continuing to carry out their core function, these local contact points would share a common logo or label nationwide, identifying them as locations through which the local employment service can be accessed and where elements of the service will be available.</P>
    <P>This is a very good idea and it should be developed without delay. The long term unemployed will know that they go to these centres and get a high quality service which will help them in their efforts to find work.</P>
    <P>The Government's response to this report has been extremely positive. It has taken on board the essential recommendations in the National Economic and Social Forum's report on tackling long term unemployment. I look forward to the evaluation of that service in a year's time and the formulation of further plans for its development. In conjunction with the recomendations in the services report, it will create a positive climate which will help the long term unemployed return to work.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Justice</askee>
      <Quest>the views, if any, she has on whether the powers available to the Garda Síochána to have money in bank accounts frozen in the course of a criminal investigation are adequate.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen) Nora Owen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Criminal Justice Act, 1994 confers powers on the courts to order the seizure and confiscation of criminal proceeds where a person is convicted of drug trafficking or another serious criminal offence.</P>
      <P>Section 24 of the 1994 Act empowers the High Court to make restraint orders freezing assets which may be liable to realisation if a confiscation order is made at a later stage. The effect of a restraint order is to prohibit any person from dealing with the property to which the order applies. Applications for these orders are made by the Director of Public Prosecutions. They can be made without the need to give notice to a party against whom an order is sought.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The circumstances in which a restraint order may be made are set out in section 23 of the 1994 Act. Subsection (1) (a) of that section provides that the court may order property to be restrained where proceedings have been instituted against a person for a drug trafficking offence or for an indictable offence other than a drug trafficking offence and a confiscation order has either been made or may be made. Subsection (1) (b) of section 23 allows the High Court to make a restraint order where the court is satisfied that proceedings are to be instituted and it appears that a confiscation order may <Col N="1563" /> be made. This provision ensures that a restraint order can be obtained before a person is arrested or charged with an offence.</P>
    <P>In this context I should also mention section 63 of the Act which permits the Garda Síochána to apply to the District Court, for the purpose of an investigation into drug trafficking, money laundering or an offence in respect of which a confiscation order may be made, for an order requiring the disclosure of material which is relevant to the investigation. Failure to comply with an order made under section 63 is a criminal offence.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances, Deputies will appreciate that the 1994 Act contains very extensive provisions which enable our law enforcement authorities to identify and to secure restraint and confiscation orders in respect of the proceeds of drug trafficking and other criminal activity. The relevant sections of the Act came into operation in November 1994 and I am keeping them under active review. If they do not prove to be effective I will consider what further legislative changes in this area may be necessary and practicable. Deputies will be aware, of course, that the extent to which the Oireachtas can seek to interfere with private property rights is limited by the Constitution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no doubt that certain sections of the Criminal Justice Act, 1994, came into force almost 100 days after the Brinks Allied robbery and represented the greatest piece of political procrastination since Nero watched Rome burn. Will the Minister for Justice define what she considers to be a realisable asset?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Criminal Justice Act, 1994, was brought in by a previous Minister last year. The sections of the Act which I signed into order on 2 May required the setting up of a committee of the financial institutions that would be required to make known lodgments where they thought money laundering <Col N="1564" /> or some other nefarious act had led to the availability of these assets. That committee commenced its work last year and was still sitting when I took office. Any criticism the Deputy may have about the length of time it took to implement those sections of the Act should be levelled at somebody else. When I took office I made sure that work was completed so that I could bring those sections of the Act into operation.</P>
      <P>Realisable assets would be such things as money and property. The section 24 power allows for restraint orders to freeze assets which might be realisable; in other words, to freeze property or moneys that a person might be able to get rid of so that by the time it came to confiscate that money, in the event of a confiscation order being made, it might have already been disposed of. That is what I understand realisable assets to mean.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I respectfully suggest to the Minister that there is no power in Irish criminal law for the Garda to freeze money in the course of an investigation of a crime. In other words, where money is the suspected proceeds of criminal activity the Garda Síochána has no power to freeze those assets. If the Minister accepts that will she agree to the Fianna Fáil Bill, the Criminal Law (Proceeds of Crime) Bill, 1995?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Donoghue made this statement before. In <i>The Irish Times</i> of 1 May 1995 he is quoted as saying there was still no provision in law that would allow the courts to freeze suspect money in the course of a criminal investigation. This statement is not true. Section 23 (1) (b) of the Criminal Justice Act, 1994, allows a restraint order to be made against the assets of a person who is being investigated for a drug trafficking or another serious offence before criminal proceedings are instituted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to Deputy O'Donoghue's Bill, it would not be appropriate at <Col N="1565" /> Question Time to indicate my attitude to a Bill that has not been brought before this House. The Law Reform Commission moved away from the proposal contained in Deputy O'Donoghue's Bill because it said it would be unconstitutional. The Deputy is attempting to seize the assets of a person before a conviction. The Act, now in place, allows for the freezing or restraint of assets while a court case is taking place. Our Constitution would not allow the confiscation of a person's assets before a conviction. Certainly we can freeze and restrain assets during an investigation and a court case.</P>
    <P>It is wrong of Deputy O'Donoghue to continue to perpetuate the impression that the law does not allow for the freezing or restraint of assets during an investigation and before a conviction. What it does not allow is the confiscation of those assets before a conviction because that would be in breach of the personal provision in the constitution. It restrains people from realising those assets or doing anything with them.</P>
    <P>This Act was carefully examined and following that it was decided that the only way to ensure that we meet the requirements of the Constitution &mdash; Article 43 specifically &mdash; would be to provide for the making of confiscation orders following a conviction. In the event of any attempt to go beyond that, the relevant provisions in the Act would undoubtedly have serious constitutional implications and could conflict with our obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights. I repeat, this Act allows restraint and freezing orders on the assets before a conviction is obtained.</P>

      <P>The Minister hides behind the Constitution. Is the Minister aware she has power to freeze assets in the course of an investigation, if they are the assets of an unlawful organisation, under the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act, 1985? How does the Minister reconcile her view that the proposal contained in my Bill is unconstitutional, when such a power exists under the 1985 Act?</P>

      <P>This question is not about Deputy O'Donoghue's Bill. The other issue raised by the Deputy related to legislation enacted for a specific purpose. The reality is that the 1994 Criminal Justice Act confers powers on the courts to order the seizure and confiscation of criminal proceeds where a person is convicted, and section 24 empowers the High Court to place restraining and freezing orders. I want it to be clear that those powers are there and are already being used in our courts.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>The House will appreciate that my Department has a very extensive legislative programme and that it would not be practical by way of reply to a parliamentary question to deal in detail with every aspect of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I propose in the circumstances, a Cheann Comhairle, to concentrate in my reply on major legislative proposals to which I am attaching particular <Col N="1567" /> priority and on which work is well-advanced.</P>
    <P>The House will be aware that the Criminal Law (Incest Proceedings) (No. 2) Bill, 1995 and the Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons Bill, 1995, are before it at present.</P>
    <P>The Courts and Court Officers Bill, 1994 and the Refugee Bill, 1994, have remained before the House since the change of Government. I have been reviewing the provisions of both of those pieces of legislation and I expect to be in a position to proceed with my own proposals in these areas shortly.</P>
    <P>Work is being advanced on the Fundraising for Charitable and Other Purposes Bill which is being prepared in the light of the Costello report on this matter.</P>
    <P>The Government is determined to continue the process of extensive reform of the criminal law to ensure that the Garda and the courts have available to them effective and appropriate powers to deal with the modern realities of crime. I should mention that over the past decade or so many aspects of our criminal law have been very substantially updated and reformed and it would be entirely wrong for anyone to seek to create the impression that there is not already a very wide range of criminal law available. This is being used day in day out successfully in bringing the perpetrators of crime to justice.</P>
    <P>But, of course, more remains to be done and I can assure the House that I intend to bring forward the necessary legislative proposals as soon as I possibly can.</P>
    <P>I regard as a particular priority the finalisation of a Children Bill dealing with juvenile justice and I believe that the appointment of Deputy Currie as a Minister of State my Department as well as at the Departments of Health and Education will greatly facilitate this process. The new Bill will replace in its entirety the Children Act, 1908, and will represent the most comprehensive <Col N="1568" /> reform in the law in this area since the foundation of the State.</P>
    <P>I am concerned at some of the present procedural arrangements for dealing with criminal cases and, in particular, the amount of Garda time which is spent unproductively in court. Preparation of a Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill which will address this problem is at an advanced stage.</P>
    <P>There are a number of outdated procedures and practices which come to light as requiring change. I have arranged for a list of these to be prepared on an on-going basis with a view to introducing a new Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill each year. I believe that this will represent a major and welcome departure from previous arrangements which could lead to a situation where desirable changes were delayed because of the lack of a suitable legislative vehicle to bring about those changes.</P>
    <P>As promised in the Government policy agreement I have set up the National Bureau of Fraud Investigation. Their work will be underpinned by a new Fraud Offences Bill which will comprehensively amend and update the law on fraud offences with reference to recommendations made by the Law Reform Commission and the Government Advisory Committee on Fraud. Work is also well advanced on the preparation of a Criminal Law (Insanity) Bill.</P>
    <P>Work is also proceeding on the preparation of a Bill dealing with Non-fatal Offences Against the Person. This will represent a major reform of the law dealing with non-fatal offences against the person in the light of a Law Reform Commission report. It will involve the repeal and replacement of the bulk of the Offences Against the Person Act, 1861, and will generally codify the law relating to assault.</P>
    <P>A criminal law Bill which, among other things, will place powers of arrest without warrant on a modern statutory basis is also well advanced.</P>
    <P>The House will also be aware that I <Col N="1569" /> will be bringing comprehensive proposals to Government shortly on dealing with the drugs problem and, of course, the drafting of any legislative measures arising from those will be accorded priority. Of course, the Deputy will be aware that there are other commitments in the Programme for Government that relate to my Department, all of which are receiving attention.</P>
    <P>It will be clear to the House that a major programme of criminal law reform is well advanced and I am sure that I can look forward to co-operation from all sides of the House in advancing that programme.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister accept that it is totally unsatisfactory that, according to a response from her today, and from the Taoiseach previously no Bill will be published by the Department of Justice during this session to deal with escalating crime levels?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept what the Deputy has said. I have read out the list of legislation under preparation in my Department. There are four major pieces of legislation from the Department of Justice before the House which will be processed between now and the end of this parliamentary session. Deputies will also appreciate that any list of legislation is constantly updated to bring on line legislation that I or any other Minister feels should be put into the legislative programme. For example, when I took up office, I had no idea that I would have to bring in an amendment Act dealing with incest, but when a judge decided that people involved in treating victims of incest could not have any information about court cases, I immediately introduced legislation in this House for which I received praise in the other House from the Deputy's colleagues. That Bill will be dealt with in the Dáil. I will introduce any legislation that is required to fight crime, and it is wrong of the Deputy to give the <Col N="1570" /> impression that somehow just having a list of legislation is an effective way to fight crime. There is much legislation available now which the Garda are using day in and day out to fight criminals and put them behind bars.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister accept that the Court and Court Officers Bill and the Refugee Bill were entirely the work of her predecessor and that the Transfer of Sentenced Prisoners Bill was also largely the work of her predecessor? Will she further accept, since she brought up the Criminal Law (Incest) Bill, 1995, that that Bill was found in the Seanad to be wholly inadequate and she was obliged to replace substantial sections in the Bill with amendments contained in a Bill put forward by Fianna Fáil? Does the Minister not further accept that her obduracy and mean-spiritedness in not accepting a Bill on bail last night which was perfectly constitutional gives the impression that in the Minister's view, to use her own words, political expendiency is more important than dealing with the issue of crime?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>In response to some of the points made by Deputy O'Donoghue, I made a very extensive speech on this Bill, and he knows full well why I was not able to accept it. It is true that the Court and Court Officers Bill and the Refugee Bill were both published by the last Government, but they were published in a very precipitate manner. One hundred and sixty amendments were tabled to the Refugee Bill, which was not introduced in the House in the normal way, which would have allowed Members to trawl through the Bill and make suggestions, but went straight into Committee Stage. We know the circumstances in which some of these Bills were dealt with in the rather fraught months of October and November before the demise of the last Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In our Programme for Government we gave a commitment to examine those Bills. A Bill that required 80 <Col N="1571" /> amendments from the Minister who introduced it and another 80 amendments tabled by the Opposition clearly needed to be reviewed when we came into office. I am completing a review of the terms of that Bill so that we will have a better Bill, and will shortly bring it to the Government. Deputy O'Donoghue is trying to make political capital out of the way in which I handled a Bill in the Seanad, but Members of the Seanad recognised my desire to ensure that no further victims of incest might find themselves in a position where they could not get the protection they needed from health agencies, etc., and I was willing, having introduced the Bill, to listen to the amendments being put forward not just by Fianna Fáil but by others because I would have introduced such amendments myself.</P>
    <P>Perhaps Deputy O'Donoghue could demonstrate some of the cross-party constructive opposition that I saw in play in the Seanad by his own colleagues and members of the Progressive Democrats. He would do better to assist in the legislative programme than to try all the time to score petty political points because one of his Bills was not accepted by the Government.</P>

      <P>A total of 598 petitions have been finalised since 15 December 1994. A number of these would have already been in the process of consideration when I took office. Each case was considered on its merits and such reports as were considered necessary to <Col N="1572" /> assist in consideration of the petitions were sought from various sources.</P>
      <P>Four hundred and six of the petitions were refused. Extension of time to pay, of an average of three months, was provided in 71 cases and an offer of partial mitigation of fines was made to 94 petitioners. Fines were remitted in full in the remaining 27 petitions &mdash; most of which were remitted at the request of the prosecuting authority, the local authority or Garda Síochána, in cases where the fine-on-the-spot penalty had already been paid.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister agree that politicians should have no business in seeking to unravel penalties imposed by the courts and accept that the judgement handed down by Mr. Justice Geoghegan in the High Court was correct? What direction has she given within her Department to freeze and halt the petitions system? Mr. Justice Geoghegan stated in the High Court that this is an improper use of the Executive power to remit penalties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Mr. Justice Geoghegan did not declare in his judgment that this system is unconstitutional nor did he state that it should be done away with. He stated that it should be operated in the way intended under section 23 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1951, that is, sparingly. Therefore the power conferred on the Minister for Justice in that section has not been found to be unconstitutional. The Attorney General's advice to me is that the power to remit fines imposed by a court of law is the Executive administration of mercy rather than the judicial administration of justice; that the Constitution does not require that the exercise of such a power of remission by the Executive should involve a public hearing and that there is no legal obligation on the Executive to consult the district justice etc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The manner in which I have dealt with the 598 petitions is in keeping with what Mr. Justice Geoghegan demanded, that is, that it be used sparingly and <Col N="1573" /> where there are mitigating circumstances. No petitions have been dealt with in my Department since the judgement was handed down on 28 April.

    <P>Since the late 1980s the number of petitions received has increased considerably, from a figure of between 1,000 and 2,000 to between 5,000 and 6,000 per annum.

      <P>While I accept that the practice of remitting penalties by the Executive is not unconstitutional, will the Minister accept that the Constitution places an obligation on us to ensure that the justice system is seen to operate in a transparent way? Will she clarify whether she intends to introduce new guidelines or legislation and accept that any remission of fines should be a matter of public record and the information published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> as mentioned in the courts? Will she agree that in the context of our political culture the word should go out that applications to the Minister for Justice to have fines and penalties remitted should not be considered as a matter or routine at politicians' clinics?</P>

      <P>I made it clear within days of it being handed down that I would not be appealing the judgment and that I would consider which method should be adopted within the Department of Justice. Issues such as whether information should be published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> are being considered. I also understand that the issue of whether persons should be allowed to pay fines on a phased basis has been considered many times by previous Ministers for Justice. I have commenced an examination of the practicalities involved. Such <Col N="1574" /> a move would involve major administrative changes in District Court offices which would have to collect a few pounds each week from someone on low income. The new procedures will be announced when finalised.</P>

      <P>Air support to the Garda Síochána is currently provided by the Air Corps and there is little doubt that air support is an effective and important aid in combating criminal activity. The support provided by the Air Corps to the Garda Síochána has proved to be very effective in this regard.</P>
      <P>The question whether the Garda Síochána should have a dedicated aerial unit has often been raised over the years. It requires careful examination because of the potentially high costs involved and the need to determine how best to provide the force with the most effective air support. The availability of dedicated air support for policing is very much the way in which this is dealt with in other jurisdictions. This, and all other aspects will be examined by the interdepartmental working group which I recently established to look at air support for the Garda Síochána. The group is representative of officials from my Department, the Departments of Defence and Finance and the Garda Síochána, and will have suitable expertise available to it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that there is a need for an aerial <Col N="1575" /> unit in the Garda Síochána, comprising fixed wing aircraft and helicopters, in view of the fact that Border controls have been removed and the predictions that this country would be vulnerable to large movements of drugs have proved to be correct? An aerial unit should be established as a matter of urgency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Given that I have initiated an examination of this matter the Deputy may take it that I favour the provision of full air support to the Garda Síochána. This is currently provided by the Air Corps. It will be part of the work of the interdepartmental working group to examine the question of the adequacy of this service. Where available, it has proved to be very effective but no service is available at night time. As the air Corps has other business to transact, the working group will consider whether it is necessary to buy aeroplanes or helicopters for the Garda Síochána as part of a dedicated service. I have asked the group to complete its work as quickly as possible, hopefully by the end of the summer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, wish to acknowledge the contribution made by the Air Corps but does the Minister accept that, because it is involved in other work, such as fisheries protection and air and sea rescue, it cannot make facilities available at all times to the Garda Síochána and that there is no need for yet another committee or policy group to decide one simple question? What she is really saying is that she is putting it off for another day because she will not fund it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not the reason I am putting it off for another day. It has been found in other jurisdications that the availability of dedicated air support from the Air Corps is the most effective way of providing such a service to the police force given that trained personnel are already available which reduces the length of time it takes to introduce <Col N="1576" /> the system. I want the working group to report back once it has determined which is the most effective way, whether it be the purchase of new aeroplanes and sending personnel away to be trained or dedicating the service that is already available and which would not be required to do any other work. I have commenced this procedure and I hope to be able to deliver before the end of the year. It is not therefore a question of putting this off until some date in the future. I have undertaken this study precisely because air support is necessary for a modern police force.</P>

However, as I mentioned during the course of the Second Stage debate on the Bill, the Irish Commission for Prisoners overseas has estimated that the number of prisoners who would seek a transfer in the first year would be about 40 and that, thereafter, the number would level off at less then ten a year.

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I will answer some parts of the question. Deputy O'Donoghue will have read the convention to which this legislation gives effect. That convention is very clear on how this system will work. It is a voluntary system whereby the prisoner, the receiving jurisdiction and the imprisoning jurisdiction must agree to the transfer. The proposal put forward by the Deputy does not relate to the convention and therefore does not relate to the legislation.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">

      <P>Neither the convention nor the legislation distinguishes between one prisoner and another or between one crime and another. I will consider all applications in the normal way without giving preference to any prisoner. I cannot give a definitive cost because no study has been undertaken in this regard. We are still in limbo in terms of the number of applications that will be made. The Bill provides that the cost of transferring a prisoner from one jurisdiction to another will be carried by the jurisdiction from which the prisoner will be transferred.</P>

      <QRef>[7667/95]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the concern of Members of this House and the general public about the way in which syringes are being used as weapons of crime. Attacks made with syringes are deeply distressing for a victim who is faced with the threat of being infected with HIV or some other serious disease. The main provisions of our criminal law which can be invoked against persons who use syringes in connection with the commission of criminal offences are contained in the Larceny Act, 1916, and the Firearms and Offensive weapons Act, 1990. Section 23 of the 1916 Larceny Act, as substituted by the criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Act, 1976, provides that a person is guilty of robbery if he or she steals, and immediately before or at the time of doing so, and in order to do so, he or she uses force on any person or puts or seeks to put any person in fear of being then and there subjected to force. The maximum penalty for the offence of robbery is imprisonment for life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Part III of the Firearms and Offensive Weapons Act, 1990, provides for a wide range of offences relating to offensive weapons. Many of these offences apply in the case of the carrying and use of syringes for criminal purposes. In particular, section 10 of the Act states that a person who is on any premises as a trespasser is guilty of an offence if he or <Col N="1580" /> she is in possession of any weapon of offence. For that purpose a weapon of offence is defined to include any article intended by the person having it to cause injury to or to incapacitate another person. In addition, section 11 of the 1990 Act provides that a person commits an offence if, while committing an offence, he or she produces, in a manner likely unlawfully to intimidate another person, any article capable of inflicting serious injury. A person who is convicted of an offence under section 10 or section 11 of the Firearms and Offensive Weapons Act can be sentenced to imprisonment for up to five years.</P>
    <P>Our law, therefore, already provides for the imposition of heavy penalties on a person who threatens, or may threaten, others with a syringe in the course of committing a robbery or another offence. I am, of course, keeping the law in this area under review and if any additional legislative measures are needed I will bring forward appropriate proposals.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. L. Fitzgerald Mr. L. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>When referring to syringes and needles the Minister did not say the use of these items endangers life. Will she accept that the use of blood-filled syringes endanger life in the same way as would a dagger or gun, and that there is an urgent need to review legislation to take account of that? Will she also accept that people fear blood-filled syringes and needles more than they fear a loaded gun because they know they may be killed instantly from a loaded gun whereas with the use of a blood-filled syringe may sentence them to death over a two, three four or five year period? The point I am making is that the public have a deep fear of the use of syringes as offensive weapons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I again confirm that, under the Firearms and Offensive Weapons Act and the Larceny Act, people have been convicted of carrying and using syringes as offensive weapons. The law has been used effectively in that regard. A robbery offence which <Col N="1581" /> can attract a life sentence applies to any case where property is stolen with the use or threat of force. A person holding a syringe as an offensive weapon has been found to be using that threat of force. As I said earlier to Deputy O'Donoghue, one of the Bills I am preparing in response to recommendations of the Law Reform Commission deals with non-fatal offences against the person. The Deputy said that the law as it stands cannot be used effectively to deal with such offences, but it has. However, I will keep an open mind as to whether it requires strengthening. I know the point the Deputy is making that holding a syringe while committing a robbery is a threat of force and can be used in evidence against the offender.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. L. Fitzgerald Mr. L. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept what the Minister said as the factual position but will she accept that this category of crime is increasing, particularly in the Dublin area? The Minister and I represent neighbouring constituencies and I am sure she accepts that there is a serious increase in such crime in our constituencies, particularly in urban areas. Will she accept also that the extent of unreported incidents is increasing? I cite the example of people challenged on street corners who are robbed by thugs but who are relieved to get out of danger and do not want to subject themselves to the further inconvenience &mdash; although I could use a stronger word &mdash; of having to formally report a crime and go through the formal procedures. Will the Minister accept that such crime, as well as being serious, is increasing in Dublin?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept it is a heinous crime. As the Deputy said, in many instances people who have been subjected to an attack or a threatened attack by a person holding a syringe suffer greater fear and longer-term effects than those subjected to an attack not involving such a threat. Regarding <Col N="1582" /> the type of offences to which the Deputy referred, it is an offence to intimidate a person with a syringe and a prosecution can be taken on that basis, one does not have to be stabbed with the syringe. Any improvement in the law to ensure that type of action is treated in the most serious way under our criminal laws would be welcome, but I confirm that the law as it stands has been effectively used to deal with this type of crime.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Since it would be extremely difficult to make it an offence to carry a syringe as doctors, veterinary surgeons etc., carry them, will the Minister accept that the easiest and best manner of resolving this problem is to make the consumption of a controlled substance a criminal offence?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a different question. I am answering one about methods by which we can control the use of and effectively prosecute people using syringes. I told Deputies that the law as it stands allows for that type of prosecution and I support extension of the law to deal adequately with such crimes. As Deputy O'Donoghue said, the law does not prevent a diabetic or a doctor from carrying a syringe and that is one of the difficulties that would have to be taken into consideration in drafting future legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree it is reasonable to conclude that persons who use a syringe in such attacks would probably be heroin addicts? As there are 6,000 heroin addicts in Dublin and only 400 receive treatment, will she agree it would be far more appropriate if the Minister of <Col N="1583" /> State in the Departments of Health and Justice got together to introduce a methadone maintenance programme throughout the city and in other urban centres?</P>

      <P>Will the Minister articulate more clearly the need to realise that the word &ldquo;article&rdquo; is extremely broad and to list the possible objects which could be considered articles for the benefit of the Director of Public Prosecutions and others interested in such cases? Syringes, cars and quite a number of other things are used in crime. Is it true that the use of stolen cars only constitutes dangerous driving rather than a threat to life? I hope the Minister will consider those matters.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree <Col N="1584" /> that the use of a syringe, irrespective of whether its contents are HIV positive, constitutes attempted murder, not merely attempted robbery, and should be treated as such? The Minister quoted that a five years' maximum sentence applies to such an offence&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;or life imprisonment which can be eight to 12 years with remission. If an offender is HIV positive, and uses a contaminated syringe, it constitutes a death sentence for the victim. Will the Minister agree that there should be a separate offence of attempted murder in such cases rather than attempted robbery?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I clarify that section 23 of the Larceny Act provides for the offence of robbery which would include stealing with the use of a syringe. A person convicted of that offence can be sentenced to life imprisonment. The offences to which I referred cover the position where a person is intimidated by another holding a syringe, but not where he or she is stabbed with it. If the person is stabbed with the syringe, the attacker can be charged with unlawful wounding under section 18 of the Offences Against the Persons Act, 1861, or, perhaps, as requested by the Deputy, attempted murder. Both those offences can attract a sentence of life imprisonment. That penalty is allowable depending on the charge.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Even if a syringe is not used in an attack the mere threat of it is more dangerous and frightening than a gun. That is why I ask the Minister to consider stepping up the penalties for robbery offences involving the use of a syringe, the most heinous of all crimes.</P>

      <P>I do not have figures for the number of intimidatory attacks with syringes. I can assure Deputy Fitzgerald that I am as concerned as he at the increasing use of syringes as offensive weapons. As all Members said to be threatened with a syringe, without knowledge of its contents, must be the most terrifying experience. Any updating of the law required will be undertaken. While I am satisfied that existing laws can and have been used effectively in examining the non-fatal offences against the person legislation, which I hope to introduce in the House later this year, I will re-examine this matter.</P>

      <P>I am preparing legislation which will repeal the Children Act, 1908 and replace it with a comprehensive modern statute. The proposed Bill will deal with most aspects of the juvenile justice system. It will be appreciated that at this stage I cannot be specific about its content.</P>

      <P>While I share Deputy Briscoe's concern I am not sure it is a matter solely for the Children Bill falling within the remit of the Department of Justice. The Deputy will be aware that I wear other hats. In my ministerial role within the Department of Education I have established a Task Force on Truancy which would also cover the problem of bullying at school. I shall certainly examine the matter. However, bullying is a complex problem that can go from name-calling to physical violence, with a whole range of intimidatory practices in between, such as the isolation of individual children at school &mdash; colloquially referred to as sending one to Coventry &mdash; which can render a child's life absolute purgatory. I am aware there is ever growing concern within our society about bullying. I shall take the most intense, interest in examining its effects and countering them whether wearing my Justice or Education hat.</P>

In the course of any review to be undertaken and in drafting legislation will the Minister ensure greater responsibility is placed on parents, something we are not inclined to do?</P>

However, it is not a matter solely for the Department of Justice but one for the Department of Education and Health also and I shall examine it within that broader spectrum. This is another of those problems in respect of which, in terms of their resolution, it is a mistake to think that there is but one solution. There is a myriad of remedies.</P>

When I receive its report we will engage in wider consultations with other Departments and interested bodies. We are determined to grapple in the most effective way with the problem of truancy. The specific question we are supposed to be discussing, that of bullying, is part of the reason some children do not attend school.</P>

Have the recommendations of the all-party committee on juvenile justice and crime been taken into account in the drafting of the Bill?

I have nothing to add to what I said regarding the responsibility of parents. When the Deputy and I attended school truancy meant that one left home in the morning with a satchel and returned home at approximately 3.30 p.m. pretending to have attended school. In some cases children are now staying at home from school to look after parents who are addicted to drugs or drink. Parental responsibility must also be viewed in the context of children exercising responsibility. The question must be addressed in a wider context.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 and 10 together.</P>
      <P>On 1 January 1995 there was a total of 249 members of the force engaged full time on community policing duties in urban areas throughout the country. Some 197 of these were located in the Dublin metropolitan area while the remainder, comprising 52 members, were based in the Cork, Limerick, Galway, Waterford, Sligo-Leitrim, Louth-Meath, Longford-Westmeath and Tipperary divisions. This system of community policing was first introduced in 1987 in the Dublin metropolitan area and has been expanding since then.</P>
      <P>While I am aware that community gardaí are diverted from their community policing duties from time to time, I am informed by the Garda authorities that this is not something that is done readily and only occurs in cases of absolute necessity. Of course, Garda management must be free to deploy the members of the force in accordance with the demands placed on it. The Garda authorities recognise and respect the unique and important role which community gardaí play in the prevention and detection of crime in local communities, the diversion of community gardaí to other policing duties is kept to an absolute minimum and members are returned to community policing duties in their localities as soon as circumstances allow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister accept that in reality community gardaí are allocated to other duties on a regular basis and that priority must be given to preventative policing? Will she agree that such policing not only acts as a deterrent to criminals but is an important reassurance particularly to <Col N="1592" /> the elderly who feel safer when it is in place? Will she also agree that the recommendations of the Lord Mayor's commission on crime should be implemented immediately by the Government? Those recommendations include the setting up of new rosters, the transfer of traffic functions to other bodies, the reduction of Garda time spent in court and increased civilian duties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the Deputy's sentiments that once community policing is assigned to an area it should remain in place. The daily deployment of Garda forces in stations is a matter for Garda management. I do not dictate to it regarding the assignment of gardaí. Almost every time I meet the Commissioner I raise with him the need to ensure that community policing is in fact community policing. It is realistic to expect, however, that from time to time it would be necessary for local Garda management to take gardaí out of community policing to deal with, say, a major crime or to police a major function in a community. I will pass on the Deputy's comments to the Garda Commissioner. The report of the Lord Mayor's commission on juveniles has been made available to the Garda and its recommendations are being examined. Issues relating to new rosters and so on are matters for Garda management.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the Minister's point, but does she not accept that it is an indication of a lack of leadership for her to allow total autonomy to be exercised by Garda management? On foot of the cross-party belief that community policing is not getting the priority it requires, given the high level of fear regarding crime among citizens, Garda management needs direction from the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Garda Commissioner is well aware of my desire to have community policing extended. I <Col N="1593" /> met a number of Deputations on community policing from all over the country. It is incorrect for the Deputy to say I cannot indicate to the Commissioner the areas to which I would give priority, but the day-to-day employment of gardaí is a matter for Garda management. A Minister for Justice cannot run the daily affairs of Garda stations. I do not believe the Deputy would want a Minister to interfere politically with the day-to-day placements of gardaí and the work they are doing because he or she would not be aware of all the demands involved. I can assure the Deputy I have already indicated to the Commissioner my own views about community policing and they are the same as the Deputy's.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware of the severe criticism levied against the community policing system at the recent Garda Representative Association Conference? In this context, will she at least issue a recommendation to the Commissioner that those gardaí allocated to community policing would provide that kind of policing other than in exceptional circumstances?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to community policing and the need to prioritise this form of preventative policing, as it was called, and following on a similar parliamentary question that I asked during a previous Question Time, has the Minister had an opportunity to act on her commitment to ensure that community policing vacancies arising due to illness or some other reason are filled? In the Minister's own constituency, which is now actually part of Dublin West, vacancies that arise for whatever reason are not being filled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1594" />
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I recall the Deputy raising this issue with me on a previous occasion and, following on that, I made the necessary contacts requesting that no vacancies should be left unfilled. From time to time, vacancies occur due to retirements or promotions. Those vacancies are filled but that may not occur the day immediately after a retirement or a promotion. However, if the Deputy wishes to give me details of particular community policing vacancies that exist, I will investigate those.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanKenneally" hpid="Mr. Kenneally Mr. Kenneally">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenneally</NameTxt>
      <P>I was disturbed to hear the Minister say in her reply that transfers from community policing are kept to a minimum. I am glad such transfers are kept to a minimum but they should not be taking place at all because it sends out the message that we are not serious about community policing. I believe the flow should be towards putting more gardaí into community policing because prevention is always better than cure. The Minister said that 249 gardaí are currently involved in community policing, with 197 of those in Dublin and the remaining 52 located around the country. What are the Minister's plans to expand the community policing scheme because I believe it is an area to which we are not giving sufficient attention. I want to see community policing being increased in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I too would prefer if community gardaí were not diverted into other areas of fighting crime. However, I am assured by the Garda Síochána that community gardaí are not moved from their work except for the most serious of reasons. The example I gave was the committing of a major crime where the assistance of the gardaí from several areas might be required. I will get back to the Deputy on the type of proposals the Garda has in regard to expanding the scheme. Since 1987, the community policing scheme has expanded gradually each year. I would like to see it expand even further and, as the peace process continues, and as <Col N="1595" /> we begin to lose the burden of policing our Border areas, I hope to be able to divert resources into this type of scheme.</P>

      <P>Accepting the principle of community policing, is the Minister satisfied that rural areas are being properly policed when one considers the restructuring of rural Garda stations and the high levels of crime in rural areas? Is the Minister satisfied that there is sufficient Garda presence in our rural towns and villages? Rural stations are being downgraded, hours of opening of stations are being limited and many stations do not have a sergeant on duty, to the annoyance of rural communities.</P>

      <P>Yes, but the Deputy extended the question to include the whole issue of Garda stations, etc. There are approximately 11,000 gardaí available to the Commissioner to deploy throughout the country. On an ongoing basis, a review of that deployment is carried out by the Garda Commissioners. Responsibility for the deployment of those gardaí rests wholly with the Garda Commissioner.

      <P>I am sorry to be repetitive but I must remind the Deputy that the actual deployment of gardaí is a matter for the Commissioner. The population of Waterford, which has 114 gardaí, is 42,000. The population of Limerick, with 311 gardaí, is 80,000 and the population listed here for Galway, with 134 gardaí, is 38,000. The Deputy <Col N="1597" /> will see, therefore, that Galway, with 134 gardaí out of a population of 38,000, is doing relatively well compared to Limerick or Waterford.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister ask her officials or whoever prepared the reply to the question where they got the statistics on population because the population of the Galway borough area is 55,000?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I will certainly do that. As the Deputy knows, Galway city is policed by Mill Street Garda Station and there is a separate Garda Station in Salthill. I do not know whether the Deputy's figures include Salthill but 51 gardaí are stationed in Salthill. The Deputy's figures probably combine the two. The figures I have given are for Mill Street Garda Station, which covers Galway city. The figure, therefore, is actually 134 plus 51.</P>

      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>I must dispute the Minister's figures. The Galway borough area has a population of 55,000. Salthill, which has now become the divisional station, will include large areas of Connemara, increasing the total population involved to approximately 70,000 or 75,000. If one compares the 185 gardaí in Galway, including Salthill, with the 311 gardaí in Limerick, with its population of 80,000, one finds a huge discrepancy. The two cities are about the same size but there is a lower ratio of Garda Síochána per head of population in Galway and Waterford cities than in Limerick city.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>The deployment of gardaí in individual areas is a matter for the Garda authorities but they take into account such things as the level of crime, population, the size of the area and so on. In 1994 Limerick city had almost three times the crime level of Waterford city and just over twice that of Galway city. The crime statistics for <Col N="1598" /> 1994 were: Waterford, 1,190; Limerick, 3,109 and Galway, 1,487. The Garda take into account not only the population but the type and level of crime and the requirements for the deployment of gardaí.</P>
      <P>I will pass on the Deputy's comments to the Garda Commissioner for his consideration.</P>

      <P>It is quite obvious from the figures that have been given that the Garda representation in Waterford city is well below that of Galway or Limerick cities. I know from a meeting we had with the Minister on a different matter that she accepts that point but will she ensure that as gardaí come off Border duty they are deployed in areas that are under-represented? The crime figures for Waterford may be low but if the appropriate policing resources are not allocated, the crime rate will rise as it has done in other cities. It is important to ensure that Waterford has the appropriate number of gardaí in order to prevent that happening in the future.</P>

      <P>Modern policing methods do not seem to take into account the development of certain cities and the <Col N="1599" /> advent of huge local authority estates on the perimeter of cities. Has the Minister considered a policy of locating a number of substations in sprawling estates rather than having a concentration of gardaí in one central station.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I favour this development and it is already in place in areas of Dublin where substations and clinics which answer directly to a division or district headquarters are open for certain hours of the day, and when the clinic or substation is closed telephone calls automatically go through to the central station.</P>
      <P>In growing cities such as Waterford where there may be one large Garda station that does not seem to touch the lives of the people in the suburbs, one requires that kind of infrastructure in the sprawling suburbs. I met recently with a deputation from Waterford and I am considering their proposals and I hope to be in a position to give them information on it shortly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MattBrennan" hpid="Mr. M. Brennan Mr. M. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to have the opportunity to contribute to this debate. This excellent report by the task force on long term unemployment is long overdue. We must concentrate on training our people for industry. I am not too happy about the way apprentices are being trained. I know from making representations on behalf of young boys that it is difficult for young people to be sponsored on an apprenticeship, particularly in tool making and carpentry. There are builders in a small way in rural Ireland who would be delighted to take on an apprentice but having to pay them when they are doing their one year off-the-job training in FÁS and for the period of block release deters them from taking them on. The builders find it difficult enough to make ends meet when employing three or four people but they would have even greater difficulty in paying someone for 12 months on a FÁS block release course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Can something be done for small <Col N="1651" /> building contractors. I was an apprentice carpenter but at that time you were taken on by a small builder and served an apprenticeship for four to five years until you were a fully skilled carpenter and then advanced to a joinery shop. At that time you only had to serve an apprenticeship and not attend block release courses. I completely agree with the one year off-the-job training in a FÁS training centre but it is difficult for some employers to pay the apprentice when he is doing this course. The same applies to tool making. Small tool making concerns would prefer to take on a trained person because of the cost of training. I ask the Minister to change that. We need industry in rural Ireland and every town and village needs three phase electricity. If it had been available in a small village near me a factory could have set up there which would have employed five people. Instead it had to locate elsewhere. The Minister with responsibility for the west should ensure that every village has three phase electricity and a sewerage scheme. If those facilities were available more people would settle in rural villages.</P>
    <P>I wish to pay tribute to a former Member of the House, the late James Gallagher from Tubbercurry, my predecessor. He, more than anyone else, saw the need for industry in the west. He brought the first tool-making factory to the country in the early 1960s and located it in Tubbercurry. As a result there is much industry in Sligo. Sligo Regional Technical College is now the centre of tool-making in Ireland. He also set up the Basta factory in Tubbercurry. Many years ago if you wanted to get a grant for a house a Basta lock had to be fitted to the doors of the house. The industry thrived during those years. However, today architects design massive offices but do not recommend the use of Basta locks or any Basta equipment. All the locks are imported. How do we expect industry to survive if we do not support it? Look around this <Col N="1652" /> House and at most Government buildings. There is not as much as one Irish made lock on the doors. Basta now export to Scandanavia, Africa and the West Indies. It is trying to find markets while we import locks. That is a shame when we have such a fine factory in County Sligo which can provide the product.</P>
    <P>Our road infrastructure is not good enough although it has improved greatly. It is expensive to bring an articulated truck from the west to the ports of Dublin or Rosslare. Sligo airport is not going as well as it should and Aer Lingus operate only one flight a day to Sligo. It could operate to Carrickfinn in Donegal, Sligo and Knock airports and bring industrialists to the west. Knock airport was used as a political football for many years and one Member called it a foggy bog. However, many people now use this airport.</P>
    <P>Farming is not only a great industry but a way of life in rural Ireland. I listened to farmers protesting yesterday that ferry companies and do-gooders will not allow them export cattle. I hope the matter will be solved in the near future.</P>
    <P>The Dublin-Sligo railway line, which was treated as a political football for many years, should be upgraded. It would make it easier for industry and those who wish to travel to the west. I pay tribute to the multinationals such as Abbott Laboratories (Ireland) Ltd., and Saehan Media who employ people in Sligo. They are great employers and are doing very well. The workers are happy.</P>
    <P>Everyone would like to have a job. Too many people are unemployed. I was talking to people who are happy to be working on a FÁS schemes. Stone towns and villages have benefited from projects under FÁS schemes. Stone walls were built and villages and graveyards were cleaned up. More money should be made available for FÁS schemes. I know they only offer temporary employment but they give people the dignity of working for a while.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanKenny" hpid="Mr. S. Kenny Mr. S. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>On the points made by <Col N="1653" /> Deputy Brennan on the Gallagher empire and Basta locks, the house I purchased in 1969 was built by the Gallagher group and it has Basta locks, which I had to replace with stronger locks. The Sligo builders did not only build houses in Sligo, they also built houses in Dublin city.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Interim Report of the Task Force on Long Term Unemployment and the acceptance by the Government of the key proposal that a nationwide integrated local employment service should be established to bring together Government Departments, State agencies, the social partners and community interests to meet the needs of the long term unemployed. This service honours the commitment in the programme A Government of Renewal to introduce an intensive guidance and placement service at local level. This decision has been made against the background of the serious problem of long term unemployment. Ten per cent of the workforce or 135,000 people are now long term unemployed. A solution to this crisis is the greatest challenge facing the Government and society. By pooling their resources these separate groups can provide intensive guidance, counselling, training, education, job placement and support for self employment as available options for the long term unemployed. This service can provide a gateway to the world of work for the four main groups identified in the report, namely those who have been out of work for more than six months, dependant spouses of the unemployed, lone parents and the young unemployed. A particular difficulty exists for people who are long term unemployed and over 35 years of age. The new service should focus on this group which is at the core of the long term unemployed. While registration with the local employment service will be voluntary, the service should be proactive in reaching out to those most in need of employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report recommends setting up community-based contact points to bring the employment service to the <Col N="1654" /> long term unemployed. The contact point developed in my constituency by the north side partnership and the north side centre for the unemployed at Glen Road in Coolock is the model on which the local employment service is based. The north side partnership was set up under the Programme for Economic and Social Progress to develop strategies to combat long term unemployment. It identified the need for an effective local job placement service and various models and approaches were researched before a Dutch model was discovered. This model was adapted to meet the needs and requirements of the Irish market. There are three key elements to the placement programme used by the north side contact point: first, an intensive personal approach to the unemployed and employers; second, it seeks to develop a relationship of trust with the individuals seeking work and potential employers and, third, information is collected from various agencies and organisations concerning the capabilities of people seeking work.</P>
    <P>The Coolock contact point understands the supply and demand side of the labour market and it has gained the confidence of both people seeking work and employers. Qualified guidance counsellors and mediators form the core of the team at the contact point. The mediators who have backgrounds in industry, State placement services and education work with the job seeker in analysing his or her position and developing a realistic plan of action to reach the goal of suitable employment. This may require periods of training or education before the job seeking can begin. Implementing the career path is then undertaken by the team who match the needs and capabilities of the individual job seeker with the requirement of the employer.</P>
    <P>The contact point was very encouraged by references in the National Economic and Social Forum's Report on Long-Term Unemployment to its importance as a worthwhile model for local placement services. That report launched in the building which houses <Col N="1655" /> the contact point in Coolock indicates that the key ingredient in the progress made by the contact point is the cohesion, commitment and unity of purpose of the three broad groups on the board &mdash; the community, businesses and trade unions and the State and local authorities. This year the north side partnership was extended by the Government and it now covers Sutton Cross, Kilbarrack and parts of Raheny and Clontarf.</P>
    <P>I will give some figures to illustrate the success of the contact point which will be the model for the employment service. Up to the beginning of this month 2,042 people had registered in the contact point as seeking work. In 1993, its first year of operation, it placed 204 people in employment while in 1994 it placed 607 people in employment. This represents a dramatic threefold increase over the figure for the previous year. That in itself gives hope that new methods of job placement will work. It is important to point out that 78 per cent of those 800 people are still in employment today. The north side partnership area has a population of 88,000, of whom 31,000 or 30 per cent are unemployed. This figure is almost double the national average.</P>
    <P>The extension of the north side partnership will require a new office as the service needs to be located and delivered close to the problem. St. Benedict's Resource Centre in Kilbarrack could be used as the second contact point in the north side partnership area. This contact point is at the heart of the north side partnership's links between local unemployed people and employers. Since its formation in 1973 the north side partnership contact point has worked at strengthening the links between employers and the unemployed. Many of these links were formed at breakfast meetings hosted and organised by the employers on the partnership board. The contact point has developed these links and at present more than 100 companies use it to recruit personnel. This service is free to employers whose <Col N="1656" /> recruitment needs are thoroughly explored so as to ensure that their requirements are matched with the ability and skills of the clients registered with the contact point. The recruitment needs of large, medium and small companies are dealt with in a professional and thorough way by the staff of the contact point. The area partnerships established under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> have been extended to 33 areas under the local development programme.</P>
    <P>The interim report deals with the perceived value of community employment schemes, which are very much in the news at present. Unlike wages, the income received by participants on the scheme is calculated by reference to social welfare benefits. Participants pay the J rate of PRSI as opposed to the normal A rate. This has long term implications for the future social welfare entitlements of the participants on the scheme, and it requires further consideration. The work experience gained by participants on community employment schemes has all the hallmarks of employment but it is not always valued as such by prospective employers. The task force must consider the importance of this experience and carry out research into the attitude of the sponsors and participants.</P>
    <P>Some community employment schemes have had to let people go. When he raised this point this morning, Deputy Ahern conveniently overlooked the fact that the money provided in the Fianna Fáil Estimates at the end of last year would have catered for 26,000 participants whereas the money provided by the Government will cater for an average of 38,500 participants each year. However, this does not meet all the requirements and some people will not be able to continue on schemes. I ask the Government to review the community employment schemes. The difference between a community employment scheme and a social welfare benefit is marginal and in some cases all that is happening is finance is being transferred from the Department of <Col N="1657" /> Social Welfare to the Department of Enterprise and Employment.</P>
    <P>In other areas of the city &mdash; I am sure this is true of other cities and towns &mdash; these schemes have provided immense benefits. In my own area of Priorswood the Fairfield Development Association and the Priorswood community programme do magnificent work in the community and bring hope to the long term unemployed and to communities suffering through various forms of depravation, drug problems and so on which are a direct follow-on from high unemployment.</P>
    <P>I ask the Government to review the community employment schemes and to take into account the marginal difference between social welfare benefit and paying a person who wants to work on a community employment scheme and gain some work experience.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AndrewBoylan" hpid="Mr. Boylan Mr. Boylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to make a brief contribution on what is a very important subject. I congratulate the Minister on bringing the task force report before the House for discussion and I compliment those Deputies who availed of the opportunity to contribute to the debate. It is important to show the unemployed that there are people who are concerned and trying to do something about their plight. The feeling of despair experienced by the long term unemployed is unimaginable; they feel nobody cares and that nobody is trying to do anything about it. That is wrong but I understand their feeling. It is important that there would be contributions from all parts of the country to show we are concerned and that we are trying to come to grips with the problem. There is only so much the Government can do. I will return to this issue later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recall a former Taoiseach, Jack Lynch, who took office in the late 1970s when the unemployment rate was approximately 80,000 saying that if it reached 100,000 he would resign. The employment rate far exceeded 100,000 and the then Taoiseach did not resign. He was a decent man and I am not casting any reflection on him. Since then <Col N="1658" /> unemployment has spiralled. In round figures we are talking about 300,000 people unemployed, many of whom have been unemployed all their lives and second generations are unemployed which is terrible. In many households no effort is made to go out to work and the State provides minimal income. Unemployment leads to further problems.</P>
    <P>In my constituency of Cavan-Monaghan unemployment is not a major problem but that is not a reason for complacency. I am aware that in the densely populated large cities and towns, including Dublin and Cork there are housing estates where the rate of unemployment is 50 per cent or 60 per cent of the workforce. Such high unemployment leads to trouble. As a consequence of boredom and having nothing to do people go to the pubs, the betting offices or turn to drugs or violence. What can we do about it? As I said, there is only so much the Government can do.</P>
    <P>People will have to do more and we will have to educate them on those lines. There is no point in sitting around and saying: &ldquo;The State owes me a job&rdquo;. The State does not owe anybody anything. That is a wrong attitude. It is surprising what people with initiative can do. It may not be their objective when they start out in life but when they finally get a job and are in the circle of employment, they find that one job leads to another, thus improving their position. Even if people have set their minds on a particular job they should be prepared to accept less. There are several examples of people who have worked their way up the ladder. In areas of large scale unemployment people are not given the chance to work and, therefore, there is no possibility of improving one's position.</P>
    <P>Communities and community leaders have a role to play. When young people get into the habit of getting up in the morning and going to a job they take an interest in it. I have in mind the marvellous community employment schemes. Five to ten years ago there was an unfavourable attitude to those <Col N="1659" /> schemes and some of the work was vandalised. That has changed dramatically and people are beginning to realise the value of improving their own area by restoring old buildings, monuments and so on, which are part and parcel of our history. The FÁS schemes are marvellous and I ask the Minister to address the cutbacks in those schemes. I am aware of the benefits of those schemes and the skills taught. For example, I thought the old skill of stone masonry had become extinct but there are young people who are well qualified and capable of doing this work. That has come through our education system, particularly the vocational education system, where the skills of carpentry, ironwork and masonry are taught.</P>
    <P>This brings me back to the crucial subject of education. I cannot emphasise enough that we should endeavour to keep our children at school to receive the maximum education. When I was at school I thought I would never get out of it. I thought it would be great to see the end of it but that is not good enough. In my day a primary certificate at national school ensured one got a job, if one had the leaving certificate one got a very good job. That is no longer sufficient. Now one must go to third level colleges &mdash; not necessarily university &mdash; such as to the regional college of further study in Cavan where wide-ranging skills in secretarial work, household management, cookery, pre-nursing and so on are taught. My advice to boys and girls &mdash; I go out of my way very often to give them a lift to football matches &mdash; is to remain at school. Parents have a role to play here. If the parents are unemployed their attitude towards education is that one is wasting one's time. This is serious.</P>
    <P>Career guidance teachers &mdash; we have an excellent person in Cavan Vocational School &mdash; constantly follow up on children who are not attending school and encourage them to return. A good <Col N="1660" /> career guidance teacher can help enormously. A person will not obtain meaningful employment without a good standard of education which is freely available. It may not be on one's doorstep but transport is available and there are good grants available. It is no longer an excuse to say one cannot afford it. There is nothing wrong with students of 20 or 21 years of age continuing in education. Many young people find it difficult to get through the examinations but they should keep at their studies. They will get a qualification which will lead to a job.</P>
    <P>Community support work schemes have a role to play. I cannot understand for the life of me why the Department of Social Welfare, FÁS and the other agencies cannot gel together. I do not see the sense of giving money to people for doing nothing. It would be much better to pay a few extra pounds and have them working. I cannot fathom why we cannot resolve that problem and thus get more people to work.</P>
    <P>Our road structure is deplorable. There is a problem in my county but we are coming to grips with it. We have the raw material, the gravel, the sand &mdash; tar is a by-product of crude oil &mdash; and the workforce. Why is it that we cannot put all those together and get a road structure in place which would help develop tourism and the services sectors which have a major role to play? Tourism has a role to play in educating our young girls and boys on how to look after bed and breakfasts, self-catering units, and to do hotel work and so on. The tourist industry has taken off as a result of the peace initiative. I do not want people to feel there are no opportunities, there are many.</P>
    <P>The day of the multinational coming here and providing 300 or 500 jobs is over. The computer chip era has reduced employment. Unless we modernise we will not get to the market place. We have some excellent multinational industries here: Intel, in Leixlip is an outstanding example, and in my <Col N="1661" /> county we have Boxmore Plastics Limited and others. A number of industries in Dublin are experiencing difficulties.</P>
    <P>I firmly believe that it is not all down to management problems. Workers will have to change their attitude because no job is sacrosanct. People will have to redouble their efforts, bad practices will have to be rooted out and that is something the unions will have to come to grips with. No industry can subsidise a lazy approach to work. It is not good enough that people clock in and are there to clock out but do not say where they were in between. If people think they are so smart that bosses and foremen do not miss them, they are only codding themselves. The bottom line is that if there are no profits the industry will not succeed. People should stop cutting their own throats and take pride in the jobs they have. They should not be afraid to put in extra time and be flexible. One industry in my constituency was closed down because the workforce refused to be flexible when the management asked them to do some tidying up at a time when no other work was available. They said that keeping the place tidy was not their job and called in the union. That plant closed down, the former workers would have swept the place out on their hands and knees to get their jobs back, but it was too late.</P>
    <P>It is important to try to hold the jobs we have as well as creating more. People must be got into the habit of getting up in the morning and going out to do some work. In this respect communities have a role to play. It is said sometimes that people do not want to work, but that is not true. There are always the unemployable, but the majority of people would take pride in having a job which would enable them to set up a home and build a future for themselves. That is the aspiration of young people. I do not accept that they do not want to work. There is a good work ethic in this country but it can decline because of long term unemployment, second generation unemployment and the ethos in a home that one does not go to work. We <Col N="1662" /> need to get rid of that ethos. The Minister should do what she can to bring the various schemes together and, instead of giving people money for doing nothing, give them a little extra to do something. It would not be altogether a net expenditure because if these people have money in their pockets they will spend it and the Government will get a return by way of taxation. Such a policy would allow people have pride in themselves while many of the problems that go along with unemployment and which we are trying to control, such as vandalism, drug abuse, etc. would be solved. I know the Minister is fully aware of the problems and I am confident she will do her best to come to grips with them.</P>

      <P>First I would like to thank all those Deputies who contributed to the debate, the quality of which has been excellent and reflects that on all sides of the House we regard the problem of unemployment, particularly the hard core issue of long-term unemployment, as being the most important economic and social problem facing us.</P>
      <P>For many years the main strategy to tackle unemployment was based on the view that the rising tide would lift all boats, that by promoting economic growth the benefit would trickle down to the unemployed. We do need economic growth to build a bigger economy, but economic growth in itself does very little to reduce long term hard core unemployment, a problem that has intensified in the past ten or 15 years in spite of a steady increase in real economic growth.</P>

    <P>The establishment of the new local employment service, following on the report of the task force, with £6 million start-up funding in this year's budget, marks an important shift in public policy towards tackling unemployment. It recognises in official thinking for the first time that one needs a different strategy to approaching long-term unemployment from simply creating jobs generally in the economy, that it <Col N="1663" /> needs a special approach to tackle the stubborn problem of long-term unemployment, and that policies to create extra jobs are, on their own, unlikely to reach the hard core of long-term unemployed.</P>
    <P>We have made significant progress in terms of overall reductions in the numbers out of work although it is still far from enough. The total number of jobless has fallen by 20,000 since the Labour Party went into Government at the start of 1993, but it has not yet made a big difference to those who have been out of work for more than a year. There is now a widespread acceptance that for this group, the long-term unemployed, the strategy has to be different. That is why we are using a two-pronged approach to reducing the numbers out of work.</P>
    <P>First, growth in the economy is necessary. There have been many useful contributions on that aspect from all sides of the House. It is a necessary, if far from sufficient, condition to increase the total number of jobs becoming available. Our economic growth at the moment is excellent and is being translated into extra numbers at work.</P>
    <P>The second and crucially important aspect of Government policy is to concentrate on policies for and target resources specifically at the long-term unemployed. There are now 135,000 people who have not worked for over a year. Almost 60,000 of those have not worked for the past three years. If we compare that with the European situation, the rate of long-term unemployment in Ireland is greater than the total unemployment rate of most OECD countries. The longer a person is long term unemployed the more difficult it is to find employment. Those who have been unemployed for more than two years have a 74 per cent chance of being unemployed a year later. The long-term unemployed are concentrated in the prime age group of 25 to 44, the stage at which people would be rearing young families. Most of them have relatively low education and skill levels &mdash; they <Col N="1664" /> lost out at earlier stages of life in terms of their education chances, and their skills have become outdated. Almost half have no formal educational qualifications.</P>
    <P>The cost of unemployment in economic terms is enormous, amounting to £2.2 billion or 7 per cent of GDP. The estimate for the EU as a whole is under 4 per cent of GDP. The indirect costs of unemployment have been adverted to again on all sides of the House with references to ill health, poverty and crime. These factors need to be taken into account in assessing the real cost of unemployment.</P>
    <P>The longer one is out of work the slimmer the chance of ever getting a job again. Skills become rusty and outdated and people lose confidence in themselves. Most important, employers who have a choice of recruits tend to place the long term unemployed at the back of the queue. That is why I brought representatives of the unemployed to the table in the National and Economic Social Forum, to have them sit down alongside the social partners and an all party group from the Oireachtas and come up with agreed answers as to how to crack this nut of long-term unemployment. The solution we came up with, which is the subject of our debate today, the task force report, is to set up a local employment service to reach out to the long term unemployed and those at high risk of drifting into long-term unemployment, to assess strengths and skills gaps, to rebuild the skills and potential of individuals and to ensure, in partnership with local employers, that they are placed in suitable vacancies.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kenny gave an excellent outline of the work being done by the Contact Point Initiative in Coolock. This initiative and the job centre initiative in the Ballymun Partnership are part of models on which the new local employment service is based. A key element of the service is access to dedicated training and education places, to work experience opportunities and contracts of employment in support of the local employment service. What is envisaged <Col N="1665" /> is to turn on their head the services we have traditionally offered to the unemployed and instead of trying to match unemployed people to services that are there we will ask what are the needs of unemployed people, make the services match their needs and develop the appropriate mix of services from there.</P>
    <P>The Government's response does not end with the launch of the new local employment service due to come into action at the end of June. The task force is currently examining how job options for those long-term unemployed who cannot get a place in the open job market might best be structured and to prepare the detailed basis needed for practical action. Although roughly 30,000 job vacancies are offered to the unemployed every month, we are still finding that the long-term unemployed are at the back of the queue, unless something special is done. Again, the whole area of placement of long-term unemployed people whose skills have been restored through the services in terms of training, education, morale-building and so on that a local employment service has to offer have to be matched with a professional placement service and an involvement of employers who have to play their part in offering job opportunities to the long-term unemployed if people are not to simply fall off the table altogether with no chance of returning to the open job market.</P>
    <P>It is critical to ensure that long-term unemployed people get realistic chances of being offered employment. Research done for the National Economic and Social Forum shows that of 50,000 vacancies that became available in 1993 which were suitable to the talents of people who were long-term unemployed, only 6 per cent of those vacancies were actually filled by people who were long term unemployed. That is what this service has to try to crack. There is a need for positive discrimination in favour of the long-term unemployed.</P>
    <P>The local employment service will be introduced on a phased basis, initially in the 12 established area partnership <Col N="1666" /> areas and two others will be selected. As suggested by the task force, the experience gained during phase one will determine how we progress and how phase two will be implemented. The population of the 12 partnership areas is over 500,000 with unemployment running at 26 per cent. It is clear that the new local employment service has a major task ahead.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies mentioned that there is a lack of clarity in terms of the model proposed. It is envisaged that each local community will draw up its own action plan or model rather than employing any one predetermined model. The structure has been deliberately designed to allow options so that what we deliver will match the needs of the area concerned as determined by the local community, local representatives, statutory organisations and local employers.</P>
    <P>Deputy Noel Ahern raised the question of funding the service and said that other bodies are already working in this area. It is envisaged that funding will be made available from the sum of £6 million to top up existing resources &mdash; the resources of FÁS, social welfare job facilitators or a local unemployment centre &mdash; in areas where gaps have been identified.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Rourke argued that the Department of Enterprise and Employment had won the turf war. That is the wrong way to view the service. This is not a question of turf wars or winners or losers but about pooling the resources of Government and public agencies in a focused way to meet the needs of the unemployed rather than meeting the priorities of individual agencies. It is a question of putting the unemployed first, not of who wins the turf wars.</P>
    <P>In its report Tackling Long-Term Unemployment which forms the basis for the service, the forum put forward a model designed to meet the needs of the long-term unemployed based on the successful experience of Contact Point in Coolock and the Ballymun jobs service in Dublin. A service is proposed which on the one hand brings together <Col N="1667" /> all existing services in the community, statutory and voluntary, and on the other which is tailored to meet the individual needs of the unemployed person. My office chaired the task force to turn the ideas of the forum into practical action. Resources have already been provided to introduce the first phase of the new service in the 14 partnership areas.</P>
    <P>It is important to emphasise that we are not looking at one unique solution which is imposed from the centre on local areas; there is a need for a range of options to give as many of the long term unemployed as possible a chance to obtain work. This is based on the premise that we should start by identifying the gaps in the skills, abilities and talents of the unemployed, what needs to be done within local communities and offering a credible job placement service to local employers to ensure that both sides will benefit from what is on offer. It is extremely important that we involve local employers in this task. If we fail to break the psychological barrier to employing the long-term unemployed, in a society where we are producing more school leavers than net job vacancies in the economy, the long term unemployed will continue to remain at the back of the queue unless employers are prepared to believe in their talents, potential and abilities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for giving me permission to raise this topic on the Adjournment. I express my appreciation of the efforts of President Clinton, not only in supporting the peace process but in organising the Washington Conference to ensure <Col N="1668" /> inward investment from the United States in the Border counties which have been placed at a disadvantage because of the violence of the past 25 years. I have already made the case in this House that the moneys targeted at the Border areas from other European countries should be regarded as additional. I do not intend to cover that ground again except to say it is important during the next three years that the Border areas are given some competitive advantages to allow them to compete on a level playing pitch.</P>
      <P>I appreciate the efforts of President Clinton and the US Department of Commerce in organising the conference to which a number of people from this country have been invited to attend. In this regard I am primarily concerned with the industrialists and business people who have received invitations. As some of them are very busy they will have to decide if they will be in a position to attend.</P>
      <P>I am concerned at the lack of preparation for the conference on this side of the Atlantic. I call on the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Enterprise and Employment to meet as a matter of urgency, within the next 24 hours given that most of the people invited to attend the conference do not know what will be discussed or how it will be of assistance to them.</P>
      <P>I understand there will be a major discussion on the question of partnership on 25 May. I discovered this today and the people to whom I have been speaking do not know it yet. I call on the three Ministers concerned as a matter of urgency to meet IDA-Ireland, Forbairt and CTT and organise a briefing session for all the industrialists and business people in the Border areas who will attend the conference following which they should have an opportunity to discuss their needs and requirements, such as who they would like to meet while in Washington, with officials of relevant Departments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In turn, it should be indicated how more jobs can be created in the Border <Col N="1669" /> areas as a result of this conference, in the area of new technology, for example, by creating a link with an American company, based either in the United States or Europe. Alternatively, an American company may wish to locate here to supplement or complement an existing industry. I would ask the Minister of State and her two colleagues who are in the House to use their influence with the three Departments I mentioned to ensure, as a matter of urgency, a briefing is held on this matter &mdash; it will have to be next week because they will go to Washington the following week &mdash; with a view to facilitating these people. It will be a serious indictment of the Government if we do not maximise the benefits that can accrue from this conference.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Ms Burton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to provide clarification of the Irish preparations for the White House Conference for Trade and Investment in Ireland, which will be held in Washington at the end of this month.</P>
      <P>Economic progress can make an enormous contribution to the goal of achieving a lasting peaceful and political accommodation in Northern Ireland. While there are deep divisions on political matters in Northern Ireland, there are few who will contest the view that economic co-operation between the two parts of Ireland makes sound common sense.</P>
      <P>There is a very important US dimension to the economic aspect of the peace process. President Clinton announced in November 1994 a package of economic measures to assist in the consolidation of the peace process. The President, noting how the present opportunity for lasting peace in Ireland was the chance of a generation, urged that it is be seized upon and supported.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A major element in the President's strategy was the proposal for a White House Conference for Trade and Investment in Ireland. The conference <Col N="1670" /> offers a valuable opportunity to promote inward investment in Northern Ireland and the six Border counties and for the economic regeneration of an area which has suffered severely from the consequences of 25 years of violence in Northern Ireland. The Government is determined for its part to do everything possible to ensure that full use be made of this major opportunity to highlight for potential US investors the merits of investment in the new context created by peace.</P>
    <P>The Department of Foreign Affairs has chaired a co-ordinating group of other Government Departments over several months in order to ensure the best possible Irish input to the conference. The State agencies have been closely involved with the likely Irish business invitees. Once the Irish companies who have received invitations are known, I am confident that any assistance which those companies require will be extended by the State agencies and Government Departments to enable contacts to be made with US companies.</P>
    <P>The expectation of the US Department of Commerce, who along with Senator Mitchell's office is responsible for the conference arrangements is for an attendance of some 1,000 invited guests, of whom roughly 700 would be from the US and roughly 300 from Ireland, North and South.</P>
    <P>The primary focus of the conference is to ensure that business representatives from the US, Northern Ireland and the Border counties are facilitated in every way possible in making contact with each other so that trade and investment prospects can be identified and pursued. An important element in this regard is the &ldquo;Match-Maker&rdquo; programme being promoted by the Department of Commerce. This will enable Irish companies attending the conference to have contact with relevant US companies with a view to the development of co-operation in areas of mutual business interest. One hundred Irish companies, 50 each from North and South, have been invited to participate in the &ldquo;Match-Maker&rdquo; programme. <Col N="1671" /> This is an exciting development and one which I hope will bring positive benefits.</P>
    <P>The main work at the conference will be conducted at the eight different workshops or break-out sessions. The topics planned cover business partnerships, information technologies, food industries, tourism, manufacturing, tradeable services, employment and community development. The organisers have lined up a distinguished list of moderators and panellists from US business people currently involved in investment in both parts of Ireland to chair the breakout sessions. Irish Ministers will also participate at these sessions.</P>
    <P>We must be cautious, however, against expecting instant results. The White House conference is the beginning of a longer term process aimed at converting the potential of the peace process into lasting economic and social progress in Northern Ireland and the Border counties. I hope the conference will help to generate in the first instance an increased awareness among American companies of the potential benefits for investment and joint venture activity in the areas concerned.</P>
    <P>The Department of Foreign Affairs together with the other Departments involved have been working intensively on this process for a number of months and we are prepared to offer whatever assistance we can to participants in the conference.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to raise this matter. The Minister is aware of the seriousness of the problem whereby social workers in Dublin's north inner city simply cannot take on new cases due to their workload. In the region of 100 cases are unattended and in many instances children are seriously at risk. About 25 per <Col N="1672" /> cent of social worker positions remain vacant in the north inner city. This seems to be a culmination of years of neglect of that area. While in the past church bodies and voluntary groups did much of this work the bulk of it is now carried out by the State, but it is failing in its responsibility.</P>
      <P>There is also a very serious drugs problem in this area which exacerbates the other social problems. I ask the Minister to consider the need for an integrated approach to these problems because it is not only the Department of Health that is involved as the Department of Education has responsibility for residential centres for young children and the Department of Justice also has responsibility. This is not simply a matter of filling social worker positions. I understand from <i>The Irish Times</i> of yesterday that the Eastern Health Board has given a commitment to redeploy people from other areas and I am anxious to know whether that will be done. Social workers spend much of their time looking for residential places for children, places that do not exist, and meanwhile the children involved are seriously at risk.</P>
      <P>I rarely go to the lengths of raising a specific case by way of Dáil question &mdash; I usually approach these matters in other ways &mdash; but on 25 April in Question No. 88 and on 9 May in Question No. 42 I raised the case of a child who is seriously at risk not only to himself but to others, and that has been confirmed by professional people involved in child care and by members of the community. The child involved who is about 12 years of age is on drugs and is extremely aggressive and violent. This is one of the cases with which I have become familiar. If action is not taken in this instance I would not like to be responsible for what may happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was dissatisfied with the reply I received to my first Dáil question which stated a place was being sought for the child, but that none was available. The reply to my second Dáil question on 9 May indicated that the position <Col N="1673" /> remains the same and that the health board is continuing to work with the family. We know what that means in the context of the crisis in social work in the area. Indeed, I would go so far as to say that the reply to the question is not correct as no effective or appropriate work was carried out in respect of that child who is running loose and at risk to himself and others.</P>
    <P>I emphasise that case although there are similar cases and social workers are overwhelmed in that area dealing with case after case, they have reached the end of the road. I hope the position is not similar to that outlined by a columnist in <i>The Irish Times</i> yesterday who stated: &ldquo;in the absence of a vigorous drive to improve matters the action being taken by social workers in Dublin could signal the beginning of the slow collapse of child protection services in some areas and that will inevitably be followed by awful human tragedies&rdquo;. The writing is on the wall and the Minister needs to act now. I emphasise that the responsibility for the problem does not lie only with his Department. One of the greatest needs in the area is that of residential care for emergency cases. If social workers become aware, as they regularly do, of emergency cases which need to be referred quickly to centres, such centres are not available. I ask the Minister to seriously address this matter and act on the different aspects I outlined.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan, Limerick East) Michael Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>, <i>Limerick East):</i> I thank the Deputy for raising this important matter this evening and for giving me an opportunity to respond to the House. This situation has arisen as a result of industrial action by social workers in the north inner city part of Community Care Area 7. The industrial action is related primarily to the number of vacant posts in the social work service in this area. At present there are five vacant posts in Community Care Area 7, four of which are in the north inner city. The Eastern Health Board has recruited two graduates &mdash; BScs &mdash; who are able to carry <Col N="1674" /> out some of the work normally carried out by social workers. Next week an additional social worker will be taking up duty in the area and the board is at present making arrangements to assign a new team leader to the area.</P>
      <P>The cause of the current vacancies in the social work service is the difficulty in recruiting social workers. Despite advertising extensively the board has not been able to fill all the social worker posts.</P>
      <P>One of the reasons for the shortage in social workers is because of the major expansion in social work services in the child care area over the past two years. The supply is simply not there to meet the current demands. The Eastern Health Board recently advertised for social workers in the United Kingdom and two of the board's staff will go to England next week to interview people who have expressed an interest in the posts.</P>
      <P>The health board is in discussion with IMPACT and I understand that agreement has been reached on a Protocol for dealing with emergencies. The board will review this on an ongoing basis to ensure that all emergencies are dealt with.</P>
      <P>It is regrettable that the situation has arisen and I appreciate the difficulties which are being presented to both the board and the social workers in these circumstances. The board will continue in its efforts to recruit additional social work staff.</P>
      <P>On the question of the lack of services, I am pleased to have been able to make additional funding of the order of £3.7 million in a full year available to the board for the further development of child care services during 1995.</P>
      <P>Officers of the board, in consultation with officers of the child care policy unit of my Department are currently finalising the details of the board's development plan for 1995 and it is anticipated that this further investment in services will go a long way towards meeting the child care needs within the board's area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This further investment will also pave the way for the introduction of the next <Col N="1675" /> phase of the implementation of the Child Care Act, 1991, Parts III to VI, which deal respectively with the protection of children in emergencies, care proceedings and the powers of duties of health boards in relation to children in their care. It is our firm intention that these provisions will be implemented before the end of 1995. The early introduction of these key provisions will greatly strengthen the powers of the health boards, the gardaí and the courts to intervene on behalf of children who are in need of care and protection.</P>
    <P>I have also taken a note of the Deputy's anxiety about a child who was the subject of a parliamentary question tabled by him and I will have the position re-examined.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Shorthall</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, Sir, for allowing me to raise this matter on the Adjournment. I appreciate that the Minister has come in to respond.</P>
      <P>The problem of wandering horses in urban areas is very serious and often not appreciated by those living outside the main urban centres. Sometimes people have a romantic idea about horses, akin to the film &ldquo;Into the West&rdquo; which included romantic scenes of traveller children riding horses bareback across the green areas between high rise apartment blocks in the Dublin suburbs and eventually leaving the city. That appears romantic, but in reality there is nothing romantic about wandering horses. I want to make it clear that those horses do not belong to travellers because sometimes people believe they do. I am referring to the problem in urban areas, principally in Dublin, where horses are often owned by children and teenagers who have dropped out of school. Their young owners, get a great thrill riding their horses, but they pose a serious threat in many urban areas, principally in Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recent months those animals have caused a number of injuries to motorists <Col N="1676" /> and pedestrians. Many of us who live in Dublin have encountered that problem when driving through housing estates where horses on open spaces frequently run out in front of cars or pedestrians. The problem of wandering horses kept on open spaces in housing estates and often in the backyards of ordinary houses has been brought to my attention by many of my constituents.</P>
    <P>For many Dublin children owning a horse has become something of a status symbol. I am aware of instances where such horses have been used in crime and drug dealing. The ability of people on horseback to make their getaway makes life difficult for gardaí as it is virtually impossible to pursue them. On one level that may be considered amusing, but for people living in these areas it is a serious problem.</P>
    <P>Those horses, with few exceptions, are not properly looked after. They are often kept in unsuitable conditions, tethered to trees and railings, in public open spaces and sometimes kept in the backyard of the owners' houses. Those horses are often in bad condition when purchased and we need to pay closer attention to the Smithfield horse fair which is held on a monthly basis. Many of the horses on sale there are not in good condition, and very often are sold to young people who know very little about caring for them and who keep them in unsuitable conditions. There is much to be learned about the cruelty aspect. There have been many cases of serious abuse and the Dublin Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals has called for immediate action on this problem.</P>
    <P>The problems presented in terms of public safety are obvious. Much good environmental work undertaken at community level by members of residents' associations and so on is being undermined by these horses destroying cultivated areas. However, my main concern is the lawlessness such wandering horses represent, exacerbating problems in many housing estates. While the Minister indicated that he is preparing a Bill I must ask that it be expedited <Col N="1677" /> because it is a serious problem in the Dublin area warranting urgent attention. In the interim, he should investigate the existing powers of the Garda and local authorities which can be used to great effect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Deenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Shortall for raising this matter in which she has an obvious deep understanding and is of great concern to her.</P>
      <P>I am aware that the problems caused by wandering horses in urban areas, and particularly in parts of Dublin, have increased significantly in recent years. I am also well aware of the concern expressed by many Members of the Oireachtas, local authorities and the general public at the hazards posed by these animals, the threat to public safety and the damage being caused to property. Therefore, I can readily sympathise with the feelings of frustration which this topic has generated. There is also a welfare dimension to be considered, as many of these animals bear obvious signs of neglect and ill-treatment and are frequently subjected to serious abuse.</P>
      <P>On the specific issue of cruelty to horses, I would point out that legislation already in place &mdash; the Protection of Animals Acts, 1911 and 1965 &mdash; deals with cruelty to all animals, including horses. These Acts are the principal statutes governing cruelty to animals here. They are enforced by the Garda and provide for penalties in the form of fines or imprisonment as appropriate. Any person with information about abuse or cruelty to animals should contact the Garda in the matter. The House will be aware that an order was made last year which doubled the potential fine for cruelty from £500 to £1,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On straying horses, I should mention that the Animals Act, 1985, administered by the Department of Justice, includes provisions for increased powers for local authorities and the Garda to impound wandering horses together with increased fines for allowing horses to be turned loose and to wander on the <Col N="1678" /> public road. It also abolished the immunity of owners/occupiers of land adjoining the public road in relation to damage caused by their animals straying on to the public road.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the foregoing, I accept that problems persist and we need to adopt additional measures to control horses in urban areas. Therefore, I am pleased that as provided for in the programme <i>A Government of Renewal,</i> I will be introducing legislation to seek to address the remaining difficulties. My Department has commenced consultations with a view to the early drafting of the necessary legislation. Among the options being considered are the compulsory licensing and identification of horses; a ban on the sale of horses to minors; the disposal of horses where they have been repeatedly confiscated by local authorities and the recovery in full of confiscation costs. Issues such as grazing and stabling of horses are among those which need to be addressed, as well as the questions of liability, penalties and related matters.</P>
    <P>As the issues involved extend beyond the traditional role of my Department and impinge on other areas, I have been in touch with my counterparts in Justice and the Environment as well as the Garda Síochána, Dublin Corporation and South Dublin County Council with a view to expediting examination of all the issues involved and developing comprehensive proposals to deal with them. My Department has also written to every county council and to the corporations of larger towns requesting their views and recommendations. I shall consider all relevant issues in this matter. I would welcome views and comments from all interested parties on the topic to assist in completing the draft. It is my hope, fully realising its urgency, the relevant Bill will be ready for the autumn session.</P>

      <P>I know the Acting Chairman, Deputy Browne, will be familiar with this subject as there is a large <Col N="1679" /> sheep population in County Carlow. My colleague, Deputy Cowen, cannot be present because his insistence, in the face of the Government's provocative silence this morning, led to his being shown the red card by the Ceann Comhairle.</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil will not remain silent in the face of the crisis within the sheep industry engendered by the Government's inactivity and procrastination. My constituency colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Yates, has made a mess of the live export issue having endeavoured to please both sides. Indeed, his efforts to date have so impressed Compassion Within World Farming that they are mounting a protest at the port of Rosslare on Saturday next. His appeals and promises so impressed the United Kingdom-based ferry companies they refused absolutely to take live animals on board their ships.</P>
      <P>The crisis in sheep prices has arisen from this fiasco and the problem was highlighted by the huge attendance at meetings and demonstrations by farmers, their families and others whose livelihoods are threatened. I compliment the Minister, Deputy Yates, on his public relations machine; never in the history of this State have so many photographs of a Minister been seen within such a short period, together with a list of so many of his promises. If even half the energy of his public relations machine was invested in agriculture, probably we would not have had the conference held in Wexford on Friday last or the demonstration that took place outside this House yesterday. On being invited to a function, I understand the Minister's first question is whether there will be a cameraman present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's response to an all-time low in sheep prices is to place 1,000 tonnes of hogget into private storage. That is what I would describe as a sticking-plaster solution, the resultant 2p price increase having evaporated within a week. Factories, being aware that farmers have no alternative, are determined and have successfully pushed <Col N="1680" /> prices to the floor. That remedy merely postpones to the autumn an even worse problem, when that 1,000 tonnes of hogget will come out of storage on to the market, hindering rather than helping farm incomes.</P>
    <P>The Minister has refused to explain from where his departmental budget for this remedy emanates, its cost and who will have to bear it. It is inexplicable that Stena Sealink and P&amp;O Pandoro have made such fools of our Government. Notwithstanding their inexperience, surely it has dawned on somebody that in discussions between Government and the ferry companies the issue of a £20 million investment in Dún Laoghaire and almost similar investment at Rosslare must be a factor. That is the type of pressure that can be exerted.</P>
    <P>It is time to take off the gloves, we do not have to tolerate the United Kingdom ferry companies cherry-picking traffic to and from this island. We have one of the toughest regimes of animal welfare regulations in Europe, thus rendering the compassionate stance being adopted on the part of world farming interests totally unjustified; there is a missing chapter from their agenda, which is compassion for farmers.</P>
    <P>Specialisation in farming, encouraged by successive Governments, has exacerbated the present hardship experienced by farmers in the collapse of sheep prices, whereas erstwhile farming was more varied. Many farmers now affected have no other source of income. A succession of farmers in Wexford on Friday last informed me, and others, of the possibility of their having to get out of farming altogether. There is no doubt there is a huge market for Irish lamb, it is an indigenous and sustainable industry. Our right of access to the Single Market of continental Europe is absolute.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil's position on this issue is unequivocal. It supports the rights of farmers to export live animals, but of course standards must apply. The highest possible standards are in the best <Col N="1681" /> interests of Irish farmers. It must be noted that exporters have a vested interest in the animal arriving at its destination in the healthiest possible condition.</P>
    <P>As the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry does not appear to have the courage, I call on the Taoiseach to vindicate the national interest immediately.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>A few years ago when farmers brought their sheep into Agriculture House the problems were much greater.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is true to say there has been a strong focus recently on prices in the sheep meat sector and that producers have been disappointed at returns during the Easter trade for spring lamb. It is inappropriate to describe the situation as a crisis. It is also clear that the Minister has responded quickly and effectively. Current prices in the sheep industry have to be seen in context. The <Col N="1682" /> pattern for sheep meat prices varies within any particular year.</P>
    <P>The high price of lamb at the beginning of 1995 led to speculation that the price would continue its traditional rise and bring Easter lamb prices to a new peak. This did not happen because of currency fluctuations; more aggressive competition from other meat producers, mainly from pork and poultry producers; a weak French market, more French lamb was retained for the French market following a decline in Fench live exports to Spain; an overhang of hoggets on the market, causing problems for both the lamb and hogget trade; strong competition from UK lamb producers, fuelled by a weak sterling; the end of the ewe premium retention period brought extra supply on the market; and problems with the export of live animals.</P>
    <P>This combination of events caused certain difficulties. The overhang of hoggets in particular undermined the market for spring lamb. Some of those hoggets were over-fat, certainly for the French market.</P>
    <P>The average price for the first quarter of this year was 7 per cent up on the same period in 1994, which was an extremely good year. The problem emerged with the spring lamb trade. Discussions were held with the farming organisatons and with meat processors and no time was lost in reacting.</P>
    <P>Effective and speedy action was taken to assist the sector. Agreement in the European Union Commission to introduce an aid for private storage scheme was secured literally within a matter of days.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. H. Byrne Mr. H. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Who is paying for it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>This measure is exceptional to Ireland and is designed to remove the overhang of hoggets from last year's production and thereby help spring lamb prices. Officials of my Department have had discussions with processors about the conditions of the scheme. Tenders for aid must be submitted before 17 May and will be <Col N="1683" /> adjudicated on on 19 May. This is the normal arrangement for the operation of the aid for private storage scheme and I expect processors will make proper use of the measures. There is evidence already that the decision is having an impact and that prices have hardened. There has been a recovery in prices this week.</P>
      <P>On the question of live exports, no effort has been spared to resolve this issue. New regulations governing the welfare of animals during transport have recently been introduced by the Minister, Deputy Yates, and there is no reason any ferry company should refuse to transport livestock from this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. H. Byrne Mr. H. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a sensitive issue and there are strongly held views on both sides. Progress is being made towards a final solution and we will persist with our efforts until this is achieved.</P>
      <P>Apart from the aid for private storage scheme a range of other issues is being addressed to consolidate the medium and long term future of the industry. These include a top-up premium to compensate Irish sheep producers for the absence of price convergence under the ewe premium system. Specific proposals have already been submitted to Commissioner Fischler in that regard that these will be pursued in further discussions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Equally, it must be recognised that <Col N="1684" /> consistent high quality is the key to the future development of the sector and to meeting the exacting requirements of export markets. Sheep meat is an expensive product relative to other types of meat. The focus on quality would be greatly strengthened by the introduction of carcase classification on a general basis, it currently operates in two plants. We will work on this in the future.</P>
    <P>A review of the approach to breeding and genetics is also being initiated in order to improve output performance and quality standards. An Bord Bia has been asked to assess the strategy on marketing, especially in the highly important French market. These are conflicting views as to whether our approach to the French market is as effective as it should be; if there are weaknesses these should be identified and action taken. These initiatives indicate a strong commitment to ensuring that the sector achieves its full potential and that a decent level of profitability is available for those involved in the industry. Full support is being given to the sector to deal with both its short term problems and to put it on a secure footing for the future.</P>
    <P>I hope Deputy Byrne will not be disappointed when the transport problem with the ferry companies is resolved shortly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. H. Byrne Mr. H. Byrne">

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government's policy document <i>A Programme of Renewal</i> provides for &ldquo;an examination by the Law Reform <Col N="1600" /> Commission of legislation to allow courts to refuse bail where the court considers it desirable to do so&rdquo;. When I took up office, I asked the Attorney General to ensure that the Law Reform Commission's review takes into account the terms of the Programme for Government.</P>
    <P>As I explained in my contribution to the Second Stage debate on the Criminal Law (Bail) Bill last week, all of the advice that is available to me indicates that any effective change to the bail laws will require a constitutional amendment. I am awaiting the Law Reform Commission's report, but, in the meantime, I am also having work done in my Department in preparation to bring proposals to Government. It is clear that no Government decision has been made because I have not brought any proposals to them yet for the reason I have given.</P>
    <P>For the information of the House, 4,416 crimes were committed by people out on bail in 1994, which figure is up from 2,495 in 1990.</P>
    <P>The three Garda associations whose annual conferences I have recently addressed have called for constitutional changes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The strength at Mill Street Garda station in Galway was 134 gardaí on 1 April 1995 compared to 151 gardaí on 1 April 1994. The reduction in numbers is partly due to the creation of a district headquarters at Salthill in May 1994 when 12 members of the Force were transferred there from Mill Street. Prior to that, Salthill was policed from Mill Street. When Salthill became a district headquarters it made sense to transfer the relevant gardaí there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1601" /> A district headquarters will always have a higher number of gardaí than a regular Garda station but these additional numbers are to cover a whole District's needs. The number of gardaí assigned to a district office although physically based in a district town, do not form part of the standard assignment for the town in which they are situated but cover the additional duties attached to a district headquarters. The actual difference from 1 April 1994 to 1 April 1995 is five gardaí due to retirements, transfers on promotion, etc. The Garda authorities are satisfied that the strength at Mill Street is adequate to meet the policing needs of Galway city but they are keeping the position under review.</P>

      <P>District Court fines become due as soon as they are imposed but they are not considered to be outstanding or in arrears until the time allowed for payment has expired. At the time a fine is imposed the court sets a period of time within which the fine must be paid before a warrant is issued. Since the passing of the Courts (No. 2) Bill, 1991, on the 16 July 1991, warrants in respect of unpaid fines must issue within six months of the expiry date given by the court for payment. Together with the introduction of increasing computerisation this has led to a reduction in the number of warrants awaiting issue by the District Court. At 31 December <Col N="1605" /> 1991, 61,099 warrants were awaiting issue and by 31 December 1994 this figure had dropped to 21,646.</P>
      <P>The estimated value of uncollected fines at 31 December 1994 was £11.37 million, representing 110,126 fines. There were 21,646 warrants awaiting issue by the District Courts and a further 88,480 with the Garda for execution. During 1994 £7.89 million was collected in fines. Every effort is made by the Garda to collect fines due on foot of court warrants which often entails calling to defaulters on a number of occasions. A total of 80,601 warrants were executed by the Garda during 1994.</P>
      <P>I have already indicated in an answer to a parliamentary question put down for reply on 7 February 1995 that I am at present considering various proposals in relation to the payment of fines and in particular the introduction of a system of attachment of earnings whereby the court could order that outstanding fines be deducted from a person's earnings. This would represent a form of payment by instalment and legislative proposals which may emerge in this regard will be announced in the usual way in due course.</P>
      <P>The House will be aware from newspaper publicity and a statement issued by my Department last night that the Director of Public Prosecutions has directed that a number of summonses issued for parking violations are not to be proceeded with, because a doubt has been raised concerning the adequacy of existing District Court rules to authorise service of summonses by recorded delivery rather than by personal service by a member of the Garda Síochána.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Service of summonses by recorded delivery was authorised by section 22 (1) (c) of the Courts Act, 1991. The Department of Justice, since that legislation was enacted, explored various methods by which summonses could be served. In December last a system of recorded delivery, where a garda delivers a summons but does not personally serve the summons on the person concerned or another adult was <Col N="1606" /> introduced. Approximately 11,000 summonses were issued in this way. A number of these have been dealt with by the courts but the Director of Public Prosecutions has directed that the remaining summonses should be struck out.</P>
    <P>The problem which had been raised came to notice in my Department yesterday, following the DPP's direction issued yesterday. The District Court Rules Committee have already been asked to draft a new rule to specifically deal with this issue, in order that service of summonses by recorded delivery can resume. In the meantime the Garda authorities have instructed that service of summonses by personal service be resumed.</P>
    <P>I am very concerned that this situation has arisen and have instructed my Department to review the position to see whether any similar problems might exist which have not come to light. I have also instructed that the Director of Public Prosecutions should be consulted as part of this review and that in any future situation where rules of court are being considered he is also to be consulted.</P>

      <P>As I stated in my answer to Parliamentary Question No. 132 of 14 March 1995, I am informed by the Garda authorities that statistical information on child sexual abuse is not readily available. As I explained at that time, child sexual abuse can involve crimes of different kinds, e.g. rape, indecent assault, and the crimes are recorded under such headings rather than any general heading of &ldquo;child sexual abuse&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The following information relating to crimes against children under 17 years of age has been extracted from a number of existing categories of crime i.e., sexual assault, aggravated sexual assault, rape, defilement of girls, incest, and is the best estimate of the information sought by the Deputy which is available:</P>

    <P>Information for 1991 is not readily available. The Deputies will appreciate that the 1994 figures must be viewed in the context of cases pending before the courts and those cases that are currently under investigation. As regards the definition used for parent or near-relative, the following family members are included: father, mother, brother, sister and foster child.</P>
    <P>The Garda authorities are resolved to deal effectively with the issue of child sex abuse. A measure of this resolve was the establishment of the domestic violence and sexual assault investigation unit &mdash; formerly known as the woman and child unit. The unit was established in March 1993, and it is staffed by gardaí who are highly trained and experienced in dealing with domestic violence and sexual assaults. The functions of the unit <Col N="1608" /> include overseeing the investigation of offences of domestic violence, child sexual abuse and other violent and sexual offences committed against women and children. Enforcement practices in respect of protection and barring orders are also carefully examined. The unit works in close contact with the Garda community relations section and liaises with organisations, both statutory and voluntary, which deal with violent and sexual crime against women and children. It also deals with the drafting of Protocol on the role of the Garda Síochána in these cases.</P>

      <P>Deputies on all sides of the House will, I am sure, be aware of my support for the Irish Association for Victim Support and the valuable service it provides for victims of crime. At present, my Department provides a significant level of funding to help the association with its work and I can assure you that it is my intention that this level of support will continue in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The growing awareness of the importance of improving the way in which the law deals with victims is reflected by a number of changes in legislation and procedure, which have already been <Col N="1609" /> implemented by my Department in recent years. I recently received an updated Charter of Victims Rights launched by the Irish Association for Victim Support and officials in my Department have since had discussions with the association about its updated charter.</P>
    <P>As the Deputies will be aware, the Government's policy agreement <i>A Government of Renewal</i> includes a commitment to draw up a Charter for Victims of Crime. Any proposal which I might have, following detailed examination of these matters, will have to be considered and approved by the Government before being announced in the normal way.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the provisional crime figures for 1994 for the Lusk area indicate a drop of over 25 per cent on the 1993 figures. The provisional figures for the first three months of 1995 indicate that the crime levels for 1995 will be similar to those in 1994. I am also informed by the Garda authorities that while the level of burglaries and robberies in 1993 and 1994 was the same, there was a 12 per cent decrease on the 1992 figures for this types of crime.</P>
      <P>The present strength at Lusk Garda station is one sergeant and 2 gardaí. Lusk Garda Station is open between the hours of 10 a.m. and 1 p.m. on Monday to Saturday and 12 mid-day to 1 p.m. on Sunday. Outside of these hours the direct communication link, to the district headquarters at Balbriggan, comes into operation. A joint mobile patrol of the Lusk and Rush sub-districts is carried out at times of most need i.e. late evening-early morning. I am informed by the Garda authorities that the strength at Lusk will be kept under review. I am also informed by the Garda authorities that there are no plans at present to extend the opening hours at Lusk station. The difficulty with this is that it would absorb manpower which could be better used on outdoor patrol duties. The essential point the Garda authorities make is that it is far better to maximise the number of gardaí available for outdoor patrol and crime duties rather than tie up manpower indoors on administrative work.</P>

The opening hours at the Garda station were adjusted accordingly to ensure optimum use of the available manpower in patrolling the sub-district. The Garda authorities are satisfied that this arrangement provides for a more visible Garda presence in the area. The revised opening hours at the station concerned are as follows: Monday, Wednesday and Thursday, 10 a.m. to 11 a.m.; Tuesday, 10 a.m. to 1 p.m.; Friday and Saturday, 5 p.m. to 6 p.m.; Sunday, 12 mid-day to 1 p.m.</P>

      <P>The purpose of the Criminal Law (Incest Proceedings) (No. 2) Bill, which has been passed by the Seanad and is currently before this House, is to deal with urgent problems that have arisen out of judgments of the Central Criminal Court in an incest case. These judgments give rise to serious difficulty because they have had the effect that the outcome of a criminal prosecution for incest cannot be disclosed to a party, <Col N="1621" /> for example a health board, with a specific interest in the welfare of an incest victim. I am sure that all the Members of this House would agree that such a situation must be remedied without delay and that is what is proposed in the Bill.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1935, is concerned with a wide range of sexual offences and many of the provisions of the Act have been amended or repealed by subsequent legislation. Accordingly I would ask the Deputy to let me know if there are any specific changes to the 1935 Act he may have in mind. I will, of course, be glad to consider any suggestions the Deputy makes in this regard in the context of what might go into my discussion paper and any relevant legislative proposals I may bring forward.</P>

      <P>The information requested in Parliamentary Questions Nos. 143 and 144 of 14 March 1995 could have been obtained only by a manual examination of thousands of individual prisoner records held in the prisons and places of detention and the <Col N="1622" /> subsequent collation of the data obtained.</P>
      <P>As regards the information sought in Parliamentary Question No. 105 of 28 March 1995, as already stated in the reply, there is no single crime category of handbag snatching. When Garda statistics are being compiled, handbag-snatching is included in the general crime category &ldquo;larceny from the person with aggravation&rdquo;. The number of cases involving handbag snatching, as opposed to other larcenies from the person with aggravation, could only have been obtained by gardaí manually checking investigation files in order to determine the information sought.</P>
      <P>In both cases, because the particular information was not recorded centrally, it would have required special examination of thousands of files by prison staff and by gardaí. Given the other, more pressing demands on the time of Garda and prison staff, it was considered that the allocation of scarce staff resources to collating the information would be disproportionate.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The objectives of the Probation and Welfare Service in prisons and places of detention are set out in my Department's policy document <i>The Management of Offenders A Five Year Plan</i><Col N="1623" /> published last June. The main objectives as set out in chapter 8 are: (1) to assist those in custody through individual and group programmes towards an amelioration of personal and familial difficulties; (2) to confront those in custody with their offending behaviour and to counsel them towards a greater understanding of their responsibilities to themselves, their families and their communities; (3) to develop and promote good personal management arrangements and to make effective resettlement plans with those in custody, and to implement them on release; (4) to utilise and develop community resources to meet accommodation, training and treatment needs.</P>
    <P>The plan recognises the need for additional staff as follows: (i) ten probation and welfare officers &mdash; two senior and eight basic grade &mdash; and two clerical support staff to provide a more comprehensive pre-release service to long term offenders and (ii) four probation and welfare officers &mdash; one senior and three basic grade &mdash; and one clerical support officer to deliver &mdash; in co-operation with the psychology service &mdash; the specialised sex offender treatment programme.

      <P>All fines are paid into the Exchequer unless their disposal is otherwise provided for by law. I am aware, however, that for very many years, pre-dating the foundation of the State, individual judges, from time to time, have ordered that contributions be paid into the &ldquo;Court Poor Box&rdquo; or be paid directly to a <Col N="1624" /> named charity rather than a defendant being convicted and fined in the usual way. Where such contributions are paid through the court they are receipted in the normal way and lodged to the general cash account of the relevant court office. The money is then paid out to various charities following directions given by the judge.</P>
      <P>Separate records of moneys paid in this fashion are not maintained. However, in 1990 a survey for the calendar year 1989 showed that the contributions to the &ldquo;Court Poor Box&rdquo; in eleven district court offices ranged from £31,553 in the office with the highest amount to just over £1,000 in a number of these eleven offices.

      <P>The position is that the longest delay in the hearing of listed cases in the High Court arises in the hearing of personal injury cases where there is a delay of approximately three years between the date of receipt of the notice of trial and the date of trial. Personal injury cases cannot be listed to fix a date for hearing until a notice of trial is received by the court from either of the contesting parties. In relation to other types of civil cases, for example, non-jury and chancery cases, the position is that cases cannot be listed to fix a date for hearing until a notice of trial and subsequent certificate of readiness is received by the court. There is a delay of approximately nine months between the date of receipt of the certificate of readiness and the date of the trial in such cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1625" /> Cases listed for trial, however, are subject to application for adjournment from either party and indeed are often adjourned by legal representatives in the interests of their clients. In this context there were, with effect from 1 May 1995, 27 personal injury cases in respect of which a notice of trial had been received more than five years previously, which had not yet been completed. It would not be appropriate for me to give information regarding any specific case which is pending. Such information will be given on request by the court to the litigant or his legal representative.</P>
    <P>Delays in the hearing of cases in the courts is a matter of great concern to me and is currently under examination in my Department. In line with the commitment given in the Programme for Government, a review of the Courts and Court Officers Bill 1994, is being carried out to ensure that the provisions it contains adequately address the backlog of cases for hearing in the courts. This review is being carried out and I hope to be in a position to announce my proposals in this regard shortly.</P>

However, I am aware that a number of proposals have been made to the Minister for Tourism and Trade from private investors for the development of casinos, as part of wider leisure or conference centres. I am also aware that there is some public opposition to the operation of a casino. I understand that the Minister for Tourism and Trade is examining the proposals made and it will be a matter for him to decide whether the proposed developments require to have a casino as part of the development to make them viable. I understand that he will be submitting his findings on this matter to Government for a decision.</P>
      <P>Any decision to permit the operation of a casino in any part of the country will be a matter for careful consideration by the Government. A decision to permit the operation of a casino would require the provision of specific new legislation to regulate its operation.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to my Department's policy document &ldquo;The Management of Offenders &mdash; A Five Year Plan&rdquo; published last June. The document in Chapter 10 outlines the current position in <Col N="1628" /> regard to work and training in the prison system and plans for the future.</P>
      <P>Briefly the document points out that there is now a wide range of work and training activities in the prison system that have been developed by a corps of staff specially recruited and trained for them. The training activities include welding, machinery, engineering, drawing, construction, painting, decorating, printing, electronics, catering, computer skills and driving. Most of these courses are now certified by the City and Guilds of London or other bodies. Manufacturing activities involve clothing, furniture, printing, baking, laundry, cleaning and grounds upkeep.</P>
      <P>About 40 per cent of the prison population are engaged fully in these activities and another 20 per cent partly. It is reckoned that, allowing for the involvement of prisoners in other pursuits including education, another 20 per cent of the prison population could be engaged in work and training activities if the necessary accommodation were available.</P>
      <P>Chapter 10 concludes with an outline of plans for the development of work and training activities over the next five years. Work on this plan is proceeding.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Question Nos. 54 and 73 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Visa applications are generally made to an Irish Embassy or Consulate in the country where the applicant lives. With <Col N="1631" /> regard to applicants from the newly independent states which were formerly part of the Soviet Union, who are now in countries where Ireland does not have diplomatic or consular representation, the position is that such applicants may apply directly to the Department of Foreign Affairs here in Dublin for the appropriate entry visa. Letters in lieu of visa stickers are issued to applicants who apply in this way to facilitate their travel to Ireland. These applicants must call to the Department of Foreign Affairs within three days of arrival to get the visa stickers placed on their passports.</P>
    <P>This process can be time-consuming and can give rise to a considerable level of inconvenience for applicants. With a view to developing a more streamlined system to significantly reduce the time involved in the process, my Department is in communication with Aeroflot Development Ireland at Shannon in relation to an arrangement whereby that company would transmit visa applications from the newly independent states directly to my Department and thereby ease the problems which the absence of diplomatic or consular representation causes for visa applicants in these countries.</P>
    <P>On a more general level I emphasise that no obstacles are put in the way of people who genuinely wish to visit the State to further trade links or for tourism purposes and that visa applications are processed quickly. Indeed, for such bona fide business people who come here on a regular basis, and for whom there is a visa requirement, multiple entry visas are available to reduce any delay or inconvenience which might arise from having to make multiple applications.</P>
    <P>When doubts exist as to whether a particular application for a visa is a genuine one, the referee in Ireland, who is named by the applicant when applying, is usually consulted with a view to dispelling those doubts. If the doubts are dispelled, a visa will issue. If they are not, a decision is taken in the light <Col N="1632" /> of all of the circumstances surrounding the individual case. In the event of a negative decision the application can be reviewed if further information comes to light.</P>

It is a valuable contribution to the promotion of this objective.</P>
      <P>The Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe has instructed its Steering Committee for Human Rights to look into the question of the feasibility and necessity of drafting a Protocol on equality between men and women to the European Convention on Human Rights. Consideration of any Protocol to the European Convention on Human Rights that might be drafted in this area is a matter for all Ministers to consider from the perspective of their own areas of responsibility. In the area of women's rights, specific responsibility will rest with my colleague, the Minister for Equality and Law Reform.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> It has been agreed in principle that the Children's Hospital Temple Street be relocated on the campus of the Mater Hospital. It has also been accepted that future developments at the Mater Hospital would take into account the relocation of the children's hospital. It is too early to cost the relocation proposal other than to indicate that substantial capital funds would be required.</P>
      <P>Pending relocation to the Mater Hospital site, a programme of improvements is ongoing at the Children's Hospital, Temple Street. In the interim, it is intended that the hospital will be provided with adequate facilities to enable it to perform its important functions in the delivery of paediatric hospital care.</P>

        <i>Limerick East):</i> The Expert Group on the Blood Transfusion Service Board appointed on 4 March 1994 carried out a highly complex task, the primary focus of which was a detailed examination of the problems which had arisen with the Anti-D product. I do not at this stage intend to re-examine issues dealt with by the expert group in their report. I have responded to issues highlighted in the report and taken action to ensure the highest possible standards in our blood transfusion services.</P>

        <i>Limerick East):</i> Since coming into office, I was concerned that there be an independent and thorough review of all the workings of the Blood Transfusion Service Board by experienced management consultants who would address the exceptional mix of professional, technological and managerial problems which beset the board. On 31 January 1955 the Government approved the funding of a major consultancy study by Brian and Company, a United Kingdom-based firm with special expertise in the area of <Col N="1641" /> transfusion services, into the organisation and workings of the Blood Transfusion Service Board. I expect to receive its report shortly.</P>

        <i>Limerick East):</i> The provision of maternity services generally is the reponsibility of the health board. In 1994 the Eastern Health Board introduced a scheme whereby a contribution up to a maximum of £400 was made by the health board towards the cost of a domiciliary midwifery service. The case raised by the Deputy refers to expenses incurred in 1990 and 1992 which predate the scheme considerably. However, the Eastern Health Board has informed me that it is undertaking a review of this case. I will be in further communication with the Deputy in the near future.</P>

      <P>In my Department's policy document <i>The Management of Offenders &mdash; A Five Year Plan,</i> published last June, a comprehensive strategy was set out for the optimum development of the prison system. It involves the provision of 210 additional prison spaces, a major programme of refurbishment of existing accommodation and the adoption, as far as practicable, of non-custodial measures which will have the effect of reserving prison spaces for offenders for <Col N="1644" /> whom no other option is feasible. I am satisfied that this strategy is an effective response to current needs and will go a long way towards solving current deficiencies in the prison system.</P>
      <P>The 210 additional prison spaces are being provided in two new purpose built institutions &mdash; 150 for adult male offenders at Castlerea, County Roscommon and 60 for female offenders at Cowley Place, near Mountjoy Prison. Construction of these two prisons is expected to commence later this year and completion is expected early in 1997.</P>
      <P>In addition, I am proceeding with a major programme for the refurbishment and upgrading of the existing older prison buildings. It is estimated that about £55 million will require to be expended on a wide range of improvement works in the period 1995 to 1999 inclusive. A total of £10 million has been provided for this work in the current year. Non-custodial measures include the extension of community sanctions and measures at the Court stage, as well as programmed and structured early releases under supervision as part of a positive sentence management strategy.</P>
