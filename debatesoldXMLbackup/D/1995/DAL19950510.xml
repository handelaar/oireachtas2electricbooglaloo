It is also proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that: (1) Nos. 4, 5 and 6 shall be moved together and decided without debate by one question which shall be put from the Chair; and (2) Private Members' Business shall be No. 24 and the proceedings thereon shall be brought to a conclusion at 8.30 p.m. tonight.</P>

      <P>I apologise for the absence of Deputy Michael Ahern. He is attending the debate on the Finance Bill and is one of our few efficient chartered accountants who we need to attend it. We should not let this day pass without acknowledging the significance of the talks that will commence today between Sinn Féin and British Government Ministers after 23 years. They are the culmination of what we achieved last August, about which the Tánaiste and the former Taoiseach, Deputy Reynolds, can feel satisfied. I hope the talks will go from strength to strength and I wish the process well. Will the Tánaiste give the House some information on what progress has been made during the past two weeks since the Taoiseach told us that under strand II he would make direct contact and issue invitations to the parties in the North? Has that happened and what are the Tanaiste's views on that?</P>

Despite my best endeavour I cannot relate the matters referred to by Deputy Ahern to the formal Order of Business in this House.</P>

      <P>The Irish School of Ecumenics is also involved in the peace process. Will the Tánaiste pay particular attention to the difficulties in this regard? The whole idea is to deal with peace and the role of a third level institution in dealing with peace matters. If the Tánaiste cannot answer that question, perhaps he would pay attention to those difficulties.</P>

      <P>In relation to the third banking force, as the Minister for Enterprise and Employment has invited tenders, among others, from the private sector banks, for the new loans subsidy scheme for small business, will the Tánaiste say whether the Government will go ahead with its proposals for a third banking sector?</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 2, line 18, before &ldquo;disease&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;serious&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>A concern of all Members of the House is the elimination of the &ldquo;compensation culture&rdquo; prevailing in our society. In that respect the objective of my amendment is to raise the threshold of seriousness of such claims for compensation and to send out that clear signal. We have all witnessed trivial claims being pursued, at times to the annoyance of the courts, resulting in the system becoming clogged. I refer to the mentality that dictates that any minor fall, scratch or graze must result in some type of compensation, about which we must send out clear signals from this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister did not appear to be very receptive to the arguments I advanced on Committee Stage. I hope he will have had an opportunity to reflect on them in the interim because, like myself, I think he also believes that many such trivial claims have been lodged. My objective is the psychological impact that would result in the Minister's acceptance of these amendments. I am concerned with the principle, that we discourage people from believing that they deserve to be compensated, particularly in regard to minor accidents which, in many cases, may very well be their fault. Acceptance of these amendments would encourage the public generally to be more self-reliant. It would be useful also if it sent a similar signal to children. I have already said that, <Col N="1217" /> whenever as a child I fell, my parents would ask why I had not been looking where I was going. Unfortunately, some people now will assume that when their child falls, the fault lies with somebody else and not merely with the exuberance of youth. I ask the Minister to consider these amendments favourably.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 9 is a more substantive one. Deputy Keogh wishes to have the word &ldquo;serious&rdquo; inserted in the Bill, but we are both trying to deal with a similar problem. Amendment No. 9 states that &ldquo;An occupier shall not be liable to a trespasser in respect of any damage to the property of the trespasser or any injury to the person of the trespasser unless such injury is of a permanent nature or causes or contributes to any permanent ailment, disability or deformity&rdquo;. We are spelling out our concern for the removal of vexatious claims for minor bruises and scrapes for which, as Deputy Keogh stated, people would not have pursued claims in the past.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 9 provides that the occupier would not be liable to a trespasser in respect of anything other than permanent injury to either property or person or in respect of something which causes or contributes to permanent injury. While the amendment would protect people who suffer serious injury, it would exclude the majority of claims against occupiers which usually fall under the heading of something less than a permanent injury. In other words, it would exclude liability for scrapes, sprains, bruises and so on.</P>
      <P>It must be recognised that we are talking about trespassers. On Committee Stage the Minister stated he could not accept such an amendment by referring to customers who are visitors, and a separate category. Amendment No. 9 relates to trespassers and proposes that while they can claim for serious injuries, they should not be able to claim for minor ones.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct, but not visitors to which the Minister referred on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>While this is a fair proposal, if the Minister would like to amend it somewhat I am sure Deputy Keogh and my colleagues would be satisfied. We would like him to go some way towards accepting this amendment because up to 90 per cent of actions taken by trespassers against occupiers relate to minor abrasions, lacerations, sprains and so on. This is an important amendment if we are to bring about the desired change in this area. We are anxious, therefore, that the Minister should respond positively to our proposals.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Chair raised the matter of procedure, I wish to raise a point of order in that regard. As a Member of the House of reasonable standing, I note the unfortunate recent habit of tabling large numbers of amendments on Report Stage. This creates great difficulty for the operation of the House <Col N="1219" /> because they cannot be discussed and debated adequately. For example, a large number of amendments were tabled on the Report Stage of the Family Law Bill. Those amendments required a great deal of discussion, but because they were tabled on Report Stage, Members were limited in their contributions. I wish that point to be noted and it would be undesirable for the practice to continue. It is an undemocratic process.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not lay down the procedure for dealing with Report Stages of Bills in this House, it has been there for a long time. This House is sovereign in respect of changing that position if it so desires. In this case we are taking merely three amendments Nos. 1, 2 and 9. That is not a great number to take together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy Woods's amendment. There is a fundamental distinction between trespassers and lawful visitors to property, a matter which is recognised to some extent in the legislation. A separate standard of care applies and a separate onus of responsibility must be discharged for a claim to succeed. Nevertheless, landowners are extremely concerned about the possibility of a person who enters their property without their consent and suffers injury making a claim against them. It is this more than anything that is giving rise to the campaign being waged within farming organisations to cut off their properties from recreational users who fall into the same category as trespassers. We must give those organisations a measure of reassurance in this legislation. While I recognise what the Minister did in his initial proposal, from the feedback I have received he has not gone far enough, and a stronger measure will have to be introduced.</P>

    <P>As a practising lawyer of great distinction before taking up ministerial office, the Minister will be aware of the problem, particularly in urban areas, <Col N="1220" /> regarding people contriving claims. While the criminal courts have dealt with this matter to some extent, many people, the majority of whom are trespassers and are not lawfully on the property on which they allege to have been injured are still inventing claims. This difficulty is giving rise to higher insurance premia and operating costs. Will the Minister consider this matter in the context of this amendment? If this amendment is accepted far fewer people will contrive claims. People are not prepared to seriously injure themselves. They usually do something to themselves which will give them the basis for a claim but if we are talking about a serious or permanent injury, that is unlikely because the acceptance of this amendment would considerably reduce the numbers falling into that category. The criminal courts, the Garda and local authorities cannot deal with all those people. The numbers appearing before our criminal courts to date are merely the tip of the iceberg. This amendment would be a perfect stratagem to reduce those numbers considerably which would be in the interests of everybody, particularly the people who are paying inflated insurance premia.</P>

      <P>Deputy Keogh proposes that an occupier should be liable only for injuries to an entrant which resulted in serious disease or constitute a serious impairment of a physical or mental condition. Deputy Woods makes much the same point in relation to trespassers and their property and proposes that an occupier should be liable only for injuries of a permanent nature to a trespasser and should have no liability for damage to a trespasser's property. I regret that for reasons which I shall give I am unable to accept these amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If a claim for injuries is small or insignificant, it will be thrown out under the <i>de minimus</i> rule but if the claim is properly brought, if a person is injured intentionally by an occupier or through the occupier's reckless disregard and the <Col N="1221" /> injury is minor, the damages will be minor also. I do not see why an occupier who has shown want of care or reckless disregard towards an entrant should be exempt from liability altogether just because the injury is comparatively minor.</P>
    <P>The amendments envisage a radical change in our law of civil liability. We could not have one rule for occupiers who cause injuries because of their want of care or their reckless disregard and another for all other persons who cause such injuries. The definition of &ldquo;injury&rdquo; in the Bill is, word for word, that in the Civil Liability Act, 1961, which sets out the general law in this regard.</P>
    <P>Moreover, Deputy Wood's amendment would exempt occupiers from all liability if they intentionally caused less than permanent injury to a trespasser or intentionally damaged the trespasser's property. A fracture of a leg, for example, could involve hospitalisation for some months, the use of crutches for three, four or five months, considerable pain and suffering and loss of earnings but, at the end of that time, the person makes a full recovery. There would be no permanent injury and, therefore, according to Deputy Wood's amendment, no claim would arise for that type of injury.</P>
    <P>I emphasise that as far as injuries to trespassers are concerned, the liability of occupiers under this Bill is well below that under the present law and only arises when they intentionally cause injury to trespassers by reason of a danger on the premises or show reckless disregard towards them.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 2, lines 23 to 28, to delete all words from and including &ldquo;and&rdquo; in line 23 down to and including &ldquo;trespasser&rdquo; in line 28.</P>
      <P>If this amendment is accepted, the definition of &ldquo;occupier&rdquo; will state:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;occupier&rdquo;, in relation to any premises, means a person exercising such control over the state of the premises that it is reasonable to impose upon that person a duty towards an entrant in respect of a particular danger thereon</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1225" /> We propose to delete what is intended to affect the situation where there is more than one occupier. The Bill makes provision for cases where there is more than one occupier, and the definition of &ldquo;occupier&rdquo; continues as follows:</P>
    <P>&mdash;and, where there is more than one occupier of the same premises, the extent of the duty of each occupier towards an entrant depends on the degree of control each of them has over the state of the premises and the particular danger thereon and whether, as respects each of them, the entrant concerned is a visitor, recreational user or trespasser:</P>
    <P>This provides that each may owe a different level of care to people on the premises. To one occupier, a person may be a trespasser but not to another. It appears that when a number of people occupy a premises, which is not uncommon, there could be a tremendous confusion where the duty of one part occupier to a person may be that owed to a trespasser whereas the duty of another may be that owed to a visitor. This might well arise in circumstances where premises are occupied by a number of different traders, each one having liability for his place. It seems an unnecessarily confused extension of a definition that is more than adequate if it went as far as &ldquo;thereon&rdquo; on line 23 as suggested in the amendment. If the amendment is accepted the position would be much clearer both for the occupier and for people coming on to the land.</P>
    <P>Our advice on the definition as it stands is that the potential for confusion is considerable and for that reason it would be preferable to delete all words after &ldquo;thereon&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a full discussion of this amendment in the Select Committee on Legislation and Security and I have given further thought to it in the meantime. I remain convinced and so does the parliamentary draftsman that it is essential to retain these words. There is no dispute about the need to <Col N="1226" /> provide for the possibility that more than one person may occupy the premises and should be made subject to a duty to entrants in respect of a danger existing on the premises or that the extent of this duty depends on the degree of control the occupier has over the state of the premises. That is the present law. Where I disagree with Deputy Woods is that I consider it is necessary to say this specifically in the text, otherwise there would be no clear indication that the extent of the duty of each occupier could vary depending on whether, as respects each of them, the entrant concerned is a visitor and thus subject to the common duty of care or a recreational user or trespasser, in which case the duty owed is much lower.</P>
      <P>I regret therefore that for these reasons, I am unable to accept this amendment.</P>

While the definition as it stands will leave scope for confusion, there is not a great deal between us on this issue and we are prepared to accept the definition with reservation. On that basis I will withdraw my amendment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said this is a technical amendment and that is probably so. However, one of the concerns of farmers is that a person may be deemed to have been invited by a child. The court <Col N="1228" /> would then decide whether implied permission was given. It would seem to extend the status of visitor to such a person and consequently bring about a higher duty of care. Perhaps the Minister will clarify this. Will the permission now include an implied permission?</P>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am a little confused about this matter. Our original view was that an entrant should have the express permission of the occupier and not just &ldquo;express or implied&rdquo;. I have difficulty with this. On Second Stage I said that the Minister should have inserted &ldquo;at the express invitation&rdquo;. He seemed to go along with that, then held back from it and now seems to be going towards it again. At this stage, I am not sure whether he has reached the right compromise. I do not know if he is trying to ensure that the category of visitor should be more restricted or less restricted. Perhaps he will clarify that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment is consequential on the changes made in the definition of &ldquo;visitor&rdquo; on Committee Stage.

      <P>I move amendment No. 10:</P>
      <P>In page 4, between lines 21 and 22, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3) No person entering on premises, or being thereon or leaving thereof with any criminal intent or whilst entering on, or being there or leaving the premises commits or attempts to commit any criminal offence will have any cause of action against an occupier of the same premises arising from his entry thereon, his being there or leaving the same premises.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment seeks to ensure that no possibility will exist whereby a person who enters premises with any criminal intent can sue the occupier in respect of injuries sustained by him while on the premises. There is widespread support for a provision of this kind. It is ludicrous that a person who enters a premises with criminal intent can sue the occupier if he sustains a broken leg, etc. At present occupiers, including householders, are liable for injuries sustained by a person who enters their premises with criminal intent. While it may be unlikely that such a situation will arise the possibility of it arising is intolerable.</P>
      <P>The Minister's amendment No. 21 states:</P>
      <P>(3) (a) Where a person enters onto premises for the purpose of committing an offence or, while present thereon, commits an offence, the occupier shall not be liable for a breach of the duty imposed by subsection (1) (b) unless a court determines otherwise in the interests of justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b) In paragraph (a) &ldquo;offence&rdquo; means an offence against the person <Col N="1233" /> or property of the occupier or of a member of the occupier's family who is ordinarily resident on the premises, and includes an attempted offence.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's attempt to meet the spirit of my amendment. I support the proposal in subsection (3) (a) of his amendment which mirrors the proposal in my amendment but I have reservations about paragraph (b) which defines an offence as an offence against the person or property of the occupier or of a member of the occupier's family. While it may sound extraordinary, a person with criminal intent who injures himself while on an adjoining premises may take an action against the occupier of that premises. The definition of &ldquo;offence&rdquo; in paragraph (b) is so narrow as to negative the provisions in paragraph (a) of the Minister's amendment and my amendment. If the Minister's amendment is accepted a criminal will still be able to sue an occupier. We want to ensure that a criminal will not be able to do this.</P>
    <P>I welcome the inclusion in paragraph (a) of the words &ldquo;unless a court determines otherwise in the interests of justice&rdquo;. The words &ldquo;criminal offence&rdquo; in my amendment do not require further clarification. I support paragraph (a) of the Minister's amendment but I have difficulty with paragraph (b). I will not oppose his amendment as we are at least getting half a loaf, so to speak. However, paragraph (b) is somewhat flawed and takes away from what we are trying to achieve. I ask the Minister to reconsider his amendment.</P>
    <P>A person with criminal intent who injures himself in the house, garden or field next door should not be able to make a claim against the occupier. The Minister has gone a long way in his amendment towards meeting our concerns about this issue but my amendment is better in many respects. The ideal amendment would perhaps be made up of elements of both our amendments. I have concerns about <Col N="1234" /> paragraph (b) of the Minister's amendment and I hope he accepts my amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Woods that the Minister's good intentions are negatived to a large extent by paragraph (b) of his amendment. If a person enters my property, shoots me and subsequently injures himself he has no action against me but if he enters my property with the express purpose of shooting the person next door, because he can get a good aim from my house, and injures himself subsequently, he could have an action against me for damages. That distinction is unreal and Deputy Woods has illustrated the position very graphically. I take the Minister's point in the first part of his amendment that the crime has to be committed in order to deprive the person of his action for damages. Nevertheless, a person can enter my property with intent to murder, wound, pillage or rape and if before he manages to carry out his nefarious deed he falls through the floor, he can have an action for damages against me if I am held to be grossly reckless. I take it that the commission of an offence includes an attempt to commit the offence.</P>

      <P>The Minister will be aware that an attempt which is an inchoate offence is difficult to prove. It may be evident to all and sundry that this person's intent is bad but he may not have gone far enough in doing what he intended to do to come within the definition of attempt for criminal law purposes. I realise the Minister's difficulties in relation to imposing sanctions, even civil sanctions, on people on the basis of intent rather than commission but I ask the Minister to look again at paragraph (b) of his amendment. There is no moral distinction and there should not be a legal distinction between entering my property and injuring me and entering my property for the <Col N="1235" /> express purpose of injuring a person next door because my property is convenient. I thank the Minister for coming so far. I do not want to trespass unduly on his generosity but in the interest of balance, fairness and logic he should come a little further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>We are agreed that if a person enters property with intent to commit an offence that person should not have any shelter within the law. It would be a scandal if such a scenario were allowed to continue. Such people do not deserve any legal protection and they should not get it. As can be seen from amendment No. 21 the Minister is agreeable. If we are seeking a simple way out between the Minister's amendment and Deputy Woods's amendment I could put forward my own relatively simple amendment to the effect that nothing in this Bill shall be construed as imposing any civil liability upon an occupier of premises towards an entrant who has entered upon the premises for the purposes of committing a criminal offence. I agree the Minister has come a considerable way, he has listened to the debate and has tried to arrive at a solution in the first part of his amendment. If we were dealing only with subsection (3) (a) of amendment No. 21, we would be satisfied and I would have no difficulty with it. I would congratulate the Minister as much as I did on the last amendment he accepted on foot of arguments made. I am worried about the restrictive nature of subsection (3) (b). It occurred to me while other Members were speaking about a person entering land for the purpose of murder or injuring the person next door that it is very restrictive. Paragraph (b) states:</P>
      <P>In paragraph (a) &ldquo;offence&rdquo; means an offence against the person or property of the occupier or of a member of the occupier's family who is ordinarily resident on the premises, and includes an attempted offence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What happens if there is a visitor? Am I being too narrow in my interpretation? <Col N="1236" /> It appears to me that paragraph (b) is extremely restrictive. It does not negate what the Minister is trying to do. As the Minister is open to accepting the arguments being made, he recognises the scandalous position where people can have legal protection although they have criminal intent I ask him to look again at subsection (3) (b) and to reflect whether it is too restrictive and too narrow. It would be unfortunate when we are trying to arrive at the best legislation possible if something which was not his intent was included in the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendments by Deputies Keogh and Woods are amendments they moved in the Select Committee. They are designed to exempt an occupier from any liability towards a person who entered premises for the purpose of committing an offence or who committed an offence while there. In the Select Committee the amendments were supported by several other Deputies. My amendment is in response to the views expressed in the Select Committee but, for reasons which I shall explain, it does not go as far as the Deputies proposed in that committee. For example, it was proposed there that an occupier would be exempt from liability even if he or she intentionally, and without lawful excuse, injured the trespasser. That could not be justified. Of course, if the occupier has a lawful excuse for inflicting injury, as he or she would have in self defence or in defence of property, that situation is provided for in section 8 (a) which preserves the occupier's rights in that respect.</P>
      <P>Leaving aside intentional injuries to trespassers, we could not totally relieve occupiers from the consequences of their reckless disregard in each and every case where an offence is committed. The offence may be an entirely trivial one, such as taking apples or flowers &mdash; an offence which is more or less predictably committed by children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My amendment establishes the principle that an occupier will not be liable for breach of the duty imposed by section 4 (1) (b) in relation to a person <Col N="1237" /> who enters the premises for the purpose of committing an offence or who commits an offence while on the premises but &mdash; this is an important qualification &mdash; it allows the court in an appropriate case to depart from that principle where the interests of justice so require. We cannot foresee all the various sets of circumstances that can arise in this area. It would be prudent to recognise that there may be cases of reckless disregard when the court may have to exercise its discretion if justice is to be done. I hope my amendment No. 21 will be acceptable to the House on this basis.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to paragraph (b) of my amendment. It extends what Deputies are trying to achieve by including an attempted offence which otherwise might not be included in subsection (3) (a). The inclusion of attempted offences is a major extension. Deputy O'Dea made the point about intent but my amendment covers entry on land for the purpose of committing an offence, whether or not it is committed. That is much the same as entering with the intention of committing an offence. Deputy Woods raised the point about an offence committed crossing the county boundary as it were. That is a rather extreme situation. I have gone a long way, as far as I possibly can, to meet the comments made by Deputies in the committee and in the House. I commend my amendment No. 21 to the House.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister's explanation in regard to subsection (3) (b) of his amendment and the fact that he considers it extends to a person entering premises with a criminal intent. We have a dilemma in that the Minister has come a great deal of the way with us and is obviously anxious to meet us in spirit. However, I know of cases where teenagers have gone into somebody's garden, perhaps to steal apples &mdash; not a locking up offence &mdash; or, more common nowadays, a bicycle, have fallen and injured themselves and then brought a civil action for damages against the owner.</P>

      <P>Our view is that under the present law a person on a premises with criminal intent, not necessarily in relation to the premises, might have grounds for action if he was injured. This could arise in the case of an invitee, that is a person coming in with the permission and in the interests of the occupier but who, unknown to the occupier, was committing a criminal offence. Such a situation is not acceptable, and we strongly urge the Minister to accept our amendment No. 10, which is comprehensive and direct, and seeks to ensure that no person should be able to recover damages against an occupier in the circumstances set out in the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In these days when we are facing what, in effect, is a crime-wave &mdash; since Christmas we have seen a huge increase in the availability of drugs, trespassing, mugging and robbery &mdash; we want the ordinary citizen defended as fully as possible. Although I have reservations, which were echoed by Deputy Keogh, I supported the step being taken by the Minister but ask him, before finalising the Bill, to examine the issue further in the context of the Seanad debate which will follow. We recognise that the Minister has gone a long way to meet our requests and we appreciate that &mdash; I would not like him to think otherwise. I take a somewhat non-political approach to these issues because it is necessary to produce good law, and that takes time and trouble. That may not be suited to television news programmes where what is required is a few quick words &mdash; it is significant that the press gallery is empty, as it usually is when we are discussing the meat of a Bill and issues that affect every householder, farmer and <Col N="1239" /> occupier in the country. These issues must be debated fully with a Minister who is prepared to consider what has been said and take the considerable legal advice available to him.</P>
    <P>The points I made in regard to amendment No. 21 are generally agreed on this side of the House. I ask the Minister to examine the matter further. In the meantime we are happy to accept what we know to be considerably more than half a loaf and thank the Minister for taking the steps he has. We recognise that it is difficult to find the right solution in this area and we are thankful that he has gone as far as he has.</P>

      <P>In page 4, lines 25 and 26, to delete &ldquo;or had reasonable grounds for believing&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 4 restricts the duty owed to recreational users and trespassers. However, my concern is that there is a capacity to undermine what the Minister sets out to do in the section. We discussed this matter at a reasonable length on Committee Stage but I am concerned that, rather than dovetailing subsection (1), subsection (2) and the <Col N="1240" /> paragraphs contained therein extend the duty owed. There is an invitation to judges to continue to give negligence based rulings. A number of my amendments relate to the degree of duty owed. I am concerned that the courts will have to deal with a hard case and the way to deal with it is by being very precise about the duty owed to recreational users and trespassers. Has the Minister decided to accept these amendments?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>These amendments would unduly tilt the balance in favour of an occupier who had shown reckless disregard towards a recreational user or trespasser. The section at present requires an occupier to know or to have reasonable grounds for believing, first, that there was a danger on the premises and, second, that the entrant was or was likely to be not only on the premises but also in the vicinity of the danger. If we delete the requirement that the occupier should have reasonable grounds for believing that these two conditions existed then it would be only too easy for the occupier to say in some circumstances that he or she did not know of the existence of those conditions and the occupier could escape liability no matter how grievous his or her conduct had been.</P>
      <P>The same would apply to the deletion of the words &ldquo;or was likely to be&rdquo;. That is a relevant criterion to be taken into account in deciding whether an occupier acted with reckless disregard. These words occur in the opening paragraphs of subsection (2) which set out the basic conditions governing the liability of the occupier in the sense that the occupier will not be liable if the criteria set out in these paragraphs are not satisfied, but even if the criteria are satisfied the occupier will not necessarily be liable. Regard must be had also to the remaining criteria in the subsection such as the care the entrant took for his or her own safety and so on before determining whether an occupier had acted with reckless disregard towards the entrant. For these reasons I regret I cannot accept the amendments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>

      <P>We should be concerned at all times to maintain a balance. The Minister said that these amendments would tilt the balance in favour of the occupier but I do not accept that, it is a question of interpretation. Even if we were to delete those words, the provisions would still be more than adequate. In looking at the wording used in the section it seems that some occupiers will have to be clairvoyants. There will not be a meeting of minds on these amendments.</P>

    <P>I am not too perturbed that the Minister has not accepted some of the amendments because important amendments have been accepted. Again, it is a question of degree. I am not a lawyer but in considering legislation politicians should try to deal with it in lay person's terms. Much of the debate will centre on <Col N="1242" /> people's perception of liability.

      <P>In page 4, between lines 38 and 39, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(e) where the person is a minor, regard shall be had to whether or not the occupier was entitled to expect in the circumstances that some adult or other responsible person would take steps to prevent the person from entering the premises:&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Minister has made some major changes. This amendment seeks to insert a further paragraph to provide that regard shall be had to whether an occupier was entitled to expect that some adult would take steps to prevent a minor from entering a premises. The amendment would protect an occupier where it was reasonable for him to expect that a person in charge of a child would take normal steps to prevent the child from entering the premises. It should be noted that regard would only be had to this paragraph in determining whether an occupier acted with reckless disregard.</P>
      <P>If, for instance, the occupier was to see that some young person was under the control of a responsible person, that is, a parent, a guardian or an adult, this should be taken into account in determining whether he recklessly disregarded the danger. Whether the person is a minor, in considering what duty the occupier owed to entrants, regard should be had to whether the occupier was entitled to assume that the responsible person would take reasonable steps to prevent the minor from entering the premises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This issue arises in the countryside where people enter farm land on which <Col N="1243" /> there are natural dangers. The purpose of the amendment is to give some degree of protection to the occupier &mdash; for example, where a person brings a group of young people onto a property and they are welcome to avail of the facilities there a certain degree of care should be expected from the person in charge of the minors.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>In the amendments discussed earlier I have provided for the situation where an entrant is actually on the premises in another's company and where account should be taken of the extent of the supervision and control the other person might reasonably be expected to exercise over the entrant's activities. Deputy Woods's amendment deals with the situation before the entrant &mdash; a minor &mdash; enters the premises and where the occupier might reasonably expect that some adult or other responsible person would take steps to prevent the minor from doing so.</P>
      <P>I appreciate the motivation underlying this amendment. However, under the present law parents and others in control of children have a duty of care as to their welfare and, as the Law Reform Commission pointed out in its report on occupiers' liability, a parent who carelessly permits a child to wander from home to a neighbouring or, indeed, far-off property where the child sustains injuries will be held liable for those injuries to the child. Under the Bill the occupier of the property where the injuries were sustained will be liable only where it is shown that he or she acted with reckless disregard towards the presence, or likely presence, of the child on the property. In that case liability may be shared between the occupier and the parent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 4 provides that, in determining whether an occupier acted with reckless disregard, regard must be had to all the circumstances and these would include the fact, if it is a fact, that the parent of the child should have prevented it from entering the premises. <Col N="1244" /> More specifically, in paragraph (b) regard must be had to whether the occupier knew or had reasonable grounds for believing that the entrant was in, or was likely to be in, the vicinity of the place where the danger existed. It would be highly relevant in that context if the circumstances were such that the occupier was entitled to expect that the child would be prevented from entering the premises by its parent or guardian. If that were so, the occupier would not have had reasonable grounds for believing that the child was likely to be on the premises and it is difficult to see how in those circumstances the occupier could be held to have acted with reckless disregard towards the child. Similar considerations would apply if the injured person were an adult but was mentally handicapped. For these reasons I consider that the point is already adequately catered for in section 4 (2), particularly in paragraphs (b) and (c), and I regret that I am therefore unable to go along with it.</P>

      <P>In page 5, to delete lines 6 to 10.</P>
      <P>This amendment seeks to delete the part of section 4 (3) which states: &ldquo;Notwithstanding subsection (1), where an occupier of premises provides a structure thereon for use primarily by recreational users, the occupier shall owe a duty towards such users in respect of such a structure to take reasonable care to maintain the structure in a safe condition&rdquo;. While the subsection is limited to structures provided for use primarily by recreational users, it would apply to a wide variety of structures. For instance, if a farmer does not wish a gate to be continually left open and provides a stile beside the gate for recreational users, he will be liable for any injury sustained as a result of the bad condition of that stile. If an occupier provides a park bench on his property for the benefit of recreational users he will be liable for the maintenance of that bench. I am concerned that as a result of this subsection occupiers will be very reluctant to provide such structures for recreational users and they may even remove structures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 23 in the Minister's name, which proposes to delete &ldquo;where an occupier of premises provides a structure thereon for use primarily by recreational users&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;where a structure on premises is or has been provided for use primarily by recreational users&rdquo;, would render the section ambiguous. I am proposing that the whole reference to this matter be deleted. In effect the Minister, in amendment No. 23, is extending the duty on the occupier to maintain structures which he may not even know exist because the amendment refers to structures other than those provided by the occupier. For example, the provision may relate to a structure on a remote part of an occupier's land or a bridge over a ditch and the occupier would be liable for its maintenance. From that point of view we are concerned about the Minister's amendment. We prefer <Col N="1247" /> our amendment, which proposes to delete certain words.</P>
    <P>I would be interested to hear the Minister's view on his amendment No. 23 and amendment No. 24 which effectively follows on from it. Section 4 (3) states &ldquo;Provided that... his or her duty towards a recreational user thereof in respect of such structure shall not be extended by virtue of this subsection&rdquo;. That relates to an occupier's duty of care towards a recreational user. Amendment No. 24 proposes the deletion of the words &ldquo;where an occupier of premises provides a stile, gate, footbridge or other similar structure thereon not for use primarily by recreational users....&rdquo;. We are fearful that the Minister is expanding an occupier's duty of care for structures which he or she may not know exist. We consider there is a difficulty in that regard and that our amendment No. 22 is preferable.</P>

      <P>I do not have that difficulty. We had considerable discussion on this matter on Committee Stage and I am of the view that if a structure is provided for use by recreational users, it is reasonable to expect it should be sound and maintained by the occupier. On rereading the Bill on Report Stage, I do not have any great difficulty with the provisions proposed by the Minister. I appreciate the purpose of the amendments he tabled and I do not consider that the provision in section 4 (3) should be omitted from the Bill. That would not solve anything. I have only minor points of disagreement with Deputy Woods on the Bill. As a parent, I consider that if structures are provided for use by children, it is reasonable to expect that they should be maintained in a safe condition.</P>

      <P>There was a full discussion on this amendment on Committee Stage. At the time I said I was opposed to it in principle and that is still my view. Section 4 (3) proposes that where an occupier provides a structure <Col N="1248" /> primarily for use by recreational users the occupier will have a duty to take reasonable care to maintain it in a safe condition and amendment No. 22 proposes to delete that provision. I must emphasise that the duty of care imposed by the subsection applies only to structures provided primarily for recreational users. It does not apply to any other structures on the premises which are for the use of the occupier and his family in the ordinary way. If an occupier has a structure on his or her property that will be used primarily by recreational users, and if that is the primary purpose of providing it, I cannot see why that occupier should not be obliged to maintain it in a safe condition. Otherwise, we would allow people to put up ramshackle structures or to let existing ones become dangerous through lack of maintenance without any remedy unless it could be proved that they had acted with reckless disregard for recreational users, which is a lower standard of liability. Persons who use facilities provided specifically for them are entitled to expect that they will be kept in a safe condition regardless of whether they are in an urban playground or in the open country. This provision is in the interests of the safety of people who are expected to use those facilities. For those reasons I am unable to accept the Deputy's amendment. My own amendments to the subsection and its proviso are aimed at making it clear that these provisions will apply no matter when the structures concerned were provided. As the text stands it appears to apply only to structures provided by the existing occupier. Clearly the need to protect recreational users from unsafe structures put there primarily for their use applies no matter who erected them. The same applies to the proviso which specifically ensures that the occupier's duty is not extended to structures which are not for use primarily by those users.</P>

      <P>The Minister has outlined the problem which relates to structures <Col N="1249" /> provided primarily for use by recreational users. Such users are not customers and do not fall into the category of visitors, as stated in the section; they are recreational users or trespassers, the Minister is purposely and positively including old structures as well as new ones in the provision. The message in that is that people should ensure that whatever structures are on their farms, which may cover a wide area, are maintained in a safe condition. As was stated on Committee Stage, that is acceptable from the point of view of people, such as those in the public sector, who are providing structures in parks. Following the passage of this Bill they will have to take on a higher duty of care and greater responsibility and provide for that financially. That is one of the issues that arises.</P>
      <P>The provision affects all community groups because such groups provide structures and facilities primarily for recreational users and, consequently, they would be bound by this section. That is one of the issues that was the cause of much difficulty in the first instance. People who in all innocence, provided facilities in the spirit of wanting to be community-oriented and to help development suddenly found that, because they could be deemed to be providing such structures for recreational users, they incur liability for their maintenance. It does not appear that their problems, which are great, will be solved by this Bill.</P>
      <P>We might ask, why do we have such a serious drugs problem and other major problems in our society? However, when we investigate matters we find that communities who want to provide recreational facilities are discouraged from doing so. Therefore, we are stipulating that any past structure, or any about to be provided, must be raised to the standard of care and maintenance applicable to the providers of public services generally, whether it be the Office of Public Works in regard to parks or whoever.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not happy about this section. We may well be worsening the position. No <Col N="1250" /> doubt this will be further examined by the Seanad. While our natural inclination would be to vote against this provision and its implications, we will not press it. The Minister in his amendment wants to include any structures, whether located on a farm, premises, within a community or whatever, provided primarily for recreational users. There is a difficulty in defining which facilities are provided primarily for recreational users and which will probably give rise to much future discussion and argument.</P>
    <P>The Minister can further examine our expressed concerns. We will not press the issue any further at this point.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the Minister's next amendment, No. 26, I expressed concern about <Col N="1251" /> the reasonable steps an occupier should be expected to take to bring a notice to the attention of any visitor on his or her lands or property. Section 5 (2) <i>(b) (ii)</i> reads:</P>
    <P>in case the occupier purports by notice to so restrict, modify or exclude that duty, the occupier has taken reasonable steps to bring the notice to the attention of the visitor.</P>
    <P>I was particularly concerned about that provision, which takes us back to what the Minister would consider to be reasonable. The Minister's amendment reads:</P>
    <P>In page 5, between lines 27 and 28, to insert the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(c) For the purposes of paragraph (b) (ii) an occupier shall be presumed, unless the contrary is shown, to have taken reasonable steps to bring a notice to the attention of a visitor if it is prominently displayed at the normal means of access to the premises.&rdquo;.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 5 (2) provides that an occupier <Col N="1252" /> may by express agreement or notice restrict, modify or exclude his or her duty towards visitors, that is the common duty of care. Such a modification will not bind a visitor unless it is reasonable and is by notice unless the occupier has taken reasonable steps to bring the notice to the attention of the relevant visitor.</P>
    <P>It has been represented to me that some guidance should be included on what would constitute reasonable steps, that, if a notice is prominently displayed at the normal means of access to a premises, that should constitute <i>prima facie</i> evidence that reasonable steps have been taken to bring it to the attention of the visitor. That is a fair point to which I am giving effect in this amendment.</P>

      <P>The Minister might very well get a reputation for having been very reasonable, having taken on board various of our earlier amendments. There was considerable debate about occupiers' liability for the negligence of independent contractors. Our concern had been that far too much onus was being placed on an occupier to ensure that work had been properly carried out. I was concerned that an occupier would have to examine every nail and bolt and that was going too far. The Minister may not have gone as far as I might have but as his amendment is reasonable I can withdraw my proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>We also welcome the Minister having taken our views on board. Indeed Deputy Keogh's amendment is similar to amendment No. 29 which proposes the deletion of the words &ldquo;and that the work had been properly done&rdquo;. In his amendment No. 28 the Minister proposes deleting lines 17 to 19 and substituting &ldquo;the work concerned) unless the occupier has or ought to have had knowledge of the fact that the work was not properly done&rdquo;. That is closer to our proposal while it is not as water-tight or succinct. I wonder why he omitted the words &ldquo;unless the contract... expressly provides otherwise&rdquo;. What would happen if both parties did not want the occupier to be liable? The Bill provides that the occupier cannot contract out of his duty. If the Minister accepts our proposal and there is agreement between the two parties, the occupier could be indemnified or opt out of his or her duty. The Minister's amendment does not cover circumstances in which both parties agree.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We accept the Minister's amendment. It goes a long way towards meeting what we propose and improves the position with one question mark about why <Col N="1254" /> the Minister proposes to delete the term &ldquo;unless the contract expressly provides otherwise&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>If an independent contractor and an occupier wish to do a deal making the contractor liable, I assume it would stand. Now that the Minister has excised the term &ldquo;unless the contract expressly provides otherwise&rdquo;, a contractor can be dragged into court even though an independent contractor may have agreed to accept liability. This is ludicrous and I see no reason for deleting a provision which provides, statutorily, that a contract can be drawn up between an occupier and an independent contractor stating that the occupier cannot be sued on foot of work carried out by the contractor.</P>
      <P>I thank the Minister for accepting the thrust of the case we made on Committee Stage. While his amendment goes a long way towards meeting our proposal it is reasonable to expect that an independent contractor should not escape liability if he or she carries out shoddy work which makes property unsafe and the occupier is fully aware of this. I am less happy with the provision in the Minister's amendment which states that unless the occupier has, or ought to have had, knowledge of the fact that the work was not properly done, he cannot escape liability. The Minister is introducing a note of uncertainty here which I am sure will give rise to litigation. I would prefer the position to be more definite whereby if the occupier has knowledge of the fact that the work was not properly carried out, he or she may escape liability. Will the Minister explain why the provision about the right of a person to contract with an independent contractor in respect of liability was deleted from the legislation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I presumed the answer was obvious. Deputies Woods and O'Dea are concentrating on the relationship between the occupier and independent contractor, but we are talking about the position of an injured <Col N="1255" /> third party. While it would be acceptable for the occupier and the independent contractor to have internal contractual arrangements <i>inter se</i>, the rights of a third party would be a separate matter and would arise by statute, independent of the contract they draw up.</P>
      <P>I thank the Deputies for their reasonable response to the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>They could draw up a contract between themselves and while that would be valid, it would not affect the position of a claim by a third party who would not have a connection with it.</P>
      <P>In the select committee I agreed to consider amendments put forward by Deputies Keogh and Woods, which they have now retabled.</P>
      <P>Section 7 deals with the circumstances in which an occupier may, exceptionally, be liable for injuries caused by the negligence of an independent contractor who has left the occupier's premises in a dangerous state and an entrant is injured as a result.</P>
      <P>It provides that the occupier will not be liable if the occupier has taken all reasonable care in the circumstances. What is &ldquo;reasonable care&rdquo; is spelled out as including such steps as the occupier ought reasonably to have taken to satisfy himself or herself that the contractor was competent to do the work in question. I think we are all agreed up to this point.</P>
      <P>The section goes on to include steps that the occupier should reasonably have taken to ensure that the work had been properly done. It was on this aspect the debate concentrated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I took the view that the provision was reasonable in that it allowed a measure of flexibility depending on the nature and extent of the work performed by the contractor. If, say, a substantial extension was being built on a house, most people would ensure that the work was supervised by a qualified person or <Col N="1256" /> at least checked by such a person when it was completed. For very minor works that would not be expected. I may also add that such a provision was recommended in the Law Reform Commission's report.</P>
    <P>The case was made, however, that this requirement would entail a constant cycle of checking and rechecking before an occupier could be sure that the contractor was not negligent, and that when an occupier was satisfied that the contractor was competent there should be no liability as occupier arising out of the contractor's negligence. That goes too far. What if the occupier is aware that the contractor has been negligent, that as a result the premises are in a dangerous state and a person is injured? An occupier should not escape liability by pleading that he or she knew there was a danger on the premises but that it was not up to occupier to do anything about it as it was the contractor's fault for not having done the work properly.</P>
    <P>In this Bill we are trying to strike a balance between, on the one hand, the rights of occupiers against unreasonable claims by entrants and, on the other, the rights of entrants to premises not to be exposed to dangers of which the occupiers are aware. In this case the balance would swing too far against entrants if we were simply to delete, as proposed, the words &ldquo;and that the work had been properly done&rdquo; or to go even further, as Deputy Keogh suggests.</P>
    <P>What I am putting forward in my amendment as a solution is to delete these words, but to make the occupier liable if he or she had knowledge, or ought to have had knowledge, of the fact that the work was not properly done. In other words, liability will arise only if the occupier knows, or should know, that the work has not been properly done and constitutes a danger to an entrant. That will be a question of fact in each case. This is a reasonable proposition and I am grateful to my colleagues for accepting that.</P>

      <P>I join the Minister in welcoming the Bill as amended in the House. We are happy to see the passing of this legislation which has been in incubation for some years now, when one considers the reports of the Law Reform Commission and the various <Col N="1258" /> proposals. I thank the Law Reform Commission for the work it put into this which was of great value to everybody concerned on both sides of the House. Members on both sides of the House found it particularly helpful to have the views and considerations of the Law Reform Commission available to them. As a result, many of the technicalities were at least elucidated for us and we could consider them in the knowledge that they dealt with technical matters and real and important issues. It is valuable to recognise the work of the Law Reform Commission in this regard and the work subsequently carried out by the Minister's officials on this particularly complex legislation. This is difficult legislation to deal with both from a Government and Opposition point of view and it caused great concern throughout the country. We listened to those concerns and put them to the Minister.</P>
      <P>The Bill is far better now than when it was initiated, as a result of various representations, the consideration given to it by the select committee and on Second Stage. I thank the IFA and the ICMSA for the clear expression of their views in relation to the Bill. Many groups involved in sporting and recreational activities were concerned that the farming community in particular, and landowners generally, were required to restrict people entering their lands because of the existing laws. As a result of this Bill, their duty of care and responsibility will be more clearly defined and their position will be safer in that regard. In that respect, the House has done a very good job in finding the necessary balance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Committee Stage we highlighted difficulties with the Bill but the Minister was particularly forthcoming and generous in regard to those. While he stood his ground on Committee Stage and gave us the standard replies, nevertheless he considered the points of view and came back with sensible and reasonable amendments on Report Stage. Of course, that is the way the House should work and in that respect <Col N="1259" /> the Minister provided a good example of how to meet the needs of Members in regard to important legislation.</P>

    <P>The Bill is now much improved from that which was originally initiated.

I congratulate the Minister for succeeding in steering this complex legislation through the House so professionally and for being flexible and reasonable in his approach. I believe he has gone as far as he could in the circumstances to satisfy the demands of the various farming organisations and other groups. He has endeavoured to strike a fair balance between the rights of occupiers and the rights of entrants to land for various reasons. He has included in the Bill all the principles I tried to enshrine in the Private Members' Bill I introduced here.</P>

    <P>I hope the passing of this Bill will now remove the terror in respect of this whole issue and that it will ensure the continued use of land for recreational purposes. I hope it will mean that the country side will be accessible to everyone, including urban dwellers, recreational users and tourists because land is crucial to the future of our tourism industry. The Bill will go a long way towards ensuring that occupiers will have confidence in allowing people on their property. Equally, entrants will feel confident that they can enter lands knowing exactly where they stand as regards the law. They will no longer be <Col N="1261" /> reluctant to enter people's property.

      <P>I had the opportunity to have exchanges with the Minister on Committee Stage and I am delighted to contribute at the conclusion of this Bill. When one considers the confusion and anxiety that prevailed prior to the introduction of this Bill one realises the difficulty in introducing a Bill of this kind. It was a difficult task, a challenge that had to be taken up because the people felt they were not being treated fairly and the Minister had to ensure that a fair and reasonable balance was struck between the rights of the occupier and those who for one reason or another had occasion to use their property.</P>
      <P>Deputy Woods tabled a number of amendments on Committee Stage which clearly articulated our concern about what we saw as a lack of balance. On Committee Stage we argued our case trenchantly on a number of issues relating to minors and those who would trespass with criminal intent. We were unanimous that people trespassing with criminal intent should not have a right to claim against the occupier. The Minister has come some considerable way in addressing that and his response is reasonable. I compliment him on that.</P>
      <P>Another area causing concern on Committee Stage was where an occupier provided a facility for recreational users. We all argued strongly that the balance of advantage and right should rest with the occupier who had gone to the expense, trouble and inconvenience of providing recreational facilities. The Minister elaborated on the implications of his amendment and this goes a considerable way to addressing our concerns.</P>
      <P>I join with other speakers in complimenting the Minister on the successful passage of this Bill and no doubt it will be further enriched by its passage through the Seanad.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That section 33 be deleted.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I propose to delete section 33 and replace it with the text of amendment No. 47; otherwise, the text of the Bill, as amended, would contain duplicate provisions and thereby lead to confusion.</P>
      <P>One of the most gratifying results of the debate so far is that the text and content of the Bill have been improved. In that regard I compliment my predecessor on her openness to arguments in the House and to all Deputies who contributed to this worthwhile outcome. In harmony with this approach I am proposing extensive amendments to certain sections. On the advice of the Attorney General's Office section 33, dealing with the form and content of certain credit agreements, has been redrafted. The present text, which is a composite one, covers the various credit agreements, for example, cash loans, hire purchase, moneylending and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The effect of the amendment is that there will be a general requirements provision and then specific requirements in respect of cash loans, credit sale contracts for services, hire purchase, consumer hire and moneylending <Col N="1263" /> agreements. The first of these provisions is contained in the new section 34 which replaces section 33. It reflects, in many instances, the contents of the existing section 33 in the credit agreement. Any contract of guarantee must be made in writing, signed by the consumer and given to the consumer at the time of making the agreement or delivered within ten days of making the agreement, contain a statement of the cooling off period and a statement of the names and addresses of the parties to the agreement and any costs or penalties in the event of failure to comply with the agreement.</P>
    <P>These general requirements apply to all credit agreements. The new sections 35, 36 and 38 provide details of the specific requirements in respect of credit agreements for cash loans, credit sale agreements and contracts for services. Section 35 sets out the contents of credit agreements for cash loans and credit agreements operated by means of a credit card or a running account. Such agreements must contain, among other things, details of the amount lent, the amount and number of repayment instalments, total amounts repayable, the rate of interest, APR, any other charges and the means and cost of early termination.</P>
    <P>The absence of credit sale was referred to by Deputy McDowell on Committee Stage. I am pleased I can now rectify this omission and provide for and regulate this form of credit. I am inserting the definition: &ldquo;credit sale agreement means a credit agreement for the sale of goods or the supply of services under which the purchase price or part of it is payable in instalments and the property and goods where the agreement relates to goods passes to the buyer immediately upon the making of the agreement&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Section 36 details the contents of a credit sale agreement and also provides that before such an agreement is entered into the seller shall state in writing the cash price of the goods to the buyer. The requirement will be deemed <Col N="1264" /> to have been complied with when the goods when seen by the buyer had the price tag attached to or displayed with the goods or where the goods are selected from a catalogue price list or advertisement, the cash price was stated.</P>
    <P>The new section 37 lays down the circumstances in which a credit agreement shall be deemed to be void. In subsection (a) a person acting on behalf of the seller is treated or deemed to be an agent of the buyer and in subsection (b) the seller is relieved from any acts or defaults of the seller's agents. These anti-avoidance provisions are aimed at dishonest or unscrupulous operators. One of the innovations of the amendment is the new section 38. This provides for credit agreements which are contracts for services.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes. If it were labour law the typical contract is a contract of service; this is a contract for services. It specifically provides for credit agreements which are contracts for services. Such agreements must contain a description of the service including any goods to be supplied with the services and the total cost of credit, the cash price of the services and the amount of each instalment and either the repayment date or the method of determining the repayment date, for example, the last day of the month or the first Monday of the month or whatever, the cost of early termination and the APR.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am confident that these amendments strengthen considerably the position of consumers because the information they are required to be given is set out in clear and intelligible language. The separate requirements for the various categories of agreement will help to better inform consumers of their rights and entitlements. They are the cash price of the services to which the agreement relates, the amount of each instalment by which the total cost of credit is to be paid, the date or the method of determining the date upon which each <Col N="1265" /> instalment is payable, the means and cost of any termination of the agreement by the consumer before final payment and where applicable, the rate of interest charged, the conditions under which APR may be changed and a description of the services, including any goods to be supplied to which the agreement relates.</P>

      <P>The way the matter is now outlined makes for greater clarity. Each type of credit arrangement is given a title and subtitle of its own and the conditions attaching to it are clearly laid down. That should be of help to the consumer. I agree with the amended version.</P>

      <P>Our spokesperson on the Bill, Deputy McDowell, is involved in discussing the Finance Bill. As the amendments were made available this morning he only had a cursory look at them. The Minister put down some of these amendments in response to points made by Deputy McDowell on Committee Stage and I welcome them. I hope Deputy McDowell will have an opportunity to participate in the Report Stage debate. Given the large number of committees, the timetables for some committees dealing with similar matters clash and small parties find it difficult to have representation at all of them. Will the Minister explain in more detail the reasons for the changes?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to reassure Deputy Molloy that this amendment is essentially a redraft of the existing section 33. The only material change between the two sections relates to the contract for services. I have taken on board the points made by Deputy McDowell on Committee Stage and there is a specific amendment to provide for this. I am sensitive to the obligations on small parties &mdash; I lived with this for <Col N="1266" /> a very long time &mdash; and there is no sleight of hand involved here.</P>

      <P>All parties are interested in the Finance Bill and it is very hard for Deputies to be present at both the committee and in this House. A contract for service has a different connotation under Labour legislation. The amendment provides that a credit sale agreement shall contain a statement of the total cost of credit, the cash price of the goods to which the agreement relates, the amount of each of the instalments by which the total purchase price is to be paid, the date or the method of determining the date upon which each instalment is payable, the number of instalments, the cost of any termination of the agreement by the buyer before final payment and, where applicable, the rate of interest charged and the APR and the conditions under which the APR may be charged. This calls into question the nature, range, quality, quantity, durability etc., of services which are not easily quantified in the case of some products. Will the Minister elaborate on this point?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment sets out the requirements relating to the contents of contracts for services. The Bill as previously drafted did not set out these requirements. The argument in favour of setting out the requirements is that the consumer could find himself or herself disadvantaged merely because the service being supplied was a contract for service. This amendment seeks to close that loophole. The amendment is very explicit in terms of stipulating the requirements. The credit sale agreement shall contain the total cost of credit, the cash price of the service to which the agreement relates, the amount of each instalment, the date or method of determining the date upon which each instalment is payable, the means and cost of any termination of the agreement by the consumer and, where applicable, the rate of interest charged and the conditions under which the APR may be changed. The amendment <Col N="1267" /> is primarily about clarity. It will also close a loophole so that people who enter into contracts for services are not disadvantaged.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1272" /> This amendment seeks to delete section 35 (2) which requires that a creditor who is party to a credit agreement must ensure that such an agreement contains a notice in the form stipulated in Part I of the Third Schedule. This notice must contain the following information: the amount of the credit advanced; the period of the agreement; the number of repayment instalments; the amount of each instalment; the total amount repayable; the cost of the credit and the APR. This requirement is being extended under amendment No. 48c which inserts a stand alone provision whereby the creditor must ensure that the agreement contains not only the notice to which I have referred but all the other information which the various forms of credit agreements must contain, for example, cash price, amount and number of instalments, the means of determining the agreement etc.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 48c requires that this duty on the creditor shall extend to any amendments introduced by means of regulation to either this Part of the Bill or the Third Schedule. It also has the effect that if a creditor does not meet the mandatory requirements in relation to the credit agreement the agreement shall be rendered unenforceable. However, the court may rule, subject to any conditions it may impose, that the agreement shall be enforceable if it can be shown that the failure to comply was not deliberate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Trade (Mr. E. Kenny)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have indicated in response to previous similar Dáil questions the Minister for Justice has primary responsibility for tackling the problem of crime against tourists. As Minister with responsibility for tourism I am concerned at the level of crime against tourists and the damage that this can do to our hard earned reputation as an important and, in particular, friendly tourist destination. This concern is shared by my colleague, the Minister for Justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While final figures for 1994 are not yet available I understand from the Department of Justice that there has been a slight increase in the number of crimes committed against tourists in 1994 compared with 1993 for both the <Col N="1274" /> Dublin area and the country as a whole. While there are undoubtedly grounds for concern about the problem, it is important that we keep a sense of proportion. First, the increase has to be seen in the context of a significant increase in overseas visitor numbers in 1994. Second, the growth in crime is a worldwide phenomenon and Ireland rates very well in any international comparison. For example, less than 0.2 per cent of visitors to Dublin are victims of crime and this figure includes victims of petty crime.</P>
    <P>A number of specific measures have been taken in recent years by the Garda, Bord Fáilte and other interests specifically to address the problem of crime against tourists. These include regular liaison between the Garda authorities, Bord Fáilte and other tourism interests; deployment of additional Garda patrols in areas of high tourist interest; establishment of a Garda office in O'Connell Street which acts as a centre for advising tourists on safety measures; distribution of safety leaflets in three languages and city maps, produced by the Garda, to tourists; increased level of foreign language training for gardaí; special provision in the Criminal Evidence Act, 1992, to enable tourist victims to make an immediate statement before a district judge, which eliminates the necessity to attend the subsequent trial; action by gardaí against illegal traffic wardens; setting up of a business watch scheme in Talbot Street &mdash; which may be extended to Grafton Street and Mary Street in 1995; and further measures to be taken by the Garda, Bord Fáilte and the tourism industry in 1995 to propagate &ldquo;stay safe&rdquo; messages.</P>
    <P>The Dublin Tourist Victim Support Service, which was set up in April 1994 has also played a valuable role in counteracting the effect of crime against tourists. This service is run by the Victim Support Organisation, from premises provided by the Department of Justice in Harcourt Square. It provides emotional and practical support to tourist victims referred to it by the Garda. <Col N="1275" /> While essentially a Dublin service it will also assist victims referred from the regions.</P>
    <P>The service has operated very successfully with a total of 301 visitors assisted in the 1994-95 season. A further positive feature of the service was that most of the clients assisted elected to continue their holiday despite their experience, with many promising to return.</P>
    <P>I met the board of management of this service recently and in the light of its positive contribution to tourism, have decided to increase my Department's support for the service from £5,000 in 1994 to £10,000 this year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Minister for the comprehensive response to what he and the House would consider is an important question in the context of the safety of those people who are so valuable to this country. In a recent response the Minister indicated he was meeting with the Minister for Justice to discuss the core answer to this problem, the additional policing of the streets of the capital city. In the course of his reply the Minister mentioned that the Dublin Tourist Victim Support Service said that 80 per cent of crime against tourists takes place in the capital city. That is a shocking statistic. Will the Minister indicate whether it is the intention to solve this problem once and for all by &mdash; in addition to the measures he has put in place &mdash; additional policing of our streets; in other words foot policemen and women?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Andrews in that one crime against any visitor or any national in our country is one crime too many. This should be put in context. For example, in today's newspaper, on a survey carried out by <i>Which</i> magazine which dealt with 26,000 British holidaymakers, Ireland ranked very well in their perception of it not being a dangerous place. The most dangerous countries for muggings and <Col N="1276" /> attacks were Hungary, Poland, South Africa, Morocco, Gambia, Israel and Italy. I have spoken with the Minister for Justice who, I am assured, is in contact with the Garda Commissioner in respect of Deputy Andrew's question about extra patrols on the streets of Dublin where most crimes have occurred. I hope further progress on that issue can be made fairly soon.</P>

It is important that the message go out from this House that Ireland is not a dangerous place to visit, that it is a safe and welcoming place and that Dublin is a safe city relative to the other areas to which the Minister has referred. The Minister will agree that this is no consolation to the 301 people who availed of the service to which he referred in 1994-95. If tourists coming to Ireland from a foreign destination are robbed of their currency and are seriously injured, what remedies are available to them?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously I would not like that to happen. It has happened in the past and that is why the victim support group was set up with an office in Harcourt Street. This may be extended to Talbot Street and Mary Street this year, and the list of measures taken by the Garda Síochána, Bord Fáilte and business interests in Dublin city centre has been relevant. We hope the continuing good message in this regard will result in a lessening of the small amount of crime that takes place. I share the Deputy's concern in that regard.</P>

      <P>I accept what the Minister says and I believe he is doing his best. One cannot have a member of the Garda Síochána beside every tourist who comes into the country in anticipation of something that may or may not happen. Can the Minister say what remedies are available to foreign tourists who suffer the indignity of being robbed of their money and of being seriously or not so seriously injured?</P>

      <P>There are initially two remedies available to tourists who fall victim to a mugging or other attack. In the first instance there is the Garda office in O'Connell Street which deals specifically in advising tourists on safety matters. Second, there is the Dublin Tourist Victim Support Service with an office provided by the Department of Justice, which may be extended this year and has in the past dealt with tourists who have been the unfortunate victims of attacks or muggings. The remedies include emotional support first and, in addition, restitution. In many cases, people who have called there have continued with their holidays and have promised to come back again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 and 19 together.</P>
      <P>I constantly strive to ensure that Government macroeconomic policy contributes to the competitiveness of Irish exporters. The clearest manifestation of this can be seen in the Governments successful and continuing control of inflation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Successive pay agreements, negotiated with the social partners, are assisting wage competitiveness in this country. The continuation of this approach to wage bargaining will ensure that over the period of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i>, 1994-96, <Col N="1278" /> wage increases will be kept to an average of 2.5 per cent per annum, broadly in line with expectations for inflation.</P>
    <P>Taxation changes announced in this year's budget will further reinforce the competitiveness of Irish exporters &mdash; particularly those exporters dependent on the UK, most of whom are characterised by high labour intensity. Reductions in employees' taxes and PRSI combined with the increase in the income threshold for the lower rate of employer's PRSI will assist Irish firms in maintaining an edge in foreign and domestic markets.</P>
    <P>Planned investment in improved infrastructure under the Community Support Framework, 1994-99, in areas such as ports, roads, rail, telecommunications etc. is focused on improving competitiveness and expanding the capacity of the internationally traded sectors of the Irish economy.</P>
    <P>Irish competitiveness is and will continue to be the result of sound policy built with patience and consistency over time. As a result, we achieved the strong export growth and a record trade surplus last year when total exports reached £22.4 billion, an increase of 14 per cent.</P>
    <P>Export growth in 1995 will be facilitated by a range of market supports to be provided by An Bord Tráchtála which aim to maintain and further increase our market share in Britain, accelerate our export growth in continental Europe and continue to exploit niche market opportunities in other world markets.</P>
    <P>I am confident that both our trading position and our trading prospects in Europe in 1995 are good.</P>
    <P>Economic conditions in Europe are better than they have been for many years with all economies, and Germany in particular, showing strong growth. Other positive factors which should facilitate an improved export performance in Europe in 1995 include: (1) an enlarged European Union giving Irish exporters greater access to affluent markets in Austria, Sweden and Finland; (2) increased outsourcing by European <Col N="1279" /> industry offering valuable new potential for Irish suppliers; and (3) benefits to trade from the impact of the GATT Agreement.</P>
    <P>I have initiated with An Bord Tráchtála an intensification of the drive to seize the new business opportunities in continental Europe. &ldquo;Opportunity Europe&rdquo; in 1995 will involve a dual strategy of promoting the fullest support to the 800 plus Irish companies already selling in continental Europe and, at the same time, encouraging Irish exporters who have been successful in Britain to expand into other European markets. I have complaints about barriers to trade within the EU investigated, where evidence is available, through either EU or bilateral channels.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister failed to address a contemporary problem which is now confronting exporters. In recent days, serious concerns have been expressed about the threat posed to the competitiveness of exporters by the current high level of the punt. The strength of the punt is a matter of extreme concern and exporters, particularly in the food and clothing sectors, are under pressure and may be forced to lay off workers if the crisis continues. In asking this question I am in no way attempting to undermine our currency. We must take a responsible all-party view. Despite the Minister's rosy response about what is and is not being done on the export front, there is a central crisis that the Minister has missed in his response and which is pertinent today. At the time of the last currency crisis the market development fund was introduced. I will be calling on the Minister, if the Ceann Comhairle is charitable enough to allow my private notice question to be responded to, to give details of the plans that are in place for the reintroduction of the fund for exposed sectors if this crisis continues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Andrew's question referred to the competitiveness <Col N="1280" /> of Irish exports and the steps I, as Minister, am taking to maintain that. The answer is as I have given. The Deputy rightly raised the concern of exporters about the currency position. A private notice question has been tabled and I understand the Minister for Finance will be dealing with it, as the Government has decided that there should be a solid cohesive line on questions about the currency fluctuations. The position now is very different from that which obtained in 1992 when there was a rapid appreciation of the punt against sterling and a huge rise in interest rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>With great respect, the Minister should be more fulsome in his response. I appreciate that it is a matter of national concern and that the answer to the question might be more appropriately given by the Minister for Finance, but surely the Minister for Trade and Tourism has a responsibility too; he is, after all, the director general of the whole area of exports and competitiveness. Is the Minister aware that if the punt rises beyond 104p to the pound sterling it will be the first time since the 18th century that this occurred: this is a matter of economic history. Would it not be a tragedy if we went beyond that? If it rises to 105p we would be in crisis, and I do not want to talk up a crisis but to talk it down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>If Deputy Andrews wishes me to respond more fully in respect of the market development fund, I will. It was introduced in 1992 and its aim was to assist Irish exporters to cope with the unique and exceptional currency rate position which then prevailed, where there was a rapid appreciation of the IR£ against sterling; over the space of three weeks the IR£ appreciated by up to 10 per cent. There was a resultant hike in short term money rates, including overnight rates, of up to 100 per cent. These impacted on interest rates generally, including mortgage rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following the establishment of the market development fund the IR£ was <Col N="1281" /> devalued in January 1993 when there was a more gradual appreciation of the IR£ against sterling. It averaged 1 per cent for each quarter over the past 18 months. Stability in interest rates gave exporters room to adapt and plan to cope with fluctuating sterling values. The most recent appreciation against sterling has not been accompanied by associated interest rate movement. Interest rates are still at historically low levels. The one month inter bank lending rate is now 6.56 per cent as against 6.75 per cent at the end of March. In general, where rates in Ireland are higher than in the United Kingdom the difference is marginal.</P>
    <P>Against the Deutsche Mark the IR£ depreciated by 10 per cent since mid-1993. Indigenous exports to Germany, including food, were worth £391 million in 1993. Germany is the biggest overseas market for the sector after the United Kingdom. Total exports for 1994 were worth £22.4 billion. The breakdown is as follows: the United Kingdom, 27 per cent; the rest of the European Union, 40 per cent; North America, 10 per cent and the rest of the world, 23 per cent.</P>
    <P>Taking some of these and other factors into account An Bord Tráchtála ran seven regional seminars for exporters involving professional treasurers, case studies of exports illustrating the tangible benefits, and representatives from local banks and financial service companies in terms of treasury management. The Irish Exporters Association which I met recently subsequently appointed a firm, Finance and Treasury International, to act as an adviser to its members with a free initial consultation so that they could plan forward buying and so on. The objective was to encourage small firms in particular to make greater use of financial mechanisms in currency matters. This was singularly successful. I am aware that a number of companies are experiencing difficulties. The Government and my Department are keeping a close eye on this matter.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Tourism and Trade</askee>
      <Quest>the views, if any, he has on deficiencies in the present air access arrangement from North America, in particular the lack of direct flights from the south-east, south-west and west coast of the United States and the negative effect this is having on Irish tourism; if his Department has consulted with the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications on the matter; and if he will give details of steps being taken to improve the situation.</Quest>
      <QRef>[8428/95]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision of transatlantic air services between Ireland and the United States is governed by the Ireland-US air transport agreement which is the responsibility of my colleague, the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications. In accordance with the terms of that agreement, designated airlines of both countries are free to operate air services on specified routes between both countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Minister for Tourism and Trade, I am concerned that there should be adequate access capacity on transatlantic routes into Ireland to amply cater for prospective tourists. The existing scheduled carriers &mdash; Aer Lingus and Delta &mdash; provide a good service from three gateways, two in the north-east and one in the south. However, as the Deputy has pointed out, we currently do not enjoy direct scheduled services from other regions of the US. This lack of a direct service is one of the factors, but by no means the only one, which encourages a greater number of US visitors from these regions to come to Ireland on an indirect route, with the consequent loss of bed nights and revenue in this country. <Col N="1283" /> An opportunity now exists for new scheduled services to Ireland, especially from regions of the US not currently served. I say this for three reasons: first, demand is increasing. It is estimated that US holidaymakers to Ireland increased by 21 per cent in 1994. This year the target is to increase this segment by a further 11 per cent. Initial estimates are that all transatlantic arrivals in the first quarter of 1995 are up by 28 per cent. The second reason is that we are spending more on marketing. Last year's US marketing initiative which was operated in partnership between the State and private sectors has been followed up this year by a new overseas tourism marketing initiative and the third is that the ongoing peace process will remove an impediment which has hindered the growth of tourism from the US.</P>
    <P>Ultimately, the question of whether an existing carrier or a new carrier wishes to operate on a specific route is a matter for decision by such airline on the basis of its commercial judgment.</P>
    <P>For this reason, I have proposed that the issue of access be an important element of the tourism part of this month's Washington Conference on trade and investment in Ireland, to which the major US airlines have been invited.</P>
    <P>Our counterparts in Northern Ireland have also made access a priority for the tourism discussions at the conference. Our hope is that the conference will provide an ideal opportunity to present the business opportunities of Irish tourism, including opportunities for new airline services, to a high powered and influential US audience.</P>
    <P>Both I and my Department are in regular contact with the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications and his Department, respectively, on the development of more competitive, regular and good quality access links with our main markets.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply and for his tentative <Col N="1284" /> acknowledgment of the lack of adequate access routes into Ireland for potential tourists from certain parts of America. He must accept there is a need for a new air transport agreement between Ireland and America to allow direct access from the southern states, including Texas, the west coast and the south-east states. There is enormous potential but because of the lack of direct access routes we are not getting anything like the percentage of American tourists who visit continental Europe and the United Kingdom; we are only getting a small percentage of the 40 million Irish-Americans who desire to visit here. Does the Minister agree that it is essential that all adequate security arrangements be made in America and, if not, that this can have&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that it is my responsibility to ensure this country is marketed properly internationally. Under the overseas tourism marketing initiative £6 million will be spent this year in marketing this country abroad. A large number of tourists come to Ireland on an indirect route, principally through London. British Airways fly 600,000 people approximately from California directly to Great Britain. Only a small percentage of these visit Ireland. That airline circulated over 1.5 million brochures in which Ireland was marketed as a single island entity to 32,000 travel agents in North America this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are going to use the Washington Conference to present to the heads of carriers the business opportunities that now exist in tourism. I intend to meet my colleague, the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, before the conference to adopt a clear co-ordinated line. It is a matter for the airlines to decide whether they <Col N="1285" /> wish to commence new scheduled services on the basis of their commercial judgment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The question does not relate to North America; it relates to the south-east, south-west and west coasts of the United States. Unfortunately, it has been the practice of Bord Fáilte and the Department to concentrate their marketing efforts on the east coast, the Boston, New York and Washington area, and to neglect the vast potential in the southern states.</P>

However, the peace process has significantly improved investment confidence in the tourism industry, particularly in the Border counties, and consequently, I have every reason to <Col N="1288" /> expect at this stage that the Border subregion will obtain a satisfactory share of the overall EU budget of £369 million for the programme as a whole.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is aware of the amount available under the operational programme. The INTERREG II Programme was recently launched following approval of the Commission some months ago and tourism will be a beneficiary of that programme. The programme's European Regional Development Fund allocation for tourism in the six southern Border counties for the period 1994-1999 will be £10 million and <Col N="1289" /> the equivalent Northern budget for tourism is about £3.5 million sterling. In respect of the special EU programme, the Essen package, additional EU funding will be provided to support the Northern Ireland peace process. Commission guidelines indicate that programme will cover the following broad themes: urban and rual regeneration, employment, cross-Border development, social inclusion, productive investment and industrial development.</P>
      <P>Indications are that total EU funding available under the initiative will be in the region of 300 million ECU or about £240 million over three years. Of this amount, the South of Ireland is expected to get approximately 60 million ECU or £48 million over the period. It is not known yet how much, if any, of these funds will be used to support tourism development in Northern Ireland and the six southern Border counties. Funding over a further two year period will be subject to a review of the position by the Commission, and it is likely to be the autumn before such a review is undertaken.</P>

      <P>It is not the function of my Department to prepare applications for assistance under any package. Applications are lodged in the first instance through local regional tourism offices. When my predecessor visited Monaghan last October he received a good deal of flak from assembled public representatives about the overall amount invested in tourism in the Border areas, but the figures show that area received about three times as much in tourism capital grants as the average of all other sub-regions in the period 1988-93. Investment in the Border counties compares well with Northern Ireland over the same period. I can supply those figures to the Deputy if he wishes.</P>

      <P>As I and my colleague the Minister for Enterprise and Employment have indicated in recent replies to parliamentary questions on 22 March and 15 March respectively, any increases in raw material prices are part of a general worldwide trend from which Irish industry is not exempt, and, because of the global nature of these increases, I am satisfied that the competitiveness of Irish manufacturers <i>visá-vis</i> their international competitors is not affected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, who has <Col N="1291" /> primary responsibility in this matter, has asked the industrial development agencies to monitor the situation in sectors where the increases have been most apparent, for example the plastics sector. So far, the feedback is that companies are able to pass on the increases to the end user and, therefore, are not being adversely affected. The agencies will continue to monitor the situation and are available to advise and, where possible, assist companies who experience particular difficulties.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand my Private Notice Question has been ruled out of order. The Minister might expand on the question he bypassed in his reply in anticipation of the Private Notice Question being dealt with by the Minister for Finance as well as replying to the supplementary question I am about to ask. My question was prompted by clothing manufacturers, specifically those who use raw cotton. Is the Minister aware that the cotton harvest, like coffee and other products, has been hit by frost? Is he further aware that it is anticipated that Levi products, particularly Levi jeans, will cost approximately £100 per unit produced? In those circumstances is the Minister misinforming the House? He gives the impression of having everything under control and that everything in the importers' garden is rosy, but that is not the position. There are serious problems and I would have thought that this was the place to address them. More precise and detailed information should be given on them.</P>

An Bord Tráchtála held seven regional seminars for industries that might experience difficulties and the Government is concerned and aware of what is happening. However, this is essentially a matter for the Department of Finance. Officials in my Department met the Irish Exporters Association and we are aware of the political concerns they voiced.

      <P>Exports to South America have shown encouraging growth in recent years and came to more than £90 million in 1993. South America has a population of more than 300 million and an abundance of natural resources, and if the economic reforms and market opening currently underway in many South American countries succeeds in generating sustainable growth, there should be even better opportunities for Irish exporters in the future. I will continue to avail of all appropriate bilateral contacts, as well as discussions at EU and WTO level, to press for enhanced access for Irish companies to South American markets, and I will also support closer economic and trade links between the EU and South America.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government decided on this and it is a policy matter for the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht and its ministry to decide on the acquisition of stately homes. If the owners were to sell the castle to the State, conceivably it could fall to be considered under measure 2 of the natural cultural tourism sub-programme, which is SPI of the operational programme and deals with the preservation of national monuments and historic properties. The EU allocation of approximately £20 million for projects under measure 2 of that sub-programme has been substantially committed. In the event of that home being sold to the State it is unlikely that it would be considered for some time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that it would be prudent policy from a tourism point of view if we had a stately homes agenda similar to that of the National Trust in Britain. There are a number of castles and stately homes such as Lismore which, if upgraded, would be a great tourist attraction. Lismore castle is particularly historic having been the home of the Earl of Cork, Robert Boyle who, as I recollect from my intermediate certificate, formulated Boyle's law of physics. Also, the Duke of Devonshire's family and the Cavendish family lived there. The home is <Col N="1295" /> particularly historic dating back more than 800 years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that in Ireland, no more than any other country, there is great interest in historic houses and stately homes. Available figures indicate that at least 60 per cent of tourists visit some area of historic, cultural and traditional importance. The Deputy is correct in that stately homes and castles, which have played such an important part in our heritage for good or ill, are always of interest. This is a matter for a policy decision by the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht.</P>

      <P>Can the Minister inform the House how many individuals &mdash; whether public representatives or other &mdash; and companies will attend this conference; whether it will be one with a cast of thousands and its duration? It would appear to entail a huge influx of people into a conference centre.

I have already pointed out that I will be meeting my colleague, the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, to draw up a clear agenda of our requirements in terms of my remit as Minister for Tourism and Trade in marketing Ireland abroad and catering for increasing numbers of tourists wishing to visit this country and with the remit of the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications in providing access and transport services generally. In that context we hope to meet the heads of the carriers attending the conference to <Col N="1301" /> explain the commercial opportunities obtaining and, as a result, the viability of what is on offer here. I cannot say whether we will achieve what Deputy Molloy requires since I view this conference as representing the beginning of a process.

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10 and 57 together.</P>
      <P>Bord Fáilte has indicated to me that it has received no complaints regarding pub licensing hours, nor has the subject shown up as a problem in any research carried out by it. It would therefore appear that pub licensing hours are adequate for tourist needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the role of pubs in Irish tourism, Bord Fáilte promotes 50 pub premises which fulfil accommodation requirements set out by it under <Col N="1302" /> two separate categories. In addition many of the regional tourism organisations promote pubs providing Irish music, entertainment and food. The publicans and their organisations have also been encouraged to co-operate in promoting tourism in their areas thus supporting the work of Bord Fáilte and the regional tourism organisations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen" hpid="Mr. Killeen Mr. Killeen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am somewhat disappointed with the Minister's response in that it indicates a lack of appreciation of the role of the pub in this regard and this has been indicated by the group who represent publicans. Does he plan to assist publicans with funding from initiatives under European Union funding programmes? Has he plans to introduce specific grants as incentives for publicans to improve their premises for the tourism trade?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the Deputy's comment on my reply, the Department of Justice deals with changes in legislation governing pub licensing hours and it has not received a formal application for alterations to the present pub opening hours to assist the tourism industry or otherwise. I am sure the Deputy is aware that the main change in licensing hours which publicans would welcome would be an extension of opening hours to approximately 2 a.m. on week nights. The present law also provides for pub closure between 2 p.m. and 4 p.m. on Sundays. The tourism organisations have not indicated a wish for the abolition of that law.</P>
      <P>The initiative introduced in the budget is a first step in regard to the grants for public houses and will cater for public houses in chosen areas. Otherwise, publicans are eligible for assistance for ancillary tourism facilities provided as part of their premises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen" hpid="Mr. Killeen Mr. Killeen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
      <P>Those in the pub business have indicated they would like to contribute to the marketing of Ireland overseas and have complained that they do not have sufficient opportunity to do <Col N="1303" /> so. As a mark of goodwill, will the Minister consider placing a representative of the pub trade on the board of Bord Fáilte or, in view of its substantial role in training, on the board of CERT?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that vacancies on State boards are appointed by the Government when they arise. There are no vacancies on the boards of Bord Fáilte or CERT at present. If and when such vacancies arise I am sure the Deputy will consult with me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11 and 31 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The future core roles of Bord Fáilte are to sell Ireland overseas, to help the less mature elements of the industry to develop and to provide information to industry decision makers. The objective is to make Bord Fáilte Éireann a leaner and more focused market driven organisation sensitive to the needs and requirements of the maturing Irish tourism industry and the increasingly sophisticated international tourist. Bord Fáilte will strengthen its marketing capabilities, but will cease some of its existing functions which are not required <Col N="1304" /> directly to support the board's core objectives.</P>
    <P>The steering committee which has been established to oversee the implementation of the recommendations in the Arthur D. Little review of Bord Fáilte has met on nine occasions. The change process is well advanced and progressing satisfactorily. Already there is clear evidence of the internal organisational and cultural changes within the board. A new mission statement and organisation structure are being put in place. A new dynamic international marketing director has been recruited with an impressive track record in private industry. A voluntary severance package has been put to staff which will enable the organisation to be revitalised and reinvigorated through staff movement and some recruitment of new blood.</P>
    <P>As regards existing Bord Fáilte functions to be divested, the tendering procedure for the registration and grading of accommodation is well advanced. The legislation which is needed to subcontract these functions is being drafted at present. My Department has engaged in a consultative process with the key groups of accommodation providers affected by the proposed changes to ensure that they understand what is being done and to take their concerns on board.</P>
    <P>On the product approvals side, a number of the key associations, for example, in the bed and breakfast sector, have taken up the challenge of accepting a greater level of responsibility for enforcing their own standards.</P>
    <P>The Tidy Towns competition has been transferred to the Department of the Environment and the <i>Discover Ireland</i> brochure series has been put out to tender. The <i>Gulliver</i> information-reservation system is being fundamentally reassessed to see if it can be satisfactorily reconfigured.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to put a precise timescale on the implementation of all the changes envisaged, but I would expect that substantial completion will have taken place by the end of the summer. <Col N="1305" /> These are a series of dramatic changes which, taken together, will mean a new and exciting chapter in the history of Bord Fáilte.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Will functions other than those stated by the Minister be taken from Bord Fáilte?</P>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>They are the principal ones. The Tidy Towns competition has been transferred to the Department of the Environment. The picture library, which supports its core functions, will remain under Bord Fáilte's remit. The photographic, printing and distribution departments will also remain with Bord Fáilte although they will be reduced in size. The future of <i>Ireland of the Welcomes</i> magazine has not yet been determined. While it is likely to remain under the remit of Bord Fáilte, discussions will take place with the international marketing manager about its future.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising from the Arthur D. Little review, the Deputy will be aware that applications for assistance under the European Regional Development Fund programme are lodged in the first instance through the regional tourist organisations. They are sent to Bord Fáilte for evaluation and analysis and if they meet the criteria required they are submitted to the independent product management boards, chaired by independent chairmen, who decide the level, or otherwise, of grant assistance. Those are the recommendations of the Arthur D. Little report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1306" /> The Deputy will be aware that tenders have been sought recently for further independent organisations which could carry out such evaluation, but that matter has not been concluded.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The newly appointed international marketing director will be supplied with up to 20 marketing people to assist in direct consumer marketing matters. I envisage this will mean an extension or transformation of the OTMI as it currently exists. The Deputy can take it that this matter will be actively considered and I will bear the Deputy's interest and concern in mind.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12, 32 and 63 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of my main priorities is to ensure <Col N="1307" /> that Ireland has a state of the art national conference centre within the next few years.</P>
    <P>ERDF moneys have been set aside in the Tourism Operational Programme 1994-99 for the establishment of a large dedicated conference centre capable of handling 2,000 delegates. I am currently considering all aspects of the national conference centre, including the location and the financial implications, and I will be bringing my views on this to Government shortly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen" hpid="Mr. Killeen Mr. Killeen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that there is a proposal for a conference centre in the Shannon region for which planning permission has been received, and the strong indications that tourism revenue in Dublin is growing rapidly as opposed to the position in the southwest, the mid-west and the west, will the Minister consider locating the conference centre, and perhaps other tourist attractions of that nature, in one of those areas?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>No. The Programme for Government is specific on this. The national conference centre is to be located in Dublin and I have already indicated to my Department that its establishment is one of my main priorities. Such a centre could be worth approximately £30 million per year and it is a project with which we must press ahead quickly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen" hpid="Mr. Killeen Mr. Killeen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister saying that the project proposed in the Shannon area will not receive Government support for European funding?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I am saying that the national conference centre will be sited in Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Why? With modern communications and the existence of an international airport in the mid-west region, surely there is no necessity for a national conference centre to be located <Col N="1308" /> in Dublin, which is already heavily overpopulated. In his reply to the three questions which he took together, why did the Minister not respond to the content of Question No. 32 which relates to whether consideration is being given to the inclusion of a gambling casino in the proposed national conference centre?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously Deputy Molloy has read all three questions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The Programme for Government is the agreed plan for Government to site a national conference centre in Dublin, and I am adhering to that.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>In addition, a convention centre catering for 2,000 delegates with spouses or partners, would obviously create pressure in many areas. I am preparing a memorandum for Government in respect of the provision of this centre in the Dublin area.</P>
      <P>Arising from an analysis of stand alone convention centres, various interested groups expressed an interest in providing ancillary facilities if the legislation in respect of the Gaming and Lotteries Act were changed and if the Government decided to allocate a casino licence to an operator or operators. I am preparing a memorandum for Government in that respect and I intend to see that the priority I have established in regard to the provision of a national conference centre is proceeded with as quickly as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it the intention of the Government to take up the bill for the national conference centre or is it the Minister's intention to recommend that these interest groups not only provide, at their own expense, a national conference centre, which would take that expense off the backs of the taxpayers but also, in addition, some form of <Col N="1309" /> casino? Will the Minister give his view in relation to a casino? If the conference centre is to be located in Dublin, will the Minister give an indication as to where it may be located? I suggest the Royal Dublin Society in Ballsbridge and the Phoenix Park as possible locations but the National Concert Hall has been suggested as a location. I believe it would be a tragedy if a national conference centre was added to the National Concert Hall in Earlsfort Terrace as the hall should be separate from national conference centres. However, as a Dublin person, I welcome the Minister's statement in relation to the location of the proposed national conference centre, and I am not being insular in this regard. If, as Deputy Killeen suggested, the conference centre were located in the south-west, I would have no problem with that because it is a worthwhile suggestion, but if it is to be located in Dublin, let it not be in Earlsfort Terrace on the basis I have already indicated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of locations have been mooted as possible sites for the national conference centre. No decision has been taken in this regard although I share the Deputy's view in regard to the National Concert Hall.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister consider locating it in Dún Laoghaire? We have some nice sites there.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and that the Government is prepared to amend the Gaming and Lotteries Act, 1956, to facilitate the establishment of a gambling casino here. Is the Minister aware of the difficulties under which amusement arcade owners operate in the traditional seaside resorts because this Government, and all Governments <Col N="1310" /> since 1956, have failed to face up to their responsibilities in updating the 1956 Act? It seems ironic that the Government is now prepared to amend the Act to meet the requirements of a gaming casino, which will probably be operated by some international organisation, when those who operate these small amusement arcades continuously have gardaí calling on them because, under the 1956 Act, the stake they can accept in these machines is limited to 2p, a ludicrous sum in today's values.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Molloy is incorrect. I did not say that the Government was considering amending the Gaming and Lotteries Act, 1956; I said this came to light following an analysis of stand alone conference centres where organisations and interest groups wishing to acquire a casino licence from the Government put forward proposals to my Department and to the public as to what they might do if they were granted a casino licence. This matter has not been considered by Government and there is nothing before Government about amending the Gaming and Lotteries Act. My priority is to ensure that the moneys available in the operational programme for the provision of a national conference centre in Dublin are allocated as quickly as possible.</P>

A decision should be made at Government and, with his responsibility for tourism, I suggest there is a role for the Minister in this matter to close down <Col N="1311" /> such arcades or to control them in terms of 1990s legislation. To continue to turn a blind eye and operate under 1956 legislation is ludicrous.

      <P>I move amendment No. 49:</P>
      <P>In page 30, line 24, after &ldquo;creditor's&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or owner's&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Members will remember the effect of amendment No. 4 which we discussed on 5 April which was to exclude hire purchase agreements from the definition of credit agreements. When the definition of credit agreement included hire purchase, the reference to the creditor also embraced the term &ldquo;owner&rdquo;. In hire purchase transactions there are normally two rather than one other party to the transaction, there is the owner supplier, for example, the garage, shop or dealer and the credit institution. Because of this it is now necessary in the view of the Attorney General's Office to specify &ldquo;owner&rdquo; as well as &ldquo;creditor&rdquo; separately. This is the purpose of amendments Nos. 49, 51, 53, 54, 58 to 61, inclusive, and 64.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 55 stipulates that section 40 relating to the duty of a creditor to supply documents and information during the currency of a credit agreement shall not apply to a housing loan. Section 110 makes that provision of such documents and information mandatory in the case of a housing loan to take into account the much longer duration of such loans and inevitable changes from time to time in interest rates. Housing loans were always excluded from section 40 and amendment No. 55 puts this exclusion as a stand alone subsection. This makes the purpose and scope of the Bill clearer to consumers.</P>

      <P>Under this amendment it is proposed to delete section 41 of the Bill whereby if a consumer, by virtue of a credit agreement other than a housing loan, is under a duty to keep the goods covered by the agreement under his possession or control he must inform the creditor where the goods are within ten days of receipt of a request as to their whereabouts. It was intended that this duty to provide information would relate only to goods which were the subject of hire-purchase or consumer hire agreements. As hire-purchase is no longer covered by the definition of credit agreement, this section is not appropriate to Part III of the Bill which relates to the form and content of credit agreements. The same provision is being reinstated by amendments Nos. 78 and 85 respectively in Parts VI and VII concerning hire-purchase and consumer hire agreements.</P>

      <P>On 2 November 1994 the previous Government decided that section 48 relating to the use of terms in credit agreements which are not fair and reasonable should be deleted. Underlying this decision was the knowledge that such terms would be outlawed by regulations to be made which would give effect to the EU directive of 1993 on unfair terms in consumer contracts. On 1 February 1995 my colleague, the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, signed regulations implementing the EU directive. Its principal effect is that unfair terms in all consumer contracts concluded after 31 December 1994 are illegal, thus the regulations extend much wider than the scope of this Bill which is concerned with credit agreements, hire-purchase and consumer hire agreements.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In page 36, line 32, after &ldquo;purpose&rdquo; to insert&rdquo;, and different methods of <Col N="1357" /> formulae may be approved for different classes of agreements&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Sections 52 and 53 deal with the early settlement of debt. These amendments shall permit different formulae, as approved by the Central Bank in the case where the creditor is a credit institution or the Director of Consumer Affairs in any other case, to be used for different forms of agreement, for example, a credit agreement, a cash loan, a moneylending agreement or whatever. This happens in cases where the indebtedness is discharged before the time fixed in the agreement as provided for in section 52 and in the case of section 53 where it became mandatory to discharge the debt before the due time. These formulae shall be used to calculate the reduction in the amount which the consumer shall pay where the debt is repaid or has to be repaid before the time fixed in the agreement. The original text did not provide for any distinction between the various forms of credit. The onus will now reside with the various financial institutions to ensure that the early payment provisions in the various classes of credit agreement are in accordance with the formulae to be devised for these proposals by the Central Bank. Thus it would be in the interests of the institutions to enter into early dialogue with the bank. Equally, all other creditors should make contact with the Director of Consumer Affairs to satisfy themselves that their early settlement arrangements correspond with the formulae now being drawn up.</P>
    <P>Yesterday evening my attention was drawn for the first time to the fact that these formulae do not apply to consumer hire agreements, in which Deputy Kitt is interested. I will consider between now and the debate in the Seanad the question of the Central Bank coming forward with corresponding formulae which shall apply to hire purchase and consumer hire agreements.</P>

I have counselled that the institutions should talk to the Central Bank in anticipation of this legislation being enacted and that all other creditors should talk to the Director of Consumer Affairs about the precise formulae to be used. That formulae will be featured on agreements into which consumers enter and they will know their rights.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendments in this group shall apply equally in the case of voluntary early settlement of a debt by the consumer or where the debt was called in early by the creditor because of, for example, failure to meet repayment schedules. The new wording in sections 52 and 53 reflects, first, the need to specify the term &ldquo;owner&rdquo; in respect of a hire purchase agreement and, second, the proposal to have different formulae for different categories of agreement. Amendments Nos. 72b and 72f reflect <Col N="1359" /> the removal of hire purchase agreements from the definition of credit agreements and reapply the scope of sections 52 and 53 to hire purchase agreements through the deletion of the word &ldquo;credit&rdquo; and the inclusion of the word &ldquo;owner&rdquo;. Amendments Nos. 72c and 72g reword subsections (2) of sections 52 and 53 in accordance with amendments Nos. 72a and 72e which provide for different formulae to apply for different classes of credit.</P>

      <P>In page 37, line 8, after &ldquo;creditor&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or an owner&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This group of amendments stems from the decision taken on 5 April to exclude hire purchase agreements from the definition of credit agreement. When the definition of credit agreement included hire purchase the reference to the creditor also embraced the term owner. In hire purchase transactions there are normally two rather than one other party to the transaction &mdash; the owner-supplier which can be a garage, shop or dealer and the credit institution. Because of this the Attorney General's Office believes it is necessary to specify the owner as well as the creditor separately and the amendments reflect this requirement.</P>

    <P>(5) A hire-purchase agreement shall contain in respect of the coolingoff period a statement that the hirer&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) has a right to withdraw from the agreement without penalty if the hirer gives written notice to this effect to the seller within a period of 10 days of the date of receipt by the hirer of a copy of the agreement, or</P>
    <P>(b) may indicate that he does not wish to exercise this right by signing a statement to this effect, this signature to be separate from, and additional to, the hirer's signature in relation to any of the terms of the agreement.</P>
    <P>(6) A hire-purchase agreement shall contain a statement to the effect that a hirer is obliged to give the owner information under section 64 as to the whereabouts of the goods to which the agreement relates.</P>
    <P>(7) A hire-purchase agreement shall contain in a prominent position the words `Hire-purchase agreement'.</P>
    <P>59.&mdash;An owner shall not be entitled to enforce a hire-purchase agreement or any contract of guarantee relating thereto or any right to recover the goods from the hirer, and no security given by the hirer in respect of money <Col N="1365" /> payable under the hire-purchase agreement or given by a guarantor in respect of money payable under such contract of guarantee as aforesaid shall be enforceable against the hirer or guarantor by any holder thereof, unless the requirements specified in sections 57 and 58 have been complied with:</P>
    <P>Provided that if a court is satisfied in any action that a failure to comply with any of the aforesaid requirements, other than section 58 (1), was not deliberate and has not prejudiced the hirer, and that it would be just and equitable to dispense with the requirement, the court may, subject to any conditions that it sees fit to impose, decide that the agreement shall be enforceable.</P>

    <P>(a) an owner or a person acting on the owner's behalf is authorised to enter upon any premises for the purpose of taking possession of goods which have been let under a hire-purchase agreement,</P>

    <P>(d) a hirer, after the determination of the hire-purchase agreement or the bailment in any manner whatsoever, is subject to a liability which exceeds the liability to which he would have been subject if the agreement had been determined by him under this Part,</P>
    <P>(e) any person acting on behalf of an owner or seller in connection with the formation or conclusion of a hire-purchase agreement is treated as or deemed to be the agent of the hirer, or</P>
    <P>(f) an owner or seller is relieved from liability for the acts or defaults of any person acting on his behalf in connection with the formation or conclusion of a hire-purchase agreement,</P>
    <P>shall be void.</P>
    <P>(2) Subsection (1) does not apply in relation to a provision in a hire-purchase agreement whereby an owner of a motor vehicle which has been let under a hire-purchase agreement or a person acting on his behalf&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) authorised to enter premises (other than a house used as a dwelling or any building within the curtilage thereof) for the purpose of taking possession of the motor vehicle, or</P>
    <P>(b) relieved from liability for any such entry.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This is an extensive amendment, the purpose of which is to align the requirements of hire purchase agreements with those accepted under earlier amendments in respect of credit agreements. Previously, hire purchase agreements were comprehended and included within the general definition of a credit agreement. This composite definition made it somewhat difficult to distinguish and to extract the relevant and, indeed the specific provisions which would apply in the case of hire purchase agreements.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1367" /> Section 58 now provides in a clear and logical manner the text and layout of the requirements and information which must be contained in hire purchase agreements. These include provisions relating to the agreement in writing and signed by the contracting parties given to the hirer at the time of making the agreement or else delivered within ten days of making the agreement; the information which must be included in the agreement; the comparative price information; the amount and frequency of instalments; a list of the goods covered by the agreement; the cooling off period and so on. The amendment also provides for, in section 61, a duty on the owner of the goods to ensure that the hire purchase agreement is in accordance with the provisions of the Bill and, if not, it shall be unenforceable unless a court rules otherwise.</P>
    <P>If amendment No. 69 had been moved by Deputies McDowell or Molloy I would have indicated that the provisions in relation to unenforceability in the case of hire purchase would also be aligned and made consistent with the proviso on section 18. This is now being done and the result is that if it can be shown to the satisfaction of the court that the failure to comply was not deliberate and, in this instance, does not prejudice the hirer, the court may decide, subject to any conditions it may lay down, that the agreements shall be enforceable.</P>
    <P>Under this amendment, the Minister is empowered by section 60 to make regulations amending the form and content of hire purchase agreements. This approach is in harmony with that stipulated elsewhere in the Bill as regards the other forms of agreement which the legislation covers. It also provides the opportunity to adapt and update the provisions here in line with any changes in the financial sector's practices.</P>
    <P>This amendment provides that a hire purchase agreement shall be void if it provides that, first, the owner or a person acting on his behalf enters any premises to seize possession of the <Col N="1368" /> goods, apart from motor vehicles, covered by the hire purchase agreement; second, the right of the hirer to determine the agreement is excluded or restricted in any way; third, additional and uncovenanted liability is imposed on the hirer when terminating the agreement; fourth, the amount to be given in final settlement is in excess of what the agreement provides; fifth, the owner's or seller's agent is also treated as acting on behalf of the hirer &mdash; this would place the hirer in a most disadvantageous position; sixth, the owner or seller is relieved or held not to be responsible for the actions of their agents.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) (i) goes on to provide that the seller or owner may take possession of a motor vehicle for which a court order has been obtained on condition that the repossession or seizure does not take place at the home or any adjoining buildings, for example, garage, driveway, etc., of the hirer.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 103 which relates to section 50 (3), requires that a hire purchase agreement contains a notice which is at least as prominent as the rest of the contents of the agreement in the terms specified &mdash; I refer Deputies to the Fifth Schedule. Amendment No. 103 inserts the Fifth Schedule which reproduces the schedule contained in the 1946 Act to the Bill. The schedule details for the consumer's information, in simple text, their rights in relation to the hire purchase agreement provided by the Act. It covers the hirer's right to terminate the agreement, the options available on termination and the cost of termination. It also covers the restriction on an owner to enter the hirer's premises to recover the goods. On termination the hirer must either pay any instalments which are in arrears at the time the hirer gives notice of termination and, if and when, the hirer has paid those instalments the total amount under the agreement is less than the amount required to be paid by section 61 (2), the hirer must pay enough to make up that sum.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1369" /> Section 61 (2) provides that the owner pay the amount, if any, by which one half of the hire purchase price exceeds the total sums paid or a much lesser amount, if so specified in the agreement, or, purchase the goods by paying the difference between the amount already paid under the agreement and the hire purchase price, when this amount has been reduced in accordance with sections 52 or 53, as the case may be. The schedule also states unequivocally that where a hirer has not purchased the goods and the goods have been damaged, owing to the hirer's failure to have taken reasonable care of the goods, then the owner may sue the hirer for the amount of the damage, unless that amount can be agreed between the hirer and the owner.</P>
    <P>The schedule advises the hirer to examine whether the agreement contains provisions which allow the hirer to put an end to the agreement on terms more favourable to him than those just mentioned. As the hirers may not be aware of their rights as regards repossession of the goods, the schedule sets out those rights clearly for the hirer's information. Deputy Kitt raised the same point earlier in the context of the previous section. The hirer is thereby advised that without his consent the owner has no authority to enter the hirer's premises for the purpose of taking back the goods, other than a motor vehicle for which other particular circumstances apply. In the instance of a motor vehicle the owner is entitled to enforce any right which he may have under an agreement to enter any land of the hirer other than his home or any buildings attached thereto. When one third of the hire purchase price has been paid and the hirer has ended the agreement without exercising the option to purchase the goods, the owner cannot take the goods back from the hirer without the hirer's consent, unless the owner has obtained a court order or is taking back a motor vehicle which has been abandoned or left unattended in circumstances likely to result in damage to the vehicle. In this instance, the owner may <Col N="1370" /> recover and retain possession of it pending the making of a court order.</P>

      <P>This is a contentious amendment and one that causes me concern. It appears as if all the law is on the side of the consumer. If a person purchases a carpet through a hire purchase agreement, has it fitted in the home and nine or ten days later decides it is the wrong colour, or purchases some type of furniture which has to be built in, what does the Minister recommend to protect the trader who sold the item?</P>
      <P>Sometimes consumers require immediate delivery of an item. At Christmas time, people make rushed decisions to buy goods, or insist on having appliances etc. fitted quickly. If the item is damaged while being fitted and has to be taken back, who will pay? This amendment will have very serious repercussions for small traders who sell carpets, furniture, wallpaper and so on. I ask the Minister to relax the amendment &mdash; there must be some middle ground. This is an excellent Bill introduced by my colleague, Deputy O'Rourke when she had responsibility for labour affairs, but we must have greater concern for business people. If, say, a carpet has been fitted and, within the ten day period, the consumer or somebody else decides it is not the right colour, he can come up with some excuse or other and return the carpet. This will have damaging effects on business. The cost of such contingencies would have to be built into the price of goods thus making them uncompetitive. I appeal to the Minister to examine this further.</P>

      <P>I listened carefully to the Minister and I feel he is trying to get the right balance. Some elements of the section are quite controversial, for example, the question of sellers taking possession of items that have been sold and the rights of owners to enter a hirer's premises. This is a complex and <Col N="1371" /> controversial area of law. I am concerned that consumers be aware of their rights, and I accept that these will be laid out in the agreement. I would emphasise the importance of a strong publicity campaign when this Bill becomes law to explain in as simple a way as possible the concepts of this legislation &mdash; lengthy agreements mean nothing to the consumer. The Minister indicated how complex this section is and has clarified some points, but I appeal to him to ensure, in the interests of the consumer, that the central points are spelt out clearly.</P>
      <P>I share some of the concerns of my colleague, Deputy O'Keeffe. We must get the balance right and not over-complicate what has been a central part of Irish business life, that is, good relations between the business community and the consumer.</P>

      <P>I can give the Deputies the assurances they seek. Perhaps Deputy O'Keeffe misunderstands the legislation as it will operate. If it operated as he envisages it could indeed damage the small trader in particular. Deputy O'Keeffe suggested that one could buy a carpet, put it in the living room and after a few drinks at the weekend decide the colour was not right, that the carpet should be sent back and that because of the ten day cooling off period the unfortunate trader would be at a loss. That is not how the section will operate. In terms of that type of product, the consumer walks in off the high street and buys the carpet but the trader will not part with the carpet until the ten days have expired &mdash; the consumer has ten days to reflect on whether it is the right pattern. When the ten days are up the consumer can collect the carpet or have it delivered. The same would apply in the case of a fitted carpet. It will not be good enough just to decide that one does not like the colour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Similarly, it is important in the case of someone who is in high good humour <Col N="1372" /> after a victory in a by-election who, having had a few drinks, decides to buy a high class lawnmower but finds when he wakes up next day that he cannot pay for it or realises that he already has a lawnmower at home. That person has ten days to reflect on his purchase but that does not necessarily mean he has the use of the lawnmower in the interim. What we are talking about is withdrawal from the credit agreement, not returning the product when it is used or damaged. Deputy O'Keeffe will acknowledge that if the section can be operated sensibly there should be no difficulty and that it is a good idea that the consumer should have a cooling off period to reflect on the wisdom of a purchase made, perhaps, in the heat of the moment. This is no more than a prudent provision and I do not foresee it wrecking terrible damage to relations between consumers and traders.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kitt raised the separate question of the necessity to communicate the contents of this Bill to the public at large. I am at one with him on that. This is the first such major consumer legislation in the history of the State. It is important, and its importance rests in the consumers knowing about it. There would be little point in debating it here, and the financial institutions and other interested groups being aware of its detail, if the public were not aware of the new rights it confers. I am conscious of that and I said on previous occasions that the Director of Consumer Affairs has planned an itinerary to advise people of the contents of this Bill. I presume that promotional literature in the form of easily accessible leaflets will be available to the public. I also mentioned on the last occasion that the intention to regionalise the office of the Director of Consumer Affairs is extant and that it is our intention as a Government to ensure that the director will be able to supply this kind of service in the regions, starting with Cork this year. I have no quibble with the points made. I am committed, as long as I have this <Col N="1373" /> responsibility, to ensuring that the public know about the new rights conferred on them by the Bill.</P>

      <P>This amendment proposes the deletion of section 58 which provides that any sum payable by the hirer under a hire purchase agreement by way of a deposit or an initial down payment shall be treated as part of the hire purchase price. As Deputies will recall, amendment No. 10, which we discussed on 5 April, deleted the definition of &ldquo;hire purchase price&rdquo; from section 2. Amendment No. 77 reinstates a more detailed definition of &ldquo;hire purchase price&rdquo; in a stand alone section, section 60. That amended definition will combine the previous definition of &ldquo;hire purchase price&rdquo; with a requirement that the deposit form part of the hire purchase price. The purpose of this amendment is to avoid duplication with the new proposed section 60 defining the hire purchase price.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister's decision to locate a regional office in County Cork. Given that there has been much talk about decentralisation I urge him to consider locating this office in Mallow which is more central within Munster than Cork city. He has an interest in Mallow although I would not like to advertise this fact. This would provide a boost to the town given that it has lost its racecourse and many industries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Hire purchase agreements are very complex and usually the small print creates the crisis. The person who draws up the agreement will usually complete it and give a simple explanation but the many sections at the back of the form can have a devastating effect when difficulties and problems arise for the person who signed it. The conditions <Col N="1374" /> should be readable and easily understood by the hirer. Whereas the banks have expertise the ordinary punter does not.</P>
    <P>Many people enter into three year agreements to purchase a car without considering the consequences and implications if they fail to make a number of repayments. It is not thoroughly explained in many cases when a person enters a three year agreement that they will have to make 37 payments &mdash; a down payment and 36 repayments. This takes from the value of hire purchase agreements. One of the reasons many people encounter difficulties is that the conditions were not properly explained. While they may be on good wages or the business is going well when they make the agreement as time goes on the position may deteriorate. It is important, therefore, that the conditions at the back of the agreement should be simplified, readable and throughly explained by the agent to the person concerned.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is correct; hire purchase agreements are complex and frequently the small print poses problems for the consumer. One of the more important merits of this legislation is that it provides for clarity and certainty and the provision of information to the consumer. There is nothing we can do about the consumer who chooses not to read it but the information is available and it is as intelligible and legible as we can make it.</P>
      <P>The Deputy gave an excellent example, the 36 month contract involving 37 repayments. Very often the consumer does not plan for this and does not understand it but the amendment which states that any sum payable by a hirer under a hire purchase agreement by way of a deposit or an initial down payment shall be treated as part of the hire purchase price marks a definite step forward. That amendment, taken with the clarity required in the form of the agreement, greatly strengthens the position of the consumer. It may well be the case that the consumer will have to read a couple of extra pages as a result but all legislators can do is insert a provision in legislation to ensure that the consumer will have access to information. This will be policed by the Director of Consumer Affairs and it will be up to consumers to inform themselves after that.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 76b:</P>
      <P>In page 39, between lines 5 and 6 to insert the following:</P>
      <P>59.&mdash;(1) A hirer shall at any time before the final payment under a hire-purchase agreement falls due, be entitled to determine the agreement by giving notice of termination in writing to the owner or any person entitled or authorised to receive the sums payable under the agreement.</P>
      <P>(2) Where a hire&mdash;purchase agreement has been determined under this section, the hirer shall, without prejudice to any liability has accrued before termination, have the option to either&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) pay the amount, if any, by which one-half of the hire purchase price exceeds the total of the sums paid and the sums due in respect of the hire-purchase price immediately before termination, or such less amount as may be specified in the agreement, or</P>
      <P>(b) purchase the goods by paying the difference between the amount already paid under the agreement and the hire purchase price after the later amount has been reduced in accordance with section 52 or 53, or such lesser amount as may be specified in the agreement.</P>
      <P>(3) Where a hire-purchase agreement has been determined under this section, the hirer shall, if he has failed to take reasonable care of the goods, be liable to pay for the failure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(4) Where a hirer, having determined a hire-purchase agreement under this section, wrongfully retains possession of the goods, then in any action brought by the owner to recover possession of the goods from the hirer, the court shall, unless it is satisfied that having regard to the circumstances it would not be just and equitable so to do, order the goods to be delivered to the owner, without <Col N="1377" /> giving the hirer the option to pay the value of the goods.</P>
    <P>(5) Nothing in this section shall prejudice any right of a hirer to determine a hire-purchase agreement otherwise than by virtue of this section.</P>
    <P>In many respects this proposed section 59 contains provisions similar to those contained in section 61 of the present text. I am proposing the deletion of that section in amendment No. 77b in favour of the revised and resituated section 59 as proposed by amendment No. 76b.</P>
    <P>This amendment has a twofold purpose: first, its aim is to repose the right of the hirer to determine a hire purchase agreement earlier and more logically with Part VI of the Bill. Essentially, it is being repositioned. It will follow after sections 59 to 62 as inserted by amendment No. 76. These sections set out the form and content of hire purchase agreements. Section 58 requires that owners who are party to a hire purchase agreement ensure that the agreement complies with the legislation, section 61 provides that hire purchase agreements which do not comply with the legislation are unenforceable. Section 59 provides that the Minister may, by regulation, amend the form and content of hire purchase agreements. Section 62 provides that the avoidance of certain provisions will render the agreement void. Otherwise the wording and intent are the same as the present section 61 which is being deleted by amendment 77b.</P>
    <P>Second, it is designed to express more clearly the options for early settlement, be it voluntary or enforced, in the case of a hire purchase agreement. The provisions of section 59, which will be renumbered accordingly when the Bill is reprinted, will set out the hirer's right to terminate an agreement and the options available to him such as to pay the amount, if any, by which half the hire purchase price exceeds the total of the sums paid and the sums due up to date of termination or such less amount as <Col N="1378" /> may be specified in the agreement, or purchase the goods by paying the difference between the amount already paid under the agreement and the hire purchase price after the latter amount has been reduced in accordance with section 52 or section 53 or such lesser amount as may be specified in the agreement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it Deputy O'Keeffe is referring to normal contract law where the rights of the guarantor are stipulated by the contract applying, notwithstanding anything in this legislation. The paragraph to which the Deputy is referring relates to a case where the owner takes certain action which could adversely impact on the guarantor. This provision provides for such circumstances, but it applies to the owner, not the consumer. It is a little like putting up bail for a person and if that person jumps bail it is possible to hold the bailsman accountable but in the circumstances I do not know how meaningful that would be. Similarly with the consumer, it would depend on <Col N="1379" /> the circumstances. This measure provides for circumstances where the owner wrongfully repossesses the goods.</P>

    <P>&ldquo;76.&mdash;An owner shall not be entitled to enforce a consumer-hire agreement or any contract of guarantee relating thereto or any right to recover the goods from the hirer, and no security given by the hirer in respect of money payable under the consumer-hire agreement or given by a guarantor in respect of money payable under such contract of guarantee as aforesaid shall be enforceable against the hirer or guarantor by any holder thereof, unless the requirements specified in section 75 have been complied with:</P>
    <P>Provided that if a court is satisfied in any action that a failure to comply with any of the aforesaid requirements, other than section 75 (1), was not deliberate and has not prejudiced the hirer, and that it would be just and equitable to dispense with the requirement, the court may, subject to any conditions that it sees fit to impose, decide that the agreement shall be enforceable.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;77.&mdash;The Minister may make regulations in relation to the form and content of consumer-hire agreements and in so doing may amend or modify section 75 and the references contained in section 76.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;78.&mdash;An owner who is a party to a consumer-hire agreement shall ensure that the contents of the agreement comply with section 75 and any regulations made under section 77.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This, too, is an extensive amendment. The new format of consumer hire agreement replaces that in the existing section 75 of the Bill. It does not differ from the existing format in any material way, it sets it out in a clear and logical <Col N="1386" /> way. This new format will make a consumer hire agreement more comprehensible and intelligible to the consumer.</P>
    <P>The consumer hire agreement and any contract of guarantee must be made in writing, signed by the consumer, given to the consumer at the time of making the agreement or delivered within ten days of making the agreement, contain a statement of a coolingoff period, a statement of the names and addresses of the parties to the agreements, comparative price information, amount and frequency of instalments, a list of the goods covered, any cost or penalties in the event of failure to comply with the agreement, a notice that the agreement is for the bailment of goods which remain the property of the owner and a notice that it is a consumer hire agreement and a requirement that the hirer gives information on the whereabouts of the goods.</P>
    <P>As in the case in hire-purchase agreements, the new section 76 provides that the owner shall not be able to recover the goods subject to the consumer hire agreement unless the consumer hire agreement conforms to the requirements of section 75. However, in harmony with the provisions relating to other agreements, the consumer hire agreement may be enforceable if it can be shown to the court that any failure to meet the requirements of section 75 was not deliberate.</P>
    <P>The new section 77 empowers the Minister to make regulations as regards the form and content of the consumer hire agreements and, in doing so, may amend or change the provisions of section 75 and the references in section 76.</P>
    <P>Section 78 imposes an obligation on the owner of the goods who is party to the transaction to ensure that the consumer hire agreement is in accordance with section 75.</P>
    <P>At present consumer hire agreements are not regulated. It would be instructive if I read an extract, from the 1990 annual report of the Director of Consumer Affairs, which makes the case very well as to why it is now necessary <Col N="1387" /> to introduce specific controls on consumer hire transactions.</P>
    <P>I am aware Deputy Tom Kitt signalled an interest in this section which, effectively, is a new part of the Bill, Part VII which deals with consumer hire agreements. The difference in a consumer hire agreement under the Bill is that the ownership of the article rests with the credit institution, finance house or whichever institution provided the loan. The normal example of such an agreement is that of a car purchased through a local garage in respect of which there is an arrangement with a finance house. The usual format of the agreement up until now has been that of a consumer hire arrangement. I know Deputy Kitt has an interest in this matter.</P>
    <P>I wish to put on the record the views of the Director of Consumer Affairs on this issue which Deputy Kitt may consider contentious.</P>
    <P>The 1990 Annual Report of the Director of Consumer Affairs states that in response to a situation which had brought about a dramatic slump in new car sales, various participants in the motor industry, manufacturers, distributors and retailers, in conjunction with various financial institutions, produced leasing schemes for personal purchasers of motor vehicles. Most of these leasing schemes have as their objective the eventual acquisition by the lessor of the motor vehicle, even though, largely for fiscal reasons, this was not stated in the actual detailed lease document. Many problems have arisen with this type of leasing or lease-purchase arrangement. The report outlines the main difficulties encountered by consumers. Many consumers do not appreciate the difference between a lease and a loan arrangement &mdash; the term finance is commonly used by salesmen and consumers. Sometimes this is done deliberately to mislead the consumer, in other cases the consumers may mislead themselves. Many consumers do not realise that a car on lease cannot be sold by them and this leads to <Col N="1388" /> difficulties sometimes involving repossession from the new owner. There can be difficulty with buy-out terms if the consumer wants to get out of the lease in order to dispose of the vehicle. These buy-outs can be very expensive and several consumers have employed solicitors to negotiate settlement terms. There can be large balloon payments at the end of a lease which must be paid before ownership of the vehicle is transferred. These are very often under a separate agreement to avoid the whole arrangement being treated as hire-purchase. There is a tax difference depending on whether it is treated as hire purchase or consumer hire. Sometimes other arrangements apply to avoid balloon payments, for example, step-up payments where the amount to be paid increases every year. Rates of payment are sometimes quoted on a net of VAT basis or as being so much per month plus VAT. This is a carryover from business leasing where the amount of VAT is very often a recoverable item. Consumers often do not get the benefit of competition among the leasing companies. There is some evidence that while consumers are offered a fixed lease rate, the salesman carries out an auction among potential lessors. This results in his being paid the difference between the lowest bidder and the fixed rate already offered to the consumer. The consumer credit regulations do not apply to leasing and so the consumer has no way of making comparisons and judging what is the best deal available.</P>
    <P>The last comment is no longer valid as it will apply when this legislation is enacted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply. As he is aware, I mentioned earlier that members of the Society of the Irish Motor Industry expressed a view on this aspect of the Bill and I brought it to his attention. I would like the Minister to respond to their view that the Bill will kill leasing as a means of car finance. In putting that view I am asking the Minister to respond as members of that society have lobbied <Col N="1389" /> me and others extensively on this aspect. I am representing their view, but I am not necessarily agreeing with everything they say. They consider leasing the cheapest means of finance.</P>
      <P>I appreciate the comment of the Director of Consumer Affairs to which the Minister referred, but they claim that leasing is a popular form of finance with more than 100,000 new and second-hand cars being sold annually under that system of finance. They claim also that they fully support transparency in transactions and are keen to co-operate in every possible way. However, they consider this legislation will eliminate what they consider the cheapest and most popular form of car finance. They claim also that if leasing is eliminated the banks will be able to cherry pick the consumers to whom they will extend hire purchase type arrangements. They have argued forcibly with me, and with Deputies O'Rourke, Ned O'Keeffe and others. I ask the Minister to respond to their argument, of which I know he is very much aware, since they put it clearly in writing to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I too met the Society of the Irish Motor Industry and studied the more important of their arguments at some length. The point on which Deputy Tom Kitt is focusing is their central claim which posits circumstances in which leasing, as we know it, will be no more or, as Deputy Kitt said, this Bill will kill off.</P>
      <P>I was concerned about that possibility in as much as it seems that a leasing arrangement can be advantageous to the consumer. Therefore, if the impact of the Bill was to diminish the number of transactions on this lease basis, it would be the consumer who could conceivably lose out. As a result, I have requested that extensive work be carried out on this section. At the end of that, the argument is not being represented quite fairly. For example, commercial leasing is not included here, which would constitute approximately half the number to which Deputy Tom Kitt referred of the 100,000 transactions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1390" /> It does not impact on that but, more important, it may well be that we are seeking some diminution of the leasing instrument but not as a result of this Bill.</P>
    <P>I discovered in recent days that the real issue here is the application of the Seventh VAT Directive. The SIMI see themselves caught in a double whammy, on the one hand, of the enactment of this Bill and, on the other, the Seventh VAT Directive with which the Minister for Finance is currently dealing in Select Committee, that really is the issue. I accept that the Seventh VAT Directive will make consumer hire purchase agreements, that is leasing, less attractive; there is no doubt about that. There is also no doubt but that we do not have any alternative but to implement that directive, for all of the reasons of which the House will be aware.</P>
    <P>The Director of Consumer Affairs had this to say in commenting on the matter:</P>
    <P>Most of these leasing schemes have as their objective the eventual acquisition by the lessor of the motor vehicle even though, largely for fiscal reasons, this was not stated in the actual detailed lease document.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Fiscal reasons&rdquo; there means tax reasons. Therefore, the argument revolves around the question of which is the more tax efficient, hire purchase or leasing. The position to date has been that leasing has been the more tax efficient but it is the Seventh VAT Directive which will effectively put an end to that.</P>
    <P>Until now credit institutions buying second-hand goods for leasing purposes from sellers, dealers, garages and so on, have paid a VAT-inclusive price for such goods. However, under the present VAT arrangements, they can claim a credit or offset such against their total monthly or bi-monthly liability to VAT. The effect of the Seventh VAT Directive is that they will no longer be able to claim or offset that credit. Consequently, this increased and unavoidable cost will have to be passed on to the <Col N="1391" /> hirer, thus making leasing more expensive and less attractive for second-hand goods. Another point that should be sewn into the record of the House is that it does not affect new vehicles but rather applies to second-hand goods. That is the position under the EU VAT directive and there is no point in my seeking to pretend otherwise.</P>
    <P>Similarly, I would say to the Society of the Irish Motor Industry that there is no point in their arguing with me that it is as a result of what we are doing in this Bill. The Society of the Irish Motor Industry was involved in the discussions on this Bill from a very early stage, long before it was published, I think in 1992 they were taken through its provisions. Yet there is no record in my Department of any disquiet having been expressed by them at any stage since those discussions in 1992.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the Seventh VAT Directive has changed everything. I met representatives of the finance houses who, of course, have an interest in this matter. They represent the other side of the coin from what Deputy Tom Kitt raised &mdash; he said the SIMI represents the garages whereas the finance houses provide the funding. That group raised with me the question of the Sixth VAT Directive, the manner of implementation of which has meant that, while the finance houses also had to pay the VAT-inclusive price, they could not offset or reclaim the VAT. This has rendered hire purchase more expensive and less attractive than leasing. What is being said here is that the manner of implementation of the Sixth VAT Directive has rendered leasing a more attractive option than hire purchase since the introduction of the Seventh VAT Directive effectively removes that advantage of leasing over hire purchase.</P>
    <P>From our meeting last evening with the finance houses, I am also aware that they have been making representations to the Minister for Finance, to his Department and the Revenue Commissioners about the manner of application of the Sixth VAT Directive. I do <Col N="1392" /> not know what will be the response of the Minister for Finance to that argument but, if we could posit a circumstance in which he would make any changes, assuming that he is enabled to do so, this comparative advantage of leasing over hire purchase would no longer exist. We might well then have the finance houses devising new instruments in order to facilitate the throughput of business from members of the SIMI in garages and so on.</P>
    <P>I appreciate Deputy Tom Kitt raising this important issue. I assure him we have agonised somewhat on this since it was brought to our attention, but what I have said is about as fair an exposition as I can make about the issue.</P>

      <P>In page 46, line 6, to delete &ldquo;75&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;74&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment relates to section 76 which stipulates that many of the provisions relating to hire purchase agreements, that is letting by description, implied undertakings to quality, samples, statements purporting to restrict the rights of the hirer, exclusion of implied terms and conditions, liability on persons conducting negotiations antecedent to the agreement, application of certain of the existing hire purchase legislation and antecedent negotiations and representations, shall also apply to consumer hire agreements. Section 76 also implies that the goods are free of any charges or encumbrances and shall remain in the quite possession of the hirer, which is a legal way of saying the hirer keeps them.</P>
      <P>The provisions relating to hire purchase agreements which we have dealt with at length are being transposed to apply in the case of consumer hire agreements. The amendment does not have an effect beyond that.</P>

      <P>In page 46, line 6, to delete &ldquo;letting&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This also relates to section 76. The removal of the word &ldquo;letting&rdquo; by means of this amendment does not, on the advice of the Attorney General's office. diminish or change the intent and purpose of section 76. From reading the section it is clear that the agreement <Col N="1394" /> referred to is a consumer hire agreement. Therefore, the word &ldquo;letting&rdquo;, which is not defined in the Bill, is superfluous.</P>
    <P>The effect of section 76 is to provide the hirer with similar protection to that afforded under a hire purchase agreement. In terms of equality of rights under the two different types of agreement, the word &ldquo;letting&rdquo; is superficial and redundant.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(1) An advertisement in which a person offers to arrange for the bailment of goods under a consumer-hire agreement or indicates the availability of such a bailment shall include a statement to the effect that the agreement is for hiring or leasing only and the goods remain the property of the owner,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment relates to section 78 which deals with the advertising of consumer hire agreements. It refers to the exchanges between Deputy Kitt and I about SIMI who expressed concern about the implications of the Bill requiring the inclusions of an additional 31 words in an advertisement. SIMI stated on that, on the one hand, it would confuse the consumer and, on the other, it would be more expensive. I am happy to say fewer words are now required. Nevertheless, the consumer will be provided with much needed and valuable protection. For the information of Deputy O'Keeffe, the words to be inserted in the advertisement are, &ldquo;the agreement is for hiring or leasing only and the goods remain the property of the owner,&rdquo;. If the Deputy was in the business he would have to promulgate those words only. This should go some way towards meeting the argument put forward by SIMI.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 87b:</P>
      <P>In page 47, between lines 12 and 13, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2) A person who intends to apply to the Director for a moneylenders licence shall before making such application cause to be published, in any national or local newspaper published in the State and circulating in the district court district that the applicant intends to engage or engages in the business of moneylending, notice of his intention.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1397" /> This amendment requires an applicant for a moneylenders licence to place an advertisement in a national or local paper, published in Ireland and circulating within the District Court district in which the applicant intends to engage in or is already engaged in moneylending, advising of the applicant's intention to seek a moneylenders licence.</P>
    <P>While section 81 (v) required the applicant to submit such an advertisement to the Director as part of the licence application procedure, there was no specific provision in the Bill, until now, requiring the applicant to place an advertisement of this kind. In other words, although the applicant was required to send in a copy of the advertisement, there was no requirement in the first place to so advertise and this amendment corrects that.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to give any interested parties advance notice that the person intends to apply for a moneylender's licence. Those interested parties may then advise the Director of any objection to the application which they may have. Section 81 (1) provides that the Director shall take due regard of any objections. This procedure would be similar to that applying in the case of a gaming or an intoxicating liquor licence.</P>
    <P>Section 81 (2) (a) (vi) required that an applicant include with the application &ldquo;a copy of an advertisement in one of the newspapers circulating in that area of the applicant's intention to apply for said licence and giving such other details as the Director may require&rdquo;. However, there was no specific provision in the Bill for such an advertisement to be published. This amendment corrects that omission.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 87f replaces the original reference in subsection (2) (a) (v) to the advertisement. It rewords the requirement that a copy of the advertisement now be required under subsection (2) be included with the licence application.</P>

    <P>This amendment shall have a twofold effect. First, subsection (5) concerning the duty of the moneylender to display a copy of the licence and any terms and <Col N="1400" /> conditions attached thereto in his business premises is being deleted in this subsection of the Bill. It is being reinstated under amendment No. 96a at line 53 on page 49. At present, it is not in its most appropriate position in the Bill. It is also now being replaced by a new provision whereby a person seeking a moneylenders licence shall not give any false or misleading information. This new provision shall guard against applicants who may not be truthful or who may be only partly truthful in the information they supply in support of the application.</P>

    <P>(10) Whenever the Director proposes to refuse to grant, suspend, revoke or vary the terms or conditions of a moneylenders licence he <Col N="1403" /> shall notify the applicant or the holder of the licence, as the case may be, of his proposal and shall, if any representations are made to him in writing by such applicant or holder within 14 days of the notification, consider the representations.</P>
    <P>(11) Whenever the Director, having considered any representations that may have been made under subsection (10), decides to refuse to grant, suspend, revoke or vary any term or condition of a moneylenders licence, he shall notify the applicant for, or as the case may be, the holder of, the licence of the decision and the grounds for such decision and such applicant or holder may within 7 days of receipt of notification appeal against such decision to the judge of the Circuit Court within whose Circuit the business of moneylending to which the licence relates is to be carried on.</P>

    <P>The text of page 49 which continues the list of provisions relating to a moneylender's licence in section 81 is being deleted. I will deal with the new provisions <i>ad seriatim</i> and relate them in so far as they are applicable to the provisions on page 49. The new subsection (9) corresponds in large measure to subsection (10) and includes for the first time a reference to non-compliance with subsection (8) as a grounds for refusal. In summary, the licence may be revoked or varied by the director for failure to meet any or all the requirements in subsection (8), as amended, or any of the terms or conditions attached to the licence.</P>
    <P>Subsection (10) extends the provisions of subsection (11) to the director's refusal to grant a moneylender's licence. Consequently, where the director proposes to refuse to grant a licence, <Col N="1405" /> or proposes to suspend, revoke or vary the terms or conditions of a current licence, he must notify the applicant or the holder of the licence, as appropriate, of his proposal. Such applicant or holder is entitled to make, within 14 days of receipt of the notification, representations to the director in respect of his proposal.</P>
    <P>Subsection (11), similar to subsection (12) of the present text, provides that, if having considered any representations made under subsection (10), the director decides not to grant the licence or decides to suspend, revoke or vary any term or condition of an existing licence, he shall notify the holder or the applicant of the decision and the grounds on which he has based his decision. The holder or applicant may, within seven days of receiving the notification, appeal the decision to the Circuit Court.</P>
    <P>The provisions of subsections (12) and (13) replace subsection (17). Any notification made under this section from the director must be delivered personally or sent by prepaid registered post to the business address of the licence holder or applicant. Subsection (13) provides that where the notification refers to a suspension, revocation of a licence or to the variation of terms of conditions of a licence, such a refusal, suspension or variation shall take effect seven days after receipt of the notification.</P>

      <P>I am not impressed by moneylenders or moneylending. Has a moneylender a right to ask for security? Does the moneylender have to be present in person when he is lending money or can he appoint an agent? It is in order for a moneylender to advertise in a prominent place and show his licence but can he have a faceless person represent him?</P>

      <P>The licensee does not have to be present but his agent is required to show that he is acting for an authorised moneylender. The Deputy will recall that we deal with the case where part of a rent book would be taken over by an agent and we have tried to protect against that. As regards security, if the Deputy is asking if it is permissible for the moneylender or his agent to be accompanied for protection purposes when collecting money, the Bill does not deal with that. However, <Col N="1408" /> he is entitled to take whatever measures he considers necessary for his personal safety.</P>

      <P>Does the moneylender or his agent have the right to ask the person obtaining the loan for a personal security or guarantee? In a hire-purchase agreement the consumer must have a guarantor. If I borrow £300 from a moneylender is he entitled to ask for a security? In the past, moneylenders took pension books and children's allowance books for security. I know that was dealt with and such exploitation was condemned by all sides of the House, but has a moneylender the right to seek other forms of security?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>He is entitled to ask for it but there is nothing in the Bill that confers it. The market we are talking about, by definition, comprises people who do not have access to conventional orthodox moneylending as evidenced in the banks or lending institutions. It is by virtue of their inability to put up collateral that the moneylending business thrives. However, the moneylender may not repossess a pension book or whatever and that is specified elsewhere in the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Another area of concern is the rate of interest charged and the terms of repayment. What right has the consumer to ensure that the moneylender or his agent does not call to the consumer's home and request that the loan be repaid on demand if there is rumour that the person who borrowed the money is not in a position to repay? Does the Minister consider that the moneylender should advertise or make known the interest rate being charged? In many cases moneylending is exploitation at its worst because the interest charged is well above the going rate. Will the Minister consider making it obligatory for moneylenders to advertise the rate they charge?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>To take the Deputy's first point, if the moneylender were to <Col N="1409" /> conduct himself in that fashion it would contravene the moneylending agreement, the format of which we have gone through and would constitute an offence. What the Deputy is talking about is tantamount to extortion. As regards the second point there is no ceiling on interest rates provided for in the Bill as it stands. I received many representations to restore the ceiling that existed. Many of the groups dealing with property argued that it should be reinserted in the Bill.</P>
      <P>When Deputy O'Rourke was on this side of the House I raised that point with her and she made a number of arguments against it, including the one that she felt the ceiling would become the floor. As it is structured at present the director will determine this. He has expressed the view that he wants flexibility to continue to have that power. I do not think any Minister would want to have that power because, by definition, the interest rate we are talking about will be much higher than that on the high street for the reasons we have stated &mdash; the cost of collection, the nature of moneylending and so on. The director feels the power best reposes in him. It is my understanding that he will take steps to ensure that is promulgated and that the moneylender and client are fully aware of it.</P>

      <P>I accept that it is a risk business but those who go into this business are aware of that. We can identify what money costs if we borrow from financial institutions. They add on a margin based on risk. We know their wholesale rate and, in many cases, their retail rate but those who borrow from moneylenders, by and large, would not be financed by the institutions I mentioned. They are entitled to protection. There should be a ceiling on the rate. It is not sufficient to have the Director of Consumer Affairs Act as a watchdog because he would have to wait for a case to be put to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I come from a rural constituency where moneylending would not be a <Col N="1410" /> major problem but I am aware of cases where 100 per cent interest was charged. I do not wish to prejudice what the Minister of State said but we are aware of cases where persons were sent to people who borrowed money from moneylenders. They were in difficulty and had to borrow elsewhere to repay the moneylender. There should be some protection for the consumer by inserting a ceiling on the interest rate. Failing that, the consumer should be able to see the interest rate charged on the money borrowed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that this is an important point. To some extent we are going over arguments which were debated extensively on Committee Stage. The current flat rate of 39 per cent has been more honoured in the breach than in the observance. I do not think people really knew that the rate was 39 per cent. In the very small number of cases where there were prosecutions the rate was found to be many times higher than 39 per cent; in some cases it was higher by a factor of five, ten or more. Somebody <i>in extremis</i> is not really all that concerned about the rate. All they want to do is get their hands on a few hundred pounds and to do this they are prepared to overlook the interest rate. As Deputy O'Keeffe rightly said, that may well be the attitude of a consumer <i>in extremis</i> but it is not good enough for us to ignore it and not address it.</P>
      <P>I have examined this argument which I made in Opposition. I met the antipoverty networks which comprised a number of organisations and which argued that a figure ought to be included. I also discussed the matter with the Director of Consumer Affairs who is much happier that the power ought to be reposed in him. He may have to vary it depending on the market but given that he is the supervisor, regulator, watchdog and enforcer in this area he believes the power is best left with him. At this stage he has persuaded me that this is probably the best option.</P>

It states that a person shall not engage in the business of moneylending on behalf of a moneylender who is not the holder of a moneylending licence. This will close off a possible loophole in the moneylending provisions whereby a person acting on behalf of an unlicensed moneylender would be acting outside the provisions of the Bill.

      <P>The construction Deputy Molloy has put on the amendment escapes me. I do not see how this could possibly be the position. I take the point made by Deputy O'Keeffe. I thought he was referring to the moneylender. The person authorised by him must have written evidence of the authorisation. The same applies in the case stipulated by Deputy Molloy &mdash; the agent must have written authorisation from the moneylender who must have a moneylender's licence. The question of him acting as an agent would not arise if he had a moneylender's licence himself. If there is any ambiguity in the amendment I will examine it, but I cannot see it. In reply to Deputy O'Keeffe, if a person is challenged he must be able to produce evidence of the written authorisation.</P>

      <P>There is nothing more involved than substituting &ldquo;borrower&rdquo; for &ldquo;consumer&rdquo;. While we have tended to use the word &ldquo;consumer&rdquo; it is considered that the word &ldquo;borrower&rdquo;, as we are dealing with moneylending, is more appropriate. In this Part relating to moneylending agreements, the word borrower may be more relevant than, perhaps, the more formal term consumer. As a consequence of these amendments I will be tabling in the Seanad a revision to the definition of borrower.</P>

In fairness I would refer Deputy O'Keeffe to the provision dealing with house loans where the term used there is not consumer but borrower. What is good for the goose is good for the gander. We are not talking about consuming a product but what is normally a cash loan. The term borrower is probably more appropriate on balance.</P>

Amendment No. 96m reproduces the requirement for such records to be maintained for five years &mdash; previously contained in subsection (1) &mdash; as a stand alone subsection of section 86.

      <P>From whence did this amendment come? Although one would, in general, always wish to uphold the law and give every power necessary to those who execute the law on our behalf, one always has reservations about powers such as this. The Garda Síochána are very well able to carry out <Col N="1419" /> their business, and adding this to the Bill is just tautology and is leaning on the side of &ldquo;heavy gang&rdquo; tactics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I am a bit taken aback to be accused of being associated with the inclusion of a &ldquo;heavy gang&rdquo; style measure in legislation. The straight answer to Deputy O'Rourke's question is that it is here on the recommendation of the Attorney General's office. However, it is not a full answer to say that as there have been representations. I would be interested in Deputy O'Rourke's view as to why I am subjected still to such extensive representations on this Bill. The Deputy knows as well as I that it is sometimes difficult to make up one's mind on the balance of arguments being made, but it has been represented to me that if we give powers of search to the Garda, they have to be seen to be effective, and what we have all sought to stamp out or at least minimise is illegal moneylending. The licensed or authorised moneylenders are providing a service. Many of the poverty groups would say that without them some people would not have access to credit. If they were to go to a bank or orthodox financial institution, they would not get it. What we are talking about here is illegal moneylenders and it is considered that the section is not really effective to cope with that.</P>
      <P>Members of the Garda cannot just exercise the powers willy-nilly but must have reasonable grounds as set out in the section. That is the paternity of the amendment and I honestly do not think it is overstepping the mark. It is necessary and I ask the House to agree to it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I oppose this amendment. The powers the Minister is seeking to include in this case are draconian and unnecessary and the Minister has given no argument to the House which would justify making this change at this late stage of the long debate on this Bill. The Minister has not justified the Garda being given the power to arrest somebody without a warrant if, in his or her opinion, that person has contravened any requirement of Part VIII which contains many requirements of moneylenders some of which could be deemed merely book-keeping, such as, giving dates etc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If a clerical error is made by a moneylender or an agent working on his behalf the Garda Síochána could, under this proposal, arrest that person without a warrant. The previous amendment to section 90 relates to the power of the Garda to arrest in the event of being granted a warrant by the District Court. In this instance we are seeking to extend the power of the Garda to arrest a person without a warrant for any transgressions of the requirements of this Part of the Bill. This is not justifiable. Deputy O'Rourke referred to the heavy gang: I do not know to whom she was <Col N="1421" /> referring but I doubt if the Garda want this power&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is strange if the recommendation has been made at this late stage by the Attorney General.</P>
      <P>Under the original proposal if a moneylender operated without a licence the Garda would have the power to arrest them without a warrant. We are now seeking to extend this power of arrest without a warrant for any misdemeanours and transgressions of the requirements of section 85 which states that a moneylender shall, in respect of every moneylending agreement, supply to the consumer or the borrower a book or document in which to record repayments made under the agreement which shall be completed and maintained by the moneylender in accordance with the section and shall be separate from the agreement.</P>
      <P>It places the following requirements on a licensed moneylender: he shall, in respect of a moneylending agreement, enter in a repayment book before supplying it to a consumer the following information: an agreement number or other reference to enable the agreement to be identified, the name and address of the moneylender as specified on his moneylender's licence, the name and address of the borrower, the amount of the credit being advanced and the date the credit is advanced. It seems that if the moneylender inadvertently inserts the wrong number, address or date a garda will have the power to arrest him without a warrant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amount of each repayment instalment must also be included. It seems that if the moneylender inadvertently includes the wrong amount, even though there was no criminal intent, he will be dealt with as if he were a criminal and arrested without a warrant. To comply with proper bookkeeping procedures a moneylender will also be obliged, correctly, to include the amount of each collection charge, if any, <Col N="1422" /> and the number of repayment instalments. It seems that if he includes the figure nine instead of ten or 11 he will be arrested.</P>
    <P>Why is the Minister seeking such draconian powers in respect of any transgressions of the sections in this Part of the Bill? This power was originally confined to the relevant sections which place the most important requirements on moneylenders. I support the provisions in sections 82, 91, 92 and 93 which provide that a person may be arrested without a warrant for any transgressions of the requirements of these sections but it is excessive and unnecessary to provide for this power in each of the sections &mdash; 80 to 90, inclusive &mdash; contained in Part VIII of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 85 deals with the repayment book while section 86 requires a moneylender to maintain a record of the agreement which he shall retain for a period of five years. This should include certain information, including names and addresses, date of repayment, the rate of interest, the amount of each collection charge, if any, the number of instalments and the total amount payable in respect of the loan. Agents working on behalf of licensed moneylenders will be frightened out of their lives in maintaining such records.</P>
    <P>If a garda or inspector in the course of an investigation discovers inaccuracies or contraventions one would expect that they would have the power to take action. The appropriate action is not to arrest the person concerned immediately on the spot; rather the garda should first seek to make his case before a district justice and obtain a warrant. I appeal to the Minister to reconsider.</P>
    <P>As this is Report Stage, unfortunately, I can speak only once. I find this discussion disturbing in the sense that a raft of amendments was only made available this morning and the House has rushed into discussing them without the spokesperson for my party being given an opportunity to study them. We would have liked an opportunity to give them due consideration. This is not the <Col N="1423" /> appropriate way for the House to do its business. There is a sad history in relation to legislation which was rushed through this House in this manner. That type of legislation has a tendency to bounce back.</P>
    <P>I do not know if the Government is so short of legislation that it had to rush in with something to fill the time allocated for the Oireachtas today but it is extraordinary that while the Finance Bill is being discussed by the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs the Minister is seeking to proceed with this Bill. I wish to protest on behalf of my party.</P>
    <P>I will be opposing the section unless I receive a coherent and justifiable explanation. The amendment is far too broad and excessive. It is both unnecessary and an extreme measure. The Minister has not justified his position in bringing forward such a draconian measure.</P>

      <P>Before the Deputy Leader of my party entered the House I had marked this section and section 90 which deals with search warrants. This is a contentious issue. The section, which gives far-reaching powers, has been described as draconian and heavy-handed.</P>
      <P>Deputy Molloy dealt with this matter thoroughly. If, through no fault of the agent or moneylender, an error is made in making calculations or a wrong date is inserted, action may be taken. We must find middle ground. Why was this proposal not included in the Bill as originally drafted? There has been much talk about civil liberties and while I do not have much time for moneylenders, we must be seen to be fair and honourable. It is important to bring in fair legislation.</P>

      <P>If a person who borrows money from a moneylender dislikes that moneylender, it would be <Col N="1424" /> easy to find an error in the agreement. They may say the notice displayed in the office was not properly sited or that matters were not properly explained, and in those circumstances it is easy to obtain a search warrant. We are obliged to protect all parties and that is what we are doing. I share the view of my colleagues in the Opposition that the powers are far-reaching. It has been said also that they are draconian and heavy-handed. I appeal to the Minister to reconsider this matter. I would like him to tell the House from where the idea came.</P>

      <P>There is genuine concern about this section, particularly the provision regarding search warrants &mdash; this matter will be of interest to the other side of the House. Licensed moneylenders should not be treated too harshly in the event of procedural irregularities or problems in the office. If the person involved or his agent is not well liked it may be easy to find an error in the application or agreement. Fault could be found in many areas. Litigation is the order of the day in this modern world and people are becoming more conscious of it. Where people are convicted there is usually a greater follow up of claims for damages for personal injuries.</P>
      <P>This section is far-reaching and the amendment would be damaging to the Bill. The Bill was widely acclaimed and its drafting was the foresight of the former Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment, Deputy O'Rourke. I am aware that a good amount of midnight oil was burned and a great deal of work went into its drafting. It is regrettable that the Bill might be blemished in any way by this type of section. It is frightening to hear Deputy Molloy, whom I know well, refer to it as draconian.</P>

    <P>We are all nervous of incidents involving money in the times in which <Col N="1425" /> we live. I appeal to the Minister, whom I consider reasonable and is a person whom I admire to amend that section and make it more acceptable to the Opposition and the consumer. This fine Bill was introduced for the purpose of dealing with bank charges because consumers were alarmed and annoyed at what was happening. We have dealt with many other contentious sections and amendments and we have given broad approval to most of the provisions. I appeal to the Minister to make the amendment more acceptable and if he does we will not challenge it.</P>

      <P>I started today by commending my predecessor on the extent to which she was open to accepting amendments from the Opposition and the extent to which the Bill was improved as a result. The Bill has been changed beyond recognition and my predecessor, Deputy O'Rourke, deserves much credit for that.

      <P>Deputy Molloy suggested that if the amendment had gone no further than the existing provision in section 82, which refers to a prohibition on engaging in the business of money-lending without a licence, section 91 which relates to prohibition of having possession of documents belonging to another person for money-lending or section 93 which refers to an obligation to produce to members of the Garda Síochána&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Last evening I had been dealing with the enormous frustration felt by members of the Garda Síochána at the apprehension and conviction of criminals, to the extent that they are questioning their role, asking themselves whether they are involved in a &ldquo;snámh in aghaidh an easa,&rdquo; a futile exercise.</P>
      <P>Members of the Garda Síochána are demoralised by what is happening in relation to bail. There is nothing worse for them than to see somebody, with previous convictions, before our courts being allowed out on bail to continue their wave of crime, in some instances, over a 12 to 18-month period after the committal of the initial crime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to address the automatic right of transfer of cases within our court system. Many criminals appearing before our courts have committed consecutive crimes. As they are well known <Col N="1430" /> to the gardaí, and perhaps to the judge who will hear their case and are fearful about the potential severity of their sentence, they ask for their case to be transferred to a Dublin court where they are less likely to have a severe sentence imposed as they will not be known there.</P>
    <P>The same hard core seek transfer from courts in Cork to others in Dublin. There were nine applications yesterday for transfer from Cork to Dublin, carrying the advantage of such persons being allowed bail and their court cases postponed for up to two years. We need speedy justice in Cork, which we are not getting, not through any fault of the Garda but because of the system. In many such instances we should consider the cost to the State. Legal personnel, witnesses and defendants are all heading for the big smoke, as accused persons and their legal representatives see the option of receiving a lighter sentence in the Dublin courts.</P>
    <P>The prevailing dichotomy is that while the Circuit Court sits in Cork from 7 to 17 February, from 9 to 12 May, from 13 to 20 June and 31 October to 10 November, there is an inadequate number of cases being dealt with in Cork to use the time allotted while, at the same time, the list in Dublin continues to grow, necessitating a waiting period of 18 months to two years, during all of which time an accused is out on bail. There is substantial evidence to demonstrate a significant connection between the numbers on bail and their propensity to commit further crime. The information available to me shows that 3,193 people on bail in 1993 committed crime.</P>
    <P>It is incredible that any Government would allow this exacerbating, costly and inexplicable right to transfer of cases to continue in its present form. The automatic right to transfer was granted in 1981, with seven days' notice. There is no longer any justification for this provision, delaying the administration of justice which, in turn, is costly. While I acknowledge that certain cases, such as those involving sexual assault, <Col N="1431" /> may have to be transferred to Dublin, there is provision in the Bill for that. There is also an inconsistency to which I want to draw the Minister's attention, that while there is an automatic right of transfer from Cork, no corresponding right of transfer is available to people in Dublin to have their cases transferred elsewhere.</P>
    <P>There is need for requiring an accused to show cause for having a case transferred to another court. While successive Ministers for Justice have indicated that they have no particular objection to effecting such an amendment, no such action has been taken even though no legal practitioner, certainly none in the Cork area, would oppose it. I am aware that the Garda, lawyers and victims of crime have felt for a long time that our bail laws should have been changed but, on the other hand, civil libertarians correctly argue that any such change might restrict an individual's rights to freedom. This Bill represents a considered, measured, response to all the inadequacies inherent in our bail laws, striking the necessary balance to take account of the opposing views to which I just referred.</P>
    <P>A Member who participated in this debate referred to someone accused of drugs-related crimes having been granted free legal aid. That convicted person was allowed out on bail of £5,000, yet had no difficulty in finding those £5,000 for personal surety. That constitutes further argument for the Minister accepting this well considered, moderate Bill, whose provisions do not interfere with the rights of those holding opposing views on an individual's right to liberty. Indeed it broadens the scope of our bail laws while, at the same time, stipulating the powers of the courts in granting bail. Deputy O'Donoghue is to be congratulated on its introduction. It proposes practical, enforceable and permissible constraints on the nature and extent of the liberty a person charged with a criminal offence may enjoy. There is not, nor should there be, a constitutional right to unrestricted bail <Col N="1432" /> pending trial, in that unnecessary interference only with an individual's liberty is prohibited under the Constitution.</P>
    <P>Any thorough examination of this Bill will lead to the conclusion that it can legitimately be claimed to be pro-victim and anti-crime, for which the public have been crying out. The public cannot understand why the Minister has prevaricated; it is as though she was fiddling while Rome burned. The country is awash with crime and drugs and no practical action is taken on the ground. It took Deputy O'Donoghue to advance a practical solution for the minimisation and-or elimination of such crime. This should have been the prerogative of the Minister, but she failed the people and every day we read in the papers, hear on the radio and see on the television the havoc being wreaked on decent ordinary people by thugs and blackguards.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Justice informed us that the number of crimes committed by persons on bail increased from 2,494 in 1990 to 4,416 last year. It is a shocking indictment of our bail system that so many persons reoffend while out on bail. It appears the terms of bail laws are no longer worth the paper on which they are written.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under existing legislation there are only two grounds on which bail can be refused. first, if there is a danger the accused would not attend a court for trial and, second, if there is a danger the accused would interfere with witnesses, jurors or evidence. This is little comfort to the hundreds of innocent business people, particularly in the west, who have been the victims of mobile thugs, many of whom are out on bail and preying on rural targets. This plague of crime on wheels must be stopped. Night after night Dublin based gangs target rural businesses and the criminals are <Col N="1433" /> safely back in Dublin before their evil acts are discovered the following morning. While Garda activity in Dublin has resulted in a clamp-down on robberies in the city, the thugs are diverting their criminal activities to rural areas.</P>
    <P>It is time the Minister and the Garda Commissioner addressed this growing problem. I am sick and tired of the do-gooders. They are not the victims of the thugs, nor do they have to pick up the pieces after being cleaned out by mobile bandits. Rural Garda stations will have to be reopened and the necessary manpower allocated to them. When we had gardaí on the beat such crimes did not happen as often because gardaí knew what was happening in their areas. We must implement a policing policy that will act as a deterrent against well organised criminal gangs. Policing at night will have to become a priority. Most rural Garda stations do not have sufficient manpower to maintain a 24 hour operation. This must change.</P>
    <P>Last weekend in south Mayo five robberies were committed between 4.30 a.m. and 7.30 a.m. A young man with a wife and three children, following the security light coming on and hearing the noise of a car outside his premises, telephoned 999 on three occasions, but the gardaí were busy investigating a robbery committed in the previous half hour. He waited for some time for the squad car to arrive but eventually became fearful that this property would be burned down or his family attacked and began to make noise and turned on lights. The criminals drove off in a black car to commit another crime in the same village. The Minister and Commissioner must address the question of policing in rural areas.</P>
    <P>Another deterrent would be to set up roadblocks on the River Shannon, a matter which was raised in the past by many Deputies from the west, but went unnoticed by the Minister and the Garda authorities. Such a simple idea would be highly effective in thwarting the activities of city based criminals. In most cases people with no previous convictions should be given bail, but known <Col N="1434" /> criminals should not. They should be confined to an open prison, perferably on an island where they could not interfere with honest decent people.</P>
    <P>Some years ago there were 20 gardaí in Westport, but that was reduced to 17 in recent years. We are awaiting the replacement of three gardaí. This crime wave did not start since this Government took up office. I must blame the previous Minister for the past seven years of neglect when crime was rampant, but nobody took notice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure the Deputy we will get them back. There is no sergeant in Newport or Louisburg and there is a shortfall of three Garda personnel in the Westport area. Because of tourism the populations of towns in the west treble in the summer months, but there is a shortfall of gardaí.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Minister set up a meeting with the Commissioner? I will also seek a meeting with him to inform him that attacks on rural areas must stop. This is a serious matter. People are afraid to go to sleep at night because they fear somebody may come into their houses during <Col N="1435" /> the night, tie them up and rob them. This happened to three elderly neighbours of mine recently who are now afraid to open their front doors in the middle of the day and have spent a great deal of money on security devices. This was never the case in the west, where doors could always be left open. We were never afraid of people coming into our houses during the day, but that is no longer the case. We now have highly organised Dublin criminals driving into areas in the west, committing crimes and arriving back in Dublin within a short time.</P>
    <P>The Garda Síochána must be given the powers and the resources to protect our rural population. This will not be the only time the Minister will hear me mention this matter in the Dáil. I will continue to raise it. I do not blame the Minister for this problem, rather I blame her predecessor who did nothing about it. A special squad should be set up and the Army should also play its part. There is no reason the Garda Síochána and the Army could not work together in this regard. Helicopters could be used to monitor the movements of criminals. Every available facility should be used to resolve this problem. We are talking about only 1 per cent of the population who are wreaking havoc throughout the country. They must be taken on once and for all. I have no doubt the Government is serious about taking on the criminals because decent people must be assured that when they go to bed at night their houses will not be broken into. The three young children who were tied up in last week's incident will always be afraid to go to bed at night.</P>
    <P>A few years ago Mayo was crime free, but that is no longer the case. Rural Garda stations must be reopened and gardaí put back into rural areas. The previous Government made an error in this regard and the Minister must reexamine the matter. Gardaí on the beat know what is happening. A car stolen in Lucan in County Dublin was found in Shrule last week. If a garda was living <Col N="1436" /> there he or she would have wondered about a strange car in the area and the five crimes committed in South Mayo last week would not have been committed. The thugs are aware that rural areas are not policed at night and that they are easy targets.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister on behalf of all rural people, young and old, to take on the criminals. I am sick and tired of the do-gooders. We want action and criminals behind bars, not living in grade A hotels which is frequently the case at present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my colleague, Deputy Ring, for sharing his time with me. I agree with Deputy O'Donoghue there is a need to tighten our laws. I am encouraged by the enthusiasm displayed on that side of the House. If this Bill is so simple, I cannot understand why Fianna Fáil, which appears to be so concerned today, did nothing about this problem for the seven and a half years it was in power. Several of its Ministers had the opportunity during that time to come up with the ideas which its new Front Bench spokesman has come up with in a few weeks. I congratulate him for that.</P>
      <P>It is good to have an active Opposition. It keeps the Government on its toes but this problem has not arisen overnight. The figures are there to prove it. From 1990 to date the number of crimes committed by people while on bail has almost doubled. It is not just people on bail who cause problems. The problem is widespread and we must take whatever action is needed to address it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fianna Fáil was in power for the past seven and a half years but the figures prove that it did nothing to address this problem. People are afraid to sleep in their beds at night. A 76 year old neighbour of mine was left for dead some nights ago when his house was broken into at 4 o'clock in the morning. A claw hammer was used to damage part of his ear and to hit him on the head. The telephone was ripped out from the wall and were it not that the man had a mobile <Col N="1437" /> telephone, there is no doubt he would not be alive today. These are the criminals we have been prepared to support in the past by giving them easy options but we have not protected people who are afraid to sleep in their houses at night. Can that old man ever forget what happened to him?</P>
    <P>Some weeks before that incident, a number of postmasters and other business people were attacked by a crowd of thugs from Dublin city, some of whom obviously had a good knowledge of the Cavan-Monaghan region. They came to the area, knocked on doors, broke into various premises and even stole cars. Five cars were stolen in my townland and the thieves did not care what they did with them. Thankfully, through the efforts of the gardaí and with the support of an Army helicopter, some of those criminals are now behind bars. I hope they suffer the consequences of their actions because the people living in the houses they broke into have suffered.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice, with the support of the Cabinet, will ensure that the laws are changed and criminals are apprehended. She will ensure that we will all be able to sleep in our beds at night with easy minds. This must be done in a constitutional way. I do not doubt Deputy O'Donoghue's sincerity in bringing forward the Bill but if it is constitutional, why did Fianna Fáil not produce it when in Government? The Minister has advised me that the reason this action was not taken some months ago was because it involved a constitutional issue. However, the Minister will make every effort to ensure that 76 year old men, and the young children mentioned earlier who had been accosted during the night and who, but for a mobile telephone, may have been seriously injured, will be protected.</P>
    <P>This Government must rectify the lack of effort during the seven and a half years of the previous Administration. Given the way this Government is carrying out its business, I am reasonably happy it will take action in this regard. It is not a matter of the number <Col N="1438" /> of Bills it has forecast will be produced; what is important is the number of Bills that will be put through this House. I remember raising the issue of the Occupiers' Liability Bill at the first opportunity on becoming a Member of this House. This Government has brought in a Bill that will deal with the problems of farmers, property owners and others. This Minister also introduced an appropriate Bill.</P>
    <P>In my home town of Ballybay we used to have a sergeant and six gardaí; now we have a sergeant and three gardaí. There is no patrol car in the town and the locals do not have any access to Garda facilities. If a problem arises, people must wait for gardaí to come from Castleblayney or some other town. Many people have suffered serious loss of property and goods and have run the risk of serious personal injury because of this lack of a Garda presence. The whole issue of policing must be examined and, as Deputy Ring said, we must return the gardaí to these areas and to the beat.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> It is an amazing discovery for a Fianna Fáil Member to find we have a crime problem. That is a great reflection on how relaxed he must have been in recent years as he sat in his ivory tower looking out over the land of milk and honey. Is it not time for some realism to be introduced into this area?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I was in Opposition, I objected to the Government shooting down <Col N="1439" /> Opposition Bills on the basis that there is not a monopoly of wisdom on the Government side of the House. I realise this Government might be the exception but generally that is the case. However, this is the third attempt to introduce a Bill dealing with the problem of bail and it is stretching it a little to ask the Government to accept it when the Law Reform Commission is examining the issue. In fact, that was always the excuse given by the previous Government for not introducing or accepting Bills on this subject. The Progressive Democrats and Fine Gael brought in Bills dealing with bail when they were in Opposition. We now have a Fianna Fáil Bill dealing with this subject. Obviously, Fianna Fáil is aware of all the difficulties in this area and knows some of the answers. It was in Government for the past number of years and I am amazed that its members can come in here so easily and ask to have this Bill accepted.</P>
    <P>The bail laws are making a farce of the way we deal with criminals. Judges' hands are tied and bail can only be refused where it is believed the accused person will abscond. Even if a person is caught in the act of committing a crime or caught with incriminating evidence, money, etc. he or she is entitled to bail. We have to deal with that issue. It is time the Law Reform Commission came up with its findings and I hope we will be able to deal with the question of bail during the autumn session. I accept that the Law Reform Commission is busy and has to deal with matters referred to it by the Government but it seems to be taking a long time to deal with the question of bail and this is the third Opposition Bill on this matter. We can hardly expect to go on like this considering we must be on the eve of receiving the report from the Law Reform Commission.</P>
    <P>All previous speakers referred to the fact that we are living in an era of serious crime. One needs only to read the newspapers or know what is going on in the locality to be aware that thugs are roaming the country. Members have <Col N="1440" /> referred to gangs leaving Dublin in high powered cars robbing premises and being able to return without being caught. In one case in Carlow they rammed the window of a clothes shop, took the clothes and were able to get back to Dublin without being stopped even though the alarm had been raised in Carlow. It is amazing that they can travel the country in high powered stolen cars and get away with it. Members have referred to rural Garda stations and I endorse those remarks. Gardaí on the beat help to retain sanity in a place whereas the arrival of the squad car does very little to project the image of law and order. The squad cars are timed and easily seen, those who are up to mischief hide while it is on its way and afterwards they can do what they like. There is a lot to be said for having gardaí in the locality who know what is going on and are aware of strange cars parked in a suspicious manner or strangers trying to stake out a place in advance of crime. There is the difficulty that people in prison make contact with more hardened criminals and are used to supply information about their locality. Two days ago a broadcaster living in Carlow had his house cleaned out while he was doing a radio programme. Obviously someone had information on him, knew where to go and was able to get away. Crime should not pay.</P>
    <P>Drugs are taking over and this leads to two difficulties; those selling drugs ruin people's lives and those on drugs commit crime to get the money to buy them. We should do nothing to make life easier for criminals although admittedly when in prison they should be occupied, have an opportunity to learn something and to be reformed. They should not, however, be encouraged to commit more crime by being at large.</P>
    <P>Our Constitution has stood the test of time but under Article 40, which guarantees the personal rights of the individual, everyone is innocent until proven guilty. The law has to take its course and this means that sometimes people are at large who should not be. If we have to introduce a constitutional <Col N="1441" /> amendment to change the law on bail, and we need to do so, the sooner it is done the better. The criminal is protected in that he is presumed innocent until proven guilty but that is little consolation to the person who has been assaulted, robbed or attacked or who has to live in a house that has been ransacked and has the awful feeling that someone has been in the place.</P>
    <P>I wonder if the Garda Síochána are being used to the best advantage. I have grave reservations about the use of squad cars as the gardaí in them have set routes to follow. I accept that squad cars have to be available when a crime has been committed but the gardaí in them cannot possibly know what is going on. I know the squad car can alter its route and return unexpectedly but if a Garda in the local station is fed information and knows what is going on he can make it his business to ensure that there are no robberies. A review of the bail laws is overdue and I hope the Law Reform Commission will produce its report so that we will be able in the autumn session to deal with the bail laws and put criminals where they should be rather than having them in the public arena where they continue to commit crime.</P>

      <P>To quote Deputy Eric Byrne &ldquo;This country is in the middle of a crime wave of unprecedented proportions&rdquo;. Last year's crime figures will show that for the first time in the history of this State more than 100,000 indictable crimes were committed in one year. Nothing is as corrosive of confidence in the criminal justice system as someone on bail pending trial going on an orgy of crime, causing mayhem throughout the community. In previous times clubs, knives and various types of weapons were used but, increasingly, criminals resort to blood filled syringes and guns. An increasing number of crimes is committed by people on bail.</P>
      <P>The Minister said there cannot be fundamental reforms of the bail laws in the absence of a constitutional referendum. I agree but I disagree fundamentally with the proposition implicit in the Minister's speech that nothing can be done in the meantime. The Minister says that everything will be done together and included in a constitutional referendum which will take place after she has received a proposal from the Law Reform Commission. However, the Minister has no way of ensuring that the Law Reform Commission will do its work speedily on this item and she has no way of putting pressure on it. She cannot even give us a hint as to when we will see the Law Reform Commission report. My reason for saying this is that today I received a paper from the Law Reform Commission on a matter which was given to them in July 1987. There are many items of major importance on the Law Reform Commission's desk and nobody can say when it will come forward with proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first paper on this topic which will be produced by the Law Reform Commission will be a consultation paper on which various parties will have to make submissions. The commission will consider those submissions and produce a final paper. We will have to prepare legislation and put the matter <Col N="1443" /> to a referendum. How long will this take? In case the Minister is under the impression that the final paper will follow quickly on the consultation paper, I would refer her to the Law Reform Commission's consultation paper on sentencing. Having considered the matter for many years the commission issued its consultation paper in 1993. It is now May 1995 and we have not yet seen the final paper and we have no way of knowing when we will see it. That is the reality of depending on and hiding behind the Law Reform Commission. Samuel Johnson said that patriotism was the last refuge of the scoundrel. I would hate to see the Constitution being used as a refuge or hiding place by a Government paralysed by inaction and indecision.</P>
    <P>In the meantime the level of crime committed by people on bail and the number of victims is increasing. Tonight's edition of a local newspaper circulated in my constituency carries on the front page seven stories on crimes of varying degrees of viciousness committed against innocent people. The Garda in Limerick have informed me that four of those crimes, two of which involved appalling injuries to the victims, were committed by people on bail. Why will the Minister not accept Deputy O'Donoghue's reasonable Bill which goes some of the way towards dealing with this problem? The Minister said that Deputy O'Donoghue's proposal is likely to be unconstitutional. It is cold comfort to the people in Limerick who suffered injuries inflicted by people on bail that the Minister's excuse for not accepting legislation which does something about this problem is that somebody she will not name told somebody else at some stage that it is likely to be unconstitutional. That is a flimsy and unacceptable excuse to victims and potential victims.</P>
    <P>We do not expect the Minister to take on board all the provisions in Deputy O'Donoghue's Bill. We want her to support it on Second Stage and put it into <Col N="1444" /> committee where any technical or constitutional problems in it &mdash; I do not think it contains any &mdash; can be thrashed out. The number of crimes committed by people on bail is increasing. The Government has both a political and moral responsibility to accept this very reasonable and limited Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Regardless of who is in Government, I have always been dissatisfied with our determination to deal with criminals. The Government does not seem to be taking any new action to deal with this problem. In reply to a letter from me the Minister for Justice's secretary in a letter dated 24 April stated:</P>
      <P>Dear Deputy,</P>
      <P>I am directed by the Minister for Justice, Mrs. Nora Owen, to refer to your letter regarding law and order in the Crumlin area. I have been informed by the Garda Authorities that crime statistics for the area show that the level of crime in and around the shopping centre is low.</P>
      <P>After I received that letter I told the Minister that somebody had misinformed her, that she had not been given the right information. As the Minister of State knows, the level of crime in Crumlin and the surrounding areas is increasing and many crimes are not being reported. Recently I put down a question to the Minister on the number of handbags which had been snatched. The Minister referred me to an earlier reply given to another Deputy which stated that statistics were not kept on the number of handbags snatched and that such information was not available. Most of the women living in Dublin have had their handbags snatched not just once but two and three times. They have been told by the Garda that they should carry purses instead of handbags.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am delighted the Minister of State, Deputy Gay Mitchell, is in the House. At many meetings in our constituency we expressed our frustration at people's fear about raising the ire of some of the so-called civil rights groups who are <Col N="1445" /> more concerned about the rights of the criminal than of the victim. People who commit crimes while on bail are supposed to be given consecutive sentences. Sometimes they are given consecutive sentences and other times they are not. They should be given consecutive sentences for each crime they commit.</P>
    <P>Progress will not be made in dealing with the drugs problem until drug pushers are given sentences of 20 years or longer. The rewards from drug pushing are so great that drug pushers are prepared to risk serving up to five years in prison with the possibility of time off for good behaviour. The public know that the criminals are winning and they want the Government to deal with this problem. We have an obligation to the public to deal with it. In many cases people are afraid to give evidence against drug pushers. Young people threaten them that if they give evidence in court their windows will be broken or they will be beaten up.</P>
    <P>What is the position in regard to people who smuggle drugs into prison while visiting prisoners? How many of them have been caught? Are proper searches carried out? Eighty per cent of prisoners have a drug problem and there is something very wrong with the system if they are still able to get drugs. I support the calls for the introduction of a methadone programme and the sooner this is done the better. All of us are aware of what needs to be done to deal with this problem, yet we are yellow when it comes to dealing with the criminals. All Governments have an obligation to the electorate and we have to live up to this by coming down heavily on criminals. We have to stop worrying about so-called civil rights organisations which are only concerned about the rights of criminals.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisFoley" hpid="Mr. Foley Mr. Foley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foley</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate Deputy John O'Donoghue, the Fianna Fáil spokesperson on Justice on the introduction of this Bill at a time when the country is suffering from an unacceptably high level of crime. Last weekend there was a shooting incident at the <Col N="1446" /> home of a Garda inspector in Dublin and a Garda patrol car in Cork city was rammed. Ordinary law abiding citizens are afraid to walk the streets in case they are mugged or robbed. They also live in fear of their cars being stolen or their houses being broken into. This canot be allowed to continue. The public are crying out to us as legislators to deal with this problem. I welcome this Bill which attempts to deal with it.</P>
      <P>Before dealing with the areas in urgent need of reform and the bail laws, I wish to refer to the grievous threat posed by an increase in crime which will result in our having no option but to direct the full resource of the State towards the battle against crime. While this may involve extra security personnel, better equipment and improved custodial facilities, it is the responsibility of this House to ensure that appropriate legislation is enacted to allow the various State agencies operate more efficiently.</P>
      <P>Our bail laws are a specific example of how excellent police work can be seriously undermined by guilty parties who are given a further opportunity to engage in crime. Eventually, the burden of such legal inadequacies is borne by the law abiding citizen. The proposed changes addressed two main problems with current legislation. They provide the Judiciary with greater flexibility regarding the circumstances in which they can refuse to grant bail and allow for sanctions against a person on bail in cases where the bail provision has been abused.</P>
      <P>This Bill provides the House with an excellent opportunity to take much needed action against hardened criminals since every day these reforms are delayed leads to increased opportunities for such habitual offenders. That leads to the question: do we really wish the present unsatisfactory position to continue when Deputy O'Donoghue's comprehensive prudent proposals would lead to an immediate substantial improvement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a recent IMS opinion poll, an overwhelming 88 per cent of those polled <Col N="1447" /> favoured a change in legislation which would make bail much more difficult to obtain by people who have a history of previous offences. I have no doubt that such public support to end this scandal has existed for many years. The figures of 2,500 detected offences committed in 1989 by those on bail, rising to 4,500 in 1994, do not reveal the full catalogue of misery. One preventable crime committed is one too many. The elderly, the alone and the innocent who have suffered at the hands of these bail bandits have voiced their opinion in the poll. It is also accepted that there will be a small but vocal minority who will oppose any strengthening of our bail laws. According to the recent poll this was 6 per cent. We will hear arguments relevant to personal liberty but how can they assuage the real fears of victims of vicious assaults and sexual abuse who see offenders freed on bail within hours while they remain prisoners of their mental trauma for years?</P>
    <P>In addressing the question of bail and delays in our court system, the issue of prison accommodation must also be considered. The increased pressure that a change in the law could place on an already overburdened prison will completely negate any change made unless prison accommodation is greatly increased. Without such a commitment, the revolving door syndrome in our prisons will become a Disneyland roundabout. Streamlining the courts system could alleviate the inevitable increase in the number of remand prisoners. However, nothing short of a commitment to providing after prison space will ensure an end to a system under which in order to put one person in jail we must release another.</P>
    <P>The worst nightmare for any decent member of society is to be the victim of a crime. It is harder to endure violence inflicted by a violent criminal than it is to recover from it subsequently, but it must be almost impossible to come to terms with it when that crime is committed by someone who should be in custody. There is little point in <Col N="1448" /> Members offering sympathy and understanding to victims of crime when it is our prime duty as legislators to devise a fair and efficient system of justice. Given the repeated law breaking by habitual offenders and the loopholes in our bail provisions, it is outrageous to sympathise with victims while failing to introduce essential amending legislation. It is sometimes claimed that we do not have sufficient places on our prisons to accommodate an increasing number of convicted criminals.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>When I came into the House as a new Deputy I was amazed at the capacity of some Members to speak without notes. I remember asking Deputy Durkan how Deputies spoke for 30 minutes on a subject and he said to me: &ldquo;Well, Liz, when you are in here long enough things come round and round&rdquo;. At this stage, I could talk for four hours on the issue of bail because this subject has been a constant feature of debate. In June 1994, the Progressive Democrats introduced a Private Members' Bill seeking achieveable reforms relating to bail laws which could tighten up the availability of bail but stopping short of the need for a constitutional referendum. We felt it would take a long time for any Government, having deliberated on the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission, to put the matter to the people.</P>
      <P>I was delighted when the Minister for Justice announced earlier this year that she would put this matter to the people. Her statement was warmly welcomed by Fianna Fáil, the Progressive Democrats and, presumably, by Fine Gael. However, there is silence about that now because elements in the Government were not in favour of putting such constitutional reform to the people at the next opportunity. What is the status of the Minister's statement that she will put this vital need for a change in the Constitution to allow that bail will not be granted to persistent offenders to the people at the next available opportunity, perhaps at the time of the divorce referendum?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1449" /> One of the reasons for the low morale among the Garda is that they spend long hours in pursuit of criminals, bring them through the complicated process of the criminal justice system and then find that persistent offenders, whom they know will reoffend, are released on bail. In the main they are heroin users and, as sure as night follows day, they reoffend. In Mountjoy Jail, 50 per cent of the prison population are IV heroin users and are persistent offenders. When they appear before the courts there is usually no prison accommodation for them. Under existing bail laws the likelihood of reoffending is not an adequate reason to refuse bail. They are released into the community while awaiting trial. It takes a long time for them to be brought back before the courts and they commit offences while on bail. The traditional notion of innocent until proven guilty must be balanced against the fact that nowadays most criminals are persistent reoffenders. Evidence of high recidivism is the fact that prisoners in Mountjoy have received on average ten separate sentences and the number of convictions ranged from one to 93.</P>
    <P>This matter was tested in the Supreme Court in the Callaghan case but there is need to reflect and change our laws to take account of the high incidence of crime perpetrated by persistent offenders. Citizens have a right to a criminal justice system which affords them reasonable protection against criminals who flout bail laws. There have been calls from all political parties for reform in this area. I am blue in the face talking about the need for reform of the bail laws. There is a total paralysis of analysis of the issue. Many reports have been prepared and studies carried out on the issue of bail. Several Private Members' Bills have been introduced on the subject. There is cross-party consensus that we should not delay any longer but should bring forward changes to close this loophole on bail.</P>
    <P>It is ironic that we had a debate this <Col N="1450" /> week on a Bill to return prisoners sentenced abroad to complete their sentences here. This is an essential part of the police process and was welcomed by all parties. However, we know that our jails are bursting at the seams. Putting people in prison is not only a punishment for the offender, it is a major punishment in terms of cost for the taxpayer. The fact that in the long run it is useless because of inadequate rehabilitation, or work and training schemes for the inmates, should be a source of concern. It is not generally recognised that the non capital cost of keeping a person in jail is £37,000 per year. The cost of providing one additional prison space is £110,000. We have a huge problem in relation to our prison system and we do not have a separate remand centre. This would be relevant to the debate about tightening up our bail laws by constitutional referendum. If the constitutional referendum gave us the authority to change and tighten our bail laws where would we put remand prisoners? This multi-faceted problem, an issue of major political importance has not been sufficiently considered or reflected on at Government level.</P>
    <P>Deputies referred to the drug problem in our jails, a reflection of the drug problems outside. There are no work programmes for the inmates in Mountjoy, they share cells and live in dreadful conditions. Our jails have been described by prison visiting committees as a time-bomb waiting to explode. The promised building of a jail at Castlerea and a new women's prison must be looked at in terms of their strategic benefits when what we really need is a national custodial detoxification centre for addicted offenders. We can no longer continue to put heroin addicts in with non-addicted criminals.</P>
    <P>As I said at the prison officers' conference last week, the figures indicated that the percentage of prisoners who were heroin abusers in Mountjoy had increased from 30 per cent to 50 per cent. I sought to raise this matter with the Minister tomorrow as a matter of urgency because that statistic escalation <Col N="1451" /> is startling. It was ruled out of order on the basis that a similar question had been put to the Minister by another Deputy three months ago on the general issue of drug abuse in prisons. The Minister is obviously unwilling to come into the House and talk about our prison system which is in a state of near collapse.</P>
    <P>No issue has received more cross-party support that the need for a restriction and tightening of our bail laws. We must also tackle the problem of inadequate spaces. The measures proposed to be introduced in this Bill fall short of the need for constitutional change but they would, in the short term, provide some measure of tightening up which would satisfy the Garda Síochána, who are persistent in their calls for change in the bail laws. They have the support of Fianna Fáil and my party and, I believe, the support of the Fine Gael Party.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister of State, Deputy Burton, clarify the Labour Party's position on this issue? I debated this matter with Deputy Costello on the airwaves following the announcement by the Minister for Justice that there would be constitutional changes in this area. Deputy Costello advanced the usual civil libertarian argument which is outdated, not reflected in the general population and which must be challenged. I ask the Minister for Justice to stand firm in her commitment to bring forward constitutional change in this area. She would have the support of the Opposition, the nation and the Garda Síochána who have the most difficult task of trying to enforce the criminal justice system when there is an abject failure on the part of the Government to address the bail issue.</P>
    <P>Last year Deputy Gay Mitchell proposed, as Deputy O'Donoghue is now doing, to tighten our bail laws. If the Fine Gael Party, who roared like demons on the issue of bail and who supported us in our Bill, were in Opposition they would support this Bill; in fact they would be leading the chase. Is it any wonder the public has lost confidence in politics when people change <Col N="1452" /> their stripes as soon as they get into Government?</P>
    <P>I call on the Minister for Justice to show her hand and to indicate if she will stand firm behind the urgent need for constitutional change. We proposed practical measures, similar to those in the Fianna Fáil Bill, but they were voted down by the then Fianna Fáil-Labour Government. Fine Gael, now in Government, seem to have lost its nerve on this issue and will vote against reasonable achievable changes in our bail laws which has the support of the Opposition.</P>
    <P>If we want to convince the electorate that we are up to any good in this House, if politics means anything and if we are not wasting our time talking to an empty Chamber, this paralysis of analysis of the issue must end. I warmly endorse the Fianna Fáil Bill which we will heartily support.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Ms Burton) Austin Currie">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Ms Burton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak in this debate. Has Deputy O'Donnell forgotten that the Progressive Democrats were in power relatively recently? I do not recall their addressing this issue with any degree of vigour. If we are not to be hypocritical, it is wrong to create an expectation that a very complex set of problems can be dealt with by easy answers and by quick fix solutions because, manifestly, they cannot.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Donnell asked about the Labour Party point of view. In that party there is a wide and deep understanding of the complex reasons people commit crime, ranging from problems in relation to drugs, poverty and criminally depraved behaviour. The fact that there are complex social issues which lead to crime &mdash; Deputy Briscoe is aware of this &mdash; is not an excuse for crime. The vast majority of people who face difficult economic circumstances have not resorted to crime. One of the most horrible features of the current crime difficulties is that people who are poor, in some cases very poor, are being preyed <Col N="1453" /> upon by people for very small amounts of money.</P>
    <P>I listened earlier to Deputies from rural areas speak with passion and belief about those criminals, whom they saw as emanating solely from Dublin &mdash; I am sure a great many do. However, they fail to understand there is a problem throughout Dublin, particularly in the poorest parts &mdash; in the worst flat complexes and corporation estates &mdash; where people who are trying to live their lives without much resources are persecuted by petty criminals. This is probably the single worst feature of the current problem.</P>
    <P>I have been involved both in this Government and in the last in serious efforts to address the problems of inequality and poverty, but all our efforts to promote economic growth and social justice will be set at nought if we fail to come to terms with the problems of crime. I was involved in many initiatives on local development in areas of deprivation and crime, and all of these will be put at risk unless the issue of crime is addressed alongside the questions of employment and provision for education and other social services.</P>
    <P>Another issue we must address which has not received sufficient attention and which may be partly a consequence of the peace process is the problem of hardened violent criminals who have access to guns and who will have even greater access in the future. We as a society must come to terms with that.</P>
    <P>We see in America a debate which attempts to find absolute simple solutions to wide-ranging and complex problems. Such simple solutions will inevitably fail. I understand the concerns of Deputies from both Dublin and the country and how deeply they feel about their neighbours, their families and themselves being put at risk by criminals. The debate deserves an honest answer and honest attention.</P>
    <P>In regard to Deputy O'Donoghue's Bill, points were made by many speakers, particularly on the Government side, about previous attempts to introduce such a Bill. I would remind Deputy <Col N="1454" /> O'Dea that when a similar Bill was introduced when Deputy Máire Geoghegan-Quinn was Minister for Justice, it was rejected on the grounds that the matter was being examined by the Law Reform Commission.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">

      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>That was a recent rejection. It is not unreasonable to await the report of the Law Reform Commission. As to a number of specific points in Deputy O'Donoghue's Bill, there are strong suggestions on very good legal advice that they are unconstitutional in the light of the ruling in the O'Callaghan case.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Dea laboured in the Department of Justice for quite some time so I have no doubt he is a great expert in all these areas. He certainly had sufficient time to think about them deeply, although we did not always see the fruits of the thought. There are serious objections to a number of points in the Bill. The Supreme Court ruling in the O'Callaghan case represents what the Supreme Court has to say about bail.</P>

      <P>In the last four periods of Private Members' Business during which this Bill has been discussed, every possible obstacle has been placed in its way by speakers on the Government benches. The central plank of the argument put forward by Government Deputies and Ministers is that some parts of this Bill may be unconstitutional. I say unequivocally that there is no section and no provision of this Bill which is unconstitutional. It is a fair and honest attempt to address a serious problem. The response of the Government has been, to say the least, extremely disappointing.</P>

      <P>One cannot understand why a Bill put forward in good faith, containing provisions which would limit the ability of people on bail to commit crime, cannot be accepted by this Rainbow Coalition Government. The conditions imposed under this legislation are fair, reasonable and constitutional.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with the Minister for Justice and with Government Deputies that it would be preferable to have a constitutional referendum on bail. It is not possible for a court today to refuse bail on the basis of the likelihood that the individual on bail will commit a crime, and that is what possibly motivated the Minister for Justice, Deputy Owen, to state that there would be a referendum <Col N="1456" /> on bail in the autumn in tandem with the divorce referendum. However, when the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste were pursued in this House on that question they refused repeatedly to publicly back the statement of the Minister for Justice. This statement, therefore, would appear to have been nothing more than an impromptu statement.</P>

      <P>Does the Government intend to hold a referendum on bail? Are the members of this Rainbow Coalition united in their resolve to hold a referendum? The refusal to accept this constitutional Bill tonight, a Bill tough on habitual criminals and an attempt to deal with escalating crime levels answers that question. For reasons best known to itself, this Government has no commitment to holding a referendum on bail. Every time a positive proposal was put forward by Fianna Fáil since going into Opposition it was shot down on the basis that we did not do it when we were in Government. There were certain things one could not do while in Government with the Labour Party.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Let nobody be in doubt of that. This proposal was put forward by Fianna Fáil on the basis of the number of crimes committed by people while on bail. The Minister for Justice admitted that the number of crimes committed by persons on bail has increased from 2,494 in 1990 to 4,416 last year. It is still rising, and not slowly. Those figues were published since Deputy Owen became Minister for Justice, and she would do well to remember that she is no longer in Opposition. She has a duty to deal with the probem in legislation. There is no point in hiding behind the smokescreen that Fianna Fáil was in Government for seven years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill has been designed to make <Col N="1457" /> the lives of recidivist offenders more difficult, to revoke the licence which seems to exist to commit crime and to facilitate the courts in placing the necessary restrictions on the personal liberty of accused persons. It gives statutory recognition to the fact that there is no constitutional right to commit crime. It is an honest and effective solution within acceptable constitutional parameters for the present tide of lawlessness.</P>
    <P>The Minister's response to the Bill, aside from the personal attacks on the proposer, was her usual cocktail of indifference, inability and inactivity.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;further consideration, studied and prolonged inactivity. She would have us believe that she is poised to launch an onslaught on crime, if only someone else would do the paperwork. Her comments contradict that view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister concluded her remarks by saying that a number of Bills have <Col N="1458" /> been completed or are nearing completion in the Department. I find this astonishing having regard to the answer given to me by the Taoiseach recently when he stated that it was not intended to introduce any further criminal justice measures in this session. Who is the Minister trying to fool? Does she expect the public to accept that necessary legislation has been completed in her Department but that it will not be introduced for six months? If the Bills have been completed why is she delaying further? Why are they not being introduced? When legislation was necessary to provide for the appointment of further Ministers of State to state the greed of the rainbow Coalition parties it was produced overnight. When legislation is necessary to make the streets of our cities, towns and villages safe it is deferred indefinitely.</P>
    <P>The Criminal Law (Bail) Bill, 1995 was introduced by Fianna Fáil in recognition of the need for change in the law. It proposes changes within the parameters of the existing constitutional provision which would regulate the right to bail. There is no doubt that the public wish to see an end to crimes being committed by persons while on bail; the revolving door syndrome, where prisoners, including those who have committed crimes while on bail, are given temporary release. In this Bill Fianna Fáil has introduced a measure which would have that precise effect.</P>
    <P>Section 10 provides for the abolition of temporary release where sentences are being served in respect of offences committed while on bail. The Minister has refused to support this provision and has acknowledged that it is undoubtedly constitutional. She is aware that an indentical provision can be found in section 5 (3) of the Criminal Justice Act, 1990. That section prohibits the granting of temporary release to a person convicted of the murder of a member of the Garda Síochána in the course of his duty.</P>
    <P>It is acknowledged that section 10 is constitutional but the Minister, and the Government, refuse to support it <Col N="1459" /> because they wish to retain the power to release prisoners who have committed crimes while on bail. This is some answer to the crime problem. It would appear, however, that this is the measure of the Minister's and the Government's commitment to stemming the crime wave. It is the policy of the Government to continue to grant prisoners who have committed crimes while on bail temporary release and it wants to do so without new statutory safeguards and irrespective of whether they are prepared to enter a bond to keep the peace and be of good behaviour.</P>
    <P>For many months the Minister for Justice was unable to utter a sentence without including the hallowed words &ldquo;openness and transparency&rdquo;. I invite the Minister to fulfil her pledge to openness and transparency by explaining in detail the reasons the Bill is unconstitutional. If she wishes to be transparent that is the best way she can achieve it but this will not happen as she is in full flight from the complexity of her portfolio. She has sought to hide behind an all embracing claim of unconstitutionality. I remind the House that the purpose of the Constitution is to protect citizens. It was never intended to be used as a permanent excuse for legislative indolence.</P>
    <P>It was my hope that the Minister would take the opportunity to outline her policy on bail. In introducing this measure I posed the question: what is the Government's policy on bail?</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>None.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I now have the answer, it has none. The only hope the public have of advancing their knowledge of the Minister's intentions in regard to bail is if the Minister makes an impromptu announcement on a television programme. This issue is far too serious to have continued Government by soundbite.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1460" /> The Minister's attitude to this Bill has rendered explicable the Tánaiste's exasperation with her performance to date. I look forward to the time when she will be forced to leave her bunker and explain to the public her support for temporary release of bail offenders.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil is determined to turn the tide on crime. It is determined to ensure that this House will have the necessary legislation before it without delay. It will match Government inactivity with activity and will be content to let the people judge the performance and priorities of this administration.</P>
    <P>On the bail issue in particular, the Minister's political procrastination must be the lengthiest since Nero watched Rome burn. The tragedy is that this constitutional and honest measure to try to prevent habitual criminals roaming the streets is being rejected by the Government for the flimsiest of reasons. Arguments against the constitutionality of the measures contained within this Bill do not stand up. If they do not stand up &mdash; I am satisfied they do not &mdash; the question must be asked: why is the Government opposing the Bill? The only reason I can think of, and the only conclusion any reasonable individual can reach, is that, because of mean spirited political opportunism and a failure to acknowledge that this is decent legislation in the interests of the people, the Government has decided that political expediency and opportunism and a mean spirited attitude to positive measures should take precedence over the welfare of individuals in society. That is not acceptable for the Minister or the Government parties and it is something of which they should be ashamed.</P>
    <P>I wish to make very clear that this will not be the last constitutional Bill Fianna Fáil will bring before the House to deal with crime. We are sick and tired of indolence, lethargy and flimsy excuses.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Ransom Payments to Kidnappers.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you for giving me permission to raise this important item on the Adjournment. Recent newspaper reports suggest that more than 20 kidnappings were carried out last year and the gardaí were not informed of one case for fear of reprisal. I am reliably informed that kidnappings of this nature have been happening in Ireland for the past ten years and have been increasing steadily for the past three years. In the early stages, apparently members of the Provisional IRA were the main culprits. They adopted the simple expedient of informing a target that he or she was on the list and that unless ransom was paid the target would be kidnapped. Since the peace process, kidnappings are being carried out by a group of maverick terrorists and a few ordinary criminals. Those terrorists control hundreds of heavy duty weapons and the main culprit in the ranks of the ordinary criminals is based in Bray and is well known to the gardaí.</P>
      <P>The growth in the kidnapping business has been accompanied by a growth in kidnap insurance, kidnap protection and anti-kidnap technology. Ireland has now become similar to Italy in the mid-1980s when ordinary criminals and members of the red brigade terrorist organisation discovered that kidnapping was a lucrative source of revenue and the victims could be discouraged from informing the police because of fear of reprisal. Last year it is estimated by some that kidnapping yielded at least £1 million for criminals here, but the gardaí were not informed of any kidnap. Victims paid sums ranging up to £250,000 for their freedom and were too frightened to report the kidnap threat for fear of reprisal. Apparently, low profile wealthy business people are the principal targets. High profile figures are not being targeted because of the amount of personal security they can afford to employ and because they know the matter will not come to public attention and, therefore, not to the attention of the Garda.</P>
      <P>What are the Government and Garda doing about this? Have the Garda any plans to deal with the escalation of this most sinister of crimes? Have the Garda even taken the preliminary step of interviewing the security firms mentioned in last Sunday's newspapers who confirmed that these kidnappings had taken place? Have they checked which insurance companies are providing insurance cover against kidnapping? Does the Government have any proposals to discourage and or prevent insurance companies from providing this type of insurance cover which is surely an incentive to kidnappers? Is the Government willing to allow this nefarious, sinister activity to grow unhindered?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the crime figures for 1994 are released shortly I am prepared to predict they will show that more than 100,000 indictable crimes were committed here last year, the first time in the history of the State that figure will have been reached for indictable crimes. <Col N="1465" /> These figures are being reported at a time when reported crime, as a percentage of overall crime, is at its lowest ever.</P>
    <P>Last week a policeman was attacked in his home. If decisive action is not taken as a matter of priority, as Mr. George Maybury of the ASGI said recently, this country will slide into anarchy. One could be forgiven for thinking that slide is already well under way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen) Nora Owen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen)</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy O'Dea will be aware, it is Government policy that ransom payments should not be made in the case of kidnappings. This policy has been adhered to by successive Governments. I am sure the House will agree there are very sound reasons for its continuance.</P>
      <P>I can, of course, fully appreciate the extraordinary pressures that kidnapping places on the unfortunate victims and their families. Indeed, it is difficult to think of a more deeply traumatic experience than that of kidnapping or attempted kidnapping. In this regard, recent incidents of this nature are to be deplored in the harshest of terms. In each case, I know that the gardaí will do everything within their power to bring the culprits to justice.</P>
      <P>The Garda authorities have informed me that they have no information to suggest that ransom payments have been made. However, the possibility that ransom payments may have been made in cases which were never reported nor known to the Garda cannot, of course, be discounted. As I said, I can understand the pressures faced by the families and friends of kidnap victims.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I must reiterate that it is Government policy that ransom payments should not be paid. To do so &mdash; let us be quite clear about this &mdash; only provides an incentive for criminals to continue this evil, cowardly crime. Crime must not be seen to pay. The payment of a ransom does precisely that. If criminals believe that they can commit crime, that the offence will not even be reported to the Garda, they will have <Col N="1466" /> every incentive to commit the crime again. For this reason, I must state clearly and unambiguously, that all kidnappings and attempted kidnappings should be reported to the Garda. They are the professionals and are best placed to deal with such incidents.</P>
    <P>I want to place on record that the Garda authorities have achieved a high success rate in relation to the prevention and detection of kidnappings over the years. As regards measures to prevent such crimes in the first place, I am informed by the Garda authorities that arrangements and procedures have been put in place to minimise the incidence of kidnappings. While, for security reasons, I cannot go into these procedures in any detail, I can state that the Garda advise and assist, on a confidential basis, persons regarded by them as potential subjects of kidnapping.</P>
    <P>In addition, Garda crime prevention officers are always available to advise concerned members of the public as to the steps that can be taken to reduce the risk of kidnap. The availability of such advice and assistance will be highlighted in a forthcoming &ldquo;Crimeline&rdquo; progamme on RTE.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>The outrageous, dastardly attack last weekend on the home of Garda Inspector Willie Stratford in Raheny in my constituency is the latest, extreme example of the growing problem of intimidation of urban communities and, in this case, a garda. I condemn in the strongest possible terms this cowardly, despicable and utterly irresponsible attack and sympathise with Inspector Stratford and his family. I hope the perpetrators of that outrageous crime will be brought to justice speedily.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1467" /> There has been a great increase in the amount of intimidation and harassment of householders and residents, especially of those involved in community leadership, such as members of tenants associations, neighbourhood watch groups and those endeavouring to improve the quality of life of their communities throughout the north side of this city. For example, in a very socially deprived area in my constituency, a large housing estate of approximately 900 houses in north Coolock, three families were forced out of their homes by gangs over a two week period. Two such homes were subsequently razed to the ground at an approximate net cost of £50,000, to Dublin City Council.</P>
    <P>Another similar incident took place in my constituency in a flat complex, comprising approximately 100 flats. Drug gangs attempted to take over that complex, viciously intimidating anybody who attempted to oppose them in their efforts. When visiting a constituent in that complex recently I noticed nine or ten people openly engaging in drug dealing at the entrance. That is totally intolerable for residents, families and the community.</P>
    <P>There has always been the problem of harassment of urban communities on the north side. An official of Dublin Corporation, Mr. Michael Kelly, the authority's housing officer, wrote an outstanding report on the essence of the problem, on the reason families who were considered to be slightly different on account of race, religion or whatever were singled out for harassment. This problem has recently exploded, spreading like a plague across the north side of the city, with even a Garda officer being singled out for attack.</P>
    <P>The position is intolerable and the Government must take decisive action to resolve it. Indeed a famous phrase of the Leader of the British Labour Party &ldquo;tough on crime; tough on causes of crime&rdquo; must be the policy also of all Members of this House and is certainly that of my party. The previous Government was tough on crime, and <Col N="1468" /> implemented many worth-while programmes which have been supported by the present administration. This Government is investing the money to tackle this problem.</P>
    <P>It is outrageous that people who have contempt for the democratic process should attempt to undo everything already achieved. The Minister for Justice must impress on all local authorities that one of their main responsibilities is to ensure that never again will the victims of this type of harassment and intimidation be forced to leave their homes; rather its perpetrators should be forced to move. Very often those perpetrators are known. I am proud of the fact that the new housing manager of Dublin Corporation is beginning to take action.</P>
    <P>There is need for an urgent, national programme to combat this type of criminal activity. In this respect the Minister should introduce immediately the juvenile justice Bill which was in course of preparation during the period of office of the previous Government. This would alert parents to their responsibilities and make them aware that if their children are harassing others, they may lose their home.</P>
    <P>I listened earlier this evening to the debate on the Criminal Law (Bail) Bill, 1995 in respect of which the Minister advanced some interesting proposals to counter some outrageous crimes committed by people while on bail. The Minister, who represents another constituency on the north side of the city, will be aware that a shortage of gardaí is inhibiting the resolution of this problem. For example, in my constituency there are approximately 200 gardaí to cater for up to 100,000 citizens, if I include my ward. That is a bad ratio and does not allow for the necessary type of hour to hour observation of trouble spots which is necessary in some housing complexes.</P>
    <P>While I accept that the Minister, with her colleagues, has established an interdepartmental committee to devise an <Col N="1469" /> urgent programme of action to combat crime, the position prevailing is critical, warranting immediate action. We must ensure that the despicable incident which took place in the early hours of last Saturday morning at the home of a servant of this State, a blatant attack on our democracy, never recurs.</P>

      <P>I take this opportunity to place on record my absolute abhorrence of the recent gun attack on a Garda inspector's home in Raheny, Dublin. This attack must be condemned in the strongest possible manner. Such attacks will not, and cannot ever, be tolerated. I have been informed by the Garda authorities that a number of persons were arrested and questioned about the incident and that an intensive investigation is ongoing. I am sure this cowardly attack will fail in its obvious objective. The gardaí will not be intimidated or deterred in carrying out their duty and the criminals who carried out this attack should realise that.</P>
      <P>Deputy Broughan should give me details of the specific incidents of intimidation to which he referred so I can ask the gardaí to investigate them. Also, I will raise with my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, the question of housing policy whereby as an easy course of action, local authorities may oblige the victims of intimidation to move rather than force the perpetrators out of their homes.</P>
      <P>As regards the wider issue of drug related crime, the Deputy will be aware that I have already dealt with this matter in the House in detail on a number of occasions since becoming Minister for Justice. The Deputy will know that the whole issue of drugs is a matter of high priority to me. In the remaining time available to me, I will set out as concisely as I can what I, as Minister for Justice, am doing to deal with the drugs problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These measures are, of course, being taken within the overall context of the Government strategy to prevent <Col N="1470" /> drug abuse which proposes a multi-disciplinary approach requiring action in the areas of supply reduction, demand reduction and increased access to treatment and rehabilitation programmes.</P>
    <P>I am ensuring the gardaí have the necessary resources to deal with the problem. In Dublin, drug units have been established in each of the city's five Garda divisions and their activities are co-ordinated through the Central Drugs Squad in Harcourt Square. Full time drugs units now operate in Santry, Cabra, Raheny, Dún Laoghaire, Crumlin, Ballyfermot, Tallaght, Store Street, Pearse Street, Kevin Street and Donnybrook. Outside Dublin, there are drugs units in Cork, Limerick and Galway.</P>
    <P>I will bring proposals to Government shortly on inter-agency co-operation in the fight against drug trafficking. The main task of the proposals will be to identify the best arrangements for achieving a cohesive and co-ordinated response to the drug trafficking problem by the existing law enforcement agencies. I pay tribute to the splendid co-operation and co-ordination between the Garda and the Customs unit which led to a major find of cannabis yesterday valued at more than £3 million. That is the co-ordination we require to prevent this country becoming a back door for drug trafficking to the rest of Europe.</P>
    <P>I have examined the legal powers of members of the law enforcement agencies and the need for legislative changes to assist the law enforcement response. The contribution in the health and education areas in developing strategies to reduce demand for drugs is also considered. The proposals which I will bring to Government will cover all those aspects; a multi-faceted approach will be required to fight drugs in our community and, for this reason, the roles of the Departments of Health, Education, Finance and Justice are crucial. The local community also has a role to play in helping the gardaí to identify drug pushers in their areas.</P>
    <P>I am determined that the legislation recently put in place to provide for the <Col N="1471" /> seizure and confiscation of the proceeds of crime, including drug trafficking, is operated to the fullest possible extent. In this regard, I understand the Director of Public Prosecutions has already made application for restraint orders in two cases. I intend ensuring that the authorities here work closely with the European drugs unit with the objective of achieving the maximum exchange and co-ordination of drugs intelligence. Since the unit was set up in 1994, such exchange has already helped in the fight against drug trafficking here.</P>
    <P>I am confident those law enforcement measures, with measures taken by the Departments of Health and Education to deal with the demands for drugs, will effectively deal with the problem and reduce the instances of drug related crime.</P>
    <P>I would welcome any information Deputy Broughan can give to me about specific cases of intimidation and the Garda should know about them so they can take immediate action.</P>

      <P>Thank you, Sir, for selecting this item for discussion and the Minister for coming into the House to reply. Perhaps the Minister would indicate if he has received the result of the ballot in Packard this evening. What happened in Packard last night&mdash;<Col N="1472" /> reports of which were repeatedly corrected &mdash; was bizzare. The Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, used a very strong word when referring to the matter.</P>
      <P>This industrial relations shambles is not the fault of the workers in Packard who, with commitment, last December and January embarked on productivity arrangements which they were assured would retain workers at the firm. While they expected layoffs, they did not expect 400 to be laid off indefinitely.</P>
      <P>When the Minister, Deputy Bruton, and the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, returned from their travels a few months ago they informed us they had arranged a good deal and everybody was genuinely pleased with the outcome of the trip. The workers, in particular, believed the assurances they were given. They accepted the package of cuts and changes and were told there would be a sufficient level of work to sustain employment at the company.</P>
      <P>Packard is a big enough company to ensure that those assurances are kept. It can generate work for various components of the company in many parts of the world. We want the Minister to honour his commitments to the workers. What commitment did he enter into in Coventry and later when he met executives of Packard in the Davenport Hotel? We were relatively satisfied a reasonable approach was being adopted. It is time for firm action. The company has a future in the automotive components business and it is imperative that every effort is made by the Minister to ensure this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand from people in the firm that local management is not causing the difficulties. It has reached a satisfactory arrangement with the workers, but the orders come from abroad which forces it to change. This is presenting a very uneasy, chaotic and confused picture. What commitments did the Minister get from Packard? What will he do to ensure the shambles experienced by the workers yesterday, is not repeated? It is very difficult for workers in such <Col N="1473" /> circumstances to honour commitment and retain morale.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my colleague, Deputy O'Rourke, for sharing her time with me. I, too, am anxious to hear answer to the important questions raised by her. When the Minister and Minister of State returned from Coventry last January we were given commitments and assurances that all would be well at Packard. There was talk of a new beginning and it was stated that the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, had saved the economic future of the Packard plant in Tallaght. Where do those commitments stand now? Agreements were reached, but have been broken. For example, 42 workers who were laid off were told they would be reinstated by 1 April 1995 or given a redundancy package, but this has not happened. The unions were reassured by the Government in January that any layoffs that might take place would be temporary and minimal &mdash; another commitment not honoured.</P>
      <P>Last night we had a strange and disturbing statement from the management that it was withdrawing its proposal to lay off 720 workers. What appears to be lost to everyone concerned is that we are dealing with real people and their families.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are witnessing the worst excesses in industrial relations and, as my colleague has said, extremely poor communication from the management abroad. Nobody expects Packard to run a loss making operation. We are all aware of the huge competition abroad but we are entitled to ask for openness from the management in its dealing with the workforce. Clearly, we did not get the real story from the management or indeed from the Government in January. All the Minister, Deputy Rabbitte can now say is that he does not know what is going on. I ask him to find out what is going on. What is the definitive duration of the proposed layoffs for these 400 workers? What are the prospects of the 42 workers who have been laid off? <Col N="1474" /> The time for blustering on this issue is over. We are talking about 400 real and valuable jobs and about 400 people and their families. The Minister must tell us and the workforce where their future lies, what he has done and what he intends to do on their behalf.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>The situation at Packard Electric is very worrying and deeply unsettling for its workers, their families and the community in Tallaght. Deputy O'Rourke referred to the situation as being bizarre and I agree with her. It raises a number of fundamental questions for the Ministers, Deputies Bruton and Rabbitte and for the management at Packard. One can understand the anger of the workforce who have made enormous sacrifices. These are difficult, monotonous and lowly paid jobs. The average wage is approximately £210 gross per week and I do not need to tell the House what one takes home from a wage packet of that kind. These workers want to work, they want to earn a living because they have families, mortgages and other commitments. Because they cared about their jobs they were prepared to accept a very difficult package which involved an extended work week, a pay freeze for two years and other difficulties in the interest of preserving their jobs. They now find their reward for that sacrifice is that the workforce may be laid off.</P>
      <P>It is difficult to have confidence in a management which says at one part of the day that virtually the entire workforce could be laid off and which reverses that decision within a matter of hours &mdash; a decision that has such a profound effect on the livelihood of so many people. For the management to announce that decision and reverse it so quickly raises serious questions for it and makes it difficult to have confidence in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The matter also raises questions for the Ministers, Deputies Bruton and Rabbitte. Is the Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, as much in the dark as he led us to believe today? We were told in January that assurances had been given to <Col N="1475" /> the Ministers when they went to Coventry. We were told that the IDA had put in a restructuring package so that a re-engineering programme could be put in place at the plant. We were told that training grants would be given by the Government to minimise the number of layoffs. I want the Minister Deputy Bruton to tell us the nature of the assurances given. Has the IDA put any money into the company with a view to initiating the re-engineering programme? Were any training grants paid to the company? I want the Minister to tell us also whether the company management in Coventry indicated how many layoffs there would be at the company because the Minister recommended to the workers that they should vote in favour of the package. The workers accepted the assurances given by the Ministers and by the IDA and the commitments that were made.</P>
    <P>The workers have behaved very reasonably in this whole affair. One only had to listen to their trade union representative this morning on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; to understand how reasonable they have been. There has been an ongoing saga at this plant. Last summer, over 40 workers were laid off for an indefinite period. They do not know their fate and that does not instil much confidence in the existing workforce.</P>
    <P>If we are to have a cohesive and coherent industrial policy, it is important that we spell out that policy and make clear to the management of this company that it cannot continue to play around in the manner in which it has with the workers at this plant who have done everything possible to secure it, to turn it around and to make it competitive and productive.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputies for raising this important issue. The Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, is unfortunately absent this evening on official business but he was keen to be here in the House to hear the Deputies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1476" /> As the Deputies know, the announcement by Packard of layoffs of the order of 400 has been a major disappointment. Events over the past 24 hours have been the cause of dismay and confusion among the workforce. This is a difficult industry and the management of the problems in this industry has not been made any easier by the location of key management figures outside the country.</P>
    <P>The company's announcement last Friday in regard to substantial layoffs effective from the end of June was a direct result of a reduction in demand for its wiring harnesses for the remainder of 1995. During the lengthy industrial relations negotiations last December and January, the company indicated that vital business contract deadlines had passed without agreement and that significant business had been lost.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>It was to get other business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I will come to that. The company indicated that layoffs would be unavoidable because of the loss of a single major contract. The management said that contract was one of the major contracts likely to come its way and people were aware of that. Talk of layoffs was not a surprise and no guarantees in regard to employment levels were given. As Deputy O'Rourke rightly said, the agreement was to implement a programme of reform, of re-engineering, to implement the package of measures agreed in the negotiations and to fight for new business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Arising out of the acceptance last January by the workforce of cost cutting measures, I understand from the company that significant progress has been made towards making the plant viable. Packard Electric operates in a very competitive industry within a global market where there is continuing need for productivity improvements. Since January last, efforts by various consultants and <Col N="1477" /> engineering advisers to improve performance and productivity have continued. The workforce has played a full part in this process. For example, it has contributed by working two extra hours per week without additional pay. However, much remains to be done and we would all be happier and more reassured if we knew now what the company further plans to do to achieve the required increase in productivity.</P>
    <P>Last Friday, together with my colleagues, the Minister for Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Taylor and the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, I met representatives of Packard management from both Ireland and the parent company. At that meeting they assured me that the layoff period will be as short as possible and that they will act now to achieve the improvements in operations needed for viability. Like my colleagues, I was very disappointed at the scale of the proposed layoffs. The announcement came as a shock to the workforce. I understand the workforce has taken decisions today in relation to the working hours agreed earlier in the year and propose to revert to earlier working hours after a period of seven days notice. It has also mandated its executive in respect of industrial action if negotiations fail.</P>
    <P>We are clearly at a very delicate point in the solution of this problem at Packard Electric. I ask Deputies to refrain from adding to the heat of the discussions. This is a time for calm. There has been much confusion, particularly as a result of the development last night where there was a request for approximately 720 layoffs immediately following a redeployment.</P>
    <P>It is an improvement that this has been taken off the table and that we are back to the announcement of last Friday. What is needed now is a period of calm. The parties at local level must clarify the issues, where they stand on them and avail of the established industrial relations machinery which has served us well in dealing with disputes of this nature. That is the way forward. Everything must be done to seek to <Col N="1478" /> restore trust between management, unions, and the workforce. I urge both sides to avail of the industrial relations machinery to facilitate an early resolution to the current difficulties. Actions need to be carefully measured to avoid confusion and not to undermine the existing delicate situation and I expect both sides to act in such a manner.</P>
    <P>Last Friday I received an assurance from the parent company representatives that they have a commitment to the future of the Tallaght plant. In this context I would point out that the company gave us a similar assurance last January. It was recognised at the time that competitiveness and profitability were necessary for securing employment and, on the basis of the cost cutting measures, every effort would be made by the company to minimise lay-offs arising from the loss of business.</P>
    <P>It would be helpful if positive action could be taken in regard to the 42 workers who were laid off indefinitely about a year ago. Such a measure would at least help to create a climate for the negotiations on the proposed future lay-offs at the plant and would underline the company's commitment to tackle the current difficulties in a co-operative and constructive way. It is vital that negotiations between management and unions are strongly encouraged to work towards a solution that will alleviate and minimise the difficulties, involved. Obviously I want to see a solution as soon as possible and I fully appreciate the concerns expressed in this House and by the workforce about the future of the company. I assure Members that the Labour Relations Commission, the labour relations machinery and the IDA continue to be available to assist in the resolution of these problems.</P>

It is a time when both sides must look to creating the space for negotiation on a constructive future and I request them to use tried and trusted industrial relations negotiation procedures available from the Labour Relations Commission and from the Labour Court to asist them in the resolution to their difficulties.</P>

      <P>There will be two INTERREG programmes in Ireland, one of which will cover the six Southern Border counties and Northern Ireland and the second will operate between western areas of Wales and the Dublin, mid-east and south-east sub-regions in Ireland. The Department of Finance is the central authority in Ireland which will be responsible for the administration of both programmes in conjunction with its counterparts in Northern Ireland and Wales.</P>
      <P>In so far as the North/South INTERREG programme is concerned, the Deputy will probably be aware that it was agreed by the Commission in late February, and applications for grant assistance were formally invited from the public in newspaper advertisements on 28 April last. The amount of European Union funds set aside for tourism development in the six Southern Border counties is some £10 million over the period up to 1999. The types of activity eligible for support include: natural resources and activity tourism and supporting facilities; heritage and cultural tourism, and joint and co-operative marketing and visitor services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Grant application forms for programme funds are available in Ireland from the Department of Finance, and <Col N="1313" /> grant applications, when completed, will be evaluated by Bord Fáilte and the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht &mdash; as appropriate &mdash; prior to decision.</P>
    <P>In relation to the Ireland/Wales INTERREG Programme, I understand from the Department of Finance that it will be a number of weeks before this programme is agreed by the European Commission following which details of eligible activity will be made publicly available. I am hopeful that the European Union East/West funding budget available to Ireland for the development of tourism and cultural co-operation will be about £4.5 million over the period up to 1999.</P>

    <P>The Government is very much aware of the economic expansion taking place in Vietnam and that its imminent membership of ASEAN and application to join the World Trade Organisation are likely to copperfasten its movement toward open trading economy status. An Bord Tráchtála is currently researching possible opportunities for indigenous Irish companies, especially in the multilaterally-funded services sector. Meanwhile the Government will continue to support closer economic <Col N="1314" /> and trade links between the European Union and Vietnam. Indeed, only last week, I attended the &ldquo;Look it's Ireland&rdquo; promotion in Boston &mdash; a joint initiative, supported by An Bord Tráchtála and the Industrial Development Board in Northern Ireland, which has been running in North America for the past three years.</P>

Examples of this include the publication of a series of 15 market reports covering all the major market and product sectors of interest <Col N="1315" /> to companies on both sides of the Border and a number of joint promotions targeting the subcontracting and giftware markets due to take place in Dublin and Belfast in the autumn.</P>

      <P>The key consideration in deciding on such sponsorship is the contribution the project will make to Irish tourism and its promotion in an international context. Such a contribution can consist of overseas visitors attracted to Ireland to participate in or attend the event itself or of the enhanced projection of Ireland generally as a tourism destination or of specific aspects of the Irish tourism product, to an appropriate international audience.</P>
      <P>Generally, the projects assisted in 1994 are seen as having made a positive and valuable contribution to tourism promotion. Indeed, in a number of instances, for example Jordan Grand Prix, I have decided that support should be continued into the current year.</P>

      <P>Ireland's trade with Botswana is modest but growing, with exports of just over £1 million in 1994. In recent years Irish companies in the services sector have also succeeded in getting consultancy contracts in Botswana. An Bord Tráchtála will continue to monitor this market carefully for suitable opportunities for Irish companies. The Government will continue to support closer economic and trade links between the European Union and the Southern Africa region as a whole.</P>

      <P>The special trading house scheme was set up with the aim of assisting smalland medium-sized firms to exploit their export potential. Twenty-one licences have been issued since the scheme was introduced in 1988, of which eight are actively trading, according to information available to my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the scheme was last reviewed in 1992 figures showed that, while about 20 per cent only of initial projected exports were achieved, over two-thirds were new exports, and that special trading house activities were a significant factor in the creation or securing of 150 <Col N="1317" /> to 200 jobs in small industry. It was recommended that the scheme continue for a further three years, following the incorporation of a number of changes. The scheme is due for review once more. I intend to have this carried out later in the year.</P>

      <P>As I have already stated publicly I am pressing ahead with the implementation of the findings of the Arthur D. Little Review of Bord Fáilte. These envisage, among other things, the registration and grading functions being subcontracted to a third party inspector while maintaining the Bord Fáilte brand. The product approvals function or awarding of shamrocks will, in future be undertaken by industry associations formally recognised by Bord Fáilte.</P>
      <P>In both cases Bord Fáilte will continue to be directly involved in determining the standards to be applied. They will retain responsibility for setting the standards for registration with the consent of the Minister for Tourism and Trade as provided for under the provisions of the Tourist Traffic Acts. In the case of approvals any changes in standards will be subject to agreement with Bord Fáilte.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In general, the existing standards set by Bord Fáilte for registration, grading and approval of tourism products are appropriate for our requirements, taking into account our position as a maturing tourist destination and the competitive pressures within the industry to satisfy tourist requirements. The transfer of the relevant functions from Bord Fáilte will therefore be on the basis of existing standards but I am not, of <Col N="1318" /> course, ruling out changes in the future as required.</P>

      <P>In addition to his other responsibilities, the Minister of State at my Department has responsibility for domestic tourism marketing. In this connection he has, since his appointment, had a number of discussions with Bord Fáilte, Shannon Development, regional tourism managers and other tourism interests on the question of the promotion of the Irish tourism product on the domestic market. He has also raised the subject within the Tourism Council and the marketing sub-committee is to prepare a preliminary report on the future of domestic marketing for presentation to the September meeting of the council.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be well aware of the vital importance of domestic tourism. The revenue generated by domestic tourism amounted to £642 million or 32 per cent of total tourism revenue in 1993. Home holiday business is widely distributed throughout the country, provides the extra business that is vital to the profitability of many tourism enterprises and is a major factor in easing the seasonality problems of the industry. In addition, a recent study on the economic effect of tourism in Ireland has estimated that domestic tourism contributed 1.8 per cent to Gross National Product in 1993 and supports some 24,000 jobs.</P>
      <P>The allocation of responsibility for domestic marketing to the Minister of State is an indication of my commitment to ensuring that the home holiday sector will continue to play an important role in the overall development of Irish tourism.</P>

      <P>Registration of hotels, guesthouses, holiday hostels, youth hostels, holiday camps, motor hotels, caravan and camping sites, approved holiday cottages and holiday apartments is a statutory requirement under the provisions of the Tourist Traffic Acts, 1939-1986. I have no plans to drop or ease this requirement as I remain convinced, after the Arthur D. Little Review of Bord Fáilte, that it serves to ensure a satisfactory standard in accommodation for the benefit of the visiting tourist.</P>
      <P>If, however, the Deputy's question relates to approved accommodation such as bed and breakfast, approval by Bord Fáilte is not a requirement to operate in this sector. It does, of course, confer significant benefits in terms of promotion by Bord Fáilte and the regional tourism organisations at home and overseas and the opportunity to be included in tour operator's programmes. Such benefits should increase as a result of the increased focus on marketing within BFE as part of the organisation's current restructuring.</P>
      <P>Under the new arrangements following the review of Bord Fáilte, the product approvals inspection function will, in future, be carried out by industry associations formally recognised for that purpose by BFE. I hope that this new industry involvement will, in itself, serve to encourage more accommodation providers to become part of the approved accommodation bank.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 25 and 62 together.</P>
      <P>Common-rating agreements, which are essentially inter-airline arrangements, can greatly facilitate tourism growth from long haul destinations and I welcome their development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Already, common rating agreements over London have been in place for a <Col N="1321" /> number of years by Aer Lingus with carriers from Australia, New Zealand and Japan. Last year, as part of a new tourism drive there, these agreements were extended especially in the Australian market to cover more carriers and more fares and, in addition, Cork and Shannon were also common rated out of London. Promotional moneys were specifically allocated by my Department to market these new arrangements in Australia and New Zealand.</P>
    <P>Recently, agreement has, I understand, been reached by Aer Lingus with Emirate Airlines to common-rate Dublin from Abu Dhabi/Dubai/Doha and Muscat with London, Manchester and major European cities and these new arrangements too will be promoted by my the extra funding allocated by my Department for this purpose.</P>
    <P>I am anxious to see common rating arrangements expanded to other long haul markets in line with the objectives set in the special promotional package which my Department has provided. It is, therefore, pleasing to note that Aer Lingus are also in negotiations with partners in Singapore/Bangkok, Hong Kong and South Africa and I am confident that, when these negotiations are completed, they will lead to even further tourism growth, largely from new marketing areas.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 26 and 54 together.</P>
      <P>1994 was a very successful year for Irish tourism. According to recently released CSO figures, overall visitors from North America increased by almost 17 per cent to 474,000. While final figures for US holidaymakers are not yet available, it is estimated that an increase of some 21 per cent was achieved which compares very favourably with the average 8 per cent growth achieved by our competitors. Ireland also reversed its decline in market share for the first time in eight years. This excellent performance was in no small part due to the US Marketing Initiative (USMI) &mdash; a £3 million consumer advertising campaign which was co-funded by the Exchequer, the European Union and the Irish tourism industry.</P>
      <P>In 1995 the regular promotional activity undertaken by Bord Fáilte will again be complemented by additional marketing by the Overseas Tourism Marketing Initiative &mdash; the successor to last year's USMI. This £6.3 million initiative, which is also targeting France, Germany and Britain, involves an additional £2.3 million spend on consumer advertising in the US. I am particularly pleased that the Northern Ireland tourism industry is participating in this year's initiative which is again designed to secure further increases in tourist numbers and revenue in this important market.</P>
      <P>In addition, I recently launched the British Airways Holiday Programme in the US. This programme, in conjunction with Bord Fáilte and CIE Tours, will be promoted to 32,000 travel agents and directly to 750,000 consumers throughout the US. British Airways will be selling holidays to Ireland on its 17 direct services to London and many code sharing services with US Air. It is hoped that this programme will attract an extra 10,000 US visitors per annum over the next three years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Research has shown that the proportion of would-be US visitors to Europe who would make Ireland their <Col N="1323" /> first-choice destination increased from 7 per cent to 11 per cent in 1994. I am confident that Irish tourism is well placed to build on the impressive results achieved last year and that the target of an 11 per cent increase in US holidaymakers in 1995 will be achieved.</P>
    <P>As regards the distribution of American visitors within Ireland, the House will be aware that tourism development at the regional level is a matter for the regional tourism organisations and Shannon Development. However, information from Bord Fáilte indicates that the average American holidaymaker visits at least three regions while in Ireland with Dublin, Shannon and the south-west traditionally being the most popular destinations.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 27, 55 and 65 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The US Marketing Initiative (USMI) was an innovative marketing partnership between the Government and the tourism industry designed to attract additional US holiday visitors to Ireland <Col N="1324" /> in 1994. It involved a £3 million consumer advertising campaign co-funded by the Exchequer, the European Union and the tourism industry. This year's Overseas Tourism Marketing Initiative (OTMI) represents a further development and expansion of the partnership concept pioneered in the USMI and a £6.3 million campaign is currently underway aimed at increasing tourist numbers and revenue from our four most important markets &mdash; the US, Britain, Germany and France.</P>
    <P>The US Marketing Initiative was, indeed, extremely successful. Subject to the publication of the final figures for the US in 1994, it is estimated that an increase of some 21 per cent in US holiday visitors was achieved by Ireland as opposed to the average 8 per cent growth enjoyed by our competitors. Ireland also reversed its decline in market share for the first time in eight years and research has shown that the proportion of would-be US vacationers to Europe selecting Ireland as a first-choice destination increased significantly from 7 per cent to 11 per cent. I am confident that this year's initiative will prove to be equally successful and that significant new holiday business will be attracted to all parts of the island.</P>
    <P>An exciting development this year has been the involvement of the Northern Ireland tourism industry. For the first time ever all the tourism interests on the island have come together in a large-scale programme to market Ireland as a single destination.</P>
    <P>The results achieved to date clearly demonstrate the merits of partnership between Government and industry in the promotion of Irish tourism overseas. The precise details of any future initiatives will obviously be a matter for discussion between Government, the two tourist boards and the industry on both sides of the Border, but it is certainly my intention that this type of industryled initiative should continue in 1996 and beyond.</P>

      <P>I have had the opportunity to meet with Baroness Denton, the Minister for the Economy in Northern Ireland, on three occasions; in February 1995 when the Baroness paid a courtesy call to my office and since then at two public functions which we both attended.</P>
      <P>As I have acknowledged in the House on a previous occasion, our meetings have provided a welcome opportunity to review the developments of recent months and to look ahead to the coming year which we agreed was full of hope and opportunity. Specifically, both of us have expressed our belief that it was possible for the tourism industry, North and South, to greatly increase its revenue within a short period. We also agreed that the international perception of the island of Ireland as a place to visit and to invest has been considerably enhanced as a result of the cessation of violence. When allied to the favourable economic situation which now exists in many of our tourism markets, the economic prospects for people throughout the island are at their brightest for a generation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the measures already introduced to help generate new business is the £6.3 million Overseas Tourism Marketing Initiative, which represents an entirely additional promotional effort to increase consumer awareness of Ireland. It is a private sector led consumer marketing campaign, which will promote the island of Ireland as a single destination in our four most important markets, namely the US, Britain, Germany and France. For the first time, the tourism industry on both sides of the <Col N="1326" /> Border, together with Bord Fáilte and the Northern Ireland Tourist Board, under the Chairmanship of my Department, are participating in the initiative and are selling the island of Ireland as an attractive holiday location. This common approach to marketing Ireland, North and South, is very welcome, and I have no doubt that this initiative, coupled with the existing promotional work being undertaken by the two tourist boards, will deliver additional tourism business to the whole island in 1995.</P>
    <P>At the end of March, Baroness Denton and I announced further plans for joint co-operation in tourism marketing, costing over £500,000 and which the International Fund for Ireland has kindly agreed to support:</P>
    <P>(1) <i>New Holland Marketing Initiative</i></P>
    <P>Both tourist boards, together with trade partners, are currently implementing a new joint consumer advertising programme in Holland which has been identified as a key emerging European market, because of its direct access by air to both the North and the South.</P>
    <P>(2) <i>All-Ireland Heritage/Cultural Marketing</i></P>
    <P>A new initiative, aimed specifically at marketing Ireland's wide and diverse range of historical and cultural attractions in the British and Dutch markets, is being developed through the tourist boards in co-operation for the first time with the Irish Heritage Properties Association, the National Trust in Northern Ireland and the Hidden Ireland organisation. In addition, it is planned to support &ldquo;Heritage Island&rdquo;, the private marketing group, in encouraging British coach and tour operators, who do not at present access the island of Ireland, to offer all-island heritage tour packages.</P>
    <P>(3) <i>Activity Products</i></P>
    <P>Two specific tourism activities have also been identified as suitable for joint promotion. The product marketing group &ldquo;Equestrian Ireland&rdquo; will be encouraged to extend its 1996 portfolio <Col N="1327" /> of tourist riding establishments to Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>A coarse angling marketing programme is also planned involving Fermanagh and Dungannon District Councils and the North West Regional Tourism Organisation in partnership with guest houses and bed and breakfast establishments.</P>
    <P>(4) <i>General</i></P>
    <P>It is hoped that a number of other general and regional marketing initiatives can be developed by the tourist boards in association with public and private sector partnerships during the course of the year.</P>
    <P>President Clinton's US Conference on Trade and Investment in Ireland which will be held in Washington later this month will also be helpful in promoting the island of Ireland as a tourist destination. Exchanges, so far, with the US side have confirmed that tourism is one area which will have a significant presence at the Conference, given its clear economic benefits for all parties and for the island as a whole. My officials are working closely with their Northern Ireland colleagues in this regard.</P>
    <P>Baroness Denton and I have also agreed to meet regularly in the future. We both acknowledge the potential which tourism can make to economic regeneration, job creation and reconciliation between the two parts of the island. Advancing the tourism potential of the island of Ireland is and will continue to be a priority during my term as Minister.</P>

      <Quest>and Minister for Foreign Affairs if he will demand that Ireland's EU partners cease all development and production of anti-personnel landmines in view of Ireland's ratification of the UN Inhumane Weapons Convention and of the cost in human suffering resulting from the widespread use of these devices in many countries.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government fully shares the Deputy's concern at the death and suffering of civilians caused by anti-personnel landmines. Estimates of landmines planted during conflicts around the world range up to 100 million and the devestation caused by these landmines retards the development, rehabilitation and reconstruction of many countries.</P>
      <P>Ireland does not manufacture or trade in any form of landmine and has consistently stated its policy on landmines to be one of support for a total ban on the production, stockpiling, manufacture and transfers of landmines. In accordance with the commitment in the programme <i>A Government of Renewal</i> to work for restraint on transfers of conventional weapons, the Government is actively promoting international action in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy is aware, Ireland recently ratified the UN Inhumane <Col N="1330" /> Weapons Convention, which prohibits the indiscriminate use of mines, in particular in areas where there is a high concentration of civilians. Ireland will therefore be participating, as a State party, at a Conference to review the Convention in Vienna in the autumn. We have participated actively, as a signatory State, in the preparatory work for this conference. We are pressing for a strengthening of the provisions in the convention relating to landmines. In this context we will be urging all countries, including our EU partners, to exercise the maximum restraint in the development and production of anti-personnel landmines.</P>
    <P>Ireland has also supported concerted action on landmines at EU level. An EU joint action on anti-personnel landmines was agreed at the General Affairs Council on 10 April. Under the joint action, EU partners commit themselves to active preparation of, and participation in, the forthcoming review conference. EU member states agree to endeavour to foster the universal nature of the 1980 convention and to strengthen the provisions of landmines, in particular with regard to restrictions or bans on anti-personnel mines.</P>
    <P>Another key element in the joint action is an EU common moratorium on exports of anti-personnel mines. In 1994, Ireland co-sponsored a UN General assembly resolution calling on all states to introduce a moratorium on the export of landmines. The Government therefore welcomes this common EU moratorium as an important measure in helping to reduce substantially the human and economic costs resulting from the use of such devices.</P>

      <P>The representatives of the vocational education committee were advised that the provision of additional clerical and administrative staff would be considered in the context of an analysis of the non-teaching staffing position in the vocational education committee sector generally.

At present, the analysis of the non-teaching staffing in the entire vocational education committee sector is underway in my Department. The claims of County Kildare vocational education committee will be considered in the course of this review.</P>

      <Quest>the reason additional benefits available for invalidity and other pensions are not allowable when the pensioner does not live alone or with other dependent or qualified people; if he accepts that these benefits are available as a consequence of the person being a pensioner; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>Additional benefits such as the free electricity allowance, free natural gas allowance, free television licence and free telephone rental allowance are available only to people who are in receipt of social welfare type pensions and who satisfy the living alone condition attached to those schemes. The purpose of the schemes is to encourage elderly or disabled people who are living alone on limited means to continue to live in their own homes rather than go into residential care. About 200,000 people benefit from those schemes at present at an annual cost of £59 million.</P>
      <P>I should mention that, in relation to the living alone condition, it is not necessary that entitlement should be limited to persons actually living alone. The living alone condition, as currently applied, allows certain persons to live with the pensioner without affecting his entitlement. They include a dependent spouse, children under age 18, or up to 21 if in full-time education, or a carer in the case of an invalid. where the pensioner is over 75 years of age, the allowances continue in place where the living alone condition ceases to be satisfied by virtue of somebody moving in with the pensioner.</P>
      <P>Any proposals to broaden the current application of the living alone condition or to abolish it altogether would have cost implications which could only be considered in a budgetary context.</P>

      <P>I understand that the recommendations with which the Deputy is concerned are those contained in the tourism task force report which was published in October 1992. I am glad to say that many of the key areas which the task force identified as requiring action or attention &mdash; for example, tourism priority in the allocation of European Union funds, marketing and seasonality &mdash; have already been taken account of in the operational programme for tourism, 1994-99, which was launched in September 1994.</P>
      <P>As for the residual recommendations, several of these have been or are being, implemented separate from the operational programme. These include the setting up of the Tourism Council, the establishment of product development groups or companies in a number of niche product areas, the refocusing of Bord Fáilte's functions and the establishment of more appropriate institutional structures for Irish tourism at regional and county level.</P>
      <P>I am also pleased to say that progress has been made in respect of issues which are the responsibility of other Government Ministers. An obvious example is in the area of taxation, while the subject of improved access transport remains a live issue of consultation as between my Department and the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications.</P>

      <P>My Department is progressing a whole range of issues in relation to the implementation of the Arthur D. Little review of Bord Failte, the recommendations of which were accepted by the Government last November. Much progress has been made in restructuring Bord Failte and in divesting its non-core functions.</P>
      <P>In the case of product approvals &mdash; or the awarding of shamrocks &mdash; which covers the bed and breakfast sector, the decision is that the industry associations themselves should undertake this role, subject to formal recognition by Bord Failte. Discussions are ongoing with the various associations in this regard, with the objective of putting in place a new arrangement for later this year on the basis of the existing bed and breakfast standard. However, I want to make it clear to the House that no exclusive right to approve premises is being given to any of the existing associations. Under the new arrangements, I am not ruling out new associations being recognised or different standards emerging over time, in agreement with Bord Failte as this is clearly in line with the A. D. Little review.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the existence of the Family Homes of Ireland and it is open to them to apply for recognition by Bord Failte on the basis of agreeing to apply the existing bed and breakfast standard.</P>
