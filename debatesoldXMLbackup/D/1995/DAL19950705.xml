      <P>Before I raise questions on the Order of Business, will the Taoiseach confirm that he has been in contact with the British Prime Minister, Mr. John Major?  Some time ago he promised to organise six monthly summits with Mr. Major as soon as matters in Westminster had been cleared up. When will the meeting take place?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>On the assumption that I am not creating a precedent I will answer the question.  I have been in touch with the British Prime Minister but it was a personal communication between two individuals.  That is all I will say about it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  On the other question, the House will recollect that at Cannes we left open the possibility of meeting again when the work we commissioned there was completed.  The work is not yet completed and I cannot say when the meeting will take place.  In <Col N="1248" /> any event we agreed in Moscow to hold a summit in September.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for his reply.  I wish to remind him that the previous Government gave the then Opposition a commitment that legislation would be circulated two weeks before it was taken in the House.  This commitment has been breached on a number of occasions in the past week, yet we have co-operated with the Government and agreed to take the legislation.  However, there is no need to rush through the Irish Medicines Board Bill, the Netting of Financial Contracts Bill &mdash; which I presume deals with the Merrill Lynch issue &mdash; and the Industrial Development Bill.  During recent debates on certain issues Government Deputies sat down and used the spin doctors line that there were no Opposition Deputies to contribute.  This happened during the debate on Deputy Dempsey's waste Bill a few weeks ago. If the Government wants co-operation it must earn it.</P>

      <P>Is the Deputy seeking clarification on promised legislation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I am making the point that if the Government honours its commitment we will co-operate in the case of urgent legislation.  I do not want to go through the list but at least ten of the Bills promised by the Taoiseach will not be ready to be taken by the committees during July and September.  Some Ministers have attempted to push through all Stages so that the legislation does not have to go into committee.  One Minister, whom I will not embarrass by naming, succeeded by sleight of hand in <Col N="1249" /> doing this.  The Government must play by the rules and publish promised Bills so that they can be dealt with in a meaningful way.  The Taoiseach does not seem to know about some of these issues.  The Opposition will not be taken for granted and we will co-operate on the basis that the rules are adhered to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We endeavour at all times to give two weeks notice of legislation and when we cannot do so we provide briefings to the Opposition spokespersons to enable them to get up to speed on the subject matter of the legislation during the shorter timeframe. That has been done in the case of all the legislation referred to by the Deputy. Much legislation is being brought forward at this time to ensure significant Committee Stage work for the committees of the House during the summer recess.  We could have published the Bill during the recess but had we done this it could not have been referred to the committee during the recess.  The bringing forward of legislation is telescoped as to time principally to create a volume of useful work for the committees during the Dáil recess.  I am sure the Deputy agrees that this is a sensible course of action to adopt.  In all these cases we are providing briefing to the Opposition spokespersons which hopefully makes up for the failure to give them two weeks to ruminate on the subject matter of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to point the finger at certain Ministers as I do not want to embarrass them but what the Taoiseach has said is incorrect.  In the case of some of the Bills brought forward in the past week the Government requested that we take all Stages in the House &mdash; the Minister had no interest in referring the legislation to the committees.  In future we should follow the honoured rule of the House where the Whips control the business.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair has allowed some latitude in respect of this matter.  We are tending towards debate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>During my time in the House I cannot remember an occasion when the then Government did not need to debate all Stages of urgent legislation during the week or two before the summer recess.  Obviously work needs to be progressed in accordance with certain time limits and one or two items of legislation fall into this category.  This Government is no exception and we need to pass all Stages of urgent legislation. In the case of legislation which is not urgent we either give two weeks notice or give briefings to the Opposition spokespersons.  Very often we give the briefing because we want to put the legislation into committee for the recess.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government's legislative programme is seriously in arrears and extremely inefficiently run in that four Bills with one Minister promised by the Taoiseach some months ago &mdash; the Energy (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, the Carriage of Dangerous Goods Bill, the International Carriage by Rail Bill and the Air Navigation of Transport Bill &mdash; have not yet seen the light of day.  There is gross inefficiency throughout this Administration in bringing forward promised legislation.</P>

      <P>The text of the Energy (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill was approved on 28 June and I expect it to be published very soon.  The International Carriage by Rail Bill is being drafted.  I am not aware of any promise to introduce it before the summer recess and it will not be available until the middle of next year.</P>

      <P>We are all pleased that Mr. Major has secured and consolidated his position.  In the light of the Clegg decision it is important for the Taoiseach to have a meeting with the Prime Minister before September.  I am sure the Taoiseach has not closed off the option of an earlier meeting and I hope one can take place so that the stalemate can be resolved.</P>
      <P>On promised legislation, does the Government intend to bring forward legislation with a view to holding the divorce referendum in November of this year?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to remind the Taoiseach that only some parties have enjoyed the benefit of the briefings to which he referred.  The Green Party, Comhaontas Glas, has not had this courtesy extended to it and he might consider doing so for the next session.  I understand the reasons the Dáil is not sitting tomorrow.  However, the Minister for the Environment was scheduled to answer questions and I would like to know if provision is being made to enable him to answer them on Friday?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No, there will be no provision for question on Friday. <Col N="1252" /> Unfortunately, the decision to adjourn means that questions to the Minister for the Environment are a casualty.  It is not possible to deal with all these situations when one decides, as we did properly, not to sit on Thursday because of the obsequies of Senator Fallon.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to what the Taoiseach said earlier about a number of Bills which are being put through the House in advance of the two week period where briefings are given to Opposition spokespersons, many groups who are interested in all these Bills have not had an opportunity to make their views known to the Opposition and the Government as a result of the publishing of those Bills.  We have read in the newspapers that the Government has fixed up its disagreements on the privilege and compellability of witnesses Bill.  We were told that that Bill would be before the House this session.  Will the Taoiseach indicate if agreement has been reached between the various Government parties, if he has reached agreement with the Attorney General and when it will be before the House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In most cases where briefing is provided for the Opposition on a Bill because it is being introduced less than two weeks after its publication, it is not to enable the Bill to go into committee.  Between Second Stage and Committee Stage there is, of course, an opportunity for Members of the Opposition to consult with interest groups outside the House and, furthermore, there is in the committees' order of reference the possibility for the committee as a whole to invite interest groups to come in and discuss it.  There are ample opportunities for taking outside views. This Dáil works on procedures that are more expeditious in regard to legislation than any previous Dáil and allow more input from outside bodies to the deliberations of the House than was ever previously possible.  That is not solely to the credit of this Government but to the credit of the entire House.  We should recognise that reality rather than convey <Col N="1253" /> the impression that we do our business in a way that does not allow outside input.</P>
      <P>In relation to the compellability legislation, all the disagreements, differences and arguments about that have been settled.  The Bill will be produced during the summer recess and I expect it will be ready for discussion in the autumn.</P>

I pointed out that every Government at every summer recess since 1922 has introduced legislation that needs to be put through before the Dáil rises. There were three instances of that on this occasion.  That is not exceptional.  It will happen next year, the year after and for as long as this House exists.</P>

Will he clarify the status of the <Col N="1254" /> higher education grants Bill?

Other jurisdictions have attempted various legislative measures to deal with white collar crime and these have proven to be not particularly successful but very expensive.  Obviously, care needs to be taken in ensuring that we get the right formulation in regard <Col N="1256" /> to this area of legislation.  Those involved in drafting should not feel bound by any artificial deadlines if they are not satisfied that they have struck the right balance because otherwise we could put the taxpayer to a great deal of expense.  It is the Government's intention to produce this Bill by the end of 1995 but if it is not ready it will not be produced by then.  It will only be produced when it is ready.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;Dutch auction' means a sale of goods by auction in which the price is reduced by the auctioneer until a purchaser is found;&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The previous Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Quinn, undertook, during the select committee's discussion on 17 May 1994 of section 1 of the Casual Trading Bill, 1994, to consider an amendment on Report Stage to provide a definition of the term &ldquo;Dutch auction&rdquo;, which now appears in section 2.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 4, between lines 30 and 31, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(d) selling newspapers, magazines, wrapping paper and other printed matter,</P>
      <P>(e) traditional stall-holders selling fruit, vegetables, flowers or other perishable goods,</P>
      <P>(f) the selling of fish by traditional fishmonger stall-holders or the crew which catches them,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(g) any person whom the local <Col N="1270" /> authority knows to be a traditional street trader until after such time as that person is offered a reasonable location from which to trade.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to repeat the arguments I made on Second and on Committee Stages, but the Minister's arguments on these amendments on Committee Stage were unsatisfactory. The Minister argued that the purpose of the Bill was to devolve powers to the local authorities and that they could then take on the task of assessing who should come under this Bill.  I do not accept that because the Bill has introduced categories of street traders who were excluded up to now.  It is now being left to the local authorities to decide.</P>
    <P>If it is simply a matter of devolving power to the local authorities, the 1980 Bill should stand and certain categories, such as people who sell newspapers, for example, should be excluded.  The harsh provisions, such as the large fines are inappropriate for people, both young and old, who traditionally sold newspapers on street corners.  I also include those who sell team colours outside football matches, etc.  It is unjust and unnecessary to include such people under this Bill.  I do not understand the Minister's argument that he is devolving power to local authorities.  If that was the case, he would not make these changes nor would be introduce these additional categories.</P>
    <P>This Bill legislates for social justice.  I predict as I did on Committee Stage, that the small trader &mdash; the Molly Malone who does not have a pitch from which to trade &mdash; and the woman selling fruit and flowers in the centre of Dublin will bear the brunt of the harsh aspects of this Bill.  For that reason, I will continue to press the case for these people and I will oppose the Bill.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge the Minister has changed some sections substantially and has helped categories of people such as those in Moore Street who met him and made a strong case.  It is only fair to acknowledge the Minister's efforts on their behalf, the changes he has made, <Col N="1271" /> the concessions which I and other Members, who have campaigned for these people, have won and the efforts of those who lobbied the Minister. While I acknowledge the substantial changes which are beneficial to some categories, the heavy fines and harsh provisions in this Bill will be directed against some of the most disadvantaged people in this State.  For those reasons, I will press these amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I tabled similar amendments on Committee Stage which we thoroughly discussed.  Unfortunately, the Minister did not accept the principle that we should either allow the local authority to define what categories should be exempt, or we should specify a range of categories which we thought were important.  A certain number of categories are exempt under section 2.  I table amendments which included the range of exemptions under the 1980 legislation, but the Minister has decided not to accept them.  It is being left to the local authority to make a decision on matters which it considers pertinent.  I would prefer if we, as legislators, made decisions on matters of overriding concern which should be defined here, but the Minister will not accept that.</P>
      <P>Many people will now break the law because the net has been spread too wide.  This means that everyone will have to be licensed and policed.  How will the local authority operate this system? What structural changes and costs will be put in place?  A wide range of activities take place throughout the country during the summer and people sell ice cream and team colours at football matches.  It is impossible to have a licence for such seasonal activities, therefore, I do not know how the local authority will be able to observe, supervise and police these people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am worried about introducing legislation which is not pragmatic or effective in its implementation.  Those who sell <i>The Big Issues</i> on the streets of <Col N="1272" /> Dublin and in most large towns and cities are either homeless or semi-destitute. They get 50 per cent of the proceeds which helps them to make a living.  What will happen to these people under this Bill?  There is a danger that we have widened the definition of casual trading too far.  These people will now be arrested.  How and where the axe will fall is another matter, but many people will go to prison as happened in the aftermath of the 1980 legislation and for the past 15 years.</P>
    <P>While I accept the Minister's argument about devolving powers to the local authority, I would prefer if this legislative body decided on matters of concern to the Minister because then we could have included or exempted certain categories if we wanted to do so. The arguments have been well rehearsed and the Minister is adamant that he will not go down that road.  He accepted some of my amendments and those of other Deputies, but I am disappointed he will not accept this one.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>I argued strongly on Committee Stage for the exemption of certain categories of activities, the selling of newspapers by news vendors who are not the owners of retail properties, the selling of strawberries, of fish on quay sides and of other seasonal products.  I argued strongly for their exclusion and it is regrettable the Minister did not accept the argument.  We would have a much better Bill if at the outset we, as legislators, made a judgment to exclude certain categories of trade.  We have done that regarding certain activities referred to in section 2.  We have excluded selling by Dutch auction which has been clearly defined, selling at a place adjacent to where a person resides or carried on a business and a number of other areas of activity.  I would have more confidence in the effectiveness of this legislation if the Minister excluded the activities Deputies Gregory, Costello and I sought to have written into the Bill.  The principle of devolving power to local authorities is worthwhile provided they are given the personnel <Col N="1273" /> and resources to exercise that power fully in their areas, but that is not the case.</P>
      <P>Nothing draws law more into disrepute then law which is not enforced from the outset.  Sections of this Bill when enacted will be unenforceable.  No matter how hard we try to visit a level of bureaucracy on people, enterprising people will run the risk of breaking the law by putting their products on sale, but inevitably some of them will be caught.  As Deputy Costello said, when the Bill is enacted some of the most innocent categories of people will end up in prison because it will be impossible to police the new by-laws in all cases.  We would have better law and I would be more confident that the Bill would be effective if we decided to exclude the categories to which I referred.  As legislators, there is an onus on us to make and abide by a judgment. As we have failed to do that I am not confident that the Bill will be effectively implemented.  That is disappointing. When it was introduced I thought we had the bones of good Bill, that it was timely and would have beneficial results, but I am not confident about that now.  It is foolish that we will be using a steamroller to crack a nut.</P>
      <P>A good deal of money is being spent on setting up enterprise boards and bottom up development and so on.  Those in small and medium-sized industries agree that the biggest single impediment with which they must deal, after taxation, is bureaucracy.  The level of bureaucracy in this Bill is retrograde.  I regret that the Minister did not see his way to excluding, for example, the sale of newspapers by news vendors.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no problem with the intent of the amendment.  Most of the practices outlined in it will have to be excluded under this legislation or at local authority level.  We do not want street vendors arrested or a tag of illegality attached to their activities and we must decide whether to introduce legislation to cover their activities or to deal with the matter at local authority <Col N="1274" /> level.  The amendment refers to the selling of wrapping paper, newspapers and other items by vendors and we could have excluded vendors selling such items in the legislation.</P>
      <P>I wish to raise a broader point with the Minister regarding the sale of cars on the side of the road.  I hoped there would be a reference in the Bill to this subject.  That activity comes under section 2.  Two offenders in my area who line up 20 to 40 cars daily and display &ldquo;for sale&rdquo; signs on them have avoided being caught, despite provisions covering that activity in various Acts, including the road traffic Acts.  I had hoped this legislation would prevent such practices in residential areas.  Until now the local authority and the gardaí have been unable to prosecute people who park a number of cars for sale on the side of the road.  They are causing a great nuisance, but they seem to get away with it. On the last occasion I spoke I thought that practice would be illegal in future, but I cannot find a reference to it in the Bill.  I am disappointed the legislation does not cover it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to contribute as I chaired the Committee Stage of the Bill and did not consider it was appropriate to comment on it then.</P>
      <P>This is important legislation for the constituency of Louth.  Casual trading has posed a major problem in Drogheda as the main street is blocked virtually daily by people selling all sorts of goods on the footpaths.  Vendors sell vegetables outside vegetable shops where traders must pay fairly high rates to Drogheda Corporation.  Now the traders are selling their vegetables on the footpath outside their shops to compete with illegal traders outside the main shopping centre. Strawberries supplied by shopkeepers from outside the town are being sold by children, many of whom should be at school.  Spanish onions, supposedly grown in vendor's back gardens, are being sold and those traders are getting away with that under the 1980 Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister for introducing the Bill.  He bent over backwards <Col N="1275" /> to deal with many of the problems that arose when it was introduced.  I agree with his approach.  He has been fair in trying to address the many problems raised by the Opposition.  The only way this matter can be effectively dealt with is by local authorities because the problems in Dublin can substantially differ from those in Cork, Drogheda, or Dundalk. Local authority members know how such problems should be dealt with.  On Deputy Quill's point regarding administration, local authorities are better equipped than Dáil Éireann to administer the provisions of the Bill. Their members are familiar with their communities.</P>
    <P>I have been a member of a local authority for more than 22 years and I am sure my colleagues would take into account the problems that are unique to particular areas.  The local authority of which I am a member facilitates people who keep the law.  As legislators our job is to introduce watertight legislation and close off loopholes which might facilitate those who wish to break the law. People who were supposedly growing vegetables and selling their own produce took advantage of a loophole in the 1980 Act.  For the past 25 years two spaces on the main street of Drogheda have been designated trading areas for named fish mongers.  Those spaces were designated by agreement between members of the corporation and there has not been any quibble about them.</P>
    <P>The Minister's proposal is the best way of dealing with the problem.  We cannot introduce legislation that would deal with every difficulty that arises, particularly for those who wish to break the law.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to deviate from the amendments to make a point, lest I do not have an opportunity later. Many retailers have expressed grave concern about the practice whereby people rent hotel rooms or other such places and advertise the sale of carpets, furniture and so on.  They go into towns, <Col N="1276" /> make a killing and then leave.  As a result the ratepayers of the towns suffer. This is somewhat similar to the concern expressed by Deputy Bell but, although it is of a sporadic nature, it is on a larger scale.  Chambers of commerce and groups of retailers have asked me to ascertain if local authorities will have the power to stop such sales taking place.</P>
      <P>I am also concerned about people with large vans and trucks selling expensive carpets and furniture along the side of the road.  They erect large signs stating, &ldquo;Carpets for Sale&rdquo; and people flock in their hundreds to purchase them.  I do not believe that is free trade because in general those people do not pay taxes.  I take the point made by Deputies Gregory, Ahern and Quill about taking a sledge hammer to crack a nut and preventing people from barely making a living, but I am talking about very rich people with large vans selling carpets, etc. on the roadside.  One wonders where the vans or the carpets were purchased.  What control will the Revenue have over such people?</P>
      <P>Before the fall of the previous Government, we had reached an impasse on the type of tax return which might be proffered by such people. Deputies Ahern, Gregory and Costello acknowledged that the Minister met some of the concerns they expressed on Committee Stage and agreed with the mechanism they suggested.  Will this have the opposite effect in the case of suspect traders who do not pay taxes and set up large-scale operations on the side of the road or in hotel rooms and swipe the legitimate and small profits of local traders?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Given the object of the Bill, which is to achieve greater decentralisation, efficiency and flexibility in the regulation of casual trading by local authorities, Deputy Gregory's amendments are not appropriate.  Decisions as to what should or should not be exempt from regulation in individual local authority areas are best left to local government. Local authorities may decide, as <Col N="1277" /> appropriate, to exempt, for example, newspaper sales.  At the end of the day, the decision is best left to the local authorities. The Bill provides for this object under section 2 (4).</P>
      <P>Local authorities are already empowered to delete a class of trading which it previously exempted under their general power to revoke by-laws under the Interpretation Act, 1937.  I regret, therefore, that I am unable to accept the amendment.</P>
      <P>On Deputy Ahern's point, selling by garage owners on a street beside their premises will be subject to the casual trading regulations under the Bill.  They would be only selling to a person at the place where they reside or carry on business that is excluded.  Deputy Ahern will recall that he raised that point on Committee Stage when he asked would it not be more precise to insert the word &ldquo;in&rdquo; instead of the word &ldquo;at&rdquo;.  I have taken legal advice on this matter and was informed that the existing formula should remain, as the substitution of the word &ldquo;in&rdquo; in this exemption would lead to undesirable consequences; for example, selling by the coalman, the milkman and so on would become regulated. I, therefore, propose to leave the exemption as it stands and it meets Deputy Ahern's concern.</P>
      <P>The selling of cars on the side of the road can be an intolerable nuisance in estates and residential areas generally. It will become a matter for enforcement under the provisions of this Bill.  Deputy O'Rourke expressed concern about occasional rather than casual trading. Selling at weekends in hotels, warehouses or wherever is covered by the Occasional Trading Act, 1979.  Enforcement is the responsibility of the Minister for Enterprise and Employment and is carried out on his behalf by the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs.  It is a separate and distinct act and I will be glad to pursue the matter with Deputy O'Rourke at some point.</P>
      <P>I hope we can dispose of these amendments once and for all.</P>

      <P>They will be subjected to the provisions of this Bill by the relevant local authority, as it deems appropriate.</P>
      <P>Deputy Bell made the fundamental point here &mdash; I do not intend to rehearse his arguments &mdash; on which we voted on Second Stage, which is whether Members of the House accept that what we are doing here is devolving these powers to local authorities who, as he said, are best equipped to make such decisions.  I am in no position to say where fishmongers should conduct their business in, say, Drogheda; that is a matter for the relevant local authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have considerable respect for the intelligence of Members on the far side of the House and the older I become the more respect I have for others' intelligence. However, I do not understand some of the more confused blather I have listened to again today.  I am not outlawing selling newspapers or anything else anywhere; that is a matter for the relevant local authority.  Deputy Quill said the principle of devolution is a good one.  Either it is a good principle or it is not; one either believes in devolving power to local authorities or one does not.  It is for the relevant local authorities to deal with these issues.  If they want to exempt newspaper sellers or anybody else they can do so.  It is none of my business.  I presume they will and that life will continue just as it has heretofore in this regard.  As Deputy Bell said, traders who pay their rates and taxes also have rights.  Therefore, it is appropriate that we would regulate <Col N="1279" /> this area and the appropriate body best equipped to know local conditions is the relevant local authority.</P>
    <P>I know Deputy Gregory acknowledged I have effected a number of changes to this Bill consonant with arguments he has been advancing here, but he is almost hopelessly and irrevocably committed to hyperbole when he talks about this Bill legislating for social injustice.  This Chamber is no stranger to hyperbole but that is so fantastic I cannot allow it to remain on the record without comment.  Deputy Gregory accepts I have made beneficial changes for the people who endeavour to eke out a living in Moore Street &mdash; for the Molly Malones he mentioned.  While he may not have had sufficient time to study the Bill thoroughly, I have effected changes here that those Molly Malones could not have anticipated.  For example, instead of a summary fine of £1,000, I am suggesting one of £50 in one of my amendments today.  Another amendment will afford them an amnesty in respect of past convictions which will mean they start with a clean sheet.  I have had discussions with the City Manager and Dublin Corporation to try and provide traders with pitches.  I really do not see what more I can do in the circumstances. The trading community who have premises from which to carry out their businesses and pay rates and other taxes, also have rights and entitlements which have to be acknowledged if we are to maintain any kind of balance, as Deputy Bell advocated.</P>
    <P>Therefore, all that is at stake here is whether or not one believes that devolution is a good principle.  We are here devolving powers to local authorities. Deputies Costello, Quill and others appear to be engaging in St. Augustine-type devolution &mdash; not yet, Lord; we do not want to take these decisions to local authorities.  I believe they should, that it is the most sensible arrangement and strikes a reasonable balance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 6, lines 35 and 36, to delete &ldquo;or the Act of 1980 (other than an offence under section 6 of that Act) during the period of 5 years&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;during the period of 3 years&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In the Committee Stage discussions on section 4 (6) and (7) I undertook to consider for Report Stage concerns raised by some Members, particularly those regarding the five-year ban from holding a casual trading licence following a conviction for an offence.</P>
      <P>I have considered this matter further and have concluded that a five-year ban is unnecessarily harsh having regard to the general nature of casual trading offences.  Therefore, I propose that the five year periods referred to in both subsections be amended to three years which will not seriously diminish their deterrent effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also propose in these amendments to delete the reference to the Casual Trading Act, 1980, the effect of which will be that all casual traders will commence trading under the new regime with clean records.  This measure, while somewhat unusual, is essential to resolve the particular circumstances of a large number of traditional traders in Dublin city who would be unable to benefit for a considerable period from <Col N="1281" /> the more flexible powers of Dublin Corporation and other local authorities under the new regime which will entail licensing under the designated casual trading area system, or licensing under general by-laws for special events.</P>
    <P>It is essential to take this opportunity to deal with the position whereby traders do not qualify for trading pitches, being debarred under the present five-year ban relating to two or more offences.  In this context I have contacted Dublin Corporation and I hope progress can be made on this front.  The proposed deletion of offences under the Casual Trading Act, 1980 is an essential part of the process of resolving this problem.  It constitutes an amnesty for the women affected in respect of whom Deputies Gregory and Costello argued strongly on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I warmly applaud the Minister on these two amendments which reflect two I had tabled earlier, which I regard as key elements in endeavouring to wipe the slate clean for such traders.  We are talking essentially about women who were granted licences from the relevant Department, now the Department of Enterprise and Employment, but who were not designated pitches on which to trade by the local authority.  While they had licences, they did not have the wherewithal to trade and the relevant local authority did not deign to give them pitches on which to trade.  They were then convicted for trading illegally, were constantly harassed, intimidated and, ultimately, imprisoned.</P>
      <P>We must wipe the slate clean in regard to the convictions that had accumulated under the 1980 legislation and which disbarred people from applying subsequently because of them. People will no longer be convicted under the 1980 legislation.  Effectively this will be a new regime under new legislation and the five years referred to in the previous legislation will be reduced to three years for future offences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1282" /> This is an important development which I welcome and I am sure it will be welcomed also by the women who have been trading in the streets of Dublin for generations.  They were penalised and criminalised by the 1980 legislation and have remained in that position for the past 15 years.  Those women will now be able to start afresh as a result of this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not normally given to hyperbole and today will be no exception.  I will explain to the Minister how this legislation legislates for social injustice.  I acknowledge that the Minister met a group of women who had been criminalised by the 1980 Act in the past week and I believe these changes are partly in response to that and to arguments that other Deputies and I made in relation to their particular difficulties.</P>
      <P>I welcome what is, effectively, an amnesty but I am not satisfied with the Minister's amendments.  I am not happy with the three year period for the same reason that I was unhappy with the five year period in the previous legislation. If a person is convicted of illegal casual trading, a penalty will be imposed, they may be fined or imprisoned.  The effect of this section will be to impose an additional penalty on those people; it doubly penalises them.  That goes beyond natural justice and more importantly, the offences they would have been convicted of are trivial in many cases &mdash; selling bananas from a pram.  Yet this provision legislates for denial of that livelihood or, as Deputy O'Rourke described earlier, denied their attempts at maintaining subsistence. The effect of this section will be to deny them their livelihoods for a period of three years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that he reduced the fines to £50 but that is only for the first offence.  For a third offence, the fines are increased &mdash; as they were in the previous Bill &mdash; to £1,000.  The Minister failed to mention that.  This Bill will not be effective against the large scale operators referred to by Deputy <Col N="1283" /> O'Rourke but it will adversely affect the women trading in Henry Street and North Earl Street who live in disadvantaged communities near the commercial centre of Dublin and try to make a few honest shillings to supplement their incomes.  They are the people who will bear the brunt of this Bill and that is why it legislates for social injustice. There is not any attempt in the Bill to provide some degree of protection for people in those special circumstances.</P>
    <P>The motivation behind the Bill is to protect the interests of large businesses. Even when the matter is referred to the local authority, everyone knows that the powerful business interests in Dublin will have far greater influence on the local authority than the small number of women who are only doing what their families before them traditionally did. They are the people who will suffer as a result of the Bill.  If the Minister dismisses my argument as hyperbole, I will be quite happy to come back into this House two years from now &mdash; if the Minister and I are still here &mdash; and debate the effects of the Bill and the people who are suffering as a result.  I am certain it will not be the large operators to whom Deputy O'Rourke referred; it will be those very disadvantaged people living in the centre of Dublin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Gregory does not accept that this Bill has empirical application.  It is not a Bill for Moore Street or for the north Dublin inner city; it applies across the country.  There are myriad complaints about the impact of illegal trading in other parts of the country, although we spent a great deal of time on Committee Stage, and again this morning, dealing with the situation peculiar to the north inner city of Dublin.  Some of the offences may <Col N="1284" /> indeed be trivial but others are not.  In terms of the changes I made and the fines that may be imposed on summary conviction, contrary to some of the arguments on Committee Stage, I requested that investigations be carried out into the fines applied by the courts in recent years.  A total of 90 per cent of the fines imposed by the Dublin District Court since August 1990 for offences under the 1980 Act were less than £50.</P>
      <P>The segment of traders trading illegally in Moore Street do not have pitches.  They do not have licences either because many of them have convictions. It is wrong for Deputy Gregory to argue that those traders will be penalised as a result of this Bill.  It is open to him to argue that they are being penalised under the existing legislation but this Bill will improve their position.  I am quite sure that the large business interests will be very unhappy with those improvements.  I regret, therefore, that I cannot go any further than I have gone in this regard.  In answer to Deputy O'Rourke's question, it is the local authority concerned.</P>

      <P>In page 7, to delete lines 12 to 16.</P>
      <P>This amendment refers to the direction to the local authority that upon the grant of a casual trading licence the local authority concerned shall notify the Minister for Social Welfare in writing of the name and address of the person to whom the licence was granted. I oppose this on principle because it is unnecessary and, more important, it is discriminatory.  I know of no other legislation that contains such a provision. Landlords make millions of pounds from this State in rent subsidies and the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners have great difficulty in obtaining information about that, yet we include this special provision in legislation which will impact on people who are among the poorest in this State.  It implies that such people are guilty of something when they are simply doing what the State should have done by giving them an adequate income.  They are on social welfare and, according to the report of the Commission on Social Welfare many are living on inadequate incomes.  They are merely attempting to supplement their incomes and to single them out as targets for this type of innovation is discriminatory, unjust and unnecessary.</P>

      <P>I also have difficulty with this section and tabled an amendment on Committee Stage to try to do something about it.  What is involved is compulsory notification and, to my knowledge, no such provision exists in any other legislation.  If we are to be even-handed about this it should be a matter for the Department of Finance and the provision should be included in all legislation I am concerned that it is in legislation which will impact on poor people that we tried to include a provision providing for compulsory notification in relation to tax clearance certificates &mdash; which, thankfully, has been deleted &mdash; and compulsory notification <Col N="1286" /> of the Department of Social Welfare. The implication is that this category of people would avoid paying taxes and would break the law on social welfare. We should have one law for all the citizens. If the Minister intends to persist with this he should consult the Minister for Finance and request that the principle be established across the board.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>It must be borne in mind that my colleagues are talking about a category of casual traders who, for one reason or another, have been operating illegally.  Social welfare consolidation Bills since the formation of the State have not allowed for people doing casual work of any kind.  People who engage in casual work are not paid social welfare for that working period. That applies to casual traders, casual fishermen, people doing casual work on building sites, etc. all of whom are said to be supplementing low incomes.  I agree that social welfare incomes need to be supplemented and would like to see higher social welfare payments.</P>
      <P>Our job is to legislate for people who keep the law; we cannot condone breaking the law whatever category people belong to and whatever their income.  It is not true that employers are not obliged to pass on information about social welfare.  All employers are obliged by law to indicate to the Department of Social Welfare who they employ, how much money they earn and what has been deducted from their pay.  That has to be done under pain of heavy penalties.  Only recently I dealt with a social welfare case relating to a man who was working in a bookie's shop marking up a result board while in receipt of social welfare.  He was reported by one of the punters and fined £10,000.  The law must protect people who are in receipt of social welfare and those who are paying for social welfare.  Otherwise the people who work legally and pay their taxes would have to pay the people who work illegally and operate outside the law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand the concerns of my two colleagues, but the people I speak of <Col N="1287" /> operate illegally on the main streets of my town, pay nothing to the State, take everything from it and also draw social welfare.  Everybody, rich and poor, must pay their fair share in accordance with the law.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>The requirement in subsection (12) to provide information to the Minister for Social Welfare regarding licences issued under the Act is a specific requirement contained in the Government decision approving the general scheme of the Bill.  I do not, therefore, propose to accept this amendment.</P>
      <P>In this connection the Department already provides to the Department of Social Welfare information on all casual trading licences issued on a regular basis.  This is a statutory requirement arising from section 31 of the Social Welfare Act, 1988 which provides for the exchange of information between the Minister for Social Welfare and the Revenue Commissioners and with any other Government Minister.  Section 5, as amended in Select Committee, in any event requires that a person's licence number be displayed at the place where he or she is trading.</P>
      <P>There is nothing new about this.  It is wrong to imply that this is the result of this Bill.  It is like the charges I was subjected to that it will be the end of Moore Street, of the &ldquo;Molly Malones&rdquo;, of the &ldquo;Echo&rdquo; boys, of strawberries at Wexford, of the Puck Fair of Killorglin, of the Connemara Pony Show, of religious objects being sold at Knock, and all of the other things.  Deputy Gregory could have the people concerned being asked to produce tax clearance certificates, which happens elsewhere.  I did, indeed, discuss it with my colleague, the Minister for Finance, who initiated the Bill and this section of it.  The alternative is to produce tax clearance certificates. Deputy Gregory has convinced me it is not practical to require the category of people we are talking about to produce tax clearance certificates.  I accept that.</P>

      <P>Section 2 is included to remove any doubt as to the liability for a domestic water charge.  The section specifies that the consumer is liable for such a charge.  In relation to the specific question raised by the Deputy, it was felt, after much consideration that the vast majority of consumers, who are liable for a charge and who had a charge levied on them by the democratic decision of the local or sanitary authority concerned, will pay.  There will be no significant cost involved in the implementation of the measure.</P>

      <P>In page 4, subsection (5), line 24, to delete &ldquo;a charge&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;the charge&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Section 3 (5) provides that a sanitary authority shall not discontinue a water supply in any case where a full or part waiver of a charge has been granted. The purpose of this technical amendment is to avoid any ambiguity or doubt which might arise in a case where a consumer was granted a waiver in the past but was not granted a waiver in respect of the specific charge which is now the subject of the sought discontinuance of supply.  The amendment will ensure that a local authority is empowered to disconnect a water supply in respect of an unpaid water charge if a waiver was not granted in respect of that specific charge.</P>
      <P>For example, if somebody who was unemployed applied for a waiver and was granted it in a specific year and in the following year he or she was in full employment and was not granted a waiver, the fact that a pervious waiver had been granted would not affect the right of the sanitary authority to seek a disconnection of supply in respect of the properly levied new charge.</P>

      <P>I have no difficulty with the amendment.  I wondered why the provision was included as it appeared to open the door to the possibility that somebody who was granted a waiver in times of hardship would gain some benefit from it when their circumstances changed.  I accept the amendment.</P>
      <P>In the context of the Minister's deliberations on this area, did he receive a breakdown from local authorities of the number of people whose water supply was discontinued?  Did he receive a breakdown of the criteria used by local authorities in this regard?  During the Second Stage debate, the Minister was at pains to indicate that local authorities were fair minded with regard to these provisions.  Nonetheless, he thought it necessary to make some changes.  Did the Minister have information on the extent to which this provision was being used by local authorities?  Why did he feel it necessary to include this measure?</P>
      <P>As the Minister is aware, approximately 500,000 householders are liable for service charges.  I understand about 900 people had their water supply discontinued last year by local authorities. This represents less than 0.2 per cent of those liable for charges.  If this provision does not apply to 98 per cent of those involved, the Minister must have some extremely good information from a variety of local authorities which would enable him to push forward the provisions in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for supporting the amendment which sets about removing any possibility of ambiguity in relation to the intent of the measure.  This legislation is not earth shattering.  Its intention is to provide clarity in relation to the controversial issue of local authority charges.  All Members who have served at local and national level are aware this area has been fraught with difficulty.  The measure will have a number of positive consequences.  It will provide a national <Col N="1291" /> framework in which every local authority will know where it stands.  More importantly, consumers will know where they stand.  They will be aware of the powers of local authorities and there will not be differences in the implementation of powers which, as the Deputy correctly points out, has been the case heretofore.  The vast majority of consumers will continue to pay charges as levied on time.  This is the nature of the system and as it should be.</P>
      <P>As I indicated on Second Stage, the announcement of this measure and its implementation by circular letter earlier this year has had no adverse impact on the collection rates of lawfully levied charges.  As I indicated to several Opposition Deputies in respect of their counties, the level of charges received by local authorities to date is an increase on the level available this time last year. The measure brings transparency and clarity in relation to this entire issue. Regarding the Deputy's specific questions, the number of disconnections carried out by county councils and county borough corporations in 1994 amounted to 910; one can work out the proportion from the total number of approximately 480,000 households.  A very small number of households were disconnected for non-payment of charges.  This indicates that the issue is not of huge significance. I do not envisage that they will resort in large numbers to the courts.  That is why I indicated to Deputy Smith previously that local authorities will not incur a significant increase in costs arising from this provision.  However, local authorities will now be certain as to were they stand and the procedures to be followed. Consumers also will be more certain of their rights and of the consequences of not fulfilling their responsibility to meet lawfully levied charges when they clearly have an ability to meet them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is aware of the reluctance on the part of local authorities to go to court on these issues, not least because of the costs <Col N="1292" /> involved and the administrative and other delays.  Generally, local authorities use court proceedings as a last resort and that is what is advocated for the future.  The difference of opinion arises because local authorities will no longer have the power to disconnect water supplies in the former manner &mdash; not that it was exercised but they had the capacity to issue the threat.  This procedure was exercised as a last resort but that is the fundamental difference.</P>
      <P>There is a comparison between the collection rates this year and last year, but I do not think the problems arise in the first half of the year.  When the procedures are put in place there will be a three months period during which the obligations to issue reminders and so on under this Bill will have to be met.  Local authorities will not be in a position to take action on foot of the provisions before he end of the year.</P>

      <P>I wish to clarify a number of points.  When this Bill is enacted what additional powers will be given to local authorities?  Last year there were 910 disconnections so, clearly, local authorities had the power to disconnect, which is done when every other effort has failed.  That is the way it has been to date and the way it ought to be.  I am satisfied it would continue if this legislation were never enacted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is difficult to accept that local authorities will not face an additional cost when these new procedures are put in place.  Under the provisions of the Bill six very clear steps will have to be undertaken before a local authority can proceed to disconnect.  Will some of the moneys paid by compliant citizens to provide better public services be eaten <Col N="1293" /> up in covering the cost of the bureaucracy as a result of the enactment of this Bill?</P>
    <P>Will there be uniformity in all local authorities?  Some local authorities, notably my own, have never disconnected the water supply, but a previous Cork city manager proceeded to bring an action against five people who clearly were in a position to pay their water charges but consistently refused to pay and this resulted in five people being imprisoned in Cork prison.  I think that is very undesirable.  Do city managers still have the option to disconnect or to send people to prison for non-payment of moneys due?  I favour the disconnection option which, as I already said, only happens when every other method has failed.</P>

      <P>The provisions of this measure were signalled at the formation of the Government and were part of the negotiations to form it.  They were implemented by way of circular from my Department in April and have already taken effect.</P>
      <P>In response to the question on what effect the measures had on collection rates, the collection rates across the country are uniformly high and are mainly better than last year.  In fact, one of the most dramatic increases &mdash; I am sure it has nothing to do with the change of Minister &mdash; has been the dramatic improvement in the collection rate in Tipperary North Riding where in the period January-March 1994 the local authority collected £66,918 in domestic service charges and for the comparable period this year, £144,884.  The new regime has not adversely affected the collection rate and when this Bill is enacted by the Oireachtas it will be put on a statutory basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People question whether those who do not pay their charges get away with it.  Now we are setting out the procedures clearly and the warning on the power of disconnection can be given as part of a reminder process.  The person is issued with a notice to pay the water charges, then sent a reminder and a <Col N="1294" /> warning and a further reminder, a warning and, finally, notice is served to pay their charges or face court action.  That is a reasonable series of measures and in this era of computerisation it is hardly terribly onerous on local authorities to issue these notices.  It will be an effective mechanism for ensuring there compliance.</P>
    <P>Under this Bill, local authorities will not have additional powers but I hope there will not be a situation where two or three counties resort to disconnect water supplies in great numbers whereas other local authorities will decide that disconnection will never be used in their functional area, leading people to say that disconnection is a matter of geography.  There is a need for a national policy and I am legislating for it.  I do not believe these procedures will impose a significant additional cost on local authorities as they can factor this into the normal billing system.  I do not believe that they would resort to cutting off the water supply without giving sufficient warnings.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>The problem for local authorities is that they do not know how many warning notices they should give, whether it should be ten or one.  I am setting out what is appropriate and not alone local authorities but consumers will know that after the statutory provisions of the Bill have been enacted, there will be a procedure whereby if they are in a position to pay charges lawfully levied on them and refuse to do so, they can be disconnected in accordance with this Statute.  It clarifies matters for the consumer and for the local authority.  A system can be put in place that will not place an onerous burden on local authorities and that is what is happening in any event.  I am concerned about jailing consumers for the non-payment of charges.  This is not appropriate from the justice perspective. There are enough criminals who should be in jail and the time of the court and the prison system should not be wasted <Col N="1295" /> in jailing these consumers.  This is a much better system and it has been arrived at through a process of negotiation. I have already discerned that it has broad acceptance among the community and the increase in the rates collected is the surest evidence of this.</P>

I am not saying I did not attempt to do the same &mdash; as a democrat one must accept measures with which one disagrees &mdash; but the Minister is doing a good job in presenting this measure as something which it clearly is not.</P>
      <P>It is outrageous to compare the position in Tipperary this year and last year as obviously the tax incentive will have been availed of by compliant taxpayers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Local authorities are also giving incentives to encourage early payment in an effort to offset other financial problems.  I have made it clear from the outset that I do not envisage a problem during the first six months. Rather I envisage problems at the end of this year and early next year when a significant number of people will have recourse to the courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is not only about the payment of rates.  As the Minister well knows, this is a political matter in a number of constituencies. A small but dominant <Col N="1296" /> element in the Government has advocated the abolition of service charges and has advised its supporters not to pay them.  This is why many people who can well afford to pay service charges do not pay them.  Regardless of how it is camouflaged or presented, this measure will encourage non-compliance by those who have fought against the payment of service charges for the past ten years. Given the increase in the number of households paying charges each year, many of us believed that the debate about this issue had begun to die down. The Minister is pondering to a minority by dealing with the issue in this way.</P>
    <P>I want to make it absolutely clear that we are dealing exclusively with people who can afford to pay these charges. Hardship cases should be dealt with in as careful and compassionate a way as possible.  I acknowledge that local authorities do this for the most part but there may be cases where they can do better.  We are dealing exclusively with people who do not want to pay a percentage of the cost of local authority services.  Section 3 will encourage non-compliance and I forecast a significant increase in court cases by the end of the year.  The courts are already clogged up and we do not need additional measures which will give rise to more cases.  If local authorities cannot obtain these funds after exhaustive efforts then it is much better to disconnect the water supply rather than fill the prisons with people who oppose the payment of charges on a political rather than a resource basis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>This measure will not encourage non-compliance, as evidenced from the increase in collected charges since it was put in place by way of circular letter.  Obviously history will prove which one of us was correct.  I am grateful to the Deputy for praising the tax incentive introduced by the Government to deal with a significant area of concern.  For good or ill many people believed that when local charges and rates were abolished they were subsumed into central Government taxes.  It <Col N="1297" /> is important to give people who pay a local charge some amelioration or reduction in their central tax bill.  This is a fair and good measure and it will boost the collection rate.</P>
      <P>On the general point about a party's principled decision to oppose service charges, this is legitimate and valid.  We live in a democracy and political parties are entitled to express their point of view.  The Deputy knows better than most of us the precarious situation in regard to local government funding.  In the time available to me before the next election &mdash; the electorate and others will decide whether I am a Minister in the next Government &mdash; I will try to address the issue of local government funding. This measure will not impact one way or the other on whether we want to fund a local government system.  I happen to believe we do and the Government has taken a number of initiatives to drive this process.  I hope the Deputies and parties opposite will engage in that process. In the next few years we have to decide whether we want to fund and have an effective local government system or whether we are content with the present system which is not in accordance with the norm in the rest of Europe and is not in the best interests of administration in the State.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>We will not have an opportunity today to have a full debate on the best way to fund local authorities in the future.  This is a vexed and difficult question and it will take some time to resolve.  Fianna Fáil will be extremely anxious to contribute to this debate.  I attended a public meeting last weekend in connection with the condition of county roads in the Sliabh Felim area, Kilcommon and Rearcross, in the constituency of north Tipperary.  The Minister is aware that the local authority provision for county roads is heading for a crisis.  This is the only service many people obtain from a local authority, many of whom are using roads which are unacceptable and resources will have to be provided on a priority basis. It is unfair that many people have to <Col N="1298" /> suffer because of the condition of the roads.  School buses are rerouted and people have to tolerate all kinds of inconveniences, including damage to their vehicles.  This problem has been growing for some time.  Significantly increased resources have been provided by the State but they are not sufficient to meet the need.  There would be all party agreement if this money were made available, regardless of where the resources come from.  People living in areas where there are poor roads are entitled to a decent roadway on which to travel to work, to church, to the shops, to schools, etc.  It is a shame that we are not providing such a service.</P>
      <P>The Minister has indicated to the House the amount of money that will be available this year.  I am willing to wait until the end of the year to discuss this matter in greater detail with him.  Will he give a breakdown by local authority of the 900 disconnections and court actions that were taken and will he tell us if a small number of local authorities opted for going to court as distinct from disconnection?  It appears that those local authorities which took the option of disconnection were more successful, had lower costs and were equally sensitive to ensuring that action would be taken only where people had the resources to pay.  Has the Minister available figures for local authorities which took either procedure, that is taking an individual to court for non-payment of service charges or disconnection?  My information is that no local authority was involved in either a court procedure or a disconnection unless the household income was sufficient to meet this requirement.  It would be helpful if we had figures which would give us an idea of the underlying strategy behind these provisions.</P>
      <P>The Minister underestimates local authorities, county managers and county secretaries if he believes they would require a legal instrument to adopt legal procedures.  They are aware they would be required to send notices, reminders&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and an official.  To try to tell us it is essential to have these provisions laid down in this way before he could be sure local authorities would take appropriate action would undermine confidence not only in the management of local authorities but it would be absurd in the context of the history and experience we have with local authorities not only in legal matters but in other areas.  When the circular was sent out indicating that the new measures would be enacted, the Minister admitted that that was probably happening at that time.  This would lead us to the view that the provision was unnecessary.  It is fair to say that local authorities would be in a position to make these judgments themselves.  If we are talking about true democracy and local democracy it would mean less interference where each county and region would express itself in its own way.  However, there can be differences.  There is nothing fundamentally wrong with one local authority adopting a different procedure from another.  Future reports on local government reform may contain this type of proposal.  The same law must be applied everywhere but discretion for local authorities is a valuable asset.</P>
      <P>I am anxious to ascertain what information the Minister has on the variation between local authorities and which of the options they adopt, disconnection or court action, and if additional funds will be provided.  I am willing to bet that nobody who has resisted or has been advised to resist the payment of service charges by Democratic Left has paid those charges on foot of the income tax incentive, legal provisions or letters. Deputy Lynch said last week she was totally opposed to service charges.  I presume she pays her own service charges but probably does not mind if some of her supporters go to jail.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I made my position on local authorities clear at the conclusion of Second Stage this morning.  I have the <Col N="1300" /> highest regard for the officials at local authority level.  They have acted reasonably in the past and I made no bones about that.  There is nothing wrong with wanting to have a measure that sets out for local authority officials and the consumer what we regard as an acceptable procedure, whether that procedure is already the norm or not.  We should set down guidelines telling the county manager whether two or 22 notices is adequate.  The guidelines have been provided and are to be incorporated in statute.  That is fair and reasonable and will strengthen rather than diminish local authorities.</P>
      <P>I am largely in agreement with the point made by the Deputy about a common rule of law across the country. However, it must be a part of the whole issue of local democracy and local autonomy that there would not be a common rule of law in every detail operating in every separate local authority. There will be regional and county variations which will be tailored to suit the needs of the county or region, and that is understandable.</P>
      <P>As more authority is devolved to local authorities &mdash; as I have already done in relation to taxis and hackneys &mdash; there will be different attitudes from different local authorities in relation to the licensing system.  There will be differences but there are some issues on which there should be a common approach nationally, one of which is the right of access to water.  One's right to access to water should not be arbitrary depending on the geographical area.  That is being put right by statute.  Deputy Smith asked a specific question about the data available.  I do not have a breakdown for every household in the country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Figures for 1994, the latest year for which data are available, indicate that 910 disconnections were carried out last year by County Councils and County Borough Corporations, the bulk of which was in two counties. <Col N="1301" /> Kildare County Council carried out 265 disconnections; 150 in Meath; 85 in Donegal and 70 in Westmeath County Council.  The figures for the remaining counties were relatively small.  The fact that one county council accounts for the bulk of disconnections, 265, reflects the attitude of the local county manager in pursuing debts.  It would be of benefit if consumers knew that there is to be a common approach and common procedures.</P>
      <P>The autonomy of local authorities is not affected by this legislative measure. They can decide in the first instance whether a charge should be imposed and if there should be a waiver scheme. It would also be a matter for them to follow up.</P>

Even the extremists in the Labour Party could not accept this.  Deputy Ferris and Deputy Ryan are shocked.  In deference to democratic procedures, they are prepared to remain quiet and allow me to expose the weaknesses in the Minister's arguments.  I hope for the remainder of the debate he will deal with reality and not seek to support a Bill which has nothing to do with access to water.</P>

      <P>A sum of £50 million is being raised by way of service charges.  This forms an essential part of local authority finances and is used to keep the water flowing through the tap. To represent it as other than that beggars description.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has coaxed me to enter the debate.  There are varying views on the subject of water charges and the disconnection of supplies. I am a member of two local authorities and the number of disconnections in south Tipperary is probably <Col N="1302" /> the lowest in the country.  Let me give the example of a social welfare recipient who applied for and was granted maximum relief.  The water charge at the time was £5 per year.  The following year he received a bill for £120 but, because of an inability to grasp the seriousness of the matter, ignored all notices with the result that his water supply was cut off.  If this Bill had been in place this would not have happened. As he was unable to meet the cost of reconnection &mdash; the local authority refused to do this &mdash; a charity was asked to do so.</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned that the local authorities retain much control.  This was provided for in the Bill which allowed local authorities to impose charges in urban areas.  That is the reason some authorities have not imposed a charge.  This has created many problems in counties where charges have been introduced in urban areas, although such charges have always been payable in rural areas and a waiver scheme is operated.</P>
      <P>The Minister should try to ensure uniformity, particularly when it comes to the operation of a waiver scheme.  There are different interpretations even within counties.  Some authorities were on the point of being disbanded because certain people with responsibilities, including well known people in my own constituency, used this matter as a stick with which to beat the other members of the council into submission.  They were not prepared to accept responsibility even though they held prestigious positions.</P>
      <P>Factors, such as inability to pay, should be taken into account.  Social welfare recipients and the elderly in particular should be exempt.  Elderly persons in their seventies and eighties will not qualify where a son or daughter in receipt of social welfare is living with them, although, in many instances, the son or daughter concerned contributes little, if anything, to the household budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Social welfare recipients with a number of children do not qualify for relief <Col N="1303" /> because the figure is pitched at either £100 or £115. This means that a person on the dole with five or six children has to pay the charges.  There are, therefore, major anomalies in the system.  When the charges were first introduced the then Minister indicated that social welfare recipients should be granted relief. This was taken to mean that social welfare recipients with children would be exempt and that household income would not be the sole criterion.</P>
    <P>The Minister will confirm that the collection rate for my county is one of the highest in the country, but there are anomalies in the waiver scheme.  I ask the Minister to address the matter on a countrywide basis so that people in County Tipperary will not feel aggrieved if people in County Dublin are not asked to pay water charges or if social welfare recipients in County Wexford are treated differently.  It should be recognised that this is an essential service which has to be paid for until the overall question of local authority funding has been addressed.  Until then we will have to cater for those who cannot afford to pay.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Ferris has made a fair point, but it is one which will have to be addressed at local level.  Since we started business this morning we seem to have been doing things which are contradictory.  The Minister who steered the Casual Trading Bill through the House was in favour of devolving all powers.  In this Bill power has already been devolved.  It will be difficult to decide how much direction we, as legislators, should give to county and city managers who should have discretion in administering the waiver scheme within certain guidelines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Ferris that it can be the source of great resentment when it emerges that service charges are not imposed in a particular local authority area and, as a consequence, some people may not pay them.  It is a source of resentment that no charges have been <Col N="1304" /> payable in Dublin city, for example for a number of years.</P>
    <P>There is increased awareness that service charges must be paid.  I do not know which factor has led more and more people to this conclusion.  When people travel abroad on holidays they see that services are organised to a high standard in towns and cities where there is a system of local taxation which is spent providing a decent local service.</P>

The connection of 4 Harcourt Street with Edward Carson is a matter of some debate.  However, I accept that it is of historic significance.</P>
      <P>This matter was raised on the Adjournment in November, 1993 and the then Minister of State, Deputy Pat the Cope Gallagher, told the House that he intended to ask the Office of Public Works to inspect the building with a view to recommendation for its protection under the National Monuments Act.  That inspection took place.  It showed that there had been a considerable deterioration of the building. However, I agree with the Deputy that there was some destruction which could only be attributed to vandalism.</P>
      <P>Since then, there has been a resolution of the matter which was appealed to An Bord Pleanála.  An Bord Pleanála concluded in support of Dublin Corporation. I am asking the Office of Public Works to make a specific recommendation taking into account, as a policy decision, the historic significance of the building.  That will afford the building protection.  Issue of acquisition and preservation come later.  I also understand that Dublin Corporation, in the context of its work on revising its plan, is considering regarding the status of the building in its own list.  Both of these developments will be of positive assistance.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for that positive reply.  With regard to the peace process, would it not be a positive idea if the Minister could have discussions with his counterpart in the North in the hope that perhaps another building of historical significance on the Nationalist side could be restored and conserved at the same time, bringing both Nationalist and Unionist opinion together on both sides of the Border?  I know it is a cultural matter but there is also a political significance.  It would be a positive move and I ask the Minister to consider this.</P>

      <P>There are warm relations between myself and my counterpart in Northern Ireland, Michael Ancram.  We had a positive discussion in London recently on co-operation on heritage matters.  Perhaps there is a small irony in the matter we are discussing this afternoon.  The late Edward Carson was not anxious to claim No. 4 as his birthplace but he did not deny it either.  Dr. Paisley showed more enthusiasm for recognising this birthplace than Mr. Carson ever did.  That being so, I will certainly bear the Deputy's suggestions in mind in future meetings with Lord Ancram.</P>

      <P>I understand that there has been some recent press coverage of the site known as Dunrally Fort in the townland of Vicarstown, County Laois, and the National Museum of Ireland is currently preparing a report on a recent survey of the site.  They will transmit this report to the Monuments and Historic Buildings Service.</P>
      <P>When this report is assessed by the service, a decision will be made as to the protection to be afforded to the monument under the National Monuments Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister could clarify this matter for me.  I have been told Dunrally Fort has a fort with an outer ring &mdash; it can sometimes be referred to as a citadel.  I am also told that the inner fort is protected but the outer citadel has not yet been given State protection.  Does the Minister believe that such protection should be given, as I believe it should, and does he have any information from the Office of Public Works with regard to such protection?</P>
      <P>Does the Minister believe there is a likelihood of any trial excavation?  This can be done, as I am sure the Minister is aware, through a non-disturbance survey or by digging trial trenches across the ditches.  I am told this would help to date the fort and would confirm the views expressed.</P>
      <P>Could the discovery programme be implemented in this case?  The personnel involved in the programme are moving onto another period and perhaps it would be an opportunity for the discovery programme to look into this particular fort.</P>

      <P>One could also conclude that the protection which was afforded previously by way of designation is not inclusive enough.  Mr. Kelly is the person associated with the description of the find and John Mass, his collaborator, has worked on the analysis of annals.  Mr. Kelly is the main person who has spoken about the find.  It would be exciting if the find proved to be as good as has been reported.  However, this will require confirmation and excavation.  In the short term, it is important to complete the report and protect the site adequately, not just to protect that about which there is archaeological certitude but also what has been hypothesised in the recently reported find.  I am inclined towards that and I will act as soon as I receive the report.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand from the writings of Mr. Kelly and Mr. Mass that this is a particularly exciting find which could well give us valuable information about other Viking centres.  I am sure the Minister will be aware that this the 1200th anniversary of the first Viking raid on Ireland and perhaps this year might be an appropriate year for such excavation.  However, my question relates to the protection of the site and helping to support the landowner in question.</P>
      <P>The Minister has said that there is a necessity to protect the site and I agree with that.  Would he not agree that because of the number of sightseers interested in this site, there is some worry about the potential damage to the site and the difficulties that may face the landowner with regard to liability insurance?</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;towards the significance of the site, has been anxious to protect it and has resisted suggestions of land reclamation which would have damaged the site in the past before its significance was fully adverted to, hypothetically at least, by the field surveys of Mr. Kelly or the analytic work of John Mass.  That is welcome because I am aware of land reclamation in other sites of different periods which is damaging the sites.  We should bear that in mind. I would be anxious to act as quickly as the report is available but we should follow the procedure that exists, have the report to which I referred to obtained as quickly as possible and take action without delay.  I can assure the House that I, on behalf of the Government, am grateful for the attitude of the landowner in question which is highly cooperative.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht</askee>
      <Quest>his views on the assessment of the current state of art organisations in Ireland as outlined in the Arts Plan executive summary stating that most organisations are stretched to the limits of their capacity, both in resource and human terms, and staying afloat only by personnel accepting lower salaries, relying on FÁS schemes and otherwise cutting corners.</Quest>
      <QRef>[4685/95]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree generally with the assessment of the current state of arts organisations in Ireland, as outlined in paragraph 3.3.4 of the executive summary of &ldquo;The Arts Plan 1995-97&rdquo;.  I expect that implementation of the measures identified in the plan will over <Col N="1311" /> time ensure that professional arts organisations have appropriate levels of properly remunerated management.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister accept that the picture as painted by the Arts Council in its three-year plan of most art organisations staying afloat only by personnel accepting lower salaries, relying on FÁS schemes and otherwise cutting corners paints a grim picture for the future?  Would the Minister also accept that in this year alone there has been a significant reduction in the number of FÁS workers available generally throughout the country?  If that reduction were to be applied to the arts centres, would he accept that the whole art edifice would fall like a house of cards?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be as forthright as I can on these points.  There has been a massive explosion of interest in arts activity.  It is also true to say that many of the arts organisations did not receive adequate provisions in the past.  This year the Arts Council will receive £16.25 million.  It was £10.1 million when I became Minister.  We are dealing with a pent up demand and conditions of work which I recognise are not acceptable. We have to move towards an improvement in that.</P>
      <P>An Chomhairle Ealaíon did provide a once off grant in 1994 of £100,000 to improve professional arts organisations. In addition to that, there was a survey of the management needs of the cultural industries and arts sector.  Both of these indicate a desire to get to a point where one would have good management in proper employment conditions.  The study to which I refer was a joint study with Northern Ireland of management in the cultural sector and was published in November 1994.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I acknowledge the role of FÁS in providing resources for the arts and cultural sector; without it, it would be 30 per cent or 40 per cent less.  My Department, among others, gave up resources earlier this year to ensure that the FÁS <Col N="1312" /> schemes could continue.  While I acknowledge the role of FÁS, I also acknowledge that proper planning for the arts and good management in the arts organisations mean that we should not rely on FÁS, but that we should look at proper management structures with employment which is funded by regular arts provisions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>We will continue to rely on FÁS.  Has the Minister had any discussions with his Cabinet colleagues about continuing such FÁS schemes which supply the majority of workers to art centres and organisations, even as an interim measure until such time as a better structure is put in place for long term and permanent jobs in art centres? As the Minister knows, the majority of jobs in art centres are not permanent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I should reply in the same spirit in which supplementary questions are put to me.  I refuse to take responsibility for the neglect of previous Administrations, including the one in which the Deputy's party participated, to make provision for the arts. However, I accept responsibility for doing something.  I have had discussions with my colleagues, including the Minister responsible for FÁS.  I will continue to do the best I can in terms of moving to a regular and normal set of provisions, including employment provisions for the arts.  That is the way it should be.  However, sometimes one gets the impression that these problems have only arisen now; they have been there for years.  It is to the indictment of all those who have been responsible for this area over a long period that they did not look at these problems.  I am looking at them and changing the scheme and that is why there has been a 60 per cent increase in the provision for the Arts Council, which did not feature in the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>While I appreciate what the Minister has said, I ask him to concentrate on the evidence in a recently <Col N="1313" /> published plan which shows that the situation is more grim than was realised or catered for in the past.  I am not asking him what happened in previous years but what will happen this year and next year.  If the Government continues to reduce the number of FÁS workers available throughout the country, he must be prepared to take steps to ensure that art centres will not be the first victims of such reductions, even as a short term measure.  We will return to the issue of long term employment in art centres at a later date.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards FÁS activity in the arts sector, I knew the situation was grim a long time ago. However, it will not be grim in the future because things will get better.  My Department, among others, gave up resources to keep the number of FÁS people working in schemes, including those in the arts and cultural sector.  I realised that when I gave up resources for my Department.  I will keep it under review.  However, we should realise that the arts plan, which has the support of all the parties in this House in terms of its implementation, will mean a planned regime which will be more regular.  A component of that is a provision for regular employment and good management structures, towards which I am aiming.</P>

Cuireadh de chúram ar Bhord na Gaeilge na treoirlínte a mheas go rialta, i gcomhpháirt leis na heagrais, agus sin é an fáth gur chuir siad an tuarascáil ar <Col N="1315" /> fáil.  Ba shuimiúil na torthaí a bhí ann, mar shampla an t-ábhar misnigh maidir leis an earnáil phoiblí i gcomhthéacs chlár an Rialtais Chomhpháirtíochta i bhfoirm phleananna gníomhaíochta scríofa &mdash; sin é an rud nua a bhí ann, agus ceapadh oifigeach chun teagmháil a dhéanamh idir mo Roinn agus na Ranna éagsúla.

      <P>Tógfaidh mé an dara cuid den cheist ar dtús.  Dá mba rud é go raibh mé chun polasaí éigeantach a chur ar aghaidh, bheadh an chosúlacht ar an scéal go raibh an Ghaeilge á brú ar státseirbhísigh, ar na daoine atá ag obair san earnáil phoiblí, sna heagrais Stáit agus sna heagrais áitiúla.  Is fíor a rá go nglacfadh daoine mar iad go bhfuil sé de cheart ag gach duine a ghnó a dhéanamh trí mheán na Gaeilge.  Tá mé ag déanamh iarrachta nua ach smaoiním ar iarrachtaí eile san am atá caite &mdash; agus ní bhaineann sé le ré an Teachta anseo &mdash; iarrachtaí a bhí sórt áiféiseach. Cuireadh ciorclán thart timpeall 20 bliain ó shin ag moladh do bhainisteoirí contae, nuair a bheadh an chóisir bhliantúil ar siúl, go gcanfaí An Poc ar Buile mar go gcabhródh sé sin le cúis na Gaeilge. Sin é an fáth gur iarramar orthu plean a cheapadh.  Tá mé sásta an iarracht a choinneáil faoi scrúdú agus ansin is féidir liom an gealltanas sin a thabhairt. Nuair a thiocfaidh an chéad tuarascáil eile amach, mura bhfuil na heagrais Stáit ná na Ranna éagsúla sásta cabhrú linn caithfidh mé smaoineamh ar sheifteanna eile, ach tá mé ag dul ar aghaidh ar an tuiscint go bhfuil dul chun cinn á dhéanamh againn, mar shampla i gcás na Roinne Leasa Shóisialaigh.  Tharla sé seo i mo dháilcheantar féin nuair nach raibh an fhoirm i nGaeilge ar fáil, ach tá sé ar fáil anois.  De réir a chéile, tá súil agam go mbeimid in ann na heisceachtaí sin a bhaint amach ach mura n-éiríonn leis an straitéis sin caithfidh mé an straitéis a athrú.</P>

      <P>Tá Ceantair Oidhreachta Nádúrtha molta le roghnú ar fud na tíre, ar a n-áirítear ceantair Ghaeltachta, bunaithe ar an taighde eolaíochta is fearr atáar fáil, ionas go mbeadh cosaint speisialta acu in aghaidh forbairtí a d'fhéadfadh tionchar neamhfhabhrach a bheith acu ar ghnáthóga agus gnéithe atá i mbaol.</P>
      <P>Ní miste a rá nach n-ainmneofar ceantair mar Cheantair Oidhreachta Nádúrtha go dtí go mbeidh an tAcht um Fhiadhúlra, 1976, leasaithe ag an Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>Is polasaí de chuid an Aontais Eorpaigh agus de chuid na tíre seo go gcaithfí forbairtí a bhfuil deontais á lorg ina leith a bheith comhoiriúnach le caomhnú na timpeallachta.  De bharr nádúr na talún, maraon leis na gnáthóga agus na gnéithe atá le fáil ann, beidh cásanna ann nuair nach mbeidh talamh atá lonnaithe i gCeantair Oidhreachta Nádúrtha cáilithe le haghaidh deontais.</P>
      <P>Tá iarrtha ar na húdaráis áitiúla an tSeirbhís Pháirceanna Náisiúnta agus Fhiadhúlra a chur ar an eolas maidir le forbairtí atá beartaithe agus a d'fhéadfadh tionchar neamhfhabhrach a bheith acu ar na Ceantair Oidhreachta Nádúrtha atá molta le roghnú.  Tabharfaidh an tSeirbhís Pháirceanna Náisiúnta agus Fiadhúlra a cuid tuairimí faoi acmhainn na bhforbairtí atá beartaithe chun damáiste a dhéanamh don timpeallacht agus, más gá, beidh deis ag an tseirbhís cur i gcoinne tograí tríd an gcóras pleanála.</P>

An bhfuil sé i gceist agat ceantair áirithe, b'fhéidir, a chur ar leataobh, atá tábhachtach ó thaobh Oidhreachta Nádúrtha de, céim ar chéim leis an fhorbairt atá ag dul ar aghaidh.  Tá ceantair áirithe sna Gaeltachtaí an-tábhachtach ar fad, ó thaobh cheist na hoidhreachta de.  An fhoraiseacht, mar shampla, tá sé ag déanamh <Col N="1318" /> an-chuid damáiste faoi láthair i gcuid mhaith de na ceantair, go háirithe i mBaile Mhúirne agus i gCúl Aodha, agus i gContae Mhaigh Eo chomh maith.

Tá sé tábhachtach freisin go mbeadh seans againn an fhorbairt chuí a phleanáil chun na Gaeltachtaí a chaomhnú agus a fhorbairt.  Ag an am céanna, caithfidh teagmháil bheith ann idir an Chomhairle Oidhreachta agus na húdaráis éagsúla.  De réir m'eolais, mar a luaigh mé cheana féin, ainmneofar na ceantair oidhreachta nuair a leasaítear an tAcht Fhiadhúlra 1976.  Ansin beidh seans ag na pobail áitiúla dul i gcomhairle leis na húdaráis éagsúla agus is ansin a dhéanfar cinneadh.  Chomh maith leis sin beidh caoi ann achomharc a dhéanamh más mian leo é sin a dhéanamh. I ndeireadh na dála caithfimid rogha a dhéanamh, agus maidir leis an rogha sin, is gá na tosca a lua agus déanfaidh mé amhlaidh.</P>

      <P>The Department of Tourism and Trade, as the lead Department for the Operational Programme for Tourism 1989-93, is the agency through which contact is maintained with the European Commission regarding tourism projects which are financed by the European Regional Development Fund.  In response to a query from <Col N="1319" /> the Commission regarding the implications of An Bord Pleanála's decision in relation to the Wicklow National Park Visitor Centre, the Department of Tourism and Trade formally advised the Commission on 12 April 1995 of the Government's decision in relation to the Burren National Park Visitor Centre, the Wicklow National Park Visitor Centre and the Boyne Valley Visitor Centre. An informal query in regard to the timescale envisaged for the preparation of management plans for the Burren and Wicklow National Parks was subsequently received from the Commission and replied to by the Department of Tourism and Trade by way of a letter on 10 May.  There has been no further contact with the Commission in regard to the projects in question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's question sought information as to whether there had been any request for a return of funds from the European Union. Such a request has not been made. Regarding the preparation of a management plan, steering committees have been established in the Burren and Wicklow and they will proceed.  On receipt of the management plan I anticipate we will be able to proceed on that basis.  Regarding the centres, the Government of the day proceeded on the basis of the best legal information available.  There has been no request from the European Union for the return of funds.  It is important to complete the management plan and proceed with the work in a manner acceptable to the communities involved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to be helpful in that regard.  I am disappointed my local authority does not have a representative on one of the steering committees.  In <Col N="1320" /> reply to a previous question the Minister indicated he thought it likely that the cost of site restoration would be covered by the parks and wildlife budget.  I am concerned to establish if Exchequer or European funding will be available to finance building a centre that may be located on an alternative site in Clare or Wicklow.</P>

      <P>I am reluctant to stray into any matters that might be the subject of litigation.  We must accept the court finding that what took place up until now regarding the development of one site was illegal.</P>
      <P>We want to maximise the benefit for the general area already designated. That is the purpose of the management plan.  The planning officer of Clare County Council is on one of the steering committees of the management plan.  It would be wrong to suggest that the Commission or the European Union consider that the site that has been the subject of previous discussions is the only one suitable for funding.  There is nothing to stop them, conscious of the elaborate and, unfortunately, divisive debate which has taken place, recommending a plan on which there is consensus.</P>

I informed her that I would meet with any group in an effort to facilitate its participation in the management plan process.  Since then I received a request to meet with the <Col N="1321" /> group but, unfortunately, the date suggested did not suit the group.  An alternative date is being arranged.

I am not suggesting that is the thinking of any Member but some people might hold such a view.  These matters will be concluded long before the end of this Government.  It would be foolish to suggest that the matter could be strung out and, through some mechanism, revert to the original position. That will not happen.  While endeavouring to achieve consensus, we are all obliged to obey the direction of the court.  Achieving consensus is one matter but stringing out the process is another.  That will not be countenanced. There will be a timeframe on the process, it will be completed and we will comply speedily with the directions of the court.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The June deadline referred to by the Deputy is in respect of a list of candidate special areas of conservation SACs.  The EU Habitats Directive places a requirement on Ireland, and other member states, to submit a list of candidate SACs to the Commission by 5 June 1995.  This deadline has not been met by Ireland or the other member states.  A list of sites is being selected from the proposed natural heritage areas which replaced the old areas of scientific interest.</P>
      <P>My Department is preparing a regulation which will introduce the Habitats Directive into Irish Law.  This regulation will establish a formal designation procedure and afford protection to the sites.</P>
      <P>After the new regulations are made, and before the submission of the list of candidate SACs to Brussels, the draft list will be published and all interested parties will have an opportunity to make their views known.  There will be procedures for consideration of any objections by landowners or occupiers to the inclusion of their lands.</P>
      <P>The Commission is aware that substantial progress is being made on this matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe not.  The only member state that has submitted a tentative list, without maps, is Denmark. In addition, the Commission has been made aware of the procedures we are following.  It is very important that there be a process of prior advertisement and consultation, to enable objections to be heard so that ultimately we will be able to enjoy the fullest possible co-operation with those who are owners, occupiers or users of land.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the procedure the Minister has outlined because to do otherwise would create future problems for ourselves.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I would have to work out a time scale for the Deputy.  I hope the Wildlife Act, 1976, as amended, will constitute the statutory basis for national heritage areas.  I have been very anxious to ensure that the procedures we put in place will follow from real consultation.  By that I mean that we should allow people as much apportunity as possible for consultation, specification, appeal and adjudication.  We could make substantial progress in the course of this year, when the statutory basis will be established so that, early in 1996, we should be able to conclude the matter.</P>
      <P>This question deals with special areas of conservation.  The sites are the most important in Europe for the conservation of wildlife; in our case, these would be mainly peatland, wetland, coastal, woodland, grassland, limestone or a combination of these.  We are talking about a possible 250 to 300 sites which will be adjudicated on after the statutory provision will have been provided later this year.</P>

      <P>I have been fascinated by the replies so far, having heard references to national heritage areas and special areas of conservation whereas Deputy Keogh's question refers to special areas of scientific interest.  Perhaps there is confusion, not only in Deputy Keogh's mind but throughout the country on these designations.  Will the Minister agree that his answer hides the fact that he is acutely embarrassed by the special areas of scientific interest which, following the débacle of the Clifden Airport case, were found to be worthless?  Furthermore, will he agree that ironically the waste from his Department, comprising cigarette ends, teabags and so on, probably ends up being dumped on a special area of scientific interest at Rogerstown Estuary in North County Dublin, clearly demonstarting that the special areas of scientific interest referred to in the question tabled are worthless?  Will he agree that the sooner we make progress on the national heritage areas and ditch the areas of scientific interest the better it will be for our environment?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no difficulty answering Deputy Sargent's question.  I can assure him I am not embarrassed.  I am aware of the argument about areas of scientific interest.  On this occasion I am very anxious that the consultation procedures will be such as to gain the support of the different organisations involved.  Far from being embarrassed, I am adamant that we should not continue the procedures that obtained to date, which led to complaint about inadequacy of consultation, so that we ended up in a confrontation which does not help anybody.  That is why I changed the procedures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the other matter of dumping cigarette ends and waste, my Department is as ecologically responsible as any other Department.  There appears to be a notion abroad that we should have some <Col N="1327" /> kind of superior, cranky view that all of us responsible for this area are less committed to the environment.  I wrote about these issues over 20 years ago and my commitment to the environment and ecology remains as it was then, before many others took up the cause.</P>

      <P>What will be the impact of this EU Habitats Directive on the only special amenity area order adopted here for the Liffey Valley?  I proposed it in 1984.  Very little progress has been made in affording the area the real protection it warrants.  The special amenity order is merely a theoretical exercise not followed by any practical action on the part of successive Governments. Will the Liffey Valley feature at the top of the list in our submission to Brussels, with funding allocated thereto to bring it into public ownership, thus rendering that wonderful amenity available to the public?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I will adhere to the part of the Deputy's supplementary relevant to the question tabled.  Once the statutory basis has been established through the Wildlife Act 1976, as amended, the list can be prepared from natural heritage areas which will have the support of that legislation.  It will be possible then to put the initiative to which Deputy Lawlor referred into that context, rendering it more certain.</P>

      <Quest>the composition of the steering committee set up in 1994 to consider policies and practice in public art in Ireland.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10 and 47 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Arising from consultations I have had with the Minister for the Environment <Col N="1330" /> in relation to the implementation of the 1 per cent arts scheme, a public art research project is now under way.</P>
    <P>A steering committee to oversee, monitor and advance the project is chaired by the Department of the Environment and has representation from my Department, An Chomhairle Ealaíon, Temple Bar Properties and the Office of Public Works.</P>
    <P>The steering committee decided to appoint consultants to prepare a report advising the committee on the approach that should be taken in the development of a more effective strategy in the promotion of art in the public sector for use by public authorities in commissioning art.</P>
    <P>The timeframe for the project is six months from the date of appointment of consultants, which was May 26 last.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>I acknowledge that much progress has been made in the development of this scheme since I first raised this question approximately a year ago. Will the Minister confirm that the scheme is a key element in achieving the objectives of the arts plan in that nothing could be more area-based than the proper implementation of the scheme?  When the findings of the steering committee become available, will the Minister have further consultations with the local authorities to ensure they are in a position to implement the scheme fully?  If that is done, not alone will each area benefit from it but artists and people working in the arts sector will benefit from the work that will derive from the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate Deputy Quill has raised questions on this issue in the past and that she has a keen interest in it, as do other Deputies.  I have referred to the matters about which we can be definite.  I have outlined the membership of the steering committee which will be chaired by the Department of the Environment and will include representation from my Department, An Chomhairle Ealaíon, Temple Bar Properties and the Office <Col N="1331" /> of Public Works.  The committee will report within six months from 26 May. The cost of this consultancy study is approximately £32,000 and it will be shared between the various Departments and bodies represented on it. When the committee makes its report we will then have to put in place a strategy of action.  That will provide the Minister for the Environment and myself an opportunity to see how this can be done.</P>
      <P>It is important to realise that in a scheme such as this, as in every other area of arts and culture activity, the more goodwill that emanates from local authorities, the better.  Some local authorities are doing very well in this regard, others are resisting.  It must be said that some local authorities and local authority management structures require a change of attitude.  It is the desire of the Government to make this scheme work. I may have to consider, in my consultations with the Minister for the Environment, whether we might have to introduce a more compulsory scheme. However, the objective is to put in place a worthwhile scheme and perhaps the steering committee will be in a position to suggest some flexibilities that might be incorporated in it which will help us achieve the desired results.</P>
      <P>I am aware that some local authorities requested permission to use part of their 1 per cent allocation for the arts scheme to fund an officer to advise them on the overall implementation of the scheme, which seemed sensible.  In that regard I am referring to Cork.  When I receive the report of the steering committee I will try to put a strategy for action in place in consultation with the Minister for the Environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply which gives me grounds for optimism.  Did it occur to him to appoint a representative of the city or county managers to the steering committee so as to have them on side from day one?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I will consider that <Col N="1332" /> suggestion.  The City and County Managers Association sometimes has a difficulty in nominating people for appointment to committees for the simple reason that such people are often quite busy and may have previously applied for a departmental scheme.  I assure the Deputy that the best possible liaison will be maintained with the city and county managers so as to ensure the effectiveness of the scheme.  In all of these matters we must construct a partnership to get things done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamLawlor" hpid="Mr. Lawlor Mr. Lawlor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lawlor</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister, along with his colleague, the Minister for the Environment, consider requesting county managers to include in their Estimates for 1996 the 1 per cent allocation of funds to enable them implement the recommendations of the steering committee?  I compliment the Minister on his approach and I hope his objectives will be achieved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of the provision of funding for local authorities is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for the Environment.  I am not sure whether we have already written to the local authorities.  If we have not, I will certainly consider doing that.  The 1 per cent arts scheme is an objective of this and the previous Government and it is important we receive support for its implementation from local representatives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the steering committee examine the application or, in some cases, the lack of application of the 1 per cent arts scheme?  What will be its remit?  As I am sure the Minister is well aware, during times of cutbacks in local authority funding the arts are perceived by some as being a luxury rather than something that should be incorporated in day to day funding.  Will the Minister ensure that funding allocated to local authorities for the arts is used for that purpose?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I will take the Deputy's questions in order.  I said that one <Col N="1333" /> would wish to achieve our objectives through partnership without having to establish some type of compulsory scheme.  The consultants will examine the outline of a possible strategy for use by public authorities to facilitate more effective promotion of the arts in the public sector.  Those are the terms of reference of the committee.</P>
      <P>The issue of earmarked funding raises major questions about the autonomy of practice of my colleague, the Minister for the Environment.  This issue is debated regularly in the House and it is important for local authorities who have not yet appointed an arts officer to realise the seriousness of such an omission. The lack of the services of an arts officer is a major loss to a community. Such a position is vitally important as we seek to achieve our objectives.  I am aware this scheme has the support of all parties in this House and we are trying to develop an outline strategy which will make things happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is aware that Clare County Council was the first local authority to appoint an arts officer and we are proud of that.  I am sure we will be the first local authority to take a particular interest in the report of the steering committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">

      <P>Ó ceapadh mise mar Aire don chéad uair dhá bhliain go leith ó shin, tá an soláthar caipitil d'Udarás na Gaeltachta méadaithe de bheagnach 29 faoin gcéad (.i. ó £13.2 milliún go £17 milliún). Anuas ar an tsuim £17 milliún atá i Leabhar na Meastachán le haghaidh 1995 beidh suim bhreise suas le £3.5 milliún á cur ar fáil i mbliana chun cabhrú leis an Údarás monarcha nua a thógáil do thogra &ldquo;Fruit of the Loom&rdquo; ar an gClochán Liath.  Má chuirtear an tsuim bhreise sin san áireamh, feicfear gur méadú de bhreis ar 55 faoin gcéad atá i gceist.  Is léiriú na suimeanna sin ar an tábhacht a chuireann an Rialtas, agus mise agus m'Aire Stáit, i bhforbairt na Gaeltachta agus i gcruthú fostaíochta dá muintir.</P>
      <P>Braitheann an tsuim airgid a chuirtear ar fáil in aon bhliain don Údarás ar go leor toscaí, ar a n-áirítear riachtanais na heagraíochta, polasaí Rialtais d'fhorbairt tionscial agus do chruthú fostaíochta, beartas cáinaisnéise agus mar sin de.</P>
      <P>Beidh iarratas an Údaráis ar chaipiteal le haghaidh 1996 le breithniú mar chuid d'fheachtas Meastachán na bliana sin, a bhfuil tús curtha leis cheana féin.</P>

Listeners to this debate will be intrigued to hear that in today's Order Paper concern has been expressed about the future of the birthplace of Edward Carson on the one hand and for the future of the <i>Asgard</i> on the other.  That underlines the richness of the many strands that make up Irish history.  It is to the credit of all parties that we are concerned to preserve these items, not just for this but for future generations.  Having guaranteed the future condition of the <i>Asgard</i>, has the Minister decided where it will be put on public display and who will be responsible for its maintenance into the next generation?</P>

      <P>The National Monuments and Historic Properties Service advise me that conservation of the carved panels and associated stonework of the west gable of the cathedral is necessary to prevent further deterioration. The process, which is under way, involves the removal of the panels from the monument, consolidation of the wall and the further conservation and replacement of the panels.  I expect that the panels will be replaced in a matter of weeks.</P>

      <P>The Minister said they will be replaced within a matter of weeks.  Everybody recognises the need to take them away and preserve them, but when these stones were removed last January the people of Ardmore were assured that they would be returned in May in time for the tourist season.  The carvings on these stones, and the round tower itself, are the main tourist attractions in the area.  We are now half-way through the tourist season and they still have not been returned.  I ask the Minister to do all he can to make sure they are returned as a matter of urgency.</P>

From what I read about it, it has transpired that considerbly more work was required than initially envisaged. It would have been good practice <Col N="1338" /> if that had been told to the local community because in matters with which the local community identify, they deserve that kind of consultation.

The initial conservation of the face of the panels has been carried out.  The next phase was to remove the panels for conservation off-site. That is to be done in phases starting in April.  In a letter dated March 1995 to a person who was concerned about this, it was stated that this would be done before the summer.  I appreciate the urgency of the Deputy's question.  The plastic was left in position to lessen the amount of water ingressing the stonework and that is to be removed as soon as possible.  As to the work itself, I will try to get a precise timescale and more detail about where and by whom the work was carried out.</P>

      <P>In all the appointments in his Department to date, the Minister, to his credit, has been more than careful to ensure that there has been a gender balance.  There is now a need to set regional quotas in a similar manner because I am concerned about the centralised nature of previous Arts Councils. On the four previous Arts Councils there have never been more than 11 members who were not located in Dublin.  It is time to think of ways and means of decentralising the thinking of the Arts Council and its membership. The essence of the plan is that, in future, the arts will be developed on an area basis.  Unless we come to terms with the centralised approach adopted in the past that will not happen.  Will the Minister take on board the fact that it is important to set quotas on a regional basis for this board and others of a similar nature?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>As a founder member of the Regional Studies Association in Ireland I am enthusiastic about regionalism.  As regards gender equity, I have legislated for equality on the RTE Authority and the Heritage Council. The exclusion of women from their rightful place is different from the question on regional balance.  What the Deputy said is interesting.  The primary concern in making appointments is to ensure appointees can make a contribution that transcends personal or local competence.  For example, if one is familiar with dance and appointed to the Arts Council one must take decisions in the interests of all the arts.  This is a small island and in considering appointees, I have tried to bear in mind that they should keep the cultural unity and shared heritage of the whole island in mind.  While taking cognisance of local issues, it is not a time to retreat to the parish, it is time to think on a national, European and international <Col N="1340" /> level.  While the majority of people live in Dublin it would not be in everyone's interest if all the members were from Dublin.  Sporting organisations use a regional quota and perhaps it is more appropriate in that area than in the area of cultural policy.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister agree it is more than coincidence that 66 per cent of the funding was spent on institutions in the city?  The time has come to correct the imbalance between Dublin and the regions.  It does not have anything to do with the parish mentality.</P>

I hope when I am replaced as Minister that these criteria of excellence, adequacy and competence will prevail.  The RTE Authority is chaired by a distinguished academic and writer on matters of broadcasting who can approach the position with the innovation required in a time of rapid technological change while being familiar with our national broadcasting structures.  The other members have a good contribution to make and the Authority will enjoy complete statutory autonomy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>There was debate about the autonomy of local authorities to set charges as they see fit and the view has been expressed that there should be a uniform waiver system.  I have decided to issue guidelines on the operation of waiver schemes, focusing on their consistency, so that people in similar circumstances can expect to be treated in a similar fashion across the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for that but I do not agree with the provisions of the Bill.</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned the clarity which now derives to all sides as a result of the discussion of the Bill.  Perhaps for the first time since their introduction, all political parties are now in favour of service charges.  They have demonstrated this in the House by their support for the Bill, which was introduced by the three party Government comprising Fine Gael, the Labour Party and Democratic Left.  It is their Bill and it consolidates and maintains the system of service charges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My party supports service charges until such times as a different or better system of financing local authorities is put in place.  The same applies to the other Opposition parties.  There is now uniformity in this area which did not <Col N="1398" /> exist previously.  It seems all political parties in the House are now in favour of service charges.  It also seems the Government parties are in favour of disconnecting the water supply of people who are in a position to pay the charges but refuse to do so.  That aspect has been clarified.  It seems we have reached a point of clarity in relation to the political approaches to service charges.  This is the only useful thing which has emerged from the Bill.</P>
    <P>When estimates are discussed by the various local authorities, it is important that the position of Deputies and councillors of the same party is consistent. Parties which indicated their support for service charges in the House during the course of the Bill must be prepared to support service charges in their local authority areas at estimates discussions. If this was the case, it would help local authorities in attempting to put in place a certain amount of finance which would enable them to deliver local services of a minimum standard.</P>
    <P>I made the point earlier that Irish people who travel abroad see the difference between villages, towns and cities where there is a certain element of local taxation and money collected locally is spent locally.  In such areas, good cleaning systems are in place.  There is an absence of litter; these places are well developed and maintained from the point of view of the provision of public parks, libraries, etc.  Cities and towns run in this manner have enormous appeal.  This is possible because sufficient money is available at local level and local services of a given standard can be delivered.  We should try to aspire to this ideal.</P>
    <P>I hope there will be consistency within political parties in the run up to next year's local authority estimates meetings.  I hope that on their home base, that they will support the principle they have supported in the House.  If that happened, local authorities might be in a reasonable position to carry on until it is possible to put in place a proper system of financing of local authorities. As I stated on many occasions, <Col N="1399" /> the Minister will have the co-operation and support of my party when he is in a position to consider the broader picture of the financing of local authorities.  I wish we were addressing this issue today.</P>
    <P>The current situation in relation to the financing of local authorities is far from satisfactory.  It deteriorates yearly and, if it is allowed to worsen much further, the standard of local public services will be irreparably damaged.  The sooner the necessary legislation is introduced the better.  In the meantime, I urge the Minister to use his influence with councillors from the Government parties to do at local level what they have already done in the House in supporting the service charge system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>My admiration for the Minister in his various portfolios has been recorded previously.  However, having listened to this discussion and read the Second Stage debate, particularly the Minister's contribution, my admiration for him grows.  He has made a good job of trying to defend the indefensible in this House with regard to this Bill; he has done so with a straight face most of the time and he has almost managed to convince himself, and his officials are probably convinced at this stage, that he believes the Bill was necessary because something was seriously wrong in the local authority system, that it was needed for clarification purposes &mdash; as he said &mdash; and on the basis of justice and hardship.  I know the Minister reasonably well and he has not convinced me, although the performance was very good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This section &mdash; which is the core of the Bill &mdash; is clearly only a political move to provide cover for the Minister's Democratic Left colleagues.  I am glad Deputy Quill made this point, which I made when the policy document <i>A Government of Renewal</i> was first announced.  The Democratic Left Party has lived off the backs of less well off people over the last ten years in relation <Col N="1400" /> to service charges.  They had no equivocation whatsoever at local authority level or in the House with regard to their policy on service charges, which was that they would abolish them if they got into Government.  They are now in Government, and what we have now is this thin and &mdash; for once from this Government &mdash; transparent attempt to give them some type of cover in relation to the total abandonment of their policy, which gathered them support at local authority level and probably secured support for various Democratic Left Deputies.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Quill pointed out, Democratic Left has abandoned its policy and commitment to abolish service charges when it got into Government.  It had an opportunity to do so but it did not take it.  Perhaps they will now get rid of the hypocrisy and get down to the real business of local government and get off the backs of the poorer sections of the community, to whom they have fed lies and untruths for the last ten years with regard to their real approach to local government.</P>
    <P>The Minister has consistently defended his position.  He said on Second Stage there was a need for clearly defined steps in relation to disconnecting the water supply of those who were unable or who refused to pay charges.  I have to make a clear distinction: I have no problem about disconnecting the water supply of people who are able to pay the charges and refuse to do so.  Every party should take this position although, as Deputy Quill said, this now appears to be the case.</P>
    <P>The Minister makes a case for the Bill on the basis that the steps which must be taken before a local authority can disconnect water supply are being clearly defined.  I agree clarification is always useful and that some local authorities may have needed it.  However, it was not necessary to bring in a Bill to do it.  The Minister could have done what he did on 4 April; he could have issued a circular to local authorities setting out the procedures which must be followed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1401" /> From my contacts with local authorities, I know that when the Minister made his initial statement on this and the programme for Government was published, local authorities automatically stopped disconnecting and threatening to disconnect water supplies until he clarified the matter.  I am sure the Minister and his officials agree it is a rare occurrence for local authorities to act in a manner contrary to the expressed wishes of the Minister who made it clear he did not want disconnection except under clearly defined and outlined circumstances.</P>
    <P>This Bill is unnecessary as confirmed by the Minister's figures as only 0.02 per cent of those connected to the public water supply were disconnected.  It was mentioned that the local authority in my area used the threat of disconnection but in my experience, except on the vary rare occasion a mistake was made, the disconnections were justified.  The people concerned were two or three years in arrears and generally they could afford to pay.  In County Meath the local authority had a system whereby people who lived in local authority houses or were on low incomes availed of a waiver or an instalment system and every facility was given to allow people to pay. The Minister will be aware that local representatives spent a great deal of time making appeals to the local authority for people threatened with disconnection. The Minister will agree disconnections were not commonplace and that, therefore, this Bill is not necessary. I do not have any knowledge that local authorities were abusing their powers and there are ways to tackle the problem apart from tying the system up for years.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ferris commented on the waiver system and I acknowledge that the Minister amended his proposal.  I agree the waiver system will benefit from standardisation but section 3 (4) may have a contrary effect to what the Minister intends.  In considering whether to grant an order under section 3 (2), the court shall have regard to the personal and household circumstances <Col N="1402" /> of the consumer but under section 3 (5) a sanitary authority will not be allowed to disconnect where a waiver has been granted.  It is wrong that the system should allow the courts to decide the circumstances of a waiver.  I believe the effect of section 3 (5) will be contrary to what is expected and that local authorities who are reasonable in granting waivers &mdash; my local authority grants a waiver of almost 50 per cent to households with only a social welfare income &mdash; will err on the side of not granting it because if they do they will not have the ultimate sanction as heretofore of disconnecting the water if the person defaults.  That is wrong and the Minister should reconsider it.</P>
    <P>This is the core issue but I am not convinced that the Minister has tackled the problem.</P>

      <P>The bottom line is that if a service is to be provided it must be paid for.  There is no such thing as a free service unless people believe in Santa Claus.</P>
      <P>In certain parts of Dublin there is an indirect system and people do not pay directly for the service whereas by and large in the rest of the country a levy is placed on the householder.  People are quite happy with the water, sewage disposal and refuse collection service. However, when they see that those in the greater Dublin area enjoy free services it causes annoyance.  As the people in Dublin appear to be getting the services free, the rest of the country feel entitled to the same.  The cost of services in Dublin are met by the taxpayer and, therefore, I must be making a contribution, which I have no wish to do.</P>

    <P>As Deputy Dempsey rightly pointed out, local authorities are well aware of the circumstances of the people in their area.  The waiver system has worked well in Cavan County Council with no major problems.  In all walks of life there are people who do not want to pay even though they can well afford it and have money for everything else.  If it is proposed to have an indirect system to meet service charges it should be <Col N="1403" /> nationwide, otherwise everyone should pay with a waiver provision in hardship cases.  I think the number of cases that will go to court will be minimal and that those who end up in court will deserve it.</P>
    <P>Recently a local group scheme took a number of householders to court in Roscommon for non-payment of their contribution but the district justice's decision was that the group water scheme had no authority to collect.  Who will pay for the provision of this group water scheme?  Will the Minister clarify whether the judge is right and that these people do not have the authority to collect the money?  If so, legislation must be introduced to regularise matters. Group water schemes have provided an excellent service nationwide.  The community came together and, with the assistance of EU and departmental grant aid and the local contribution, a water source was identified, reservoirs were constructed and the water was piped to all households in the scheme. This service was comparable to that available in towns and villages and people were happy with and willing to pay for its ongoing maintenance.  If there is an inkling that people do not have to contribute annually to the group water scheme it will spread like wildfire. That would be unfair to the people who have worked hard and spent sleepless nights worrying about the scheme but you cannot have a system where some in the group pay and others do not.  If everybody pays, it will be a small cost on every household.  While this point is not directly relevant to the debate I ask the Minister to take it on board as this is my only opportunity to raise this very serious issue which needs to be addressed.</P>

      <P>There is nothing like responsibility to concentrate the mind and the members of Democratic Left had to concentrate their minds very quickly on coming into office.  When in Opposition they espoused a ridiculous policy &mdash; which went down very well <Col N="1404" /> with the electorate during the early stages &mdash; that one did not have to pay for local authority services.  I appreciate the difficult position in which the Minister finds himself in trying to meet the demands of Democratic Left on this issue but I am surprised he has given in to it in this way.</P>
      <P>The funding of local government is a thorny issue which has caused problems throughout the country.  The introduction of local charges, which amount to approximately £50 million, gave local authorities some flexibility in raising finance. However, under the legislation it will be impossible for them to collect this money.  There is no point in giving them this facility if we do not allow them to collect the charges.  If the ESB and Telecom Éireann had to operate under this restriction they would find it impossible to collect charges.</P>
      <P>Even though the old scheme caused problems in the early stages there was very little wrong with it.  In some cases people were not asked to pay charges but as people were brought into the net they realised it was a good service which gave them value for money.  After the enactment of this Bill people would be mad to pay the charges.  I am sure the Minister was happy with his performance in the Department of Health but this proposal is crazy.  If he was in office for the next 50 years he could not bring before the House a more ridiculous and unnecessary measure.</P>

      <P>I congratulate the Minister on the fantastic work he did in the Departments of Health and the Environment. Time will show that his record is second to none.  Deputy Smith said it should be left to local authorities to come up with a waiver system which meets their requirements.  While there is a certain validity in that argument, given the points made by the Minister there is merit in setting out basic guidelines.  It is not the prerogative of councillors and local elected representatives to devise a <Col N="1405" /> waiver system.  They can make recommendations but at the end of the day, it is the manager who devises the system. In my local authority area a couple in receipt of a non-contributory old age pension can have charges waived while a couple in receipt of a contributory old age pension cannot have charges waived.  If they have no other income old age pensioners should not be required to pay charges.  I ask the Minister to set out basic guidelines to which local authorities can add if they so wish.</P>
      <P>All speakers have referred to the major issue of financing local authorities. I have difficulty with a system which does not impose a statutory requirement on the Minister of the day to maintain the level of the rate support grants paid to local authorities.  Since the 1980s successive Governments have reduced the level of the rate support grants and, with the exception of the Dublin area, a part of the local contribution has had to be used to make up the shortfall in the contribution from central taxation.  For example, some of the charges for roads are used to pay wages and salaries.  This is totally unacceptable and the rate support grant scheme should be put on a statutory basis so that local authorities know where they stand.</P>
      <P>I commend the Minister on his commitment &mdash; the previous Government gave a similar commitment &mdash; to look at the reorganisation and financing of local government.  We need a local government system in which people can have confidence and I hope this can be brought about as a result of the professional study commissioned by the Government.  The financing of local government has been a political hot potato: parties put forward certain proposals in Government and totally different proposals in Opposition.  Most Deputies are members of local authorities and we are all aware of the major problems in funding.  I appeal to all parties to adopt a positive approach to this issue.  There will be a different Government in a few years time&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Such a system might be tougher than the present one but we should at least have the guts to put an alternative system to the people.  The Minister has shown he has the commitment to do this and I appeal to all parties to row in behind him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have always supported service charges regardless of what Government was in office.  One hour's drive down the road from where I live, people in Northern Ireland pay £1,000, £500 and £400 rates on their houses.  Those who live in the wealthier areas probably pay twice as much rates as those who live in poorer areas.  Yet here we crib about paying a small amount for service charges, basically to provide water.  We have service charges in Sligo for water and sewerage services and we have a privatised refuse collection.</P>
      <P>In future service charges should be part of the weekly or monthly rent for local authority houses.  It may be difficult for local authority tenants to find a cheque for £100 or more, but if they pay, perhaps, £2 per week service charges with the rent it is much easier. A decision on this issue will have to come from this House rather than at county council level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Previous speakers made sensible contributions but no local authority can survive nowdays without some type of service charge.  Deputy Seán Ryan talked about introducing a system of proper financing for local government.  That is difficult because if we introduce a rates support grant it will have to be paid for by taxpayers.  It is difficult for us to strike a rate in Sligo when we read that service charges are not being paid in the greater part of the city of Dublin where they collect massive rates from big stores, factories and so on.  In a small county such as Sligo the people in the towns of Ballymote, Tubbercurry and Collooney are the only people on whom <Col N="1407" /> the rates can be increased.  The considerable amount of money taken in from the larger town of Sligo goes to Sligo Corporation.  Some of it should be distributed around the county.  In County Sligo one of our only means of finance is to increase service charges each year.  I am totally opposed to that because our service charge for water already is £100.  It is difficult to ask people to pay more than that.</P>
    <P>I am pleased the Minister will not completely abolish service charges because that would be a step in the wrong direction.  I hope solicitors and lawyers will not make huge sums of money in taking cases to court and that it will not cost the local authority or the people they are taking to court a great deal of money.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Quill commented that she perceives all-party agreement on this thorny issue which has been a matter of political contention for a considerable number of years.  We cannot write into any Bill the right of an individual party to hold its own position. Every political party will put its proposals to the people on the occasion of the next election and the people will return Deputies to this House as they see fit.  What has been worked out in the context of Government and what I am obliged to introduce is the negotiated agreement between three separate parties. The views of all parties are not the same; if they were we would have one party.</P>
      <P>I was part of the team that hammered out an agreement to arrive at an acceptable programme to bring this country forward.  I had the privilege of being a member of an earlier team that negotiated the original Programme for Government between Fianna Fáil and Labour.  As Deputies Dempsey, Matt Brennan and others are aware there was not a unanimous agreement between Fianna Fáil and Labour on all issues. Instead we had an accommodation, an agreement with which both parties could live.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1408" /> The former Minister, Deputy Michael Smith, was characteristically disarmingly frank and honest in his Second Stage contribution.  This measure is the result of negotiation; it is not necessarily one I would have drawn up from a Labour Party perspective nor one that would have been put forward from a Democratic Left perspective nor one that Fine Gael would necessarily have crafted to reflect its policies.  I am happy with the accommodation.  It holds the principles that allow local authorities to continue with their important work of serving their local communities and it provides them with a base for raising local charges if that is their intention.</P>
    <P>Several Deputies have been slightly schizophrenic in demanding autonomy for local authorities and saying we should devolve functions to them and give them as much freedom and power as possible.  At the same time they referred to differences between local authorities.  One cannot have it both ways.  If power is given to local authorities to make decisions they will not all make a uniform decision as their circumstances are not the same.  I envisage in the future, even in a reformed system of local authority funding, that different proposals for local government will be put forward by various parties seeking election and the programme put in place will reflect the votes and decisions of the people in that area.  Local democracy is about diversity and difference.</P>
    <P>I thank Deputy Dempsey for his compliment to me on the presentation of the Bill.  It is a good effort at reforming the system to allow a degree of transparency and regulation without damaging the system.</P>
    <P>This Bill will not damage the local government system as can be seen from the returns to date since the implementation of the measures by way of circular letter in April.  As Deputy Dempsey may be already aware, in County Meath income from charges for the period January to end June is up 10 per cent or £78,000 on the same period last year. This is welcome and the pattern is <Col N="1409" /> repeated in many counties across the country.</P>
    <P>It should be accepted and understood that the enactment of this Bill will not lead to the system of charges being brought to an end.  I do not agree, therefore, with Deputy Dempsey's contention that it is not needed and there are other ways to tackle the matter.  It is our function, as legislators, to legislate.  I see no harm in formalising the regulations in statute law.  Neither do I accept, on the question of waivers provided for in section 3, the local authorities will be less generous because of a fear that if someone is granted a waiver, they may decide not to pay anything more.  There are other ways of pursuing the debt.  It would not be appropriate to cut off supplies.</P>

      <P>Deputy Boylan raised the question of local autonomy and said everyone should be treated the same way.  Local autonomy means diversity.  If a common approach was adopted by all local authorities, we would not have a local authority but a national system.</P>
      <P>Deputy Power said he was surprised I had given in to Democratic Left.  It was not a question of giving in to anybody; the Programme for Government was designed to sit happily on the policies of the parties in Government.  That is the reason this legislative measure has the support of each of its constituent parts. It will have broad support among the general public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Sean Ryan raised the question of the waiver system and said there was a need for general guidelines.  I agree with him and I am formulating such guidelines to ensure a consistent approach is adopted.  Some local authorities have decided that old age pensioners, for example, should have their service charges reduced to £5 while others grant a 50 per cent reduction. Old age penioners on fixed income set by the State should not be placed at a <Col N="1410" /> disadvantage.  I will consider that matter.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also raised the question of local authority funding.  Lest anyone be under an illusion there are no easy options and there is no Santa Claus. Neither the professional study, any Member, nor I will devise a scheme that will allow local authorities to thrive on fresh air; someone will have to meet the cost.  As a community, there are a number of fundamental questions we have to answer.  I have posed these questions to local authorities, at county and regional level.  The Deputies opposite now have an opportunity to engage in this process.</P>
    <P>We can decide that we want an effective local government system and devise a mechanism to pay for it or we can abandon this hope for all time.  There is a new maturity in Irish politics which gives us a window of opportunity.  It is my ambition to publish a White Paper on this issue next year.  I will seek the broadest possible consensus across the House and country to reform the funding base of local authorities.</P>
    <P>I sincerely hope that no political party will seek to make political capital by destroying any prospective new system of local government funding before it is put in place.  If we believe in local government, we should try to build a consensus.  As Deputy Ryan rightly said, all parties will at some stage be in Government and Opposition.  They should not use their time in Opposition to be destructive exclusively.  Judging from many of the comments made by Members of the main Opposition party that is not its tack.  It seems that it will be pro-active and positive.  I look forward to that debate.  It will be a difficult road but it is one I am determined to lead people down so long as I receive support from the political institutions and the general public.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mattie Brennan put forward the notion that service charges should be absorbed into the rent payment.  That is a good idea, some local authorities already do this.  If the charge amounts to £100, the rent payment is increased <Col N="1411" /> by £2 per week.  I would encourage those local authorities who do not do this to do so to ensure that no one is faced with a large bill at the end of the year because of the strain this would put on their finances.</P>
    <P>Deputy Boylan referred to the recent decision in the District Court on group water schemes and the legal difficulties encountered in collecting moneys.  For the information of the House, that decision has been appealed to the High Court.  It would be inappropriate of me, therefore, to comment until the matter has been finalised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said it was his hope that political parties would not try to make capital on the question of local government funding.  I am in a better position than most to comment on the question of service charges as I have always favoured their introduction in the belief that local authorities would not be able to survive without them. This issue has been the source of much frustration and annoyance year after year with individuals and groups advocating that people should not pay them. Monaghan County Council would not be able to operate without these charges.</P>
      <P>When we have reached the point where it is accepted that the amount collected is not adequate and the charges must be paid, the Government is giving people the opportunity not to pay.  It should be remembered that people are quick to seize an opportunity when they do not want to meet their commitments.  If someone decides not to pay, the postman may have to deliver up to six letters from the local authority before action is taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A sum of between £50 million and £60 million is collected by way of these charges.  The number of householders who have been disconnected down the years is very small.  People will cash in on this measure in years to come.  Even those who have paid will play for time and seek an extension.  This is a bad <Col N="1412" /> decision and it will come back to haunt the Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I reject the Deputy's comment.  As I have already explained, this Bill will not give people an opportunity not to pay.  Since the measure was announced in the programme for Government early this year and since it has been enforced by regulation in April, the income from charges has increased.  The collection rate across the country has increased.  That is the reality.  It has not had the gloomy effect that has repeatedly been claimed by Opposition Deputies.  That is simply not a fact.</P>
      <P>I repeat, for the eighth or ninth time, that it is not about sending postmen running hither and thither.  There will be a system of notification which will include a demand and two subsequent reminders.  The two reminders can include a warning that disconnection may ensue.  That is a total of three letters, not six.  There will also be determination by the local authority that it will seek a court order.  I am proposing a reasonably efficient system.  It removes doubt from the local authority's perspective. The local authority need not wonder if it has given enough notice or if another six, two or 22 letters should be sent.  I am saying what is the right number.  The Oireachtas is speaking in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a fair system.  It will give due notice to consumers that they have to pay their bills or explain themselves to <Col N="1413" /> the courts.  That is an improvement.  Any order that is given for disconnection will have stronger validity because it will have the force of a court order, and not just statute, behind it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I wish to raise has already been mentioned by the Minister, under section 3, in response to Deputy Boylan.  It relates to group water schemes and the problem that has been caused by a decision of a District Justice about a case in Roscommon.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to put the Minister in an awkward position in relation to this matter in view of the fact that the decision is being appealed.  However, perhaps the Minister would consider amending section 5 by inserting after the words &ldquo;by the sanitary authority&rdquo; the phrase &ldquo;or by a body or authority designated by such sanitary authority&rdquo;. This would ensure that, irrespective of what happens in the other case, the Minister would clearly state in this Bill that a local authority could allocate its functions <i>vis-á-vis</i> the provision of water to a body such as a group water scheme. That is, in effect, what happens at present.  That body would have the same status for disconnection purposes, even if it had to go through the same procedure, as a local authority.</P>
      <P>I realise the Minister might have a difficulty with such an amendment at this late stage.  Perhaps he might consider amending the Bill in the Seanad, although I am aware of the problem he might have in that regard as well. However, the House will reconvene at a later date in July.  If the Minister can agree to such an amendment or to a similar amendment, this side of the House would not cause any problems.</P>

    <Title>Irish Medicines Board Bill, 1995: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. O'Shea) Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. O'Shea)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. O'Shea)</NameTxt>
      <P>The essential purpose of this Bill is to provide for the establishment of a new statutory body to be known as the Irish Medicines Board.  The board will replace the National Drugs Advisory Board which was established in 1966 and which, over the years, has given considerable service to the State in ensuring the safety and quality of medicines supplied in this country.  However, with recent developments in the field of medicines control, not least the establishment of the European Agency for Evaluation of Medicinal Products, it is appropriate that the role of the NDAB should be reviewed and that appropriate structures which take account of these changing circumstances should be put in place.</P>
      <P>Heretofore the Minister for Health has acted as the licensing authority for medicinal products. However, all applications for such licences, commonly known as product authorisations, were assessed on behalf of the Minister by the NDAB so as to establish the safety, quality and efficacy of the products. Similarly, under the Control of Clinical Trials Acts, 1987 to 1990, permissions to conduct clinical trials are granted by the Minister on the advice of the NDAB.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For some time it has been accepted that this involvement of two separate bodies in the process of licensing was unnecessary and administratively cumbersome and since 1991 it has been Government policy that the licensing function should be transferred to the NDAB.  This is already the case in respect of veterinary medicines in that the NDAB is both the assessor and the <Col N="1416" /> licensing authority and it is not necessary to have a further stage in the process.</P>
    <P>The recent report of the Expert Group on the Blood Transfusion Service Board endorsed that proposal to transfer the licensing function to the NDAB arguing that the present arrangement is cumbersome and unsatisfactory. However, in order to transfer the licensing function of the Minister to the NDAB, it will be necessary radically to restructure that organisation so as to equip it to take on these additional responsibilities and to make the change from being an advisory body to being a licensing authority.</P>
    <P>Having considered how best to achieve this transfer of functions from the Minister, the Government has decided that the most appropriate way of doing so is to have a new national medicines licensing authority, established on a statutory basis, which will replace the National Drugs Advisory Board, take over its existing functions and also take over the licensing function of the Minister.</P>
    <P>The Bill before the House, therefore, provides for the establishment of the Irish Medicines Board, which will become the licensing authority for both human and veterinary medicines and will also be given the responsibility for granting permissions to conduct clinical trials.</P>
    <P>The new board will be more compact and different in character from the NDAB.  The current board has a membership of 18 persons representing a wide range of expertise relating to medicines. Its members also sit on a number of specialist committees of the board, dealing with issues such as the evaluation of human medicines, the evaluation of veterinary medicines and clinical trials.</P>
    <P>It is proposed that the board will be primarily management in character. Consequently, a smaller size is appropriate and the Bill provides for a membership of nine.</P>
    <P>At the same time, it is necessary that the new board should have available to <Col N="1417" /> it a range of expertise such as is contained within the current membership of the NDAB.  For this purpose, the Bill provides for the establishment of two expert advisory committees, to be known as the advisory committee on human medicines and the advisory committee on veterinary medicines.  These advisory committees will be made up of a broad range of experts drawn from the medical, pharmaceutical and veterinary professions as currently represented on the National Drugs Advisory Board. The committees will also be authorised to establish such expert advisory subcommittees as they need to assist them in their work.</P>
    <P>The new board will carry out the current functions of the NDAB but will have the additional responsibility of being the licensing authority for human medicines.  As I mentioned earlier, the NDAB already fulfils this responsibility for veterinary medicines.  The board will also take over responsibility for the granting of permissions to conduct clinical trials and will generally assume the responsibilities currently exercised by the Minister under the Control of Clinical Trials Acts, 1987-90.</P>
    <P>Following the recent review of the Blood Transfusion Service Board, it is desirable that an independent expert body should be available to inspect and report upon the processing of blood and blood products.  It is considered that the medicines board would be the most appropriate body to undertake such a role.</P>
    <P>For this reason, the new board will be given a specific responsibility in the inspection of the collection, screening, processing and quality control facilities and procedures in respect of human blood, blood components, blood products and plasma derivatives with a view to ensuring the safety of such products.</P>
    <P>The board will also become the competent authority in the State in relation to our obligations regarding the licensing and control of medicines which arise as a consequence of our membership of the European Union.  The new board will also work closely with the newly <Col N="1418" /> established European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products and will have responsibility for the supervision of any medicines on sale in the State which are licensed by the European agency.  It is also expected that the board, along with similar agencies in other countries, will be commissioned by the European agency to carry out assessments of applications for European licences.</P>
    <P>Apart from establishing the new board and setting out its functions, the Bill, of necessity, provides the legal basis for the transfer of all the functions, responsibilities, assets and liabilities of the National Drugs Advisory Board and, in particular, for the transfer of the staff of the NDAB to the new board on no less favourable terms than those they enjoyed whilst in the employ of the NDAB.</P>
    <P>While at first sight the Bill is not a particularly short one, Deputies will appreciate that most of its provisions are the standard ones which arise when a statutory body is being established. For that reason, I will not dwell on these, but I would like to refer to some important provisions concerning the financing of the board.</P>
    <P>It is intended that the board will be self-financing and this is reflected in sections 13 and 14.  Under section 13, the Minister may make regulations for the payment of fees to the board in respect of licences.  It is intended that fees will be set at a level necessary to meet the costs of operation and this is reflected in the provision of subsection (4).  Section 14 permits the board to charge for any service which it may provide other than licensing and thus will enable it to sell other services to the extent that this may be feasible.</P>
    <P>Nonetheless, it is appropriate that provision should be made for the payment of grants out of the Exchequer should the need arise, particularly during the transition period, and this is dealt with in section 15.</P>
    <P>The Bill has been welcomed by the pharmaceutical industry who recognise <Col N="1419" /> the need to update our regulatory system. The proposed approach will streamline the licensing system and bring a new management-oriented emphasis to the overall board while retaining the essential technical expertise in the form of the advisory committees. I am sure it will have widespread support among Deputies and I commend it to the House.</P>

      <P>Cuirim fáilte roimh an Bille seo.  Tuigim an réasún atá ag baint leis.  Tuigim freisin go bhfuil roinnt mhaith oibre déanta air le trí bliana go leith anuas ó tógadh an cinneadh don chéad uair an cineál seo reachtaíochta a chur ar fáil.  Chomh fada agus a bhaineann sé le Fianna Fáil beimid ag tacú leis an Bhille.  Ar ndóigh beimid ag cur leasuithe chun cinn ar Chéim an Choiste agus tá mé cinnte go mbeidh an tAire nó an tAire Stáit sásta breathnú orthu ag an am.</P>
      <P>We have come a long way from the day when pharmaceutical companies could market in Ireland without let or hindrance drugs of dubious quality, efficacy and safety.  The history of drug licensing in Ireland reached a low in the early 1960s when one company which supplied drugs to health authorities was required by a Minister of Health to withdraw its products because the potency of the drugs was suspect.</P>
      <P>As a result of that unfortunate situation, which may have contributed to the deaths of a number of Irish people, the Government established the National Drugs Advisory Board.  The board was established in 1966 to ensure the safety, quality and efficacy of all drugs on the market.  In its almost 30 years of existence, the board has served a useful purpose and I would like to place on record my own appreciation and that of my party to all the staff who worked in the National Drugs Advisory Board for their dedication and commitment at a time when they were under enormous pressure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the length of time taken by the NDAB to process applications for <Col N="1420" /> both new and renewal licences for medicinal products has been a matter of concern for some years.  The problems have arisen with the substantial extension of the NDAB's functions over the last two decades.  When it started out in 1966, the board's job was just to disseminate information regarding drugs and to advise the Minister for Health on drug safety measures.</P>
    <P>In 1974, a statutory scheme for the licensing of drugs was introduced.  This scheme was extended to blood products in 1983 and to veterinary products in 1985 and all of this work was given to the NDAB.</P>
    <P>The extension of the board's functions without a significant increase in resources has contributed to the length of time taken to process applications for licences.  There is currently a backlog of about 1,250 new applications for authorisations for products and about 275 renewals that are still held up at the NDAB.</P>
    <P>It is unusual to take a number of years to process applications for new licences under the present system. There have also been significant delays in processing applications for renewals of product authorisations for blood products.  This happened in the case of Anti-D immunoglobulin which is at the centre of the present hepatitis C controversy.</P>
    <P>The report of the Expert Group on the Blood Transfusion Service Board records that a product authorisation for anti-D was applied for in December 1982, but was not issued until October 1986, almost four years later.  The report also shows that the National Drugs Advisory Board lacked the powers to speed up the licensing process and there was an excessive level of bureaucracy involving the NDAB, the Blood Transfusion Service Board and the Department of Health's public health division. The expert group noted that the BTSB's anti-D was effectively without a valid product authorisation for a number of years and that the authorisation for such an important product was issued eventually on a retrospective basis <Col N="1421" /> because of the crisis in the licensing system.</P>
    <P>The report of the Expert Group on the Blood Transfusion Service Board of January 1995 states:</P>
    <P>We believe that the practice of authorising PAs retrospectively is undesirable, especially when long delays arise, as in the case of Anti-D. The Department has informed us that procedures have now been improved to ensure prompt processing of renewal applications so that the need for retrospection will not arise in the future.</P>
    <P>The new Bill is welcome as it should alleviate many of these problems. However, I have a number of concerns about it.</P>
    <P>The proposed legislation follows a study and recommendations by the expert group on the BTSB.  However, when Deputy O'Hanlon was Minister for Health in 1991, concerns were expressed by him and by the Department in relation to the NDAB.  At that time, if memory serves me right, the Government made a decision to change the NDAB and to give it the type of independence now being given under this Bill.</P>
    <P>One of the recommendations of the expert group was that the NDAB should take account of the assessments on products performed by regulatory agencies in other countries.  At present, the detailed nature of applications is one of the factors in the huge delays at the NDAB.  Applicants are required to submit extensive information on the product.  The board then undertakes medical and pharmaceutical assessments through two specialist committees, the Committee on Evaluation and Toxicity and the Committee on Drug Usage and Adverse Reaction.  They make their recommendations to the board which assesses the information before a recommendation can be made to the Minister for the granting of a product authorisation.</P>
    <P>The expert group said it would reduce the time taken to process applications <Col N="1422" /> for new and existing product authorisations if the board took account of the assessments performed by regulatory agencies in other countries.  The NDAB could then raise any supplementary issues it might wish to examine.  It said this would reduce the unnecessary duplication of assessments, while retaining the right and responsibility of the board to raise specific issues it considered relevant.</P>
    <P>The Minister does not appear to have taken this on board.  While new advisory committees will be appointed, will they be able to use assessments by other regulatory agencies?  It does not appear that they will be able to do so.  Will the Minister consider including this provision for the use of assessments by regulatory agencies in other countries on Committee Stage?</P>
    <P>There is considerable and extensive co-operation between the authorities here and those in the United Kingdom on many issues.  This should also extend to co-operation between the British Medicines Control Agency and the new Irish Medicines Board.</P>
    <P>The Bill does not make clear if the named patient arrangements will continue. This process operates under Article 5 of the Medical Preparations (Licensing, Advertisement and Sale) Regulations, 1984.  It provides an exemption from product authorisation requirements for the importation or sale of a medical preparation by or to a registered medical practitioner for the treatment of a particular patient.  The named patient system has been operated informally by the NDAB.</P>
    <P>The usual purpose of the named patient scheme is to help treat patients for whom authorised, commercially available, medical preparations would not offer a satisfactory treatment or in cases of new experimental drugs.  However, the system was used to introduce the replacement Anti-D product after the Blood Transfusion Service Board withdrew its product at the start of the Hepatitis C controversy.  The expert group on the Blood Transfusion Service Board said it did not believe the <Col N="1423" /> replacement Anti-D product came within the remit of the named patient system, as it is a widely used product.</P>
    <P>The expert group recommended that product authorisations should be processed speedily.  That is provided for in this Bill.  We welcome such an inclusion. The group also recommended that the named patient system should be put on a formal basis, but this does not appear to be included in the Bill.  Perhaps the Minister could clarify this.  It is important that the system be put on a formal footing and to make the regulations for the operation of the system more explicit as, at present, doctors and dentists are not obliged to notify the NDAB that they are importing a medicinal product.  This would make the circumstances in which products may be issued on that basis clear and unambiguous. As the regulations stand and with the precedent of using the replacement Anti-D product on a named patient basis, there is a great danger that the system might be used for some type of clinical trial.</P>
    <P>The expert group emphasised that the establishment of the new European Medicines Evaluation Agency would be of assistance to the NDAB in expediting applications.  Has the Minister taken this into account in the legislation?  What impact will the European dimension have on the staffing of the new Medicines Board?  Will it free up staff at the board and will it speed up the process? Will the European input lead to excessive bureaucracy, which many people believe it leads to in other areas?</P>
    <P>This brings me to the implications of the Bill for the management and staff of the new Medicines Board.  A new staffing structure will be necessary.  At present, the NDAB appears to have great difficulty in carrying out its functions in a satisfactory way as the structure, role and <i>modus operandi</i> of the board has not basically changed since the NDAB's establishment in 1966.  The problems will now be greater as a result of these additional powers.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1424" /> Perhaps the Minister could give details of the staffing plans and the current backlog at the NDAB.  I would also like him to give a commitment here today that the changes will only be introduced after extensive consultations with staff interests.  Details also need to be given of the plans for strengthening management structures at the new board, the plans for dealing with the backlogs and for the planned increases, if any, in the number of professionals at the Medicines Board.  The professionals, along with other members and categories of staff, will be under immense pressure with the new regime proposed.  It is important for the Minister to clearly spell out what changes will be made, how they will be implemented and how a consultation process, if it has not already begun, will be operated by the Department of Health.</P>
    <P>Can the Minister give an estimate of the additional cost of the changes which will be necessary because of the new legislation?  For example, are there plans for increases in fees?  There is a proposal to make the applicants for licences liable for all costs of the Medicines Board.  The power to charge fees under the terms of the Bill is unlimited. No matter what the activity is, the fees can be increased to cover the costs, according to the proposed legislation.  If there are to be changes and increased resources for the Medicines Board, does this mean that licence fees will rocket?</P>
    <P>Surely the Exchequer should make some contribution in this regard? Section 15 states &ldquo;The Minister may, in each financial year, after consultation with the Board in relation to its proposed work programme and expenditure for that year, make grants of such amount as may be sanctioned by the Minister for Finance&rdquo; available to the Medicines Board.  However, this needs to be teased out further to ensure that the cost of the operation of the board, particularly in areas which are outside its normal remit, is included.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1425" /> Healthcare, veterinary, pharmaceutical and medicine sectors are major contributors to employment here.  Today the Minister for Enterprise and Employment announced the expansion of an existing pharmaceutical company and welcomed the establishment of a new company.  During the past number of years members of successive Governments have repeatedly travelled abroad to entice companies involved in the pharmaceutical industry around the world to set up companies here.  Such companies will be interested in this legislation.  If they are asked to provide all the funding for the new restructured medicines board, that might make them less enthusiastic about Ireland as an alternative and attractive industrial location.  The Minister would not like that to happen as a result of the enactment of this Bill.  It might be more acceptable to make the sectors liable for the costs related to the registration of medicines, but not for unrelated activities of the board.</P>
    <P>It is unclear as to whether the medicines board will be able to build up financial resources.  Will the board get an annual grant from the Exchequer to expand its accommodation facilities since the present premises of the National Drugs Advisory Board require upgrading.  Perhaps the Minister plans to move the board to a new location. Will such accommodation costs be paid for directly by the Exchequer by way of a grant from the Minister's Department or will the board be expected to meet such costs by way of fees?</P>
    <P>The Bill lacks clarity regarding the Minister's accountability for the new medicines board.  Under the present system there is no doubt about the Minister's role.  The National Drugs Advisory Board advises him on precautions or restrictions subject to which drugs may be marketed or continued in use, the board reports to the Minister on general matters relating to drugs, it advises him on licensing, manufacture, importation, distribution and sale of drugs, on the standards of drug manufacturing practices and on the certification for the <Col N="1426" /> export of drugs.  Under the new Bill it is unclear where the buck stops.  The Minister appoints the board, but following that there appears to be no direct relationship.  As stated in the Bill, the board will file an annual report, but the Minister will not be responsible for the operations or policy of the medicines board.  That needs to be clarified.  Is the medicines board to be completely autonomous or will the Minister for Health have an input through the appointment to the board of, say, an official from the Department of Health who would directly represent the Minister on the board?</P>
    <P>If Members table parliamentary questions to the Minister regarding a problem that arises in the board, will they receive the standard reply which has been given in respect of newly established agencies, that the Minister no longer has responsibility for the day to day operations of a particular agency, that he decides on and will answer questions on policies, but will not be prepared to answer any on the operation of the agency?  We have learned a tough lesson from what happened in the Blood Transfusion Service Board recently.  I do not support the transfer of such a degree of accountability.  It would be incumbent &mdash; and if it is not specifically stated in the Bill, it should be written into it &mdash; that the Minister will have to answer for the board to the House.</P>
    <P>It should be possible to call the chief executive or director of the board before the Select Committee on Social Affairs, the Committee of Public Accounts or another committee of the House perhaps on an annual basis to account for his or her stewardship.  I have advocated that in and out of Government.  Sometimes Ministers must be answerable to the House for public officials who are responsible for the day to day operation of specific duties while those public officials are not answerable to anybody.  In this era of openness, transparency and accountability such a provision should be incorporated in the Bill.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1427" /> Who is legally accountable if something goes wrong?  What will happen if a person sues over the use of a drug or a company takes an action over a delay in processing an application?  Who provides legal indemnification?  As I am sure the new medicines board will have very few assets, will responsibility in that regard lie with the Minister and the State?  Will the Minister be responsible if a member of staff of the board takes an action?  Those matters should be clarified and we need to tease them out on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The public health division of the Department of Health has had a major input over the past 20 years into the licensing and product authorisation work of the National Drugs Advisory Board.  What will its role be when the medicines board will be the competent authority?  Will it be possible to use the expertise built up over a long number of years in the public health division of the Department under the new regime? There is no commitment in the Bill regarding the timescales for processing applications for licences and product authorisations.  It is desirable that best practice procedures should apply to legislation.  Will the Minister consider including in the Bill or in regulations the desired processing time for applications? That should be a key performance measure for any regulatory authority.</P>
    <P>The Bill does not include any commitment to consult the industries that will deal with the medicines board.  Those pharmaceutical, veterinary, healthcare and medical industries have a wealth of knowledge and expertise which they are willing to make available to the board. While appointments may be made to the board from the sectors, it is vital that an efficient communication forum should be established between the medicines board and the industry.  A general forum should be considered for an exchange of views with the relevant industries on a regular basis together with a formal system for consultation or communication of critical policy issues.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1428" /> The committees and boards to be appointed by the Minister should include representatives of the industries to ensure that processing of licence applications is not unnecessarily delayed.  While the Bill provides that the board shall not refuse to grant a licence for a new pharmaceutical product without first consulting an advisory committee, the representation of the relevant industries on the committee is an essential requirement.</P>
    <P>In the past one of the considerations in the issuing of licences was the cost of drugs.  It is believed that concern regarding costs and the implications for the Exchequer appear to have resulted in the Department of Health delaying approval of drugs recommended by the advisory committee of the National Drugs Advisory Board in the past.  Had the approval been given immediately, many patients may have benefited.  Will such budgetary considerations continue under the new medicines board?  Its work should be independent of budgetary constraints and Exchequer politics.</P>
    <P>At present the reporting arrangements of the National Drugs Advisory Board are most unsatisfactory.  The current advisory board has yet to publish its 1991 annual report.  I know from my experience in Government that from time to time every Taoiseach warns Ministers regarding agencies under his or her control and the fact that the publication of many annual reports are delayed for various reasons.  It would be useful if the Minister could indicate today or on Committee Stage when the annual reports for the last number of years will be made available.  It is important that such reports should be published and that the business of the National Drugs Advisory Board should be dealt with to ensure that the medicines board, which will take over the assets, liabilities and functions of the board, should not be made responsible for the annual reports of the National Drugs Advisory Board awaiting publication. The backlog of four annual reports is a matter of concern.  They <Col N="1429" /> should be published in a consolidated form as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for the new medicines board to file an annual report within six months of the year end, but a timeframe has not been set within which the Minister must publish the report. The Bill should be amended to provide that the Minister must lay the report before the Houses of the Oireachtas within a specified time after the end of the board's financial year.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil supports the Bill.  It is important in the context of public health and it is welcome as it has been overdue for some time.  It is correct that the medicines board should be the competent authority and it should be independent in the performance of its duties, but a number of matters to which I referred need to be clarified.  Amendments will probably be tabled to the Bill on Committee Stage before the new body is established.  I would like the Minister to clarify those issues and I hope he will be generous in addressing the concerns that will be expressed by Opposition Members during the course of the debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Progressive Democrats Party welcomes the introduction of the Bill.  Committee Stage debates are usually of great benefit in that they allow time for people with the necessary expertise to communicate with Members.  We do not have the requisite research facilities or professional knowledge to deal adequately with legislation such as this.  The Opposition insisted that some time should lapse between the publication of the Bill and its introduction in the House so that experts in the field could communicate with Members and indeed the Minister. As Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn stated, it is important that strong links are established between the medicines board and the industry.  The pharmaceutical industry is one of our most successful sectors. Goodwill between the board and the industry is worth fostering.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main purpose of the Bill is to establish a new medicines board that <Col N="1430" /> will take over the authority from the Minister to license medicines.  I share the concern that we must be sure about how far we delegate power.  As we are establishing yet another statutory body, perhaps we should examine how systems of accountability and responsibility are maintained by boards following the delegation of powers to them.  The blood bank scandal is a case in point. This Bill was possibly precipitated by the Hederman report which highlighted, in its review of the Blood Transfusion Service Board, the need to examine the role of the National Drugs Advisory Board in the supervision and licensing of blood products.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke about a recent review of the Blood Transfusion Service Board.  The word &ldquo;review&rdquo; is a euphemism to cover a multitude.  The public and Members of this House were shocked by the recent events in the Blood Transfusion Service Board.  Public confidence in it was diminished, but it is being won back by the way the Minister is dealing with compensation claims.  The enormity of what happened has not been debated in the House.  A total of 1,100 women, if not more, have been grievously wounded by the negligence of a State agency and, because of the enormity of the matter, the House has not debated it.  However, we can move on and learn from mistakes and I welcome this Bill which will tighten the supervision and inspection of, and reporting on, the processing of blood and blood products.  The board's lapse and inactivity on such matters resulted in the introduction of this Bill.</P>
    <P>The licensing of drugs is not a matter generally debated in the House, but people in the industry are concerned about the efficiency of the existing board and its capacity to perform its duties.  It has allowed a backlog to build up and many new drugs have not been introduced because of bureaucratic and administrative difficulties in the board. Many drugs introduced in other countries to deal with specific health problems are not available here.  I understand that some of those products are <Col N="1431" /> available only on a named patient basis. Because the companies involved are market driven and interested only in making money, it is understandable that they are not interested in introducing a drug for which there would be a low demand.  The Minister did not refer to this matter but it must be teased out on Committee Stage.  Some important drugs that are necessary for specific and rare diseases, because of their cost, are not available here.  In a market driven economy, the companies concerned do not feel obliged to introduce such drugs because of the low demand for them.</P>
    <P>This is a particular concern in the context of so-called orphan drugs which are compounds developed for rare conditions. In a small market multinationals will not push their development.  Legislation on such drugs was introduced in America a few years ago.  The existing board was also slow to facilitate clinical trials of new agents.  Multi-centre international trials are necessary to decide on the effectiveness of an agent.  I welcome the establishment of the new board.  A board comprising 18 members is unwieldy.  One comprising eight or nine members, as recommended in this case, would carry out its work much more efficiently.</P>
    <P>The Blood Transfusion Service Board deals mainly with the daily crisis management of running the blood transfusion service.  In the context of the safety and confidence of blood products it is vital that the highest possible standards apply to the licensing, testing and the introduction of drugs into the State. Of course, similar high standards are necessary in the context of blood products.</P>
    <P>Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn referred to a matter we raised recently with the Minister.</P>
    <P>In regard to parliamentary questions, I might cite an example of the National Roads Authority established to deal with all national routes when from time to time I needed to ask questions about the progress of a given road within my constituency.  Yet there is no method by <Col N="1432" /> which one can pose such a question here because the Minister has had no responsibility for our national routes since the establishment of the National Roads Authority.  This has led to a democratic deficit.  A statutory board such as that being established under this Bill, with very important delegated powers in terms of public health, should be accountable or answerable to this House in some fashion.  Perhaps the Minister would examine that suggestion.</P>
    <P>Looking back on the scandal surrounding the Blood Transfusion Service Board, it is most important that questions be asked in this House and, more importantly, adequately answered.  That leads me to the danger of asking questions here in relation to such a possible disaster.  I wonder, if Opposition spokespersons had been asking questions about allegations of bad management on the part of the Blood Transfusion Service Board at the time, would they have been accepted, adequately answered and would it have been possible for a committee of the House to investigate the matter.  As it transpired, the disaster was discovered in another way.  I doubt whether we would have been able to obtain replies which would have disclosed all that was revealed in the subsequent Hederman-O'Brien report.  As we discovered recently, it appears the Government felt constrained in answering parliamentary questions which might have found fault with a third party.</P>
    <P>Had Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn and/or I been asking questions about the Blood Transfusion Service Board at the time, I wonder if in answering such questions truthfully, the Government might have left itself open to a huge compensatory claim against it and/or the board.  It leaves me wondering whether we would have got to the bottom of the matter in terms of accountability for the management of a most important public health facility.  For that reason the Minister should consider just how far he wants to go in delegating these important powers to a new statutory body.  For example, quite apart from presenting us with an <Col N="1433" /> annual report, perhaps he might devise some mechanism to ensure greater accountability to this House.</P>
    <P>In the short interval since the publication of this Bill there have been some responses from the pharmaceutical industry or people who know a lot about it and those involved in veterinary medicine.  Adequate time should be allowed before Committee Stage to enable such people contact Opposition Members to express their views.</P>
    <P>An important point was raised by Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn about liability, about who would be held to be liable if and when things went wrong.  I should like to know what would happen in such circumstances because, as we have witnessed on many occasions, there can be huge implications when something does go wrong.  There is need for greater clarity with regard to legal responsibility and just how far the Minister's responsibility goes.</P>
    <P>The Minister indicated that the Irish Medicines Board will be self-financing. This begs the question of just how self-financing will it be in practical terms. The self-financing requirement is laudable, but I wonder what will be the position if the board encounters difficulties in maintaining high standards while complying with this requirement.</P>
    <P>I welcome the streamlining of the licensing system and the fewer number of board members, which should ensure their being workmanlike and professional. I hope Committee Stage will not be taken very soon.  While I know the Minister is anxious to have the Bill pass all Stages, it would benefit from a reasonably thorough Committee Stage examination.  I hope the Minister and his officials will be available to brief Opposition spokespersons on a whole range of issues, particularly those relating to blood products.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch" hpid="Kathleen Lynch Kathleen Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Kathleen Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Last April the Minister for Health announced the establishment of a tribunal to settle compensation claims for women infected with hepatitis C through Anti D products. Since then there have been indications <Col N="1434" /> that hepatitis C infection extended beyond that group and may include people who received blood transfusions in the normal course of their medical treatment.  It is clear that the whole matter of the safety of blood products is very much more complicated than had originally been thought.  Indeed, we are still discovering more about the problem about to confront us.</P>
      <P>When the Hederman-O'Brien report was published the Minister for Health gave a commitment that he would act on its recommendations as soon as possible. This Bill is part and parcel of that process.  I hope we shall have an opportunity to formally thank the members of the Hederman-O'Brien committee.  It was an eye-opening experience for any woman who found herself possibly infected by immunoglobulin.  I had personal experience of that.  I was very lucky and escaped, despite having been in the high-risk category.  I am sure most women finding themselves in my circumstances would be eternally grateful to the Hederman-O'Brien committee, as I was and remain, and grateful to the Blood Transfusion Service Board, because our pregnancies up to that point had been rather perilous.  Most women, if and when faced with the choice, would have opted for a healthy pregnancy.  Therefore, I continue to be extremely grateful for the progress made in relation to Anti D and immunoglobulin. In that respect I think I speak for the majority of women in the rhesusnegative bracket since the late sixties/early seventies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am delighted the Minister has moved not only to replace the National Drugs Advisory Board but to streamline the supervisory procedures in regard to blood products and derivatives.  It is only during the past couple of years that we have become aware of the problems of infection and contamination associated with blood products, as we have also become aware that medical advances carry inherent problems.  the saying: &ldquo;Not every cloud has a silver lining&rdquo; is as true as the opposite, because, along with progress, we shall <Col N="1435" /> experience new problems with which we need to be able to cope.  As medical science advances and the use of such products increases, we shall become even more aware of potential dangers.  It is my belief that the provisions of this Bill anticipate many such problems by putting in place the necessary structures for early detection and by a recognition of the need to adjust to and deal with such contingencies.</P>
    <P>Recent events surrounding the Blood Transfusion Service Board have highlighted the need for an independent body with the requisite expertise in the processing of blood and blood products, which role will be fulfilled by the Irish Medicines Board.</P>
    <P>There will be teething problems, as is always the case when a new board is established.  However, because of the expertise of those appointed to the board, any problems that might arise will be quickly addressed.  The members of the board are experts in their own fields.  A board such as this should have been in place a long time ago rather than having a political master being advised by experts and then making a decision on whether to issue a licence. Had that procedure been public knowledge, and the problems that were associated with it, most people would have found it extraordinary.  I make that statement without any malicious intent.</P>
    <P>The Minister has taken an opportunity to establish a comprehensive and accountable system for the licensing of medicines and the granting of permission to conduct clinical trials.  He has ensured that the licensing and assessment functions, previously divided between the Minister and the NDAB, are brought together under one authority. That is a sensible suggestion which arose out of the Hederman-O'Brien report, although that is not referred to in the Bill.  In years to come we will continue to be grateful to that committee and its investigation.</P>
    <P>Pharmaceuticals are increasingly subject to European legislation and the new board will be well placed to ensure we <Col N="1436" /> comply with EU regulations in this area. I welcome the Minister's assurance that the board will co-operate closely with the new European agency for the evaluation of medicinal products.  We must be able to act quickly and with knowledge in regard to new products and clinical testing and be in a position to link in with the research and development available in other countries.  The board will play its role in that regard.</P>
    <P>European and Irish markets are currently being deluged with a bewildering variety of pharmaceutical and generic products.  The increase in supply, however, has not been matched by a similar increase in consumer information. Over the counter products are bought with little or no information being made available to the consumer as to their possible side effects and contraindications.  Package inserts, demanded by law in most European jurisdictions, are often absent and the information available is often incomprehensible to the lay man or woman.  That area must be addressed.</P>
    <P>We must have scientific information available to us when we examine particular products.  The products most widely used, however, are those that can be bought without a doctor's prescription. Consumers are often unaware of the side effects, which can be disastrous in some cases.  Those side effects are becoming more evident.  We must examine the problem of drug dependency in our society.  People often want a quick fix and they take a tablet for every minor problem.  We now have a population who will live well into their eighties and it is important that we develop a more holistic approach to our lives.</P>
    <P>Medicines were developed to help us but we should not become dependent on them.  We must develop a healthier attitude to medicine, its benefits and adverse side effects and that attitude should be developed from an early age. We must inform the public that the availability of drugs without a doctor's prescription does not necessarily mean those drugs are entirely safe or that they <Col N="1437" /> can be used at will.  I hope this issue will be addressed by the new medicines board.  The Bill provides for the Minister to make such regulations as he sees fit in the whole area of pharmaceutical supply and distribution and I urge him to address also the area of consumer information.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Moffatt</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to have an opportunity to contribute to the debate on this Bill.  The Bill has been in the pipeline for some time.  In 1991, the then Minister for Health, Deputy O'Hanlon, intended bringing forward such a Bill.  It has been introduced with some haste but I nevertheless welcome it because it will be of benefit to patients, doctors, the pharmaceutical industry, members of the veterinary profession, those working in the horse racing area &mdash; in which Deputy McGahon has a great interest &mdash; and the medical devices sector.</P>
      <P>I pay tribute to the National Drugs Advisory Board for its excellent work. It has an excellent reputation and, in that regard, I wish to mention Dr. Scott and Dr. Maura Burns in particular.  It has been said that the NDAB was somewhat tardy in issuing licences but that was to our benefit on some occasions in that certain products which were injurious to both man and beast were not allowed into this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The task of assessing and licensing medicines has become more difficult in recent years due to expansion in this field.  Many developments have taken place in biotechnology, immunology, genetic engineering and the general medical devices currently available.  The new board will not only have to take on the task of the NDAB but it must also involve itself in the areas of blood components and products.  That is a whole new area and I do not know whether the board will act as a monitoring agent or have a hands on effect.  It is an area of which the previous board had no experience. In many other European countries this area is the responsibility of a specific board.  The Minister should consider whether it is advisable to include <Col N="1438" /> it in the Bill, but if it is properly monitored I do not see any problems arising.</P>
    <P>The new European Medicines Agency was recently established in London. There has been liaison with that agency in an effort to get the new agency here up and running.  It was thought initially that the London agency would be of benefit to us in the long term but much of its work will be distributed among the sub-agencies in the various EU member states, including Ireland.</P>
    <P>I note that, for the first time, the chairperson of the board will receive a salary.  That is a welcome development.  I believe the chairperson should be someone from the medical profession because 80 per cent of the board's work will involve dealing with medicines affecting people; the other 20 per cent will involve dealing with medicines setting up of committees is also welcome, but I hope they will not be too cumbersome.  The composition of the board is not specified, but I would like to see a good mix between medics, veterinary surgeons, pharmacists and people involved in public health.  The chief executive officer is mainly a manager, and that is as it should be.  I am glad the workers on the old board will be transferred <i>in toto</i> to the new operation and will not suffer hardship.</P>
    <P>The fees charged should equal the total expenditure of administering this Act.  As the work of this agency will have more to do with the adverse effects of drugs on people and will also be dealing with blood and blood components, the pharmaceutical industry should not be expected to take on all the expenditure of running it.  Having said that, our fees should not be exorbitant because we must try to entice pharmaceutical industries to Ireland.</P>
    <P>It was said that the previous board was tardy.  I hope we will not have the same problem with this board and that the number of advisory staff attached to it will not lead to procrastination in regard to licences.  Is there an appeal <Col N="1439" /> mechanism which would allow an application to be examined in a different light if a licence is denied?</P>
    <P>On the question of how the board will work, there is more emphasis on the monetary aspect than on quality control. That is another deficiency in the Bill.  The board should be judged on how it is working as a quality control agency rather than just on how much money it will make for the national coffers. However, there is a possibility that this board could sell its expertise abroad.  There are many third world countries that do not have the same expertise and they are anxious that certain drugs and pharmaceutical products should not enter their countries without due scrutiny.  In that area the board might bring some money into the country. It is another aspect I would like the Minister to examine.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  However, I have some reservations about funding.  I would also welcome it if the Minister were to examine the blood components aspect of it because the board has no previous experience in this area.  It is a new departure and many more specialists, haematologists etc., will be needed. The old board was tardy about issuing licences because it did not have enough personnel and support.  It would be a shame if the same thing happened to this board, particularly when it will be taking on a new area relating to blood and blood components.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. T. Ahearn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this long overdue Bill and I am delighted it is supported on all sides of the House.  Any Bill dealing with public health should be taken seriously and given careful consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill proposes to replace the National Drugs Advisory Board with a new body to be called the Irish Medicines Board.  The National Drugs Advisory Board was set up in 1966, and it is fair to acknowledge its excellent work over the years.  Perhaps it was slow at times, but when dealing with drugs and <Col N="1440" /> matters of national health it is safer to be prudent than to make hasty decisions and have regrets later.  I congratulate the board on its work.</P>
    <P>With the emergence of the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medical Products, we should keep abreast of changes on the European scene.  The National Drugs Advisory Board acted in an advisory capacity but the power to issue licences lay with the Minister.  This was the essence of bureaucracy.  The work will be carried out more effectively and with greater speed by the new agency proposed in this Bill.</P>
    <P>This new body will be very important because the quality and the safety of our medicines will depend on its evaluation and judgment, and I wish it well.  I represent a constituency that has two very important chemical companies, Merck Sharp and Dohme and Clonmel Chemicals, without which many important drug products would not be available. On a recent visit to Merck Sharp and Dohme, I was astounded by the amount of money it is prepared to plough back into the production of new drugs and the assessment of its present products. It continually evaluates and assesses medical needs.  The same is true of the local company, Clonmel Chemicals.  We tend to look at companies like those on the basis of their economic value to the local community rather than the value of what they produce.  From an economic point of view such companies are valuable, but one has to go inside their doors to realise the tremendous work they do in the area of health.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge the work done by the two companies in my constituency.  We could not provide the resources necessary for research without which many new health products would not be developed.  The female Members of the House tend to speak on the safety of blood products because of the experience with Anti-D.  As a result of either mismanagement, miscalculation or misfortune 1,037 women have been affected and will bear this tragedy for the rest of their lives.  I have spoken to many of <Col N="1441" /> them through their effective organisation, Positive Action.  In spite of their suffering, the future they face, the impact it has had on some of their marriages and children they have adopted a fair and realistic approach.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister for Health on the speed with which he set up the tribunal and hope the victims will be satisfied with the assessments made.  It is a human tragedy with which they must live.  We will also have to live with it as we bear ultimate responsibility for it.  These women should be catered for in a caring and humane way.  I congratulate the Minister on the priority he has afforded to these women and their families.  I assure them that we do not see their tragedy ending with the agreements that emerge from the tribunal. They must continue to be our concern during their lifetime.</P>
    <P>I hope the board will be successful. Boards that have a smaller membership are usually more effective than those with a larger one.  Membership of the new board will be limited to nine members rather than 18.  It is important that appointees serve the best interests of people and contribute positively to decisions made.  The new board will be streamlined and this will help eliminate the present cumbersome system where the National Drugs Advisory Board was an advisory board to the Minister and the Minister had power to grant a licence.</P>
    <P>I share Deputy O'Donnell's concern about devolving power to a board.  I, too, have had the experience of tabling questions to a Minister only to receive the reply that the Minister has no function in the matter.  This hinders the input we can make as elected representatives. It is easier to contact a Minister's office than it is to find out who makes the decision on some of these boards.</P>
    <P>Our experience of the National Roads Council in south Tipperary is that it is impossible to meet with it. Irrespective of what party is in Government Ministers will receive deputations and visit constituencies.  Last week I <Col N="1442" /> tabled a question on grants to the hotel industry and was told that, as a new authority had been established, the Minister had no function in the matter and was unable to provide the information. Boards are given important powers and responsibilities.  They should be open and provide information to public representatives.</P>
    <P>The Bill, which I welcome, has received all party support.  I am sure the Minister will consider any amendments that may be proposed.  I hope there will be no undue delay and that the staff will not be disadvantaged by establishment of the view board.  I look forward to the board helping to provide a good, effective health service.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the remarks made by Deputies Quill, O'Donnell and Ahearn that the establishment of a new board can have the effect of preventing Members obtaining information. However, it is not unknown and it is becoming increasingly more common in the House for Members to be prevented from receiving information on matters that come within the ambit of the Minister. I asked the Minister for Finance for information on the amount of tax outstanding by publicans who use the tax clearance certificate procedure.  There are not that many publicans in the country and the information should be available. I received a reply indicating that resources and the amount of time involved in compiling a reply did not warrant giving the information.  I received a similar reply when I asked about the ownership of fishery rights in Mayo.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The NDAB, Bord Fáilte and the IDA are most forthcoming in facilitating me with information and at times they push me to propose improvements to legislation. I fully endorse the genuine concerns expressed regarding the establishment of another vehicle which could at times be used by Ministers and Ministers of State to only give information <Col N="1443" /> on policy and not on day to day functions. I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate and the recognition of the need to upgrade the NDAB from a statutory and regulatory point of view.  It is good that Ireland espouses the highest standards for the administration and manufacture of medicines and their supply to the consumer.  We compete for mobile international investment in the pharmaceutical industry worldwide.  The industries already here and those which will be attracted want proper statutory provision and formal recognition given to the national licensing authority.  The highest possible standards are demanded of this industry so that it can develop with the confidence that slipshod standards are unacceptable.</P>
    <P>The pharmaceutical industry is a valuable employer.  It has particular concentrations in Cork, the midlands, Dublin, Limerick and, I am pleased to say, my town of Westport where Allergan Pharmaceuticals employs almost 700 people. Of the product manufactured in Ireland, 54 per cent is exported to European countries, 20 per cent to North America, 16 per cent to southeast Asia and 7 per cent to east European countries.  It makes a major contribution to our export earnings and it is at the cutting edge of knowledge.  It has a higher level of investment in research as a percentage of turnover than almost any other industry and it must make ongoing investment in plant and machinery to keep up with worldwide competition. Many pharmaceutical companies manufacturing in Ireland, which are in the main United States companies, also have sister companies located in Europe and elsewhere.  Low cost manufacturing nations and emerging new markets which have opened up their frontiers to multinationals, such as China, are competing for this investment.  Any legislative or regulatory framework which adds to confidence in the level of high standards in the industry must be welcomed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1444" /> However, there must be a parallel commitment to ensure that any gap in resources or manpower is tackled.</P>
    <P>The Bill's explanatory memorandum refers to the transfer of authority from the Minister to the Irish Medicines Board, the authority which licenses human medicines.  The NDAB was responsible not only for human medicines but also veterinary medicines.  One of the four committees under the old board dealt with veterinary medicines, while the others dealt with clinical trials, pharmacology and toxicology.  Does section 4 (d) confer the powers to deal with veterinary drugs?  Perhaps the Minister could clarify this point in his reply.  If it does include veterinary drugs, what is the position with regard to veterinary vaccines, which I understand do not fall within the ambit of the NDAB? Who is responsible for their testing and regulation?  I ask the Minister to clarify this point also.</P>
    <P>A huge range of drugs and medicinal products are on the market.  Some of these are long established but, under European legislation, they must all be subject to authorisation and licensing if they are to remain on the market.  As other Deputies mentioned, there is a serious backlog of licensing, particularly with regard to veterinary products.  In May 1995, 1,790 veterinary applications were received, of which 589 were dealt with and authorisations issued; 302 were withdrawn by companies because they did not meet initial criteria, while 78 were refused authorisations.  A total of 824 were referred for further assessment to committee No. 3, which deals with toxicology, and 789 were referred to committee No. 1, which deals with pharmacology and 750 applications are awaiting authorisation.  I do not have the figures for human medicines but I accept those of Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn who referred to in excess of 1,000 applications awaiting authorisation.  I assume, therefore, that approximately 250 applications are awaiting authorisation on the human side, while there are 750 applications on the veterinary side.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1445" /> The Minister has been asked for clarification in this regard.</P>
    <P>It is true some products, which require authorisation but which have not yet been considered, continue to be sold on the market.  It is important that all applications are dealt with quickly. Old product on the market can show problems, which did not appear previously, when it is has been retested or subjected to new criteria.</P>
    <P>The expert group on the Blood Transfusion Service Board indicated that the extension on an informal basis of additional functions to the board led to an increased delay in product authortisation. Under the Bill, the inspection of the collection, processing and distribution of blood, blood components and products and plasma derivatives, together with the extension of functions, will add to the workload of the new Irish Medicines Board.</P>
    <P>There has not been a corresponding commitment to provide additional resources or staff.  I understand there are approximately 50 highly skilled employees, between professional and clerical staff, working under the old board.  They have a grave responsibility in terms of the licensing of human medicines and they must receive additional resources.  If a member of the existing professional staff takes leave of absence he must be replaced and the time required to train additional staff is at least one year, given the sophistication and expertise required in this field. Since we operate in a market of free movement of people and goods, procedures must be introduced to avail of the expertise and assessments carried out by other regulatory bodies in other European countries.  My colleague, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, referred to this aspect in detail.  I understand a pharmaceutical company can now get a CE marking for new product.  This is the European quality standard and allows the introduction of that product to other European countries rapidly and without the former lengthy delays.  This marking is of a much higher standard than the ISO 9000 or ISO 9002.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1446" /> As this only applies to new product, and one must recognise that not many new products come on the market, the biggest problem relates to existing products which must be reauthorised at five year intervals.  Many companies some of which produce up to 1,000 separate products require individual authorisations from each licensing authority. Despite the fact that licensing should only take into account the propriety of the product from the point of view of its effects on human beings, there is a suspicion in the pharmaceutical industry that some countries, such as France, are delaying authorisation and creating difficulties for the placement of Irish manufactured product if an industry in France could suffer economically from its introduction.</P>
    <P>If that is correct, I ask the Minister to investigate any such complaints at European level.  He will appreciate that pharmaceutical companies may be slow to make such complaints, given that they operate in a very open and mobile market. However, that complaint has been made to me and the Minister should take it on board.  I can understand another country operating procedures, such as those laid down in the Bill, to protect an existing industry which may be subject to Irish competition. However, one must recognise that the Irish competition is often owned by a US pharmaceutical company which uses Ireland as a base to penetrate the European market.</P>
    <P>While this legislation is straightforward, the day to day workings of the board and its relationship with other European agencies and manufacturing concerns is complex.  As legislators, the most important thing we can do is ensure the new agency can adequately operate without being stretched in terms of manpower or resources and that previous practices are improved to worldwide acceptable standards.  To use an analogy, we will end up with the same tuppence ha'penny worth if this Bill does nothing more than dismantle an old car and put back the old engine and expect it to run twice as fast.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1447" /> The extension of functions under the Bill was referred to and there was a particular reference to blood.  The expert report on the Blood Transfusion Service Board referred to the fact that the extension of functions on an informal basis over the years created a backlog in product application.  In the <i>Irish Medical News</i> of 26 June 1995, Dr. John Kelly, the newly appointed chief executive of the National Drugs Advisory Board commenting on the legislation for the Irish Medicines Board said it will mean a significant increase in the level of responsibility for the board, and that if it goes according to the Minister's intentions it will involve them in quite a lot of work.</P>
    <P>In an article on evaluating ongoing safety of medicines and assessing how a drug performs, in the <i>Irish Medical Times</i> of 16 June 1995, Dr. John Kelly stated:</P>
    <P>According to the Board's most recently published statistics &mdash; for 1990 &mdash; GPs accounted for about 36 per cent and consultants and NCHDs for about 15 per cent of all adverse reactions reports.</P>
    <P>As part of increasing the reporting of adverse reactions, the Board may consider a specially designed information pack and changes to alter the so-called &ldquo;yellow card&rdquo; system by which doctors and other health professionals report adverse reactions to the Board.</P>
    <P>When doctors see something that may be an adverse reaction, the question we have to ask is, &ldquo;Do they recognise it as an adverse reaction, do they document it, and do they report it?&rdquo; he said.</P>
    <P>Dr. Kelly said that the Board itself must increase its own level of exposure among the profession.  He suggested that the Board publish a newsletter to alert doctors to potential safety and efficacy concerns that arise over medicines.</P>
    <P>According to the Board's most recent annual report &mdash; for the year <Col N="1448" /> 1990 &mdash; delays in new product authorisations were running at an average of 25 months.</P>
    <P>That is in excess of two years whereas the European average is one year.  I support Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn's remarks on that and I suspect the reason there have been no reports since then is that the existing professional staff are stretched dealing with product authorisation and do not have the time to produce annual reports.  Annual reports are important.  Dr. Kelly also stated that more than 1,000 products were awaiting licensing renewal at the end of 1990.  He said he hoped the board and its proposed successor &mdash; the National Medicines Agency &mdash; would be able to expand computer information systems to curb delays in product authorisations and renewals and to eliminate from delay calculations those delays caused by drug companies.</P>
    <P>The National Drugs Advisory Board has 1,000 applications awaiting, new products are slowly coming onstream and existing products will require renewal in due course.  A single application can run to thousands of pages and the National Drugs Advisory Board has up to 8,000 files on hand at any time, we need computerisation and computer literate personnel to fast track these applications.  When will further resources be made available for this work?  Otherwise, to use an analogy it is simply putting an old engine in a car and expecting it to run twice as fast.  We would be only fooling ourselves.  I know the Minister will respond to the concerns raised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this very important Bill.  As legislators we have a duty to protect the public from unscrupulous drug manufacturers.  That may sound harsh but I have no doubt <Col N="1449" /> that a load of rubbish is being pushed on an unsuspecting public through advertising on television and in glossy magazines.  There are claims of cures for every ache imaginable and that certain remedies will prevent grey hair.  In that regard I am glad my colleague Deputy McGahon has not been fooled.  In any reasonably sized supermarket, large shelf area is taken up with remedies and an unsuspecting public is prepared to buy these products and possibly get hooked on them.  I wonder what tests have been carried on these products.  It is noticeable that the name of the product is in banner headlines but that the print listing the ingredients is so small it cannot be read.  We have a duty to ensure that the claims in advertisements can be upheld.  The amount spent on advertising and promotion indicates that there is a consumer for the product but the consumer needs to be protected. There are good drugs and well known remedies for the common cold can be found in any kitchen cupboard.</P>
      <P>It is necessary to draw attention to the issue of blood products.  Women who went into hospital for a blood transfusion have been affected by contaminated blood products.  They placed their faith in the doctor and the hospital but were given contaminated blood products and now their lives are in turmoil and they must be compensated. The people who allowed contaminated blood to pass through the system must be held responsible.  I understand also that the storage conditions for blood were very unsuitable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Veterinary medicine is a wide field. The modern farmer with his green certificate in farming, has syringes and veterinary medicine on hand.  However, how long should an animal be retained on the farm after being treated by the farmer?  Is this monitored?  It will be maintained that farmers are careful, by and large most are but there are still cases where ruthless people are prepared to use the deadly drug angel dust and put lives at risk.  Recently we saw the efforts that some people went to to prevent departmental officials removing <Col N="1450" /> samples from a factory.  People will tell me that everything is under control but that is not the case.  Ruthless people will exploit the situation and veterinary medicine is wide open to exploitation. The veterinary surgeon may recommend a certain dosage but some farmers will double the dose in the belief that it will speed up the cure but that may do more harm.  Matters must be regulated. We must ensure that animals are not sent to the factory after treatment until it is safe to do so and that there is a system in the factory to double check that.</P>
    <P>I do not want to cast aspersions on the outgoing board because I have no doubt it did its best but a number of failures in the system have come to light.  If the new board is not able to correct that and prevent it from being repeated it too will have failed.  The public must be confident that the product they buy will live up to its claim, nothing more, nothing less.  If we can do that we will have achieved success.  I wish the Minister every success in ensuring that will happen.</P>

      <P>I know more about the racing Bill than this Bill, as Deputy Moffatt is aware.  I welcome the Bill if for no other reason than by amalgamating the two boards it will remove a tier of bureaucracy from a country which is awash with it.</P>
      <P>This board which will replace the National Drugs Advisory Board will become the licensing authority for both human and veterinary medicines.  This is a practical common sense approach.  It is proposed to reduce the membership of the board from 18 to nine.  I hope we practise what we preached in Opposition and will not make any political appointments to the board.  The members should be well versed in the pharmaceutical and veterinary professions and should be selected purely on the basis of their professional qualifications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Boylan that there is a shady trade, so to speak, in the pharmaceutical industry.  The Border is <Col N="1451" /> being used by those involved in the lucrative trade of smuggling from Holland and other European countries.  In this context I would highlight the flood of ecstasy tablets into the country and the growing addiction of young people to this terrible drug.  I hope the new board will have a policing function which includes the strict monitoring of sales outlets and liaison with the customs authority in policing the Border.</P>
    <P>The board will take over responsibility for granting permission to conduct clinical trials.  I must confess that I am very ignorant of what happens in these trials and I ask the Minister to outline what they entail.  I assume they are guinea pig experiments on animals and I would like to know if humans take part in them, whether they are paid, where they take place, how they are supervised and the criteria used for selecting participants. These matters are kept under wraps and the public has a right to know about them.</P>
    <P>The board will be responsible for administering the blood transfusion service. It is desirable that a specialist body should monitor the processing of blood and blood products.  Given the recent tragic cases involving hepatitis and the tragedy which befell many people as a result of slipshod practices, this matter must be a priority for the board.</P>
    <P>I support the Bill which has been given a general welcome by the Opposition parties and the pharmaceutical industry.  It makes sense to establish a medicines board to bring us into line with the advancements in this area in Europe.</P>

      <P>I thank the Deputies who contributed to the debate.  This may appear to be a relatively straightforward and routine Bill but it is important to give it due consideration in the House.  The debate was focused and constructive and many important points were made.  This Bill has been brought forward to deal with the issue of human and animal medicines, clinical trials etc.  It is our best shot, so to speak, and if Opposition Deputies put down Committee Stage amendments which improve it I will be willing to accept them.  I will consider in detail the points made between now and Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>Many of the points made by Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn related to the future operation of the Irish Medicines Board, for example, its staffing, professional requirements and its relationship with the European agency.  I wish to stress that the Bill essentially provides a legal framework for the restructuring of the National Drugs Advisory Board and is, therefore, only part of the picture. Obviously it is of great importance that the organisation, systems and structures within the NDAB are updated in preparation for the transition to the new board.  This work is in progress and the board has appointed management consultants to assist in determining the most appropriate organisation, procedures and staffing to meet the future needs of the Irish Medicines Board.</P>

    <P>Its terms of reference are to recommend appropriate organisation, management, staffing and internal reporting structures for the proposed Irish Medicines Board; to recommend systems for ensuring that applications are dealt with effectively within the prescribed time limits; to consider the implications for the board of the likely evolution of the <Col N="1453" /> centralised EU system for registration of medicines; to recommend options for a fee structure designed to ensure that the activities of the board are self-financing, that a regular income is achieved and that adequate and effective accounting systems are in place. This work will be completed shortly and, together with the Bill, will ensure that the new board is ready and able to deal effectively with the complex and every changing demands associated with ensuring the quality and safety of medicines.</P>
    <P>Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn raised some concerns about the provisions of the Bill which relate to the self-financing nature of the board.  It is important to note that it has been the specific intention from the outset that this should be the case.  The original Government decision that a new board should be established was made in 1991 by the then Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government.  That decision specified that the board should be self-financing. This was also accepted by the Government in agreeing the Bill.  It is important to note that the licence fees approximate to the costs.  It is also important to note that the pharmaceutical industry is on record as stating its willingness to bear additional costs, if this is necessary, to streamline the licensing system.  As Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn pointed out, the transitional costs may require special consideration. This is one of the reasons we have included section 15 which allows for Exchequer funding.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies have raised the question of the accountability of the board and the Minister.  As with any State board, the Minister will have the ultimate responsibility and will be answerable to the House for the board's performance.  He will exercise this responsibility in the same was as every Minister does in relation to the boards under his or her jurisdiction &mdash; for example, through board appointments and the reporting arrangements set out in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputies will note that a number of <Col N="1454" /> paragraphs of section 4, specifically paragraphs (h), (j), (k), (m) and (n) set out these reporting arrangements.  They will also note the provisions on financial accountability set out in section 18 and the formal reporting requirements set out in section 19.</P>
    <P>I understand and share the concerns of Deputies regarding the supply of medicines on a named patient basis. However, work is already in hand in the Department of Health to draft amendments to the Medical Preparations (Licensing, Sale and Advertising) Regulations, 1994, which will put the supply of the named patient medicines on a more formalised basis.  It is intended that these amendments will be made when the regulations are being revised, as will be necessary following the establishment of the new board.</P>
    <P>Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn mentioned there was an impression that the Department of Health had on occasion delayed the approval of a drug which had been recommended by the board due to the financial implications for the Department's expenditure on drugs. While the Deputy did not say she herself believed this to be the case, it would be unfair to the Department if I did not respond to this suggestion.  I am assured by the Department that such a decision has never been taken; indeed, the reverse is the case.  The Department has, on occasion, facilitated and paid for the supply of new and, as yet, unlicensed drugs through the GMS scheme on the named patient basis.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge there have been delays in the publication of the annual reports of the National Drugs Advisory Board and that such delays are unacceptable.  I understand the publication of the outstanding reports is imminent but I will examine the position further and clarify it on Committee Stage.  I draw the attention of the House to section 19.  As soon as may be after the end of each financial year, but not later than six months thereafter, the board shall make a report to the Minister on its activities during that year and the Minister shall cause copies of the report to be laid <Col N="1455" /> before each House of the Oireachtas. The position is improving in regard to the National Drugs Advisory Board and I will have more detailed information on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The matter of backlogs in the National Drugs Advisory Board was also raised.  Major progress has been made in dealing with the backlog of renewals.  Additional staff were recruited on a temporary basis and new procedures put in place to deal with the backlog, which has been greatly reduced.  We must continue to reduce the backlog even further.  The establishment of the new board is part of the process in creating a more efficient licensing system.</P>
    <P>Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn raised the matter of reliance on other regulatory agencies.  While it might seem desirable to have regard to the licensing assessments of other regulatory authorities, the board must satisfy itself on the safety, quality and efficacy of medicines. Anything less would be unacceptable to the Irish consumer.  Nonetheless, under new European procedures, it will be possible from 1998, under a decentralised system, to have greater regard to licences that come from other member states.  This should speed up the licensing process.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies made suggestions about the composition of the board.  The membership of the National Drugs Advisory Board, because of its advisory role, comprised a wide range of technical experts.  As the new board will be primarily management in character, its membership should be more compact and reflect the managerial responsibilities while also including some persons of acknowledged expertise in the area of drug regulation and usage.  The role of the members of the board will be to set clear aims and objectives and to monitor progress towards the achievement of these targets, including the quality objectives that must form part of these targets.  More specifically, it will have responsibility to ensure that adequate <Col N="1456" /> procedures are in place for the assessment of applications for licences, permissions for inspections, information giving, record keeping and other functions of the board.  While responsible in corporate law for its actions, it will discharge its functions in a supervisory fashion.  Many other points have been raised, but in the time available I will be unable to deal with them.  I thank all Deputies who contributed to this debate and assure them that all the points made will be fully examined between now and Committee Stage.  The Government will not be found wanting where amendments emerge that would improve the legislation.</P>

    <P>The following motion was moved by Deputy Éamon Ó Cúiv on Tuesday, 4 July 1995:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That Dáil Éireann,</P>
    <P>&mdash; acknowledging the constructive role played by both Loyalist and Republican prisoners in the calling and sustaining of the two ceasefires over the past ten months,</P>
    <P>&mdash; welcoming the positive steps taken by successive Irish Governments since last autumn to begin the phased release of politically motivated prisoners who are <Col N="1457" /> members of paramilitary organisations and looking forward to further steps before the end of the year with a view to clearing the majority of prisoners in the reasonably near future.</P>
    <P>&mdash; welcoming also decisions by the German authorities to release such prisoners in the light of the present situation and</P>
    <P>&mdash; supporting the efforts of the Irish Government in the Anglo-Irish Conference and between the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister to achieve progress on these issues,</P>
    <P>calls on the British Government to play a positive role by addressing, without further delay, issues relating to prisoners, as a means of contributing to confidence in the peace process, in particular to</P>
    <P>&mdash; legislate, as a first step, to restore 50 per cent remission to prisoners in the North to come into effect before Christmas,</P>
    <P>&mdash; treat prisoners convicted of crime equally, regardless of whether they come from the security forces in Britain or the North or from paramilitary organisations,</P>
    <P>&mdash; reverse all other punitive measures introduced in the course of the troubles and to implement the recommendations of the SACHR report, in particular the full restoration of electoral rights once prisoners have been released,</P>
    <P>&mdash; investigate and order judicial review as a matter of urgency of all cases where a <i>prima facie</i> miscarriage of justice may have occurred,</P>
    <P>&mdash; expedite the transfer of prisoners from British jails to jails throughout Ireland under the transfer of prisoners convention, where applicable,</P>

    <P>&mdash; treat life prisoners on the same basis as other life prisoners in Britain and to indicate clearly the terms of their sentence to those who already served a long number of years in jail,</P>
    <P>&mdash; ensure that no one is required to serve a double sentence following extradition to another jurisdiction and</P>

    <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann fully supports the efforts of successive Governments to consolidate the peace process at every level</P>
    <P>&mdash; by seeking progress towards the overall goal of an agreed political settlement through comprehensive negotiations,</P>
    <P>&mdash; by pursuing an even-handed and constructive handling of all aspects of prison issues, including earlier releases, bearing in mind the role which the loyalist and republican prisoners have played in the peace process, the reduced risk of reoffence and the positive effects of improvements in this area on the prisoners, their families and the political climate in their communities,</P>
    <P>&mdash; by recognising the sensitivities of all victims of violence,</P>
    <P>&mdash; by promoting sensitive response to security developments on the ground in Northern Ireland in <Col N="1459" /> view of the dramatically improved security situation and</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>This motion is timely in light of recent events.  Loyalist and republican prisoners have played a major role during the past ten months in encouraging others to become involved in the peace process.  The decision of the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Sir Patrick Mayhew, to release Private Lee Clegg was wrong until proper arrangements are made for the release of republican and loyalist prisoners serving sentences on mainland Britain and in Northern Ireland.  Action needs to be taken quickly in this regard.</P>
      <P>We should not adopt the view that offenders should be put behind bars and we should throw away the key.  A number of prisoners have not been given a release date.  On the question of visits, the action taken recently by the British Home Secretary was regrettable and not in the best interests of promoting harmony in the peace process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When in Belfast on Monday I saw the plumes of black smoke over the Falls Road.  This was a reminder of what could have happened if mistakes had been made by those involved in initiating the peace process.  The Taoiseach and members of the Government should apply the maximum pressure on the British Prime Minister, Mr. John <Col N="1460" /> Major, who has been given a clear mandate and is now in a position to deal with the question of prisoners.  I appeal to the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Sir Patrick Mayhew, to make the necessary arrangements to allow prisoners, many of whom have been in prison for a long time to return home. When we contrast the way in which paramilitary prisoners, as they are often described, and Private Lee Clegg have been treated there is a gaping void which has to be filled quickly.</P>
    <P>The success of the peace process will be assessed by many on 31 August. From what I have heard on the grapevine is is imperative that the question of prisoners is addressed immediately by the British Government.  It should, as a matter of urgency, provide for a proper remission rate for republican and loyalist prisoners.  In the 1950s and 1960s the two Governments took every opportunity to cater for those who had been imprisoned because of their involvement in the troubles.  Prisoners should at least be told when they will be released, what the remission rate will be and proper facilities made available for their families, to which they are entitled.  I urge the Taoiseach, the Minister for Justice and their Government colleagues to exert the maximum pressure in this regard.</P>
    <P>It is apparent to everyone involved in the peace process that there is an urgent need to address this issue.  As a member of the British-Irish parliamentary body, I urge the British Government to devise a definite policy on prisoners as this issue has the potential to destory the peace process which was initiated for the benefit of everyone in the community, North and South.  It would be a disaster if this were to happen because of the failure of the two Governments to address this and other relevant matters.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Ellis for giving me the opportunity to make a brief contribution.  At a time when progress is painfully slow the issue of prisoners should be placed at the top of the <Col N="1461" /> political agenda.  When the peace process was initiated in August 1994 many people on this island and further afield were sceptical about its prospects for success.  We are glad it has been sustained and hope it will gather momentum.</P>
      <P>It will take time to complete the process of normalisation in the six Northern counties after 25 years of turbulence, violence and social, economic and political upheaval.  In this regard the issue of prisoners is uppermost in the minds of many people in republican and loyalist areas.</P>
      <P>The Forum for Peace and Reconciliation is attended by a representative of loyalist prisoners.  Members of that community are anxious to secure their release.  There is consensus in the House which I hope will extend to those who make decisions at British Government level that the position should be normalised as quickly as possible for prisoners, many of whom have been in prison for a long time.  One can imagine their state of mind and that of their families.</P>
      <P>Recently I had the opportunity with two of my constituency colleagues, Deputies Dermot Ahern and McGahon, to hear the point of view of the spouses and children of prisoners from County Louth.  One could not but feel for the many small children, some of whom barely know their fathers who have been in prison for a long time.</P>

      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to address the House on this motion.  In particular, I am glad of the opportunity it provides me to speak on the measures which have been taken in this jurisdiction in relation to prisons and other issues mentioned in the motion.  I want to begin by putting those <Col N="1462" /> issues within the overall context of the peace process.</P>
      <P>We are living in a time of change. Over the past 18 months or so we have witnessed the unfolding of events of truly historical significance for this island.  It is widely accepted, and rightly so, that the combination of these events has brought about the best ever prospect of securing a lasting peace and a reconciliation between the two traditions on this island.  For the sake of the people who make up these traditions &mdash; and for all our sakes &mdash; we must draw a line over the past and earnestly seek a better future for the present and future generations.</P>
      <P>Both this Government and the previous Government have accorded top priority to the advancement of the peace process.  They have understood and appreciated the importance of taking action at a number of levels and on a number of different fronts in order to underpin the process and to help ensure the achievement of its ultimate goal. The Joint Declaration, the Joint Framework Document, the ending of the national emergency and the continuing work of the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation are testimony to what has been done and achieved to date.</P>
      <P>As Minister for Justice, I have had particular association with a number of specific measures which have been taken in this jurisdiction to support the peace process.  One of the most important of these measures has been the early release, to date, of 20 selected prisoners who had been serving custodial sentences for subversive-related offences.  These releases have served to demonstrate that the benefits of the peace process extend to persons on all sides of the conflict.  They have also provided a clear indication of the willingness of the Government here to exercise the kind of flexibility which is made possible in circumstances of continuing peace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government is prepared to continue to exercise flexibility in relation to prison issues.  It recognises the importance of maintaining this flexibility and <Col N="1463" /> the significance which parties within both traditions attach to prisoner releases.  It is the Government's intention to ensure that the process of individual assessment of the suitability of prisoners for early release continues and that further such releases are arranged where possible as the peace process develops.</P>
    <P>An important consideration for the Government in agreeing to the early release of prisoners is of course the likely impact which such releases an have on persons &mdash; and the families and friends of persons &mdash; who have been the victims of offences committed by the prisoners concerned.  As the Taoiseach said when addressing this motion last night, no words can take away the loss, grief, pain and outrage felt by the victims. It is for this reason that the Government has been careful to ensure that each and every early release of a subversive prisoner in this jurisdiction is conditional not only on the prisoner keeping the peace but also refraining from doing anything, through publicity or otherwise, which would cause distress to the persons who may have been affected by the offence in respect of which the prison sentence had been imposed.  This is the minimum to which the victims are entitled.  It may, in some cases, go some way towards providing a level of reassurance and helping the victims, in time, to appreciate more fully the positive aspects of early releases for the greater good of the community in general.</P>
    <P>The release of Private Lee Clegg has been the focus of particular attention in recent days.  There are a number of aspects to the controversy surrounding the case but, in so far as the peace process is concerned, Private Clegg's release has raised a single very significant issue.  That is the need to address, and to be seen to address, on an equal basis the case for early release of republican and loyalist prisoners, many of whom have already served substantial portions of their sentences.  I believe that the reaction to Private Clegg's <Col N="1464" /> release, which has been witnessed in recent days in Belfast and elsewhere, has provided a deplorable and grim reminder to all of us who witnessed the violence, especially those who directly suffered the violence of the past 25 years, and it is now essential to demonstrate, by means of a shift of policy in relation to sentence management in Northern Ireland, that loyalist and republican prisoners will be dealt with in a fair and even-handed way.  Such a move would be widely welcomed within both communities in Northern Ireland and would generate the kind of goodwill which could help to move the peace process forward to a further stage.  I will return to this issue at the end of my statement when speaking on the amendments.</P>
    <P>With regard to prisoners in general, I have recently introduced the Transfer of Sentenced Persons Bill.  The Bill is now before the Seanad and can be expected to become law shortly.  Since its publication last April the Bill has received a positive welcome, both outside and inside this House.  It was the subject of a very thorough and constructive examination by the Select Committee on Legislation and Security.  It underwent considerable amendment during its passage in the House and its provisions have been significantly improved as a result.  I pay tribute to the Irish Commission for Prisoners Overseas whose help with the Bill was invaluable and whose work over the last number of years has kept the issue of prisoners overseas to the forefront of our agenda.</P>
    <P>Ratification of the Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons for humanitarian reasons is, of course, worthy in its own right and the convention makes no distinctions based on categories of prisoners, clearly, however, ratification has a particular role to play in the context of the consolidation of the peace process and I am grateful for the co-operation I received in the House in progressing this very important legislation.</P>
    <P>I will briefly refer to other issues relevant to the peace process which come <Col N="1465" /> within the ambit of my responsibilities as Minister for Justice.  The Government policy agreement contains a commitment to review all legislation and court arrangements associated with the conflict of the past 25 years.  My intention is to proceed with the review as quickly as possible and, to that end, my Department is currently considering proposals in regard to the nature and format of the proposed review.</P>
    <P>On the security front, there have been a number of measures taken in response to the Provisional IRA and loyalist cessations. Those measures have included the withdrawal of Border checkpoints, reductions in the security presence at prisons, ongoing reductions in Garda numbers assigned to Border divisions and the redeployment to non-security duties of gardaí who had until now been engaged exclusively on security-related work.  These various measures are an indication of the confidence of the Government and the security forces in the stability of the peace process.  I have already made it known that I expect further redeployment of Garda manpower from security-related duties will take place later this year.  I look forward to those resources being used to very worthwhile effect in tackling other forms of crime such as drug related crime and organised crime.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the very substantial progress which has been made in the peace process to date, it is clear that much more needs to be done to bring it to a successful conclusion.  There is no such thing as a partial success in this peace process.  Our target must at all times be the achievement of permanent peace and a new set of agreed relationships which will guarantee that peace. That can only be achieved if all parties work together in a spirit of mutual co-operation, commitment and compromise. That is the spirit in which the Government for its part will seek to advance the peace process and I appeal to all other parties to approach it in a similar spirit.</P>
    <P>With regard to the amendments that <Col N="1466" /> have been put down, the decommissioning of weapons illegally held by paramilitaries and the ending of punishment beatings are important objectives supported on all sides in this House.  For that reason and to avoid any misunderstanding, Deputies on this side of the House will support the amendment to amendment No. 1 in the names of Deputy Harney and Deputy O'Malley, subject to a minor amendment Deputy O'Malley will make this evening. However, the test of commitment to democratic policies remains that set out in the Downing Street Declaration.</P>
    <P>I would also reiterate the point made by the Taoiseach in his remarks to the House last evening.  He made it clear that in considering the peace process it is important not to single out any item and concentrate on it.  All issues including the decommissioning of weapons, punishment beatings, prisoner releases, policing and progress on political talks are interconnected.  Progress in one area makes progress possible in other areas. Decommissioning cannot be isolated and dealt with on its own.  When dealing with the peace process, one has to recognise that it involves a complex and linked number of elements, none of which can be dealt with on a stand alone basis.</P>
    <P>In supporting the amendment to amendment No. 1, I ask Deputies to bear in mind that I do so in the context that the overall goal of an agreed political settlement through comprehensive negotiations can only be achieved by pursuing an evenhanded and constructive approach to all elements in the peace process.  To make any one element a precondition or to isolate it from the need to make progress at the same time on all the other issues runs the serious risk of destabilising that very process which I know all of us in this House are united in supporting.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Howlin) Brendan Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Ten months ago the IRA guns fell silent.  Two months after that loyalist paramilitary groups announced their ceasefire.  True peace is not merely the <Col N="1467" /> absence of violence, but the silence of the guns has been an important step of great value.  It was achieved thanks to the efforts of individuals with foresight and with a courageous readiness to adopt new categories of thought.  Central to the new approach of republicans and loyalists, including the paramilitaries, was the realisation that there is a better way than violence, that the political process is the preferred route of the vast majority of the Irish people and that new methods of co-operation and political interaction must be tried.</P>
      <P>That call to co-operate is the challenge which faces all of us.  We must together find a way of addressing the broad agenda which constitutes the peace process.  In doing so we need to bear in mind the complex and interlocking nature of many of these issues. Of course, progress will not always be easy and there will be many difficulties on the way to overcome.  However, we can draw inspiration from the scale of what has been achieved thus far.  We should also be encouraged by the reality that progress in one area inevitably improves the prospect for advances across the agenda as a whole.</P>
      <P>In this perspective the Government has consistently emphasised to the British authorities the need to respond positively to the new situation created by the ceasefires.  What is required now is a pragmatic, flexible approach to the release of prisoners in an orderly way against a background of diminished threat to the community of reoffence. That is the route chosen within this jurisdiction by this Government and by its predecessor.  As the Minister for Justice said, 20 prisoners have been released in this jurisdiction since last Christmas.  The early release system in this jurisdiction has been operated pragmatically and progressively and with particular regard to the crucial requirement of ensuring the protection of the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Tánaiste has consistently put it to the British authorities at meetings of the Intergovernmental Conference and at <Col N="1468" /> other bilateral meetings &mdash; the Taoiseach has done the same &mdash; that there must be prompt practical movement on prisoner releases in Northern Ireland. As recently as Friday of last week the Tánaiste re-emphasised to the Secretary of State that this is a key and emotive issue for the republican and loyalist communities.</P>
    <P>We have indicated to the British Government the sense in the nationalist community that the lack of movement in this area has been leading to a build up of frustration both in the prisons and the broader communities from which the prisoners come.  It has been made clear to the British in recent weeks that this worrying situation has been exacerbated by the perception that the case of Private Clegg was being dealt with in isolation from the broader prisoner issues.  I do not want at this stage to dwell unduly on the Clegg case, but lessons can be learned from this case if the executive procedures used to free Clegg are applied equally to other life sentence prisoners in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Government has, therefore, consistently underlined the crucial importance of all cases in Northern Ireland being treated with rigorous impartiality, both as regards due process of law and any executive decisions which may be taken on sentences handed down by the courts after the law has run its course.</P>
    <P>There are a number of other areas where the Government sees scope for progress towards early and orderly releases from prisons in Northern Ireland.  The House will be aware that paramilitary prisoners in Northern Ireland who are serving sentences in excess of five years currently qualify for remission at the rate of 33 per cent.  This rate was reduced from 50 per cent for those convicted of scheduled offences committed since March 1989 as a response to acts of paramilitary violence at that time.</P>
    <P>There is little doubt that a reversion to 50 per cent remission in the first instance would now be seen as an important and timely initial step by the British Government.  The change in <Col N="1469" /> question is not without precedent.  The 50 per cent remission applied from 1976 until 1989 during some of the worst periods of violence.  Many find it hard to understand the logic of a more restrictive remission rate now at a time when the guns are silent and the risk to the community must surely be a matter of serious reassessment in the light of the ceasefires.</P>
    <P>A positive development would be to move now to increase remission rates, if necessary by the introduction of legislation. We have also urged improvement in life sentence review procedures and for temporary releases.  In this regard I am glad to note that the Secretary of State recently relaxed the grounds for granting compassionate home leave in cases of illness of relatives outside the prison.</P>
    <P>The controversy surrounding the Clegg affair and the broader question of prisoner releases should not conceal from us the suffering and wounds caused to the victims of violence and their families, some of whom are, of course, the families of prisoners.  The Forum for Peace and Reconciliation has heard the anguish of the victims of violence of the past 25 years and I know it was a moving experience for those present at the forum to hear such testimony.</P>
    <P>Deputies have rightly referred to the importance of transfer of prisoners from abroad to prisons in Ireland.  In relation to transfers from England to prisons in this jurisdiction, the Transfer of Sentenced Prisoners Bill, which must become law before we can ratify the European Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons, has passed all Stages in the Dáil and is about to be considered by the Seanad.  The Government hopes the convention can be ratified in the near future and preparations to give effect to its provisions are already well in hand.</P>
    <P>As regards transfers from England to prisons in Northern Ireland, the Government has conveyed to the British our view that the programme of transfers should be operated as flexibly <Col N="1470" /> as possible and that transfers should be on a permanent basis.  We have also pressed the British authorities to ensure that the regime is as flexible as possible and will be pursuing with them differences which have recently arisen with regard to arrangements for closed visits.</P>
    <P>I have dwelt in some detail on the prisons issue because the Government fully realises its central importance.  We agree with the thrust of the Opposition motion on the need for a forward looking and imaginative approach to prison issues generally and will be actively pursuing such an approach in all our contacts with the British authorities.</P>
    <P>However, a motion on this issue should set it in the wider context and should reflect also the sense of the Dáil on key political, security and economic dimensions.  These are crucial dimensions in the search for progress and in creating a climate of permanent peace. There are also, of course, a range of steps which can be taken in regard to prisons and we will continue to urge that these be implemented as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>If flexibility is essential in resolving the prisons issue, it is no less critical in the wider task of forging an enduring settlement.  Such a settlement can only be reached through a process of open, inclusive negotiations in which each party puts forward its viewpoint with conviction but reaches out to others in a spirit of compromise.</P>
    <P>The Government has already signalled its wish to have face to face discussions, without preconditions, with the Northern Ireland parties.  I hope the unionist and loyalist parties will carefully consider this invitation, which is motivated by a recognition that dialogue offers the only path to eventual agreement.  By responding positively, they will be serving not only the interests of the peace process but those of the unionist people as a whole who share with everyone else on this island a yearning for a lasting settlement.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1471" /> The peace which we now enjoy offers an unrivalled opportunity to build a lasting settlement.  For its part, the Government will continue to do everything it can to promote understanding and create conditions conducive to an agreement. By working closely with the British Government and in close co-operation with all the parties, we can make real progress towards this objective.  We will not be deflected from that goal.</P>

      <P>The peace process in Northern Ireland which has given the people of this island such hope and, even more importantly, given us a ten month period virtually free from violent death is clearly going through a delicate phase. It is a matter of considerable regret that the British authorities did not heed the advice offered by the Taoiseach as to the potential consequences of treating Private Clegg in such away as to convey to many nationalists that crimes committed in a uniform were to be regarded with less seriousness than those committed by others.  It is equally a matter of regret that those associated with Sinn Féin were prepared to respond to the Clegg release by unleashing what appears to have been a well orchestrated campaign of rioting and destruction in Belfast over the past two days.</P>
      <P>The anger at the preferential treatment given Private Clegg is understandable, but the folly of this campaign of rioting and destruction has been highlighted by Mr. Eamon Hanna, the Director of the Phoenix Trust, a cross-community development agency in west Belfast, who said that the rioting had set back the cause of economic regeneration in the area for many months, if not years.  I am also concerned that just when my Department had launched the extension of the free travel scheme for those travelling to and from Northern Ireland, cross-Border road and rail travel should have been interrupted for the first time in two years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is not a time for the sound of marching feet and angry voices, as Sinn <Col N="1472" /> Féin seems to believe, but a time for cool heads and measured words.  There is an obligation on us all, Government and Opposition, people inside and outside this House, nationalist and unionist, British and Irish, not to say or do anything which might make the current position more difficult or impede the objective, which we all want to see, of turning the current period of peace in Northern Ireland into political agreement on new structures which will ensure that the people on this island will never again have to face the awful scourge of politically motivated murder and destruction.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that the resolution of the position of those currently in jail serving sentences for politically motivated crime is a key element, but not the only one, in copperfastening the peace process.  In the debate in this House in December 1993 on the Downing Street Declaration I made the point that the ending of virtually every campaign of politically motivated violence in this country and throughout the world had led to the early release of prisoners and that this was an issue which must be faced up to by both Governments.  The Irish Government has responded by initiating a phased release of paramilitary prisoners from within our jurisdiction. This has made a significant contribution to maintaining the momentum of the peace process.  There have been no problems with this programme and nothing to suggest that any of those who were released have again become involved in illegal activities.</P>
    <P>In previous decades of this century, when IRA campaigns of violence ended, the process of the release of prisoners began shortly afterwards and continued without any decommissioning of arms.  Surely with the ceasefires having held for ten months, there is now an unanswerable case for the British Government to do what it was prepared to do on every previous occasion and begin the release of prisoners.  Nobody is realistically looking for a general amnesty or the throwing open of all gates and the mass releases of prisoners.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1473" /> What is needed is the phased release of prisoners, with those who have served the longest being released first.  This can be done through the system of releasing on licence, which has been used here and by the British in the Clegg case, or by the restoration of the 50 per cent remission rate, a suggestion which has been made by the Government to the British authorities and which is referred to in the Fianna Fáil motion.</P>
    <P>Both the motion and the Government amendment rightly point to the important role played by loyalist and republican prisoners in the peace process. The experience of the past has been that time spent by paramilitary prisoners in jail has not been wasted, that many spend their time usefully thinking through the factors which brought them to jail in the first place and that many come out with a more realistic understanding of the problems of our society and the way in which they can be resolved.  A phased release of prisoners would have a moderating impact on both republican and loyalist paramilitary thinking and would provide a boost for the peace process.</P>
    <P>While continuing to press for such releases, we also need to try to understand the position of the British on this matter and, in particular, to understand the feelings of the victims of paramilitary violence.  The Fianna Fáil motion is flawed in that it makes no reference to the victims of paramilitary violence. Compared to Northern Ireland and Britain, and with the exception of the Dublin and Monaghan bombings in 1974, we in this jurisdiction have not suffered anything like the same level of violence as those in Northern Ireland and Britain. We should be honest enough to admit that had we endured a similar campaign and were there those serving long sentences for crimes of mass violence within this State, then there might not be the same degree of consensus on the release of prisoners.</P>
    <P>While continuing to press the British authorities to adopt a more flexible approach in relation to prisoners, both <Col N="1474" /> as regards releases and transfers of prisoners from jails in Britain to Northern Ireland, we must also continue to exert all possible pressure on the paramilitaries and their political representatives to show the movement necessary to ensure that progress is maintained.  If the peace process is to move forward to a successful conclusion, it must be on the basis of give and take on all sides.</P>
    <P>The question of decommissioning of paramilitary arms is a crucial one which will not go away.  Its resolution will require imagination, ingenuity and trust on all sides.  It should not be built into such a matter of principle that it will create further obstacles to the achievement of the principal objective &mdash; a political solution and a lasting peace. However, the political realities are &mdash; Sinn Féin and the IRA must be aware of this &mdash; that apart from the difficulties it creates for the British Government, the two main unionist parties in Northern Ireland, which between them represent close to two-thirds of the population, will not enter into all-party talks with Sinn Féin until such time as some progress is made on the decommissioning issue.  I do not agree with the position of the two unionist parties, but we should try to understand it.  Given that nationalist violence took such a horrific toll on members of the unionist community over the past 25 years, it is not surprising that they should have reservations about entering into dialogue with the political representative of those who still hold these weapons.</P>
    <P>There are other ways in which paramilitaries can help to advance the process and demonstrate that they are continuing to move away from violence and accept the democratic standards of our society.  One would be to end the horrific activities of the paramilitary punishment gangs, which continue to inflict barbaric cruelty on those whom they regard as having offended against them. Another would be to assist in the location of the bodies of paramilitary victims, some of whom were murdered more than 20 years ago and whose families are still suffering because they have <Col N="1475" /> never been able to give their loved ones a decent burial.</P>
    <P>In the case of Sinn Féin, it can move the process on by ending its political equivocation and stating clearly whether or not it accepts concept of consent as regards any changes in the constitutional position of Northern Ireland, which is enshrined in the Downing Street Declaration and the Framework Document and which has been accepted by all parties in this House.  Like the members of the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation, I have seen members of Sinn Féin duck, dodge, weave and do everything possible to avoid addressing this issue.  However, unless it faces up to this crucial issue and unless its leadership has the courage to tackle it, political progress will be extremely difficult.</P>

      <P>I am astounded that the Government has decided not to accepted our motion and has instead tabled a bland amendment.  As already indicated in this debate, we will not accept the amendment because it is not specific enough as regards prisoners in British jails.  That is why we tabled this motion, which was done before we knew Private Clegg would be released. The fact that we were prepared to use the last Private Members' Time in this session to raise an issue which is at the kernel of the peace process and its progress shows our commitment to it.  I castigate the Government for not accepting a motion which could be accepted by most parties.  Our motion will now be defeated because the Government has tabled an amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1476" /> The fact that we will be voting against a Government amendment does not indicate that we are adopting a bipartisan approach to issues relating to the peace process.  As an Opposition party, we will be making our position clear on the decommissioning of arms and other pertinent issues.  Our party when in Government was one of the leading proponents of the peace process.  If it were not for our party's contribution, perhaps the peace process would not be as well established.  I say that for the benefit of Government Deputies present and they should give us some credit for that.  I thought they might have indicated that by accepting our motion.</P>
    <P>Regarding Private Clegg's release, as Cardinal Daly said, it was one of the greatest blunders made by the British Government.  It is regrettable that the scenes on the streets of Belfast, Newry and other towns in the North have taken place.  I concur with our colleague and one of my near neighbours, Mr. Seamus Mallon, when he said those scenes are distracting attention from the awful decision made by the British, that they may give others an opportunity to say that the peace process is dead and that some people will resort to violence again if things do not go their way.</P>
    <P>Coincidentally and unrelated to this motion, I agreed a few days ago, after many abortive efforts, to meet the families of a number of prisoners from my constituency which has been at the coal-face of the violence during the past 25 years.  I was struck by the attitude of children whose fathers are in prisons on this and our neighbouring island.  On the morning Private Clegg was released a mother told me that when her nine year old heard he has been released, she asked, &ldquo;Does that mean Daddy will be released?&rdquo;  It is difficult to explain to children why their fathers are not being released when Private Clegg has been released.  Our party leader referred to what Mrs. Thatcher said, that murder is murder and there is no dear doubt about it.  There is justification to an extent for the claim sometimes made that there is one justice for the British <Col N="1477" /> and another for the Irish.  If anything is to be achieved from the peace process, it will be achieved only on the basis that movement must be made in a balanced way.  I suggest that applies to the decommissioning issue also.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Hanlon, a number of members of my party and I met representatives of the former loyalist paramilitaries two months ago in Belfast.  It was intriguing that hard-line loyalists raised the prisoners issue with representatives of the Fianna Fáil Party to ensure that we would put enough pressure on the Irish Government and particularly on the British Government to secure movement on the prisoners issue.  When account is taken of the sterling work carried out by Reverend Roy Magee who single-handedly convinced the loyalist paramilitaries in prison that a ceasefire should be put in place, it is interesting that they are now turning to the Fianna Fáil Party to state their case. It is important that our Government deals with the prisoners issue even-handedly and ensures that the British Government will do likewise.</P>
    <P>On the decommissioning issue, Mr. Tim Pat Coogan is on record as saying it is the Orange card.  It is important to emphasise that there is not only an onus on the IRA to decommission arms, but there is also an onus on the loyalist paramilitaries.  Perhaps the British Government has not handled that matter as even-handedly as it should.</P>
    <P>I appeal to Sinn Féin to recommence its talks with Mr. Ancram or another representative of the British Government; and rather than do it in the glare of the publicity of TV cameras, it would be more appropriate if it proceeded in a manner in which progress could be made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my colleague for sharing his time with me.  There should be a clear policy on the early release of prisoners.  That issue cannot be isolated, but should be encompassed in a resolution as part of the overall peace process. The Private Lee Clegg case is unquestionably a political issue and, <Col N="1478" /> accordingly, it should be addressed by the Government.  Unlike what some political parties are saying and what the usual merchants of doom and gloom are claiming regarding Private Clegg's release, I emphasise his release should not be allowed to jeopardise the peace process, but should solidify it.</P>
      <P>The manner in which the Private Clegg affair was handled has presented the Taoiseach with the key to the political prisoners issue.  Is he prepared to grasp the opportunity?  Unfortunately, having regard to the nature of the Taoiseach's comments last night, it appears he is afraid to grasp this opportunity and, therefore, is missing out on a unique opportunity to move forward the peace process.  He is in a unique position to demand from the British Government that it immediately addresses the prisoners issue.  The release of Private Clegg, which I believe was badly timed and smacked of typical British insensitivity to the nationalist people, has given the British and Irish Government a unique opportunity to work together to strengthen the peace process.</P>
      <P>The pivotal role played by loyalist and republican prisoners in bringing about and consolidating the ceasefire has been acknowledged many times in this House and elsewhere.  As we are all aware, especially at this time of the year, symbolism and gestures in Northern Ireland can carry a good deal of importance for both communities.  I hope the Government will use its influence at the Anglo-Irish Conference and elsewhere to urge on the British Government the necessity for the wider use of the provisions of the 1961 Criminal Justice Act.  Section 26 (1) of that Act gives discretion to the appropriate Minister to allow the transfer of a prisoner from one part of the United Kingdom to another.  That provision was used in the case of Private Clegg. Why can it not be used in the case of Irish political prisoners?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil motion sets out in detail the many steps that should be taken.  A reasonable person could not expect that all loyalist or republican <Col N="1479" /> prisoners should walk free tomorrow morning.  Some are guilty of horrific crimes, such as the Shankill, Greysteel and other bombings.  However, the majority of prisoners on both sides of the divide were not convicted of killing anyone.  Many of them could be said to be victims of circumstances.</P>
    <P>I congratulate Monsignor Denis Faul on his elevation today.  He said that the early release of such prisoners would be of enormous benefit to the entire peace process.  This is not something to be put on the long finger.  We are now in the marching season and we have seen how easy it is to inflame emotions.</P>
    <P>The peace process should be built upon and every opportunity should be taken to bring it further.  A fitting tribute to the memory of Miss Karen Reilly would be that she did not die in vain, but that her death will have inadvertently strengthened the peace process. It is up to the Taoiseach and the Government to ensure that will be the case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Historically the momentum for peace following prolonged periods of conflict can be maintained and accelerated only by major gestures.  These gestures may not prove to be universally popular but that is not the litmus test of whether a decision is right or wrong.</P>
      <P>The British Government took umbrage at protests from this country regarding the early release of Private Lee Clegg in isolation.  It said it was none of our business and that it was a matter for a sovereign Government.  To my knowledge, nobody questioned the right of the sovereign Government in Great Britain to make this decision, what was questioned was whether it made the right decision.  I submit it did not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Undoubtedly it was a very popular move from the perspective of the Tory right, but it was deeply offensive to those who had to live with the trauma and tribulations in the Six Counties for the past 25 years.  It reinforced the view <Col N="1480" /> that there is one law for the British security forces and another for Irish men and women.</P>
    <P>The British Government should not delude itself into believing this will be forgotten or that it has not had an adverse effect on the peace process. When the release of Private Lee Clegg is set in the context of the clear miscarriages of justice in the Birmingham Six, the Guildford Four and the Judith Ward cases, the inescapable conclusion is that British justice must stand in the dock. The administration of justice in any democracy is badly served when it is motivated by prejudicial and political considerations.  The decision to release Clegg was an executive one and, as such, was a political act.  Nobody in this country believes the British Establishment fiction about this being a <i>quasi-judicial</i> decision and therefore by implication above criticism.  It was prejudicial because it was discriminatory as Clegg was released only because he was a member of the security forces although he murdered a young girl in west Belfast.</P>
    <P>Recently I had come to the conclusion that at long last there was a British Government which understood the Irish problem.  The release of Clegg has undermined my confidence in that conclusion. A major gesture on the issue of republican and loyalist prisoners is required urgently from the British Government.  The message must be sent out loud and clear that we will not accept Ireland's difficulty being used by Tory politicians as their opportunity.  It is not the first time that Sir Patrick Mayhew has trampled on the sensitivities of the Irish people.</P>
    <P>It is time for the British Government to dig itself out of the intransigent hole which it dug for itself and to move the peace process forward.  There is no point, especially after the Clegg release, in trying to link the decommissioning of arms with the prisoners issue.  That we have a cessation of violence, but we do not have progress in the peace process because of the stagnation and entrenchment of the British Government.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1481" /> It would appear it really wants an abject surrender by both loyalists and republicans.  That is not realistic.  This is a far cry from the solemn promises of magnanimity and generosity in the Downing Street Declaration.  Unless there is movement, there could be chaos.  The ostrich approach of Sir Patrick Mayhew is in danger of catapulting us all back towards the past through indolence and ignorance.</P>
    <P>The current British Government policy is increasingly falling prey to complacency, and the danger is that this island and the peace process could be the ultimate victims.  Surely the atrocities in the Six Counties over a 25 year period are still fresh enough in the memory of the British Establishment to provoke a desire to avoid a return to violence at all costs.  Surely it must recognise that the next step forward is possible.  The British Government would do well to remember that intransigent and ignorant policies based on political expediency often drift past in coffins.  Those who do not learn from history are doomed to repeat it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the amendment to amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In amendment No. 1, after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo;, to insert &ldquo;condemns the action of the British Government in releasing Private Lee Clegg and&rdquo; and, after &ldquo;comprehensive negotiations,&rdquo;, to insert the following paragraph:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&mdash;by ensuring that members of all paramilitary organisations commit themselves irrevocably to democratic politics by decommissioning their weapons and ending their brutal punishment beatings within their own communities.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I wish to amend the amendment to amendment No. 1 by substituting the words &ldquo;regrets&rdquo; for the word &ldquo;condemns&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This motion deals almost entirely with prisoners.  The Government amendment is more broadly based and somewhat more objective and, for that <Col N="1482" /> reason, I favour it.  Because the Government amendment appears more reasonable, we have put down our amendments to it.</P>
    <P>The regrettable events of recent days in the North arise directly from the action of the British Government on Monday morning last in releasing Private Lee Clegg &mdash; a convicted murderer given a life sentence &mdash; after serving a relatively short period in prison in a benign regime near his home in England.  Cardinal Daly described this action as one of &ldquo;crass insensitivity&rdquo; and I see no reason to disagree with him.</P>
    <P>When this release was signalled in the past three or four weeks, the overwhelming advice from this island was not to proceed with it.  Serious consequences were foreseen.  Notwithstanding that advice, the British Government, rather incredibly, and with reckless foolishness, proceeded to do something wrong and indefensible.  The fact that it was without precedent has been borne out by the resignation from the Life Sentence Review Board of the head of the Northern Ireland Probation Service who was courageous enough to state in public that the Clegg release was a complete deviation from the criteria laid down for considering such cases.</P>
    <P>This regrettable decision was obviously highly influenced by the vote taken in Westminster yesterday on the leadership of the Conservative Party.  It is appalling to realise that a fundamentally wrong decision such as this, taken in defiance of all rules and precedents, should be used as an electioneering ploy and as an inducement to certain members of Parliament to cast their votes in a particular way.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested by spokesmen for the British Government that Private Clegg did nothing wrong and that he is not really a murderer because they claim he did not go on duty that night with the intention of killing anybody. This flies in the face of the fact that he has been convicted by a duly constituted court and had the conviction upheld by two higher courts including, I believe, the House of Lords.  It is impossible to <Col N="1483" /> be convicted of murder by a succession of judges and courts such as that unless they are satisfied, beyond all reasonable doubt, that the defendant was possessed with the necessary <i>mens rea,</i> in other words, when he fired he had to have the intention of either killing or causing serious bodily harm without justification. All the courts were so satisfied.</P>
    <P>The unfairness of the British Government's approach is underlined by the case of a man whose wife appeared on television a few nights' ago and explained that he had been convicted of attempted murder and has served more than 20 years, but was given no release date and was being detained under an extremely harsh regime.  Such obvious partiality was bound to cause an outcry and to lead to trouble.  The fact that the trouble appears to be orchestrated by Sinn Féin is by the way.  The release of Clegg was a godsend and they took full advantage of it.  However, the net result was that appalling images of Northern Ireland were once again flashed around the world.  Hundreds of vehicles on fire and £2 million worth of damage done in two days is hardly the advertisement we want, North or South, for increased tourism and commercial investment.</P>
    <P>It is abundantly clear that the most obvious requirement to lead to comprehensive negotiation is the decommissioning of illegally held arms and explosives by those who have retained them since 31 August last.  Nonetheless, neither the motion nor the Government amendment to it makes any reference to this most obvious and desirable development.  Unionists generally have made it abundantly clear that they will not enter multilateral negotiations under the implied threat represented by the retention of these weapons.  There will be no comprehensive or meaningful multilateral negotiations on a democratic, political basis when the most important part of one party's mandate is not the votes they got at an election but the retained arms they and their <Col N="1484" /> associates still control with all its implications.</P>
    <P>Likewise, it is neither normal nor acceptable that those who claim to be ordinary political parties should number among their members and supporters people who even still frequently inflict vicious and brutal beatings on persons whom they unilaterally judge to have infringed some moral or social code they deem appropriate within a particular community.  Since August last well over 100 people have been brutally beaten, in many cases, maimed for life, some of them were beaten close to death.  The two points the Progressive Democrats highlighted in the amendment are self-evidently true and should be accepted by the House as part of the motion.  Therefore, I was very pleased to hear the Minister for Justice say the Government was prepared to do that.</P>
    <P>I have warned on more than one occasion that there is a grave danger that a particular agenda is being set in the ongoing debate on what is described as &ldquo;the peace process.&rdquo;  Even the very term &ldquo;the peace process&rdquo; has taken on a particular meaning arising from that agenda.  There is a grave danger of this House and the general public falling into the trap of accepting that agenda as the real one.  However, the real agenda is not just what Sinn Féin wants at any given moment, it is much broader and should encompass the aspirations, desires and fears of all sections of the community in Northern Ireland. Accepting a succession of Sinn Féin demands as the effective agenda is unwise, first, because of its alienation of so many other people and, second, because its set of demands threatens to be never-ending.</P>
    <P>It is disappointing that, after ten months of substantial peace, so little progress has been made in areas such as North-South economic co-operation, the constitutional and institutional development of Northern Ireland internally and in respect of its relations with the south.  Everybody has been so relieved at the ceasefires the real agenda is not being pushed.  Sinn Féin is <Col N="1485" /> allowed to make the running.  The majority of moderate people in the North and their political representatives are not really engaged in the process, which represents a great loss of opportunity and is particularly disappointing.</P>
    <P>I appeal to moderate people in Northern Ireland to consider the desirability of encouraging their representatives to begin talking; that is equally true on the Unionist and Nationalist sides.  By and large the two Governments have worked well together as facilitators in recent years.  The Downing Street Joint Declaration and Joint Framework documents are of great assistance to the process. The external goodwill is manifest, particularly in the United States and the European Union.  Today a joint meeting of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Joint Committee on European Affairs was visited by the President of the European Parliament and Senator George Mitchell, President Clinton's economic envoy to Ireland, stressing that good will.  There is anxiety everywhere to help and make progress but, in the last resort, progress can be made only in Northern Ireland.  We know the overwhelming desire of the people there for peace but they can give lasting effect to that desire only if they insist that their representatives talk, negotiate, compromise and, ultimately, agree.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity to contribute to the debate on the motion and on its broader aspects.</P>
      <P>Having listened to those Members who have already contributed this evening and the majority who spoke last evening it can rightly be argued that very little was said on either occasion with which one could disagree, as all Members adopted a very constructive tone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the broader aspect of the problem, bearing in mind that we must agree a formal motion at 8.30 this evening, it is extremely important that any signal we send is sufficiently broad to demonstrate that we fully recognise we are dealing with a problem of many parts <Col N="1486" /> necessitating many remedies for its resolution.  In that respect I am very comfortable with the amendment tabled by Deputies Harney and O'Malley.</P>
    <P>The British Government may have reached stalemate as far as decommissioning arms is concerned, this can occur when one attributes one aspect of a problem greater importance or significance than others.  Accordingly, we must tread carefully when approaching the problem, fully recognising that it might be unwise and unhelpful if our Government made a priority or emphasised any one aspect of the problem.</P>
    <P>In an interesting and inspiring contribution last evening the Taoiseach listed in very considerable detail 12 or 13 different but equally important issues of concern in respect of the peace process, in relation to each and every one of which movement is necessary if we are to achieve real, lasting progress.</P>
    <P>We are dealing with a motion on the issue of prisoners and I am confident that the Government fully recognises its importance and sensitivity.  Indeed in recent months the record of our Government and Minister for Justice in that regard has been very impressive, and will have sent a very strong signal to those formerly involved in paramilitary activities that there is a strong peace dividend to be gained by those who have decided to opt for peace rather than their erstwhile methods of political persuasion.  That record demonstrates the commitment of the Government and Minister.  On the specific prisoner issue, I welcome the commitment of the Taoiseach and Tánaiste, highighted through their recent meetings with the British Government in particular, and the Taoiseach's meeting with his counterpart, the British Prime Minister, when real progress was made.</P>
    <P>Our Government's arguments for an increased remission rate, the review of life sentences, in particular the issue of compassionate parole, have all been constructively advanced and constitute an important component of the peace process which must be worked on within the context of the many other issues and <Col N="1487" /> difficulties highlighted by the Taoiseach last evening as being part and parcel of the same problem and, consequently, of its resolution.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach listed in great detail the many obstacles we face but he also highlighted how we can all work together to overcome those obstacles. There has been concern about the lack of progress in the peace process but now that the British Prime Minister, John Major, is in a stronger political position, an opportunity exists for further progress on the part of the British Government and I hope some progress will be made in the coming weeks.  I am confident Prime Minister Major will deliver in that regard.</P>
    <P>The violent events of the past few days were a stark reminder of what life was like in Northern Ireland before the ceasefires.  We all have an obligation to ensure that there will not be a return to that violence.  The creation of a political process, built on the foundations of the peace process, will help us build a new future.  There are many causes of division and doubt and many aspects to their resolution but we all must work together to secure that resolution.</P>
    <P>The amended motion is the most constructive way to address this problem. There is a danger in giving one aspect of a problem a greater degree of priority than another.  While the motion put forward by the Opposition deserves serious consideration by Government, the problems referred to therein must be addressed in the wider context.  We must be extremely cautious in ensuring that all sides of the argument are dealt with in a fair and impartial manner.</P>
    <P>We, in Dáil Éireann, must be concerned about parity of esteem because the messages we send from this House, particularly by way of motion, are heard on all sides in Northern Ireland.  Unfortunately, with the position currently obtaining in Northern Ireland, people are inclined to put their own interpretations on those messages.  We must, therefore, be cautious in what we say in this House and how we say it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1488" /> I welcome the debate tonight and the discussion on the issue of the transfer of prisoners.  It must be put in its proper context, however, and we must recognise that there are many parts to the problem which require a multifaceted solution.  I am confident that the efforts of the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the Government as a whole, in putting pressure on the British Government and all other interested parties, will result in the progress that will lead to a better future for all the people on this island.</P>

      <P>Following the ceasefires there are many issues that need to be addressed, including policing and the decommissioning of arms illegally held and those legally held by sections of the community in the North.  The issue of prisoners must be addressed also and the structures that will be put in place for the future.</P>
      <P>This is a timely motion by the Fianna Fáil Party in view of the release of Private Clegg last Monday.  The unilateral decision to release him was totally insensitive.  Private Clegg was convicted of murder.  He appealed his sentence to the highest court in Britain, the House of Lords, but the sentence was upheld. To release him in isolation without having regard to the position of other political prisoners, both republican and loyalist, was insensitive.  There is also a certain cynicism about the fact that Private Clegg was released the day before the Tory leadership vote and one week before 12 July.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The sentences of all political prisoners should now be reviewed.  This Government has approved the release of prisoners and that was a positive step forward in the peace process.  If the sentences of prisoners in Britain and in the <Col N="1489" /> North were reviewed, I believe a number of them would be released.  The provision for a 50 per cent remission, which operated up to 1989, should be reintroduced. That would be a positive step.</P>
    <P>Prisoners in British prisons should be transferred to the North or to the South, according to where their relatives live. That would be a positive move.  In addition, a more humane approach must be adopted in the treatment of prisoners in British prisons, and not just because of the peace process.  All civilised countries should adopt a humane approach to prisoners.  Those prisoners will eventually be freed and it is important that they are rehabilitated in their own communities as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>Transferring prisoners from one prison to another without informing their relatives is unacceptable.  Some prisoners have been transferred to different prisons eight times in two years.  Such treatment does not reflect well on any prison system and it is certainly not in the interests of security.</P>
    <P>Refusing an application for parole by a prisoner, particularly one who has been in prison for perhaps 20 years, whose mother or father has died constitutes inhumane treatment.  Denying prisoners independent medical attention is another issue that should be addressed.</P>
    <P>I am concerned at the delay in progressing the peace process.  Last night, our Leader, Deputy Ahern, referred to the fact that British politicians who came to Ireland to govern us down through the years made the same mistakes. During the past 25 years of violence in the North, the British Government made at least two serious mistakes.  One of those was the introduction of internment in 1971 and the other was the manner in which it dealt with the crisis in the H-blocks in 1981. Both of those blunders were responsible for prolonging the violence in Northern Ireland and they contributed to an increase in the membership of the IRA.</P>
    <P>I am concerned at the dilly-dallying by the British Government in the past 12 months in regard to the definition of <Col N="1490" /> the word &ldquo;permanent&rdquo;, the whole question of the decommissioning of arms and the unilateral decision to release Private Clegg.  The British Government should now move the peace process forward because it is within its power to do so.</P>
    <P>I ask the Government to support this motion.  Members of this House should be seen to be unanimous and to have a sense of urgency in regard to the question of prisoners.  The Government has already moved on that issue and it would send a worthwhile signal to all concerned if we were to have unanimous support for this motion tonight. The re-election of Mr. John Major as Prime Minister and the re-appointment of Sir Patrick Mayhew as Secretary for Northern Ireland indicates that the difficulties of the last few weeks in Britain have now been resolved.  I again ask the Government to use its influence with the British Government to move the peace process forward.  I have no doubt that history will judge harshly the politicians who do not grasp the opportunity for peace.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The issue of prisoners is extremely important in the peace process. Our motion concentrates attention on all its facets.  A united call by this Dáil on the British Government to take action could have had some effect.  The Government amendment diffuses and dilutes the impact of the Fianna Fáil motion and, not for the first time, lets the British Government off the hook in a week it has behaved abominably.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We do not want to see the views of the Government increasingly ignored because it fails to put them forward with sufficient vigour or because the British Government takes them for granted.  On 4 April last I and another Deputy tabled questions on the issue of prisoners in Belmarsh Prison and the programme of releases of provisional IRA prisoners in British jails.  In reply the Government pointed to the need for careful consideration of the position regarding prisoners and made clear its view that a sensitive approach in this area had an important <Col N="1491" /> contribution to make to the consolidation of the peace process.  The Tánaiste, Deputy Spring, was talking about a sensitive approach by the British Government.  What effect have his representations had when they have been so ignored, as evidenced by the Clegg case and the fact that there have not been releases since?</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste went on to say he believed that if tackled on a pragmatic and sensitive basis these problems could be satisfactorily resolved without any loss of principle.  He achieved no results from the pressure he exerted.  He concluded by saying that the Government would continue to keep these matters under review in its contacts with the British Government to encourage a flexible and sensible approach to dealing with prison issues generally.  We have heard pious platitudes from the Tánaiste but have seen no action.  It shows how little effect our Government is having in its discussions with its opposite number.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that the Government will not support this motion.  I am even more surprised that Deputies who have adopted a high profile on the issue of prisoners, for example, Deputies Costello and Bree, are satisfied with the Government's approach to our motion. There is no point in appearing on public platforms and then failing to use their influence with their party in the Dáil where it counts.</P>
    <P>Last night the Taoiseach said to say that all issues had to be treated together was a recipe for stagnation.  The Government's argument would have more credibility had it persuaded the British Government not to proceed with the unilateral decision on the release of Private Lee Clegg.  The British Government argues that it was a separate issue and had nothing to do with other prisoners. That is making a nonsense of the Taoiseach's argument.  Our position is that, given the decision on Private Lee Clegg, there has to be movement on prisoners independent of movement on <Col N="1492" /> other issues.  We did not create this situation; the British Government did.  It is of no use for our Government to wring its hands in helpless impotence.  It could start to show some resolve by supporting our comprehensive motion.  This would send a powerful message to the British Government and to wider opinion that we expect to see progress on this issue.</P>
    <P>In the last few days the notion has been put forward that the Clegg decision somehow came within agreed guidelines for prison releases.  If that is so, why did the head of the Northern Ireland Probation Office Ms Breidge Gadd resign her position?  The reality is that the decision on Clegg was political and not, as the British Prime Minister said, judicial.  Were the Provos still active, it would be fair to say that this one decision showed that Sir Patrick Mayhew and the British Government are perfect recruiting officers for them. It is proof, unfortunately, of the feeling that has prevailed in Ireland for hundreds of years that there is one law for the British and another for the Irish. Why has our fair country been blighted by incompetent British politicians who show more concern for day to day internal Westminster political issues than for the nuances of the problems in Northern Ireland, particularly in recent years.  Last night our party Leader said that the Home Counties seem to matter more than the Six Counties.  The Six Counties are important to us.</P>
    <P>The peace process must be built upon.  Mutual confidence is vital in that regard, but what message does Clegg's release give to the people of the North and of this island generally?  The role of the prisoners in the peace process has been fundamental not only in bringing it about &mdash; it was their positive input into the discussions at the time on the republican and loyalist sides that brought it about.  They have continued to support the peace process despite the fact that the British ignored its human dimension.  Fewer prisoners were released at Christmas 1994 when the peace process was in operation than at <Col N="1493" /> Christmas 1993 during the conflict.  A Government that ignores the humane factor, the role of the prisoners, is playing with fire.</P>
    <P>I praise the Irish Government for its role.  It deserves praise for releasing the 20 Provisional IRA members since the beginning of the process.  Many of the prisoners in the North were young people who were sucked into the conflict at the time.  We must be sensitive to the victims of violence, but we must draw a line in the sand and look forward to the future.  We must show some humanity to the prisoners.  In talking about the prisoners, we must talk about the regime in British prisons and the failure of the British authorities to show humanity in relation to it.</P>
    <P>On the subject of judicial decisions, there are judicial recommendations about releases of and transfers of prisoners. The British Home Secretary is sitting on them, but we are told that Sir Patrick Mayhew's decision to release Private Clegg was a judicial decision. The question of people who have been on the run and have not been home for up to 20 years must also be tackled in the context of the peace process if we are to have a final comprehensive peace on this island.</P>
    <P>I regret that the Government has not agreed to accept our comprehensive resolution on prisoners which we tabled last Friday.  The amendment by the Progressive Democrats, touching on the release of Private Clegg, is important. However, we on this side of the House want the full comprehensive resolution we tabled to be voted for and passed in this House.  The peace process is not just about the prisoners or about the decommissioning of arms, important though that is.  It is about a range of items which have to be tackled in all-party talks in the North which should now begin.  Let there be no prevarication or further delays.  Let us get on with all party talks. Peace should not be taken for granted. What we have now is an absence of violence but what we need is long term peace.  That must be negotiated by all sides that hold a democratic mandate.  I <Col N="1494" /> call for that peace process and for round table peace talks to get under way as soon as possible in order to build on what we have had on this island for the last ten months which was negotiated by this party when in Government with the Labour Party.  We call for support for our motion.</P>

      <P>I move that the Committee agree with the Seanad in amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 10, lines 3 to 7 deleted and the following substituted:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;`APR' means the annual percentage rate of charge, being the total cost of credit to the consumer, expressed as an annual percentage of the amount of credit granted and calculated in accordance with section 10;&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment deals with the definition of APR.  As I indicated on Second Stage, APR is a term which is increasingly in public usage.  In short, APR is the true rate of interest.  It means the total cost of credit to the consumer over the lifetime of the loan expressed as an annual percentage of the money borrowed. I have endeavoured to come up with a verbal definition of APR which will be readily intelligible to all consumers. I considered various formulations, particularly on Report Stage. Among the definitions I considered was the following: &ldquo;APR is that effective rate of interest quoted as an annual rate which, expressed as a decimal and used to discount the repayments made by the borrower over the term of the loan, <Col N="1501" /> gives a total present value of such repayments equal to the amount of the loan advanced.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Another definition considered at that stage was &ldquo;the true rate of interest is the rate of discount expressed in annual percentage terms that when applied to the total sum of repayments made on the loan over its lifetime equates that amount to the original value of the loan, taking account of the amounts, timing and frequency of the debiting instalments of amounts due for repayment and crediting of repayments made to the running account of the borrower&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>These definitions give verbal expression to the mathematical formula which perhaps is only intelligible to economists, accountants and mathematicians. Deputy Ned O'Keeffe asked me to go back to the drawing board on the question of the definition.  I assure him I have done precisely that and the definition proposed in this amendment is the most intelligible to consumers.  I, therefore, propose the following definition: &ldquo;APR means the annual percentage rate of charge being the total cost of credit to the consumer, expressed as an annual percentage of the amount of credit granted and calculated in accordance with section 10&rdquo;.  This definition has the added advantage of being the definition specified in the European Union Consumer Credit Directive of 1990.  One of the purposes of the Bill is to transpose that directive into national law.</P>

      <P>I welcome this amendment which will clear up the confusion about the amount of interest charged on loans.  As the Minister said, the definition was understood only by mathematicians and economists and many people did not know the total cost of a loan.  This definition will make it easier for people who do not have a background in banking or economics to work out the true cost of a loan.  People did not realise that some of the loans advertised in the media had hidden costs and they found out about them only when <Col N="1502" /> making the final payment.  I welcome this clarification.</P>

      <P>I concur with what both Deputies have said.  We have taken some time to examine the mathematical formula that is attached.  The task we were presented with was to give verbal expression to that formula, which is not a particularly easy thing to do.  The point made by Deputy Eoin Ryan is particularly relevant in the context of a later amendment which will require financial institutions to advertise only in terms of APR.  Even if some people do not understand APR they know they are comparing like with like.  It represents progress.</P>

      <P>&ldquo; `borrower' means a consumer acting as a borrower;&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Arising from the insertion on Report Stage in this House of the provisions relating to credit sale, the term &ldquo;buyer&rdquo; was used for the first time.  As in the case of &ldquo;borrower&rdquo;, a &ldquo;buyer&rdquo; has been defined as a consumer acting as a buyer. In order to reflect the fact that the term &ldquo;borrower&rdquo; is used in Part IX relating to moneylending, &ldquo;borrower&rdquo; has now been defined in the same fashion i.e. &ldquo;borrower&rdquo; means consumer acting as a borrower.</P>
      <P>In relation to Seanad amendment No. 19, the revised text of subsection (2) of section 2 for the first time refers to buyer and seller and lists the various parties to the agreement in correct alphabetical order.  Dáil consequential amendment No. 7 is purely a textual amendment.  As a result, the definition &ldquo;collecting repayments&rdquo; now means in respect of a moneylending agreement, the collection of repayments in respect of the agreement at a place other than a business premises of the moneylender. That may well refer to Seanad amendment No. 7 rather than Dáil consequential amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 104 deals with the repayment book which a moneylender is required to provide in respect of each moneylending transaction.  Section 105 stipulates the records to be maintained by a moneylender.  Throughout Part IX of the Bill, which deals with moneylending, the previous references to consumer have been replaced by the term &ldquo;borrower&rdquo;. In the interests of consistency, it is necessary to insert &ldquo;borrower&rdquo; in place of &ldquo;consumer&rdquo; in sections 104 and 105.  Section 107 is concerned with moneylending agreements which <Col N="1505" /> include a collection charge.  In the interests of consistency the term &ldquo;consumers&rdquo; in line 26, page 58, is being replaced by the word &ldquo;borrowers&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>&ldquo; `credit-sale agreement' means a credit agreement for the sale of goods under which the purchase price or part of it is payable in instalments and the property in the goods passes to the buyer immediately upon the making of the agreement;&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>On Report Stage in this House I introduced provisions which regulate credit sale agreements for the first time. However, on that occasion the Bill did not contain a definition of &ldquo;credit sale agreement&rdquo;.  The Seanad amendment rectified this omission and defines a credit sale agreement as a credit agreement for the sale of goods under which the purchase price or part of it is payable in instalments and the property in the goods passes to the buyer immediately upon the making of the agreement.</P>
      <P>Section 38 provides that credit agreements other than an overdraft facility must contain the notice set out in Part I of the Third Schedule.  The notice shows consumers at a glance the full extent of the financial commitment they are undertaking.  Amendment No. 68 excludes credit sale agreements from having this form of notice because it cannot apply to an agreement for the purchase of goods.</P>

      <P>I move that the Committee agree with the Seanad in amendment No. 12:</P>
      <P>In page 12, between lines 29 and 30, the following definition inserted:</P>
      <P>&ldquo; `financial accommodation' includes credit and the letting of goods;&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1510" /> In the course of amendments relating to advertising or offering credit in Part III of the Bill adopted on Report Stage in this House, the term &ldquo;a financial accommodation&rdquo; was introduced into the Bill.  The Seanad amendment corrects the omission.  As a result &ldquo;a financial accommodation&rdquo; now relates to all forms of credit and the letting or hiring of goods by means of hire purchase or consumer hire.</P>
    <P>Section 24 deals with the advertising of availability of credit for goods or services. This section provides that the cash price, the total cost of credit, the number and amount of instalments, the duration of the intervals between instalment payments, the number of instalments which have to be paid before delivery of goods and details of any deposit payable must be included in the advertisement.  The amendment replaces the reference to &ldquo;credit&rdquo; with the wider term &ldquo;a financial accommodation&rdquo; which is defined as including credit and the letting of goods.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 47 follows on from the previous amendment which replaces the word &ldquo;credit&rdquo; with &ldquo;a financial accommodation&rdquo;.  A specific requirement has now been placed on advertisers to state the nature of the financial accommodation on offer, for example, cash, loan, hire purchase or consumer hire.  This transparency is important as consumers are often confused as to what credit product is on offer.</P>
    <P>Section 26 requires that where an advertisement purports to compare repayments or costs under one form of credit it shall contain the relevant terms of each form of credit advertised.  These amendments replace &ldquo;credit&rdquo; with the wider expression &ldquo;a financial accommodation&rdquo; which includes credit and hiring.</P>
    <P>Section 140 relates to the making of regulations in relation to the duty to display information about the type of business being undertaken as regards the provision of credit.  Consistent with the substitution in earlier amendments of the term &ldquo;a financial accommodation&rdquo;<Col N="1511" /> for the word &ldquo;credit&rdquo;, this change of wording is now applied to section 140.</P>

There are not many people from whom one borrows or purchases goods who will be so open about one's repayments.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the Deputies' comments.  I have only seriously started to struggle with the date of implementation of the Bill.  Its provisions are far-reaching and it will take some time for the Director of Consumer Affairs to prepare his office so that it will be capable of responding to the expected onslaught as a result of the new rights conferred on consumers and the new duties imposed on the director. We have dealt with this in the course of discussion on the Bill.  In the Seanad a number of Senators pointed out that there is not much point in having the first major consumer Bill on the Statute <Col N="1512" /> Book if that information is not conveyed to the public.  It is the intention of the director to engage in a promotion campaign about the Bill, the new powers it confers on consumers, their rights and how they vindicate them.  For that reason, some sections of the Bill may be more slowly implemented than others because they will place serious and onerous new duties on the director and his office in particular.</P>

Can we put an onus on them to explain exactly what the agreement means and what rights the consumer will have?  Unfortunately, I was absent from some of the debates on this Bill and perhaps the Minister has covered this matter in another section.

There will be enormous changes to application forms and so forth.</P>
      <P>With regard to the other matter raised by Deputy Ryan, I remind him, since he has not followed the Bill closely before now, that the Bill provides for a 10 day cooling off period during which time the consumer can reflect on the bargain secured or otherwise.</P>

They also point to the fact that they had to alter their systems to accommodate the Unfair Terms Directive, which we introduced in February this year, and that we would now require them to do that a second time.

      <P>In page 12, subsection (1), line 27, to delete &ldquo;section 152&rdquo; amd substitute &ldquo;Part XV&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This relates to the question raised previously about pawnbrokers.  The amendment relates to the definition of moneylender. A moneylender does not <i>inter alia</i> include any pawnbroker carrying on the business of pawnbroking in accordance with the provisions of the Pawnbrokers' Act, 1964.  This Act is now amended by not alone section 152 but also sections 151 and 153 which, taken together, comprise Part XV of this Bill. This is the purpose of this amendment.</P>
      <P>Seanad amendment No. 21 is a technical amendment to the pawnbrokers' legislation.  Arising from amendments adopted on Report Stage in this House, the Pawnbrokers' Act, 1964 has now been amended not alone by section 152 but also by sections 151 and 153.  These three sections, taken together, comprise Part XV of the Bill.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>

      <P>&ldquo; `partnership' has the meaning assigned to it by the Partnership Act, 1890;&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This refers to the use of the term &ldquo;partnership&rdquo; which is used elsewhere in the Bill.  Until Committee Stage in the Seanad it had not been defined.  The <Col N="1515" /> self-explanatory amendment remedies this omission and inserts a definition of partnership.</P>

      <P>In page 14, lines 1 to 5 deleted.</P>
      <P>One amendment relates to interpretation and the other relates to successive credit agreements.  The definition of successive credit agreements and section 49 dealing with successive credit agreements have been deleted.  These were included in the Bill at a time when credit agreements included hire purchase agreements.  This is not now the case as successive hire purchase agreements are provided for separately in section 75, Credit agreements such as cash loans cannot be the subject of the provisions of section 49 which provide that successive agreements shall be regarded as having revoked the earlier agreement and consisting of the combined terms of both agreements.  It is essentially a tidying up provision.</P>

    <P>In page 14, line 8, after &ldquo;credit&rdquo;<Col N="1516" />&ldquo;exclusive of any sum payable as a penalty or as compensation or damages for breach of the agreement&rdquo; inserted.</P>
    <P>The total cost of credit does not include any sums payable as a penalty or as compensation or damages for breach of the agreement.  Therefore, the purpose of this amendment is clarity. The underlying approach to the calculation of the cost of credit is that the consumer will at all times abide by the terms of the agreement.  Thus, to build into the total cost of credit any cost in relation to a breach, which one assumes will not occur, would be erroneous. Therefore, such payments are now specifically excluded from the definition of the total cost of credit.</P>

      <P>The term &ldquo;undertaking&rdquo; is used elsewhere in the Bill to describe the person on whose behalf credit or mortgage intermediaries act, but the term &ldquo;undertaking&rdquo; had not been defined until now.

    </Speaker>
    <P>The sale of goods on interest free credit is becoming more and more popular as a sales or marketing technique. <Col N="1518" /> However, quite often the price of the goods is inflated because of an inbuilt but undisclosed interest charge.  This amendment means that sellers of goods who advertise them as being interest free are now covered by the Bill whereas, for example, the small shopkeeper who makes goods like bread or milk available on tick but does not advertise the fact is not covered by the Bill.</P>

      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to ensure that credit effected by means of credit cards are within the scope of the Bill.  Section 3 sets out the application of the Bill and provides for certain exemptions, one of which being a credit agreement under which no interest is charged, provided the consumer agrees to repay the credit in a single payment.

Persons found guilty of such an offence are liable to a fine not exceeding £1,500 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 28 designated that sections in Part IX relating to moneylending, contraventions of which shall be an indictable offence.  A person who alters, falsifies or attempts to alter or falsify; a moneylender who fails to issue a person acting on his behalf with authorisation to so engage in the business of moneylending on his behalf, or a person who collects on behalf of a moneylender, without such authorisation; a person who engages in the business of moneylending without a moneylending licence and without maintaining a business premises for the purposes of moneylending; a person who acts on behalf of an unlicensed moneylender; a moneylender who fails to keep the necessary records; a moneylender who charges expenses on moneylending loans; a moneylender who fails to comply with the requirements relating to collection charges; a person who has possession or control of any document belonging to another person; a person who collects outside the permitted or agreed times; or a person selling goods on the occasion that a cash loan is advanced shall be guilty of an indictable offence.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 31 makes contravention of section 121, that is, prohibition on alteration or falsification of a mortgage intermediary authorisation, also an indictable offence.</P>
    <P>The effect of consequential Dáil amendments Nos. 3 and 4 is to reposition the reference to section 147, nature of the finance arranged, to be explained to the consumer from paragraph (i) to paragraph (g).  Paragraph (i) deals with those sections in Part XI, <Col N="1525" /> contravention of which results in a summary offence.  Section 147 will, on the next print of the Bill, move into Part XII, credit intermediaries.  Paragraph (g) contains the references to the sections in Part XII, contravention of which result in summary offence.</P>

    <P>The omnibus provision in former section 17 concerning unenforceability has been deleted.  During Report Stage in this House I tabled a number of amendments to those Parts of the Bill dealing with general credit agreements, Part IV; hire purchase, Part VII and consumer hire agreements, Part VIII,-and thereby inserted in each of those Parts a separate and specific enforceability provision.  These are contained in sections 40, 62 and 88 which, <Col N="1529" /> similar to section 17, provide that agreements which do not comply with the requirements as to form and content are not enforceable by a creditor or owner. The new sections also mirror the proviso contained in section 17 where if a court is satisfied that the failure to comply was not deliberate and has not prejudiced the consumer, the agreement may be regarded as enforceable.</P>
    <P>The updating of the cross-reference contained in amendment No. 77 &mdash; and this relates also to amendment No. 76 &mdash; will happen automatically and thus does not require an amendment.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am speaking to what is in the Bill and that is the problem.  In spite of my best endeavours as a Government backbencher, contacts with a Minister in my party, other Ministers and Ministers of State and recognising that the Government wanted to accept in principle the recommendations laid down by the commission, it <Col N="1531" /> is important that, on behalf of my constituents, I express my grave reservations about what is in the Bill, particularly the Schedule as it relates to Tipperary North and South.</P>
      <P>I asked that the Minister and the Government consider the minimum changes I proposed which would not alter the thrust of the report, the number of seats, but would have regard to the views of the public in the areas to which I referred on Second Stage.  I should not let this opportunity pass without restating my grave reservations about the Bill.</P>
      <P>The Constitution states that the Oireachtas is the final arbiter in this regard.  The rights of the people in Cappawhite and Donohill and their normal affinity with Tipperary town and county council electoral areas, such as Cashel with Tipperary South County Council, have been disregarded.  The commission by drawing a pen through the townland of Ballingarry ensured that the village of Ballingarry fell within the constituency of Tipperary South and the remainder of the parish is transferred to the constituency of Tipperary North.  As a representative of Tipperary South, it is ridiculous that I will have to drive through Tipperary North to get back to Tipperary South to serve the people in the Ballingarry area.  That type of division of a constituency and a parish is ridiculous.  The people are annoyed and feel disenfranchised.</P>
      <P>Nobody has taken from the commission's work or condemned it for carrying out necessary work, but people in offices in this city should not disregard the people of rural Ireland, rather they should consider their suggestions.  I am disappointed that the Government has not listened to my pleas in regard to the Bill because they would not interfere with the legitimacy of what the commission was seeking to achieve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I asked and had hoped that the Government would table an amendment because it would be inappropriate for me to table one.  I was given an <Col N="1532" /> assurance by Oireachtas Members from all parties in Tipperary North and South that they agreed with what I was trying to do and considered that I was probably someone with sufficient influence to achieve it.  I am disappointed I have failed in that regard.  This is my last opportunity to state the case on behalf of those people.  If this Bill is passed without any Government reference to that anomaly, those people having been represented by me, the Ceann Comhairle and others for many years will find themselves for the first time in a constituency with a mountain dividing them from their public representatives in Tipperary North.  I am elected to speak for them and, irrespective of the political consequences of what I am saying it is a shame we have disregarded their rights.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support what Deputy Ferris said.  My colleague, Deputy Michael Smith, was the first to raise this matter on Second Stage when he pointed out, as Deputy Ferris stated, that it is ludicrous that parishes will be split, and I agree.</P>
      <P>It was suggested at that stage that if there were all-party agreement, changes could be made.  As there appeared to be all-party agreement on this issue, it is regrettable the Minister did not see fit to make the changes requested.  The Deputies from both parts of Tipperary made very good cases.</P>
      <P>It is grossly unfair to ask Deputies to cover the Mayo constituency.  I worked in County Mayo for a year and know how large it is.  It is not possible for public representatives to properly represent such a large constituency.  It is also regrettable that the Minister did not see fit to make changes requested for that constituency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>I am one of the Deputies who must cover the Mayo constituency. It is fine for members of the commission to sit at their desks in Dublin and make decisions that will affect rural areas about which they have no understanding but when this Bill is enacted, Mayo <Col N="1533" /> Deputies will devote most of their attention to the towns of Castlebar, Ballina and Westport where the concentration of votes will be.  The outlying areas of Charlestown, Blacksod and Belmullet will be ignored.  I travel 185 miles to Belmullet once a month and still do not have one-quarter of the Erris area covered.  Erris is as big as County Louth.</P>
      <P>What is proposed is disgraceful.  It is all very fine for the commission to examine figures and maps and claim that County Mayo is a small percentage short of the number of people required to retain a two seat constituency.  Since I was elected to the House many powers have been taken away from Ministers. Even today a Bill was introduced which will devolve powers to a medicines board.  For far too long we have been taking powers from Ministers and giving them to commissions.  Members of such commissions are not aware of what takes place in rural Ireland.  I challenge members of the electoral commission to visit Mayo and see the position for themselves.  Some time ago I tabled a question seeking information on the distance from Blacksod to Dublin and received an incorrect answer.  In view of that, how could members of the commission judge how people in the west should be represented?</P>
      <P>This is a bad Bill and were it not for the party system I would be voting against it.  The Labour, Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil and Progressive Democrats Parties should come together and refuse to accept the commission's decision because it is not a correct one for the people of Tipperary and Mayo.  As a public representative I cannot be expected to cover the Charlestown and Blacksod areas in one day.  Last weekend I was expected to cover the Ballinrobe, Castlebar and Belmullet areas. That is not possible for any public representative. When this Bill is passed there will be more by-elections because Deputies will drive at speed through their constituencies and perhaps be killed in accidents.  Deputies should be provided with helicopters to cover their constituencies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>Unlike my colleagues, my constituency will be unaffected by this change, but we are at the bottom of the league as far as population per Member is concerned.  The constituency of Sligo-Leitrim has 20,014 population per Member of the Dáil, a variation from the national average of minus 5.76 per cent.  I do not know what changes will be made in the future but, despite what Deputy Ring said, I am glad a commission has been established.</P>
      <P>However, I am extremely disappointed the commission did not avail of this opportunity to reverse the ridiculous decision of the previous commission to join Roscommon in Connacht with Longford in Leinster.  In doing that, it not only crossed a major physical barrier in the Shannon, but the provincial barrier, the Euro constituency barrier and the barrier of the ancient kingdom.  The people in Roscommon are represented by Deputy Connor from Fine Gael.  In bygone times the local chieftains in Longford were more used to knocking each others heads off than co-operating in one constituency.</P>
      <P>We operate an excellent proportional representation system that returns party Deputies almost in proportion to their support nationally.  Admittedly it brings in the odd maverick and the odd partly off the wall Deputy, but probably only in proportion to the number of such people outside the House.  The proportional representation system provides stability.  A Government's term of office is now four years and, having regard to the way in which parties on all sides are hopping into bed with each other, there is little danger of us not having a Government.  We now have political promiscuity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All parties should come together and examine our electoral system.  Ninety-five per cent of our time is spent on constituency work, and not legislating as should be the case.  We cannot carry out proper research or other necessary work because, if we do, we will not get reelected. It is pointless being a great legislator unless one is a Member of the <Col N="1535" /> House in which legislation is passed.  All parties should have the courage to come together and introduce a new system. As demonstrated on two occasions recently, we will not get a single party Government.  The public want some form of proportional representation, but there could be variations of that system. It is not possible to have good legislators under the present system. However, I am glad we have a commission to implement the changes proposed in the Bill.  Some of the Minister's predecessors were electoral engineers. They succeeded in moving some of their party's votes from one side of a river to the other and as a result returned more of their members to the Dáil.  At least that can no longer happen.  Overall I welcome the changes, but I object to the position in the Longford-Roscommon constituency and I am sure the changes in Tipperary and Mayo will cause local difficulties.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>With the exception of the last speaker, only the wounded are contributing tonight.  The Constitution states that constituency boundaries must be redrawn every 12 years at a maximum.  Therefore, it is unconstitutional for Deputies to be changed from one constituency to another in a shorter period of time.  Twelve years is a reasonable timeframe.  It is the equivalent of a farmer leasing land for a five-year period, ploughing, drilling and sowing it &mdash; and in my case, draining it &mdash; yet when the crop is ready somebody else harvests it.  I consider that to be an unconstitutional method of redrawing constituencies.  Assuming that an independent commission will continue to recommend the redrawing of constituencies, I advocate that its membership remain unchanged for the maximum period.  It is unconstitutional when 21 constituencies have not been changed but another 21 have been severely changed, while others have been changed only slightly.  That is not a fair way of conducting business.  Furthermore, if every constituency was altered <Col N="1536" /> in the same way or if there were fewer alterations, our representation would be totally unbalanced.  For example, it does not make sense to take an area from one end of west Galway and add to it at another or, if a constituency is overpopulated, to reduce the overall area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv" hpid="Éamon Ó Cuív Éamon Ó Cuív">
      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>I can concur with much of what has been said.  On the other hand, it is easy to blame a commission for taking decisions based on the terms of references we have given it and not have sufficient courage to direct its members in the way in which we would like them to operate.  The advantage of such a commission is that it can divide constituencies in an impartial manner but it is our job to direct its membership <i>vis-á-vis</i> the structure under which they must function.</P>
      <P>I agree with what has been said about the position in County Mayo, in that I have always argued that some cognisance should be taken of the size of a constituency, particularly sparsely populated ones.  Probably I am one of the few Members who has no complaint about the present boundaries redrawn, while I did have some about the previous review.  Therefore, I can view this more objectively.  However, I did complain that in the old Galway West constituency cognisance was not taken of the fact that there were four offshore islands that had to be serviced.  Without any disrespect to the electorate of Dublin &mdash; recognising that they have Bull Island and Ireland's Eye &mdash; or other city constituencies, it is very difficult to service offshore islands whose people are entitled to the same service and to meet their public representatives as their counterparts on the mainland.  The same problem obtains in County Mayo with two offshore islands inhabited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We might well have included those offshore islands in the terms of reference of the commission since it has been suggested that, in sparsely populated rural areas, we should opt for three-seat or four-seat constituencies, but we did not write in that stipulation this time, which is where the flaw occurred.  Let us <Col N="1537" /> call a spade a spade; we could have written it in but we balked at doing so and we are now reaping the reward.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">

    <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv" hpid="Éamon Ó Cuív Éamon Ó Cuív">
      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>If Deputy Nealon checks the commission's terms of reference he will discover they were changed this time.  Previously it was recommended that there be five-seat constituencies in densely populated areas but that was not advocated this time.</P>
      <P>If we are talking about moving away from four and five seat constituencies or the possibility of encountering difficulties effecting constitutional change, I might point out that there is no constitutional barrier to our deciding to have three seat constituencies of a uniform size nationwide; there is nothing to prevent us doing that.  To a certain extent it would make a lot of sense that we would all represent three-seat constituencies rather than some three, some four and others five, irrespective of which part of the country we represent.</P>
      <P>If we are serious about reform there are ways and means of doing so.  I have always objected to the list system.  I do not like the idea of a party being able to decide that if a person wants to vote for a specific party, the candidates will be placed in order and the party will decide who will top the list&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Under our present system, and on the basis of a lack of tolerence tested in the famous court case of the sixties, it appears to me to be farcical to take small slices of counties and place them neatly in others.  For example, the electorate of east Kildare were put into Wicklow and are now back in Kildare but a portion of Carlow has been appended to Wicklow.  There was another example where a portion of <Col N="1538" /> County Galway adjacent to me was placed into County Mayo &mdash; thank God it has been put back into County Galway &mdash; but the electorate concerned still resorted to their Galway representatives because the local authority offices and everything else was located in Galway.</P>
      <P>Although I doubt that a referendum is necessary to avoid that type of farcical arrangement, I think the electorate would be very quick to pass it.  When this Bill has been passed &mdash; I agree with Deputy McCormack that the membership of the commission should not be altered more frequently than every 12 years &mdash; it might be well for us all, after the recess, to examine this issue in the cold light of day and endeavour to advance some long term proposals to improve the present electoral position.</P>

      <P>This debate certainly confirmed the old adage that one cannot please all of the people all of the time.</P>
      <P>I listened with a certain amount of understanding and sympathy to Members' comments.  I would not predict any likelihood of a subsidy for helicopters. Members will also understand that I will not propose any change in the recommendations of the commission which would set an unfortunate precedent and undermine the work of any future commission.  Since the establishment of the first commission in 1977 the Oireachtas has never changed recommendations presented in legislative form and I do not consider it would be appropriate to deviate from the good practice of previous Governments.  We must accept these recommendations as a package.  Therefore, I would not agree to any change.</P>
      <P>I should like to avail of this opportunity to thank the chairman of the commission, Mr. Justice Richard Johnson and its members who lived up to their hard task conscientiously and impartially.  It is only right that we record our thanks to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the points Deputy Ó Cuív raised, when debating the Electoral Bill, 1994, <Col N="1539" /> it will be possible to examine the terms of reference of such commissions.  This time the minimum of restrictions were imposed on the commission but we can debate that matter further then.</P>
    <P>It would not be correct to say, as did Deputy Eoin Ryan, there is all-party agreement or anything like it to implement changes, minor or otherwise, in the recommendations.  I do not think anybody in this House wishes to revert to the bad old days, good precedent having been established by Governments in which the Deputy's party participated.

We must remember that multi-Member constituencies and the single transferable vote system were enshrined in our Constitution so that any change would necessitate constitutional amendment.</P>
      <P>I expect these issues to be considered by the Expert Group on the Constitution now functioning under its chairman, Dr. T.K. Whitaker and next year they will be examined by the all party Oireachtas Committee on the review of the Constitution when no doubt the Deputy will have an opportunity to air his views on our electoral system.</P>
      <P>I thank Members for the views they have expressed.  I do not think it would be possible to have unanimous approval of all the recommendations but the fact that the vast majority of Members are satisfied, in itself, is an indication of their acceptance.</P>

      <P>Tá gá ar mhaithe le forbairt chothrom a dhéanamh ar an tír go mbeadh bóithre náisiúnta den chéad grád ag dul ó chósta go costa go mór mhór nuair atá gá leis le freastal ar fhorbairt atá tarlaithe cheana agus nuair atá gá leis ó thaobh tráchta.</P>
      <P>Nuair a bhíonn an gá atá ann le bóithrí a mheas bunaítear é go minic ar chomhaireamh ADT, no Mean Trácht Laethúil.  Má chuirtear an trácht ar an mbóthar seo i gcomparáid leis na bóithre náisiúnta den chéad grád sa gContae, is léir go bhfuil an trácht ar an mbóthar seo inchurtha leo.  Mar shampla bheadh an trácht ar an mbóthar seo inchurtha leis an trácht ar an N6, N17 agus N 18.</P>
      <P>Idir Gaillimh agus Barna, tá trácht de cúig mhíle dhéag aonad sa lá agus siar sa Spidéal, tá an meán trácht de chúig mhíle cúig céad aonad sa lá.  Ar ndóigh bheadh trácht i bhfad níos troime ar an mbóthar seo sa samhradh ná san ngeimhreadh de bharr cúrsaí turasóireachta.</P>

Tá Eastáit Tionsclaíochta sa Spidéal, sa gCoill Rua in Indreabhán, i mBaile na hAbhann, Ros a Mhíl, Casla agus an Cheathrú Rua.  Freisin déanann an bóthar seo freastal ar na heastáit tionscail ar fad i gceantar na <Col N="1541" /> n-oileán agus freisin i Rosmuc, Cill Chiaráin agus Carna.</P>

    <P>Freisin tá forbairt mhór ádíanamh ar an bhfeilméireacht éisc.  Sa gciontán seo ar iascaireacht sliog éisc.</P>
    <P>Ar ndóigh tá go leor trácht turasóireachta ar an mbóthar seo mar aon le ostáin mhóra ar nós Ostán Cois Fharraige, Ostán na Páirce agus Ostán na Ceathrú Rua.  Ta Ionad Ceardaíochta Mór sa Spidéal.</P>
    <P>Freisin, ar ndóigh, tá daonra mór sa gceantar seo siar an bealach uilig go dtí an Cheathrú Rua, agus tá os coinn cúig mhíle duine in a gcónaí sa gCeathrú Rua féin.</P>
    <P>Mar cheantair fhorbartha agus mar cheantair Ghaeltachta, ba cheart go mbeadh soláthar ceart bóithre iontu.  Ní ceart glacadh leis níos mó go gcaithfidh gach rud stopadh ag an mBaile Mór.</P>
    <P>Déanfar an cás go bhfuil an bóthar ro-dhona le bheith ina phríomhbhóthar náisiúnta.  D'fhéadfá, áfach, an cás céanna a dhéanamh roimhe seo faoin mbóthar a bhí ag dhul trí Léim an Bhradáin agus Maghnuad go Cill Coca.  Ach de bharr go raibh an trácht ar an mbóthar seo agus go mba phríomhbhóthar náisiúnta é bhí an Rialtas in ann airgead ón Eoraip a úsáid le bóthar ceart a thógáil ann.  Mar a chéile don bhóthar go dtí an Cheathrú Rua.</P>
    <P>Fiú leis an airgead atá ar fáil do bhóithre reigiúnacha ar nós an R336 go dtí an Cheathrú Rua ón Eoraip, ní bheidh dóthain ann go deo le caoi cheart a chur ar an mbóthar.  Bóthar nua iomlán atá ag teastáil de bharr na cúinsí <Col N="1542" /> atá luaite agam.  Ní bheidh sé seo ar fáil mura mbeidh an t-aitheantas cuí ar fáil don bhóthar go náisiúnta chun gur féidir ár gcás a chur ar aghaidh le haghaidh cistíocht chuí ón Eoraip.  Tá mé cinnte go mbeidh an tAire sásta breathnú go báúil ar an gceist seo agus beidh mé ag súil le freagra dearfach uaidh.</P>

      <P>Le linn 1993 agus 1994, rinne mo Roinn athbhreithniú ar rangú na mbóithre náisiúnta.  B'é seo an chéad athbhreithniú cuimsitheach a rinneadh ó cuireadh an rangú náisiúnta ar bun i 1977.</P>
      <P>Mar thoradh ar an athbhreithniú seo, cuireadh rangú suas chun dáta ar bun do ghréasán na mbóthar náisiúnta.  Tá sé seo leagtha amach san Ordú um Bóithre Náisiúnta a rinneadh ar 14 Iúil 1994. Deineadh athruithe i gcás bóithre chuig calafoirt thábhachtacha agus chuig na haerfoirt nach raibh rangaithe cheana mar ghóithre náisiúnta, agus freisin, bóithre nua a tógadh ó 1977 i leith.  Cuireadh san áireamh, freisin, athruithe i bpátrún tráchta a tharla le roinnt blianta anuas.</P>
      <P>Cuireadh an t-athbhreithniú seo i gcrích i gcomhairle leis an Údarás um Bóithre Náisiúnta agus na húdaráis áitiúla, agus cuireadh san áireamh na hiarratais uilig a bhí ag mo Roinn ó ghrúpaí áitiúla.  Ní fheicim go mbeidh gá le hathbhreithniú eile mar seo roimh dheireadh an chéid.</P>
      <P>Nuair a déanadh scrúdú ar rangú na mbóithre, socraíodh gurb í Cathair na Gaillimhe an suíomh is oiriúnaí do phointe deiridh an phríomhbhóthair náisiúnta, an N6, mar go bhfuil sé socraithe mar phrionsabal go mbeadh na príomhbhóithre náisiúnta mar cheangail idir príomhchathracha agus bailte móra.</P>
      <P>Ní hionainn athrangú agus breis infheistíochta. Dá gcuirfí an bóthar ón gCeathrú Rua go Cathair na Gaillimhe in áirithe mar chuid den N6, ní tharlófaí dó ach go mbeadh sé ag deireadh scuaine fada de bhóithre náisiúnta a bhfuil infheistíocht ag teastáil uathu.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is í an fhírinne ná go bhfuil an gréasán de bhóithre náisiúnta thar a <Col N="1543" /> bheith sásúil d'éileamh tráchta an lae inniu agus don todhchaí.  Socraíodh ar an ngréasán sin i ndiaidh próiséis fhada agus tar éis an-chuid comhairle a lorg. Ní dhéanfadh méadú ar an ngréasán ach éifeacht an chiste atá ar fáil don ghréasán náisiúnta a lagú, tríd an méid chéanna airgid a scaipeadh thar bhóithre breise.</P>
    <P>I Mí na Nollag 1994, cuireadh rangú na mbóithre réigiúnach ar bhonn reachtúil don chéad uair.  Faoi láthair, tá an bóthar ón gCeathrú Rua go Gaillimh rangaithe mar bhóthar réigiúnach &mdash; an R336.  Ag cur san áireamh an méid atá ráite agam, agus na slait tomhais a úsáidtear le haghaidh athrangú bóithre, ní dóigh liom go bhfuil aon chúis ann chun an bóthar seo a athrangú mar bhóthar náisiúnta.</P>
    <P>I 1995, faoin scéim deontaisí comhíoctha ag an Aontas Eorpach le haghaidh feabhsuithe a dhéanamh ar bhóithre nach bóithre náisiúnta iad, fuair Comhairle Chontae na Gaillimhe deontas de £200,000 do scéim feabhsúcháin ar an mbóthar so ag Casla.  Tabharfaidh sé seo cabhair do chúrsaí fiontair agus tuarasóireachta sa cheantar.  Beidh Comhairle Chontae na Gaillimhe in ann iarratas eile a chur isteach i mbliana faoin scéim chéanna chun deontas a fháil le haghaidh codanna eile den bhóthar seo i 1996.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for coming into the House so late in the evening.  I wish to highlight a problem that has existed in the village of Blarney and its environs for many years, namely, a shortage of water.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position is particularly critical this year because we have had so much fine weather.  Poor pressure and scarcity <Col N="1544" /> of water generally have meant that on several occasions about two weeks ago hundreds of houses in the higher housing estates outside the village were without water for up to ten hours a day, sometimes on three consecutive days. This posed enormous problems for families and residents in those areas who were reduced to primitive conditions through lack of water.  In addition, there was the frightening prospect that if a fire broke out on any of those days there would be no water readily available.</P>
    <P>Finally, the county council responded. Several times every day tankers of water are brought from the dam at Inniscarra and pumped into the reservoir at Blarney to boost supply to enable householders to cope in this particularly dry summer.  That is nothing more than a short term response to an ongoing problem which must be addressed immediately.</P>
    <P>Cork County Council is on the point of sanctioning two more major housing schemes in that area.  That will put additional pressure on a public water supply that is already inadequate.  The same county council has sent a scheme to the Department of the Environment, the contract documents for which have been with the Department since 1987.  The amount of money sought at that time was £750,000 to increase the size of the trunk main from Inniscarra to Blarney and increase the storage of the reservoir at Blarney so that the public water supply could cope with the demand from residents and the commercial sector in the village.</P>
    <P>The situation is getting worse and is particularly bad this year.  This cannot be allowed continue.  For that reason I appeal to the Minister to sanction that scheme so that work can commence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalMoynihan" hpid="Mr. Moynihan Mr. Moynihan">

      <P>Ba mhaith liom mo bhúiochas a ghabháil do Máirín Ní Quill am a thabhairt dom chun tacaíocht a thabhairt don rún seo.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1983 a preliminary report was submitted to the Department by the county council.  In 1987 the contract documents were prepared and forwarded to the <Col N="1545" /> Department of the Environment.  In 1988 the Department confirmed that the documents were in order.  However, it was not possible to indicate when the scheme would be allowed to go to tender and construction.  The council is still awaiting approval to proceed.</P>
    <P>The cost at the time of the application was between £750,000 and £800,000. The project proposed to provide mains and reservoirs to cater for existing and future demands in the area.  Quite a number of planning applications have been granted over the years by Cork County Council.  This proves that there is a growing population in that area.  In the Togher/Cloghroe area alone planning permission has been granted for 100 or more houses this year.</P>
    <P>The recent dry spell has resulted in large areas of Blarney being without water.  Tank loads of water had to be drawn into the area, approximately 6,000 gallons an hour from 5.30 a.m. to 8 p.m.  As Blarney is a famous tourist area I appeal to the Minister to sanction the scheme and to let work begin on the improvement of the water supply to this area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank both Deputies for raising this matter this evening.</P>
      <P>At the outset I think it will be understood that the recent spell of extremely dry weather has caused water supply problems in a number of areas in the country.  Local authorities have sought to respond to these problems by tightening up on demand management and maximising the output from existing treatment works, in this case by ferrying in additional water supply.  However, some supply restrictions have also been necessary.  I would like to compliment local authority staffs for their efforts during the current difficult period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to Blarney, it is accepted that the town has experienced water supply problems over a number of years.  The proposed improvement scheme, for which the contract documents are with my Department, envisages the laying of about 6,500 metres of <Col N="1546" /> 300 millimetre trunk mains from Inniscarra to the Blarney reservoir, together with the construction of additional storage at the reservoir.  The scheme as designed would cost about £1 million.  In common with many other worthwhile projects around the country it simply has not been possible to progress this proposal due to pressure of other priority schemes in the water and sewerage programme.</P>
    <P>Considerable progress has been made in recent years in improving the water supply in the South Cork area with in excess of £8 million being invested over the past five years.  Water projects that have been completed include schemes at Riverstown/Glanmire, Dundurrow/ Kinsale and Carrigaline.  Within the wider south-west region in the current year I have approved tenders for major water schemes in Dingle, Macroom and Schull.  This represents a continuing commitment to the region which should be recognised.  At the same time I am unfortunately not in a position to approve every proposed scheme.</P>
    <P>Despite the fact that we are spending a historically high sum of money improving water supplies around the country, the demand will always be greater than the resources at my disposal.</P>
    <P>The prioritisation of schemes under the water and sewerage programme must take into account a wide range of economic, environmental and public health-safety considerations.  Statutory requirements including those under the drinking water and urban waste water directives must be met.  I have also sought to maintain a reasonable balance between the major public schemes and smaller projects under the group water and small schemes programmes.  The competition for funding is such, however, that I and my predecessors have been forced to make hard choices.</P>
    <P>I am not in a position to approve the contract documents at this time for this scheme.  I can, however, assure the House, and both Deputies that while I cannot provide funds in the current year <Col N="1547" /> I will continue to bear in mind the concerns which they have expressed tonight in assessing priorities in future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I thank your office for allowing me raise this matter.  In November 1990 regulations were brought into effect to enable the Department of Social Welfare to compel deserting husbands and unmarried fathers to make a contribution towards payment by the State to deserted wives and unmarried mothers. At present, the State is paying social welfare to 25,344 deserted wives and 31,711 unmarried mothers.  This represents a total of 57,045.  The total net cost to the Exchequer in the current financial year will exceed £230 million.</P>
      <P>To date, the State has concentrated on pursuing deserting husbands to make a contribution.  No action has been taken to obtain contributions from unmarried fathers.  As regards the ability of deserting husbands to make a contribution, of the 15,000 men investigated by the State approximately 4,000 could afford to make some contribution. However, only 219 or 5 per cent are doing so.  The present contribution from unmarried fathers is nil.</P>
      <P>The annual contribution from the 219 deserting husbands is £330,000 and this represents, in numerical terms, less than 0.5 per cent of the number of women in receipt of such payments.  The monetary contribution represents less than 1 per cent of what is paid out by the State.  It is a national scandal.  There are only four people employed in the maintenance recovery section of the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Taxpayers who will pay in excess of £230 million to deserted wives and unmarried mothers this year deserve better.  They are entitled to expect that those who can afford to contribute should be compelled to do so.  What does the Minister intend to do about enforcing the maintenance recovery <Col N="1548" /> regulations?  It is pointless to have regulations in place unless they are enforced. Either the Minister should admit the regulations do not work and scrap them or he should take the appropriate steps to ensure they are properly enforced. The present position represents the worst form of Irish joke but, unfortunately, the taxpayers who carry the burden are not amused.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The &ldquo;Liability to Maintain Family&rdquo; provisions in the Social Welfare Acts provide for persons to maintain their dependent spouses and children in accordance with their means.  Under the legislation, where a marriage breakdown occurs and a family is dependent on a social welfare payment, the person who is liable to maintain that family must contribute to my Department towards the cost of the family's income support where they have the means to do so.</P>
      <P>From 1991 to the end of June 1995, £537,606 was collected in contributions from liable relatives towards the cost of the payment of lone parent's separated spouses allowance, deserted wife's allowance or deserted wife's benefit to their spouses.  Liable relatives pay either by way of regular direct contribution to my Department or through family law court orders which are transferred to the Department.  Of this amount £163,985 has been received for the first six months of this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to these contribution payments, the operation of the maintenance recovery provisions also yielded savings on scheme expenditure of a further £500,000.  These related scheme savings arise as a result of the withdrawal of <Col N="1549" /> some claims which were actively in payment. For example, some spouses make arrangements to provide adequate support to their families once the Department intervened.  Some people are no longer entitled to the benefit or allowance as a result of new information obtained when the case is investigated. Certain other cases of co-habitation or concealed additional means are also discovered in the course of maintenance recovery investigations.</P>
    <P>Contrary to what the Deputy may believe, there is no crock of gold to be collected in this area.  Of the cases reviewed to date, only about 24 per cent of the spouses with a potential to pay were traceable and working.  The remainder were either receiving social welfare payments themselves, 48 per cent, or were untraceable, 28 per cent, for example, living in the UK or the US.</P>
    <P>The number of relatives contributing will continue to grow significantly as the Department continues its investigations of the cases on hand.  Changes to the liability to maintain provisions in the 1992 Social Welfare Act strengthened the powers of collection and enforcement. Legal proceedings are being considered in a number of cases where the liable relative failed to comply with the legislation.</P>
    <P>The new Maintenance Act, 1994, when commenced, will increase the powers available to the Department to trace and seek payment from those liable relatives now resident in other countries.</P>
    <P>In relation to unmarried fathers, voluntary groups, such as The Federation of Services for Unmarried Parents and their Children, have raised concerns that the application of the liability to maintain provisions to unmarried parents could lead to fathers not being prepared to identify themselves on birth certificates or to make any effort to support their children.</P>
    <P>Partly because of concerns expressed, it was decided to concentrate on putting a workable system in place for those <Col N="1550" /> who are married or separated, where a greater maintenance obligation exists, before seeking to recover payments in unmarried parent cases.</P>
    <P>A review of the liable relative's provision is being undertaken and in this context a number of issues have emerged.  These include: the lack of an appeals mechanism in the legislation; the administrative rules for assessment of ability to pay and the correlation of these to court assessment rules in family law maintenance cases; the effect of the system on existing informal maintenance arrangements, part-time child custody, provision by liable relatives of &ldquo;maintenance-in-kind&rdquo;, for example, VHI, mortgage repayments, etc. for their spouses; transfer of maintenance from women recipients particularly when they have mortgage commitments and other regular outgoings; the identification and pursuit of putative fathers in unmarried cases; the need to interact more effectively with family mediation services at initial desertion-separation stage to ensure that maintenance issues are resolved then; the tracing of deserting spouses who have disappeared without making any contribution to their families and the provision of resources including staffing of the maintenance recovery unit in the Department.</P>
    <P>The system of maintenance determination and recovery is a new one in this country.  It is a positive development in ensuring adequate support for separated persons or parents looking after children on their own and also for ensuring that where people have the means to do so, they take responsibility and contribute towards the upkeep of their spouse and-or their children.</P>
    <P>I emphasise that this must be implemented with sensitivity in order to avoid the possibility of deepening the divide between parents which may rebound on the welfare of the children of a broken marriage.  We must not rush into this like a bull in a china shop and end up in the same position as Britain who did just that.</P>

      <P>I thank the Chair for allowing me to raise the failure of the Council of Ministers to reach agreement on this programme.  The efforts of some propagandists, on behalf of the Minister, to say that a major concession was won by allowing this crucial matter to remain on the agenda prompted me to raise the issue.  If that was winning something I am at a loss to know what losing something would be because the Minister failed to achieve EU agreement on the long awaited poverty programme.</P>
      <P>The decision by the Ministers to keep the programme on the agenda is nothing more than political cynicism.  It is the only EU programme against social exclusion and it should not be shelved. There is no justification for the inordinate delay in reaching agreement on this matter.  I cannot understand why the Minister does not improve on the halfhearted effort he has made on this matter. His weak and ineffective contribution at the Council of Ministers meeting is mind boggling.  No effort was made to visit his counterparts in other capitals.</P>
      <P>This is a major programme with funding of 121 million ECUs or about £100 million.  I would like the Minister to show his commitment to the programme. He stated at a committee meeting in Kildare House recently that £10 million is due to Ireland under this programme.  There is considerable concern among those involved in combating poverty at the failure to reach agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The poverty III programme was highly successful in a number of areas. For example, there were three very worthwhile projects in Connemara, Limerick and Dublin.  I raise this matter to try to give it some degree of urgency.  It is essential this programme is progressed with commitment and as a matter of urgency.  I call on the Minister to put <Col N="1552" /> this EU programme against social exclusion at the top of his agenda.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Deputy's support for my efforts in this regard.  I share the concern and disappointment of Members of this House at the failure of the EU Social Affairs Council of Ministers to adopt the EU Commission's fourth poverty programme, due to the opposition of the German and British Governments.  The Deputy and other Members are already fully aware of the background to the EU poverty programmes in Ireland and I recently addressed the Select Committee on Social Affairs on this issue.</P>
      <P>The third EU poverty programme supported three pilot projects in Ireland aimed at piloting new and innovative ways of tackling the underlying causes of poverty.  The work of these projects has been mainstreamed under the Department of Social Welfare's community development programme and other Government programmes and their future is secure for as long as they are needed.</P>
      <P>I am convinced that there is a continuing role for Europe in promoting and supporting action and research to address poverty and fostering exchanges of experiences and best practices between member states.  While the Commission's proposals for a fourth EU poverty programme involve a doubling of the budget to 121 million ECUs, the programme would still only account for 0.03 per cent of budget spending, which is less than one-third of 1 per cent.  The programme contains proposals for national level projects to tackle specific poverty issues and aspects of the problem of social exclusion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish Government has strongly supported the Commission's proposals. The issue has been raised on a number of occasions with our European colleague by myself as Minister for Social Welfare, the Taoiseach and other Ministers. I raised it at the Council meeting and the Taoiseach also raised it at the Cannes Summit two weeks ago.  The <Col N="1553" /> proposal for a fourth poverty programme which requires unanimity has, however, been blocked by Germany at previous social affairs meetings, who has now been joined by Britain in its opposition.  The German Government object not only to the timing of the new programme and to the doubling of the budget but also object in principle to the proposal on the grounds that the EU has no competence to deal with poverty and that it is solely a matter for national Governments.</P>
    <P>As I informed the Select Committee on Social Affairs, the Commission's proposals for a fourth poverty programme were on the agenda again at the Social Affairs Council meeting on 29 June 1995, having first appeared on the agenda in April 1994 when the Deputy's party was in Government and held the social welfare portfolio and they failed at that stage to overcome the German objections.</P>
    <P>I was aware this would be a crucial meeting and personally led the Irish delegation on this issue and took the initiative in pressing at the meeting the urgent need to secure agreement on a successor programme to poverty III, having, as a Government, done everything humanly possible to try to overcome the objections of the German Government beforehand.</P>
    <P>The majority of the other member states rowed in behind me in support of Poverty IV, arguing that there is a clear European dimension and role here; that it is difficult to comprehend or to explain the delay in agreeing such a modest proposal to ordinary people on the ground and that this delay raises serious questions about the ability of the Union to respond to the real needs of its people.</P>
    <P>The reality is that this proposal requires the agreement of all member states before it is adopted.  At the meeting on 29 June, the German and UK delegations were not prepared to agree to the commission's proposals. However, due to the support I was able to muster from other member states, we <Col N="1554" /> succeeded in ensuring that this item was not disposed of and remains on the agenda.  It will be returned to at the next meeting under the Spanish Presidency. The important point is that the project remains on the agenda.  The push was to remove it completely and shelve it.  The success is that the project remains alive.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, I have impressed on Commissioner Pádraig Flynn the urgent necessity for him to look again at the design of the Commission's draft programme to see what can be done to modify it so that perceived shortcomings can be addressed and to see how the political and cultural sensitivities of objector member states can be addressed.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, we also need to look at alternatives if it still proves not possible to persuade the German and UK Governments to modify their stance on this issue.  It is now essential for the Commissioner to come up with new ideas on how the European Union can make a real and visible commitment to tackling poverty if agreement on poverty IV cannot be secured.</P>
    <P>We need a Europe that expresses solidarity with the poor and socially excluded.  We need a Europe that has a human dimension concerned with real people and which offers a place in its society for those who are socially excluded by poverty and unemployment. A Europe that is concerned only with market economic forces and does not offer a secure future to all its people, including the unemployed, people with disabilities and minority groups, is of little value to society and will not survive.</P>
    <P>If, again, it is not possible to secure unanimity on this issue, then Ireland will be looking for a mechanism whereby member states will be able to work together in the EU to keep poverty and social exclusion on the agenda and to allocate the funding already provided in the EU budget.</P>
    <P>For its own part, the Irish Government is keeping poverty and social exclusion to the forefront on the <Col N="1555" /> national agenda following the recent Government decision to develop an anti-poverty strategy which will involve Government Departments drawing up specific plans to target poverty in Irish society.  I will be urging that this action at national level should be matched by ongoing actions at EU level to ensure a continued emphasis on the need for <Col N="1556" /> concerted approaches aimed at reducing levels of poverty and disadvantage.</P>

In reviewing the current arts infrastructure in the State, the plan identifies priority zones and centres of excellence as the focus of particular attention.  The priority zones are the counties of Laois, Wicklow, Donegal, Longford, Westmeath, Offaly, Leitrim, Tipperary and Roscommon and the centres of excellence are the cities of Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford.</P>
      <P>In order to be consistent with the objectives of &ldquo;The Arts Plan 1995-97&rdquo;, I have decided to examine applications under the cultural development incentives scheme from the priority zones and centres of excellence initially.

      <P>Between 1992 and 1995 the National Parks and Wildlife Service allocated £137,000 for corncrake conservation measures operated by the Irish Wildbird Conservancy (IWC).  All of these funds, except £4,000 towards survey costs in 1993, have been earmarked for the corncrake grants scheme.  The 1995 allocation is £60,000 and the scheme is operating in North Donegal, Shannon Callows and Mayo. As the rural environment protection scheme REPS is now operational I see no good conservation reason the annual interim funding arrangements, which have been in place since 1992, should continue beyond the end of this year. Even though the IWC has expressed reservations about the suitability of REPS as it now stands to cater for corncrake conservation, I am aware that they are strongly committed to its promotion. The IWC are giving special attention to encouraging the uptake of the REPS scheme in areas where the corncrake grant scheme is in operation by asking farmers to consult with an approved REPS planner.  It is hoped that the farmers will join REPS within 12 months of submitting a 1995 grant application under the corncrake scheme.  I am satisfied that this is the best way forward and, in the circumstances, I am not prepared at this stage to make any long term financial commitment about the funding of the corncrake grants scheme.  I will, of course, pursue with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry the concerns of the IWC about REPS and other matters to its operation.</P>

    <P>However, heritage is probably best served through the continuation of such properties in private ownership, with State acquisition being considered only where they are in danger of being abandoned or if no way can be found to keep them in private or semi-private ownership, or in special cases where it is desirable to keep them open to the public and where this can be achieved only through State acquisition.  State intervention in relation to properties of national significance must be considered <Col N="1349" /> in the context of scarce resources and the necessity to establish priorities.</P>
    <P>The parks and gardens which have been considered for purchase by the State since January 1995 are the Lucan Demense, the acquisition of which is in progress; Kilmacurragh, County Wicklow, currently under consideration; and Shackleton Gardens, which I understand was acquired by a private purchaser recently, the State's negotiations for purchase not being successful.</P>

      <P>The arts and culture sector has an important role to play in promoting an understanding of the different traditions on this island and this is recognised in &ldquo;The Arts Plan 1995-1997&rdquo; which sets out through its strategic objectives &ldquo;to promote North-South co-operation in and through arts&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Through An Chomhairle Ealaíon and the Arts Council of Northern Ireland, there already exists significant cross-Border co-operation on arts and culture. For some 20 years the two councils have provided joint funding for a range of arts projects in music, dance, literature, visual arts and other art forms.  In addition, since the mid-70's the two councils have held an annual joint meeting. This contact has been intensified since last year when, following my meeting with Minister Ancram at Stormont, a high level joint committee involving the chairpersons and directors of both councils was established to seek opportunities for joint projects and to monitor ongoing activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This work will be further enhanced with the recent appointment of a Co-operation Officer by the two councils, <Col N="1350" /> with specific responsibility for all matters relating to exchange, touring and joint North-South projects.  A European Affairs Officer has already been appointed on a joint basis by both councils since 1992.</P>
    <P>There is also a considerable Northern input into two cultural projects of major international significance &mdash;&ldquo;L'Imaginaire Irlandais&rdquo;, which will take place in France in 1996 and Ireland's presence as the theme country at the Frankfurt International Book Fair, also in 1996.  In the case of the &ldquo;L'Imaginaire Irlandais&rdquo; project, which will involve a wide range of contemporary artistic and cultural events, five of the seventeen Irish artists to be featured in the core visual arts exhibition to be held in Paris are from Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>The INTERREG II programme under the EU Structural Funds and the EU Initiative for Peace and Reconciliation will provide opportunities for the further development of cross-Border co-operation.</P>

      <P>It is increasingly being acknowledged at EU level that cultural industries, which embrace heritage activities, represent a source of real economic activity, employment and value added. However, because of definitional problems, the nature and fragmentation of cultural activities and the difficulty in collecting statistical data, the quantification of the economic and employment benefits of cultural industries presents difficulties in most EU countries, including Ireland.  Given these problems, the Deputy will accept that it is not possible at present to set job creation targets in arts, culture and heritage for a given period.</P>
      <P>However, the Coopers and Lybrand Report on &ldquo;The Employment and Economic Significance of the Cultural Industries in Ireland&rdquo;, published in 1994, indicated that the cultural industries (arts, culture and heritage) currently employ the equivalent of 21,500 full-time posts and have a gross annual value of £441 million, of which more than 88 per cent is earned by direct traded activity and only 12 per cent generated by grants and donations.</P>
      <P>Given the significant additional resources which I have placed at the disposal of An Chomhairle Ealaíon, Bord Scannán na hÉireann and tax incentive funding of films under Section 35 of the Finance Act, I am confident that these employment levels have significantly increased since the conclusion of the Coopers and Lybrand research.</P>
      <P>Arts, culture and heritage investment contributes significantly to job creation in the tourism sector.  The EU Structural Funds Tourism Operational Programme, of which investment in heritage and cultural tourism forms and important element, envisages the creation of a total of 35,000 jobs by 1999 comprising 17,250 direct, 6,000 in construction and 11,750 indirect.</P>

      <P>The development of programmes to help the rehabilitation of people in our prisons is primarily a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Justice.  The existing prison education service consists of a partnership between the Department of Justice and a range of agencies, including An Chomhairle Ealaíon which supports the Department of Justice in the implementation of the artists in prisons scheme. This scheme allows artists to work with prisoners in one of the country's thirteen prison/detention centres for a period of 8 to 10 days.</P>
      <P>Artists who are interested in the scheme are invited to apply to An Comhairle Ealaíon and all applications are carefully considered by both An Chomhairle and the Department of Justice. A panel of shortlisted artists is drawn up and as opportunities arise within the prison system an appropriate shortlisted artist may be called on to undertake a project within a particular prison.</P>
      <P>Any modification or extension of the artists in prisons scheme would be a matter for An Chomhairle Ealaíon, in consultation, of course, with the Department of Justice.</P>
      <P>I very much agree with initiatives in the Arts and Culture area for prisoners and my Department will be of such assistance as is appropriate and feasible.</P>

      <P>I have been advised by the Director of Public Prosecutions that the number of files involving allegations of sexual abuse of persons under the age of seven years which were sent to his office for the purpose of obtaining a direction as to whether, or not, there should be a prosecution, was as follows: 1992, 51; 1993, 64; 1994, 90.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of the 51 files received in 1992, 14 or 27 per cent resulted in a decision to prosecute.  At least 11 of those prosecutions were to have come, or have come for trial before either the Central Criminal Court or one of the Circuit Courts throughout the country and a verdict has been reached in ten of them. <Col N="1356" /> That verdict has been a conviction in nine cases or in 90 per cent of them.</P>
    <P>Of the 64 files received in 1993, 13 or 20 per cent, resulted in a prosecution. At least eleven of those prosecutions have come before either the Central Criminal Court or one of the Circuit Courts for trial and a verdict has been reached in ten of them.  That verdict has been a conviction in all ten cases.</P>
    <P>Of the 90 files received in 1994, a final decision has been taken in 87 of them. In 18 of those files, or in 21 per cent of them, that decision has been to prosecute. At least 14 of the resulting cases were to have been, or indeed have been, tried in either the Central Criminal Court or one of the Circuit Courts and in five of these, a verdict has been reached.  That verdict has been a conviction in all five cases.</P>
    <P>Prosecutions directed by the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions in each of the years 1992, 1993 and 1994 which were not going for trial to the Central or the Circuit Criminal Courts will have been, or will yet be, disposed of in one of the District Courts.</P>
    <P>The number of files involving allegations of sexual abuse of a child, a person under the age of fifteen years, which were sent to the Office of the Director of Prosecutions for the purpose of obtaining a direction as to whether there should be a prosecution was as follows: 1992, 206; 1993, 278; 1994, 338.</P>
    <P>Of the 206 files received in 1992, 79 or 38 per cent resulted in a decision to prosecute.  At least 58 of those prosecutions were to have come, or have come, for trial before either the Central Criminal Court or one of the Circuit Courts and a verdict has been reached in 54 of them.  In 48 of those cases, which means 89 per cent of them, that verdict has been a conviction.</P>
    <P>Of the 278 files received in 1993 a final decision as to whether there should be a prosecution has been taken in 275 of them.  In 113 of those files, and so in 41 per cent of them, that decision has been to prosecute.  At least 83 of the resulting cases were to have been, or <Col N="1357" /> have been, tried before either the Central Criminal Court or one of the Circuit Courts and a verdict has been reached in 70 of them.  In 69 of those cases, which means 97 per cent of them, that verdict has been a conviction.</P>
    <P>Of the 338 files received in 1994, a final decision as to whether there should be a prosecution has been taken in 329 of them.  In 108 of those files, and so in 33 per cent of them, that decision has been to prosecute.  At least 75 of the resulting cases were to have been, or indeed have been, tried in the Central Criminal Court or one of the Circuit Courts and in 29 a verdict has been reached.  In 28 of those cases, which means in 97 per cent of them, that verdict has been a conviction.</P>
    <P>Prosecutions directed by the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions in each of the years 1992, 1993 and 1994 which were not going for trial to the Central or the Circuit Criminal Courts will have been, or will yet be, disposed of in one of the District Courts.</P>
    <P>The information on prosecutions which came before the District Courts is being sought through the Office of the Chief State Solicitor and the relevant State Solicitors' offices throughout the country and I will forward this to the Deputy as soon as it is available.</P>

      <P>Ireland ratified the European Convention on Human <Col N="1358" /> Rights on 25 February 1953; it entered into force on 3 September 1953.  The Government attaches great importance to Ireland's adherence to the Convention. In Ireland the rights guaranteed under the Convention are protected by the fundamental rights provisions of the Constitution and by other provisions of Irish law.  The question of incorporating the Convention into domestic law has been looked at from time to time as has been the question of incorporation of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights where similar issues arise.  These issues were most recently examined, in consultation with the Attorney General and other Departments concerned, in the context of Ireland's report to the Human Rights Committee established under the UN Covenant on Civil and Political Rights to which the State is a party.  At present there are no plans to incorporate the European Convention into domestic law.  Any such plans would of course, be a matter for all Departments concerned.</P>

      <P>Figures of revenue tax receipts are compiled on a calendar year basis.  The total net receipt of income tax paid through the PAYE system for 1994 amounted to £3,259.1 million, excluding £12.1 million amnesty receipts.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware there is no legal obligation on employers to provide pension benefits for employees under an occupational pension scheme.  An occupational pension scheme is a voluntary arrangement organised by an employer to provide pensions and/or other benefits to employees on retirement or to their surviving dependants on death. Recognising that employees have an entitlement to the social welfare old age (contributory) pension many occupational pension schemes, when being set up by employers, are integrated with the old age (contributory) pension where allowance is made for the basic social insurance pension payable to a fully qualified single contributor in setting the level of benefits provided under <Col N="1360" /> the occupational pension schemes.  Such occupational pension schemes are established and funded on that basis.  It is for the employer when setting up an occupational pension scheme to determine the level of benefits to be provided under the scheme.</P>
      <P>In relation to the Finance Act, 1972, it is the appropriate legislation in respect of the tax treatment of occupational pension schemes set up by employers for their employees.  Section 15 of the Act sets out the various conditions which must be satisfied before a scheme will receive Revenue approval for contributions to be tax deductible. One of the conditions is the maximum level of benefits that can be paid under an occupational pension scheme.</P>
      <P>I am, however, informed by the Revenue Commissioners that pensioners can receive the maximum level of benefits allowable under Finance Act, 1972, from an occupational pension scheme, if the scheme provides such a level of benefits, and in addition receive the social welfare old age (contributory) pension, if the necessary social welfare contribution requirements are satisfied. Indeed, the Finance Act, 1972, makes no reference to taking social welfare pensions into account in determining the level of benefit payable under occupational pension schemes.  Consequently, as the practice outlined in the question is not governed by the Finance Act, 1972, the remainder of the question is not relevant.</P>

This is the first time <Col N="1363" /> that psychiatric cover will be required on a statutory basis in this country and the 40 days will ensure that some level of such cover is available to members of insurance schemes.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht (Mr. M. Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>Under sub-programme I of the European Union Structural Funds Operational Programme for Tourism 1994-99 it is envisaged that there will be expenditure of over £67 million in 1994 prices on national and regional cultural activities. This includes expenditure on developments at the major national cultural institutions as well as on regional initiatives including the establishment of a cultural development incentives scheme in co-operation with local authority and private contributions.  The Deputy will be aware that in addition to national and regional cultural activities sub-programme I also includes some £58 million for heritage tourism projects within my area of responsibility.</P>
      <P>Of the £67 million for cultural tourism approximately £2.5 million was spent in 1994 and £11.3 million is scheduled to be spent in 1995.  The detailed scheduling of expenditure for 1996 and 1997 is not yet finalised.</P>
      <P>There will be additional expenditure of £4.4 million on heritage and cultural tourism under the EU Structural Funds Community Initiative INTERREG II Programme and expenditure of £2 million under the Maritime INTERREG Programme.  The phasing of this expenditure is not yet finalised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The foregoing relates to EU Structural Funds expenditure which is fully <Col N="1367" /> within my area of responsibility.  Cultural Tourism projects would also be eligible for funding from other sub-programmes under the Operational Programme for Tourism administered by Bord Fáilte and SFADCO.  Similarly projects might also qualify under other Structural Funds Operational Programmes such as the Operational Programme for Local, Urban and Rural Development.</P>
    <P>The figures I have mentioned above refer to capital expenditure available to me specifically for cultural tourism in the period up to 1999.  The Deputy will be aware, however, that there are significant voted funds allocated for capital and current investment in arts, culture and film which all contribute to the growing tourism industry.</P>
    <P>While the detailed allocation of all the funds available under the operational programme has not been finalised, funds have been committed at national level to the development of the National Museum at Collins Barracks and investment in a new home in Dublin Castle for the Chester Beatty Library.  At regional level funds have been allocated to Galway and Longford theatres.  Crawford Municipal Gallery, Cork and the Hunt Museum, Limerick.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that I have invited proposals for consideration for funding under the Cultural Development Incentives Scheme.  &ldquo;The Arts Plan 1995-97&rdquo; prepared by An Chomhairle Ealaíon obtained the broad support of all sides of the House when it was debated here on 6 April and 11 May.  In reviewing the current arts infrastructure in the State, the plan identifies priority zones and centres of excellence as the focus of particular attention.  The priority zones are the counties of Laois, Wicklow.  Donegal, Longford, Westmeath, Offaly, Leitrim, Tipperary and Roscommon and the centres of excellence are the cities of Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford.</P>
    <P>In order to be consistent with the objectives of &ldquo;The Arts Plan 1995-97&rdquo;. I have decided to examine applications <Col N="1368" /> under the cultural development incentives scheme from the priority zones and centres of excellence initially.  To date, no decisions have been made with regard to the individual projects to receive allocations under this scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht (Mr. M. Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Famine Commemoration Committee, chaired by the Minister of State Deputy Avril Doyle, is responsible for co-ordinating the Government's programme of events to mark the 150th anniversary of the outbreak of the great famine.  The programme was announced by the Minister of State on 27 June last.  The committee is considering a proposal from my Department for a commemorative &ldquo;Famine Garden&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>A number of the national cultural institutions for which I have responsibility will also stage commemorative events to mark this tragic era in our country's history.</P>
      <P>1.  <i>National Library</i></P>
      <P>The National Library will hold a documentary exhibition of printed, pictorial and manuscript material which will graphically represent the causes, progress and history of the Great Famine, the remedial measures taken by public and private organisations to alleviate it as well as its social, demographic and political consequences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition a travelling exhibition of facsimile material will be staged comprising photographs and other reproductions which I hope will serve to inform a wider audience outside Dublin <Col N="1369" /> as to the causes and effects of the Great Famine.</P>
    <P>Both of these exhibitions will be financed from normal funding provided by my Department to the National Library.  The National Library also propose to produce a book of key documents entitled <i>The Famine &mdash; A Documentary History</i> which will be designed for use by the general public and also for use in schools.</P>
    <P>2.  <i>National Archives</i></P>
    <P>The National Archives is in the process of upgrading its finding aids in respect of the areas relating to the Great Famine &mdash; the archives of the Relief Government which co-ordinated famine relief in Ireland and the papers of the Society of Friends concerning the relief of distress.  It is intended that this work will be completed in 1996.</P>
    <P>The National Archives is also considering the possibility of redesigning and reprinting a facsimile pack of documents relating to the Famine which was first published in 1982.</P>
    <P>The cost of these works will be met from normal funds provided by my Department to the National Archives. The National Archives will also of course, provide assistance to the many historians and researchers engaged in the study of this period.</P>
    <P>3.  <i>National Museum</i></P>
    <P>The National Museum will hold a major exhibition to commemorate the 150th anniversary of the Famine in 1997.  The exhibition will be housed in the West Wing of Clark Square, Collins Barracks.</P>
    <P>4.  <i>Botanic Gardens</i></P>
    <P>Concern will hold a ceremony in the National Botanic Gardens on 20 August to commemorate the discovery of blight in the Botanic Gardens in 1845.</P>
    <P>5.  <i>Other Projects</i></P>
    <P>The Deputy will be already aware that in this year's budget an allocation of £100,000 was made to the Women's Archive and Resource Centre Ltd. to be paid through my Department's Vote. An exhibition outlining the effects of <Col N="1370" /> the Famine on women in Ireland will be opened on August 23 by the centre and is being part funded from this grant.</P>
    <P>In addition, an allocation of £50,000 was made in this year's budget to the Jeanie Johnston Project, Tralee and is being paid through my Department's Vote.  This project involves the authentic reconstruction of the famous Famine emigrant ship <i>Barque de Jeanie Johnston</i> by a transnational team.</P>
    <P>I also understand that An Chomhairle Ealaíon has directly supported a number of initiatives in connection with the Famine Commemoration.</P>

      <P>The Wreck of the <i>Trinidad Valencera</i>, which sank in Kinnagoe Bay, Co. Donegal in 1588, was discovered by members of the City of Derry Sub-Aqua Club in the early seventies.  The wreck was within this jurisdiction and the material recovered over a few years was delivered to the Receiver of Wreck in Letterkenny.  As the National Museum did not, at the time, have the facilities to conserve this material, its conservation was undertaken by the Ulster Museum.  The long-term loan to the Ulster Museum was formalised in 1979.</P>
      <P>The Ulster Museum then made a proposal to the Irish authorities to buy the material.  It was decided that the Ulster Museum should pay a nominal sum of £10 on condition that it would, at the same time, also reimburse the expenses of Derry Sub-Aqua Club and on condition that the material would eventually be put on display in Derry in a suitable building.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1371" /> The material was formally handed over at a ceremony on 1 October 1982 at which the then Taoiseach, Mr. Charles J. Haughey, TD, presided.</P>
    <P>Earlier this year Derry City Council opened the Tower Museum which contains some of the wreck's items lent by the Ulster Museum on a long term basis. More items are to be lent as the Tower Museum's resources provide.</P>
    <P>Since the items were formally sold to the Ulster Museum it has acquired legal title to them, and the issue of their possible return on a permanent basis does not, therefore, arise.</P>
    <P>Any other items subsequently recovered from the above wreck would be approached within the general context of long term display and loan policies of the National Museum.  Such policies in the present context would have regard to the most appropriate place for such items to be located.</P>

      <P>Annex 2A of the Operational Programme for Transport is an indicative list of projects scheduled for construction in the period 1994-99. Inclusion of a project in the list does not necessarily imply that it will be submitted or approved for EU assistance.  Projects other than those listed may also be submitted and/or approved for EU assistance.  The selection of national road projects to be undertaken is a matter for the National Roads Authority and all projects for which EU assistance is sought have to be approved in accordance with the requirements of the Regional Fund or Cohesion Fund, as appropriate.</P>
      <P>In April, 1993 following the submission by Sligo Corporation of an Environmental Impact Statement on the proposed Sligo Inner Relief Road, the Corporation were requested in co-operation with Sligo County Council, to arrange to have a new traffic study of the Borough and its environs carried out.  The Corporation decided to undertake a more extensive report, including the preparation of a new Environmental Impact Statement.  Volumes 1 and 2 of this report, covering an initial assessment of all options, were presented to the Borough Council on 10 April 1995. I understand that volumes 3-5 in relation to the Environmental Impact Statement, the preliminary design of the preferred route and the traffic study, will be presented to the Borough Council later this month.  It will then be for the Corporation to decide whether to submit the full report and a Compulsory Purchase Order for the acquisition of necessary lands, to me for decision. Depending on the outcome of these procedures, it would be a matter for the National Roads Authority to decide on the allocation of grants for the project, having regard to available funding and the priorities within its overall improvement programme for national roads.</P>

      <P>The information sought is as follows: 1984, 19.2 per cent; 1994, 13.8 per cent (estimate).</P>
      <P>Because of the introduction of 100 per cent capital grants in 1988 and the elimination of loan repayments and subsidies on capital loans written off by the Exchequer, there was a significant technical once-off reduction in the figures for total local authority expenditure between 1987 and 1988.  In addition, local authorities were relieved of a number of statutory demands and levies in the period 1986 to 1995.  As a result, figures for local authority expenditure as a percentage of total Government expenditure in 1984 are not comparable with those for 1994.</P>

These posts were allocated on the basis of priority of need following <Col N="1380" /> recommendations from my Department's primary inspectorate and having regard to the data supplied by the schools.  One post was allocated to primary schools in County Waterford.  This post is to be shared between three schools and the appointment comes into effect from September 1995.

      <P>I should mention that the possibility of amalgamation arose in 1992-93, but this was rejected unanimously by the parents.  In the circumstances that this was a closure and not an amalgamation, the criteria relating to amalgamated schools could not be applied.</P>

      <P>The Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions in any case referred to it by the Garda decides only whether or not there should be a prosecution.  It may, however, when communicating to the Garda a decision that there should not be a prosecution in a particular case, make a recommendation that the suspect in that case be cautioned by the <Col N="1386" /> Garda as to his future behaviour.  If the Garda accept that recommendation, the wording of that caution and the manner in which it is to be carried out are matters for them.  This informal system of cautioning applies where the suspect is over the age of eighteen years.</P>
      <P>Where, however, the suspect is under the age of eighteen years, the Garda or the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions may, in certain circumstances, decide not to prosecute a suspect and, as an alternative to prosecution, to deal with the suspect under the provisions of the juvenile diversion programme.</P>
      <P>However, as stated in my reply to the Deputy's question of 8 June, 1995 (No. 26), whereas in the majority of cases the decision as to whether or not to include a juvenile suspect in the programme is a matter for the gardaí, a juvenile suspect for certain specified crimes, including sexual offences, can be included in the programme only on the direction of the Director of Public Prosecutions.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 102 and 107 together.</P>
      <P>I have received ongoing reports from the Garda authorities in relation to the investigation into the tragic death of Stephen McMillan and the &ldquo;Dance Nation&rdquo; event which he had attended at the Point Depot on Saturday, 24 June, 1995.  The investigation will involve the tracing and interviewing of many of the young people who attended the event and this is likely to take some time.  The investigation will also consider the degree to which safety and other regulations were adhered to.</P>
      <P>Under the Public Dance Halls Act, 1935, persons who wish to hold public dances must apply to the local District Court for a public dancing licence. These licences are renewable on an annual basis, unless revoked or surrendered earlier.  The conditions and restrictions attaching to the licence normally include conditions as to the age of customers.  Breaches of these conditions and restrictions may result in prosecution and may constitute grounds for revocation of a licence.</P>
      <P>The question as to whether the conditions attached to the licence which was granted in respect of The Point Depot were in any way breached will, of course, form part of the Garda investigation.</P>

      <P>The community employment (CE) scheme is aimed at providing part-time employment to assist unemployed people, particulary the long-term unemployed, and lone parents to reenter the labour market.  The purposes of family income supplement (FIS), on the other hand, is to create an incentive for full-time workers with families &mdash; who are in low paid employment &mdash; to remain at work.  Its purpose, therefore, is intrinsically different to that of CE.</P>
      <P>CE weekly rates of payment are £81.30 for a single person and £116.85 for a person with an adult dependant.  A sum of £13.20 is payable in respect of each child dependant.  CE participants receive payments which are in excess of their entitlements under the unemployment assistance scheme.  They also retain their social welfare secondary benefits.  For example, a CE participant with an adult dependant and two child dependants receives £143.25 per week, as against an entitlement under long term unemployment assistance of £126.40 per week.  CE participants are also free to supplement their payments through earnings from work outside of their working hours on the programme.</P>
